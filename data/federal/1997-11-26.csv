2,Mr REITH,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is intended to ensure that small businesses are exempted from the federal unfair dismissal provisions in respect of new employees. This exemption is necessary and appropriate, given the special features of small business-and it is necessary, to maximise growth in employment in small business. This is the same bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 26 June 1997 and passed by the House of Representatives on 27 August 1997, but rejected by the Senate on 21 October 1997, in the face of the majority report of the Senate committee to which it was referred. The government is reintroducing this bill, not because we want an election over it, but because we want to see this problem fixed. Senators who spoke against this bill said there was insufficient evidence of the need the bill, and its benefits. There was plenty evidence, but they were not convinced. They were not convinced by Morgan and Banks' 1996 survey, which indicated that 16 per cent of businesses with fewer than 30 employees had been adversely affected in their hiring intentions by the previous federal unfair dismissal laws. They were not convinced by the Recruitment Solutions survey, released in April 1997, which indicated that 32 per cent of businesses in metropolitan Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane had been the subject of some sort of unfair dismissal claim in the 12 months covered by the survey. They were not convinced by the Bell committee, which reported on the widespread feeling that the previous government's unfair dismissal laws were 'the final nail in the coffin' for small business. When the Senate rejected the bill, small business made its view even clearer. Mr Rob Bastian of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said that small business would create 50,000 jobs if this bill could go through the Senate. And the Chief Executive of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce, Ms Katie Lahey, said: For the opposition to claim that there has been no independent research proving business concern on this issue is nonsense-it shows how little attention . they have paid to the needs and concerns of the small business community. She drew attention to the New South Wales chamber's own survey, conducted jointly with the St George Bank in May this year, in which 56 per cent of businesses surveyed said that the prospect of unfair dismissal claims had discouraged them from recruiting additional staff to their businesses To make it all completely clear for the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate, the Commonwealth government has commissioned further research, as part of the labour market research program being conducted under the auspices of the Labour Ministers Council. Specific questions on unfair dismissal were included in the latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index survey, conducted from 30 October 1997 to 12 November 1997; This is the largest economic survey of for small businesses in Australia; it focuses of specifically on small businesses with 19 or fewer employees. Approximately 1,200 randomly selected proprietors of small businesses were covered in the survey. In this survey, 79 per cent of proprietors thought small businesses would be better off if they were exempted from unfair dismi-sal laws. Thirty-three per cent of small businesses reported that they would have been more likely to recruit new employees if they had been exempted from unfair dismissal laws in 1996 and 1997. And 38 per cent of small businesses reported that they would be more likely to recruit new employees if they were exempted from the current unfair dismissal laws. Relping small business to grow, employ, export and invest in Australia's future has been a top priority for the government since its first day in. office. The government's ecpnomic and industrial relations policies are central to its agenda for the growth and development of the small business sectorand the government is also committed to taokling the impediments to small business imposed by unnecessary government regula.. tion and paperwork, as set out in the government's small business statement, More time for business. The government has made substantial progress in labour market reform, which is and will be of particular benefit to small business. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 changed both the federal industrial relations system, and the relationship between federal and state industrial relations systems. These changes provide small business with greater opportunities to develop industrial relations arrangements best suited to their individual circumstances. In particular, small business employers have new opportunities to make direct agreements with their employees. Small businesses that choose to remain in the award system are benefiting from a simplified and more flexible system; small businesses now have greater certainty with respect to industrial action within their business; and the Employment Advocate has been given a specific charter to assist small business. Unfair dismissal was one of the most important industrial relations issues for small bUl)iness, prior to the last election. mitment, in Better pay for better work, was to introduce a new unfair dismissal scheme, which would recognise the circumstances facing small business, and we have done this. The new system is more balanced and fair to both employers and employees. It is less legalistic and costly, with an emphasis on conciliation. Employers are protected from frivolous and malicious claims by the requirement for a filing fee and access to costs where a claim is vexatious. In considering unfair dismissal claims, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has to consider a range of factors, including the possible effect of any order on the viability of the employer's busin-ss. These changes are important-but they have not gone far enough-for small business. It is an unavoidable fact that the defence of an unfair dismissal claim, however groundless, is especially burdensome for small businesses. In many larger businesses, expertise and resources can be put into recruitment and termination procedures. Small businesses have no such resources. Even attendance of witnesses at a hearing can bring a small business to a standstill. The government has been listening to the concerns of small businesses, their experiences of the impact of unfair dismissal claims, particularly under the previous government's provisions, and their fears that the simple fact of employing someone makes them vulnerable to unfair dismissal claims. The Yellow Pages survey confirms the difficulties that even the government's new provisions cause for those small businesses who experience an unfair dismissal claim: not just the cost of settlement, where that occurs, but the time and location of hearings, stress, costs to business in lost time, disruption to working relationships and the costs of defending the application. And the Yellow Pages confirms the terrible pall that the fear of those difficulties casts over small business employing intentions, even amongst businesses which may not have themselves experienced a claim. These are the reasons that this bill should be brought into law as soon as possible. I tum now to the terms of the bill itself. Our comThe exemption is to commence on royal assent. However, it will not affect existing employees. As it is intended to encourage new employment, the exclusion will only apply to employees who are first engaged by the relevant employer after the commencement of the amendment. The exemption is from the federal unfair dismissal provisions only. Employees will still be protected by other provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. Section 170CK protects employees against dismissal because of any discriminatory reason. Sections 170MU and 170WE prohibit dismissal of an employee because the employee engages in protected industrial action, in seeking a certified agreement, or in AW A industrial action. Section 298K, in the freedom of association part of the act, prohibits dismissal on grounds contrary to the principle of freedom of association. And section 170CM prohibits dismissal without one to five weeks notice, depending on the employee's length of service and age, or pay in lieu, except in cases of serious misconduct. The exemption also does not affect the rights of apprentices in small businesses. Apprentices have a particular need for protection, given the additional impact that any break in the continuity of their employment may have, in terms of attainment of qualifications. This bill will not affect existing in this regard. The exemption applies only to businesses employing 15 or fewer employees. This size of small business was chosen because of the precedent provided by the Employment Protection Act 1982 (NSW), introduced by the Wran government, and followed by the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the 1984 termination, change and redundancy test case. An exemption for businesses of this size will benefit a substantial proportion of all businesses in the federal jurisdiction, but will not cover too many businesses of such a size and complexity that they are likely to have a separate management structure which would facilitate defence of unfair dismissal claims. The bill provides that, in counting the number of employees in a business, casual employees are only to be counted if they have been engaged on a regular and systematic basis for at least 12 months. The intention of this exclusion is to reflect the fact that a business which occasionally engages additional casual employees is not necessarily a large business. This bill will have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. ANL SALE BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Reith, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr REITH,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The government has indicated its commitment to the sale of ANL Limited on a number of occasions, including in its pre-election policies and in the 1997-98 budget. While timing for the start and conduct of a sale process is yet to be determined, the government has decided to introduce sale legislation to enable the sale process to be conducted as expedirights tiously as possible when it commences. I might also add that the government has been advised that it may be possible to conduct a sale through administrative means without legislation, but at this stage the government wishes to keep its options open to provide for the best commercial outcome. ANL is a 100 per cent Commonwealth owned shipping company, which also has land transportation and container park and servicing interests. It formerly operated ·as the Australian National Line and was converted to a public company, with effect from 1 July 1989. The previous government announced an intention to sell ANL in the 1991-92 budget and, after an on again/off again sale process, negotiated a sale agreement with P&O in 1995. In the face of union opposition to the sale, the then government decided to restructure ANL rather than sell it to P&O. However, it is to be noted that the then government also announced that 'after restructuring ANL will be sold' and that restructuring was to be self-funding as no further equity would be provided by the government. This w- its policy going into the 1996 election. Restructuring of ANL is now largely complete. The company has been significantly transformed in the last two years, with exit from the loss making Europe and trans-Tasman trades, exit from or closure of several other businesses, rationalisation of corporate headquarters and a number of other significant cost cutting measures. ANL's result has improved from a loss of $19.4 million in 1994-95 to a loss of $1.6 million in 1996-97. This is testimony to the efforts of ANL. However, to ensure future progress, ANL needs a change of ownership. The government believes that the company now represents an attractive acquisition, particularly for a buyer who could benefit from synergies and economies of scale and provide equity to further develop ANL. Sale of ANL will be the best outcome for the company and the best outcome for the taxpayer. From the Commonwealth's perspective, the fundamentals of ANL's situation remain unchanged, notwithstanding the recent improved performance. Continued ownership would require taxpayer funded injections of equity, but without equity ANL does not have a viable future. The company is also exposed to a major downturn in its Asian markets, especially as a small operator competing against large companies with global coverage. The Commonwealth and the taxpayer are also exposed to ANL's debt through the Commonwealth guarantee. The bill makes transitional and savings provisions in relation to ANL employee long service leave, maternity leave, compensation and rehabilitation and certain retirement benefits that are standard in legislation the disposal of major Commonwealth assets. The bill also removes ANL's accumulated tax losses for the years prior to the year of sale. As of 30 June 1997, ANL had tax losses of about $80 million. This is similar to the approach taken with tax issues in a number of other sales. In conclusion, I would note that the government may need to introduce amendments to the bill when the sale process is under way, depending in part on commercial issues which may emerge as the sale progresses. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Kemp, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
4,Dr KEMP,IDGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Goldstein-Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.46 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This government is one committed to expanding the number of places in higher education, to improving the resources of higher education and to creating a higher education system that is flexible enough to meet the needs of Australian students, employers and the community and to continue to attract large numbers of students from overseas. The bill legislates funding levels for the years 1999 and 2000. It provides new funding of $3,783,052,000 in 1999, in addition to the existing $8,247,000 already legislated, and $3,581,640,000 in 2000. In legislating funds for 1999 and 2000, the bill confirms to higher education institutions the overall funding levels that are expected to be published later this year in the higher education funding report for the 1998-2000 triennium. This will assist the institutions in their planning for the relating to next few years. I want to take this opportunity to set the funding decisions embodied in this bill in the context of the government's policy to promote access to higher education in Australia and to build quality. The government is pursuing a quite deliberate strategy to expand both places and resources for the universities at the same time as it changes the mix of public and private funding. Under this government there has been strong growth in the number of undergraduate student places. In 1997 there were over 17,000 more undergraduate places than there had been in 1996, an increase that will, according to the universities' own estimates, still be in place in 1999. These figures are even better news for educational opportunity than they first appear, since the 17to 24-year-old population, from which 70 per cent of undergraduate students are drawn, will decline by three per cent in the period 1996 to 1999. The result is that a greater proportion of young Australians will have the opportunity to continue· with their studies. If postgraduate students are included, the increase in numbers is even greater. On the universities' estimates, there will be in the year 2000 in excess of 453,000 domestic students in the higher education system, an increase of over 27,000 on 1996. In every year currently legislated, and in years legislated by these amendments, there is an increase over 1996 in the number of Commonwealth funded undergraduate places. In the year 2000 there will be over 14,000 more Commonwealth funded undergraduate places than there were in 1996. In implementing the efficiency cuts to forward estimates the government has been careful to maintain fairness. The universities have wherever possible accommodated the changed financing at the postgraduate course work level. This maximises the number of students who will receive a first degree and all the opportunities that can flow from that. The universities will from 1998 be paid the equivalent of the minimum up-front differential HECS payment for each HECS liable undergraduate they enrol over their target level. For institutions with low costs this opportunity to offer additional places without charging fees. Further opportunities to participate in higher education have been created by the government's decision to allow universities, from 1 January next year, to offer undergraduate fee paying positions once they have met their target enrolment levels. These are all extra places that would not otherwise have existed. As students take up the fee paying positions, this has a flow-on effect, creating new opportunities for students who would otherwise have missed out on a HECS funded place. It is a win-win policy. Students who would have missed out on their first preference course will now get to do it, and students who would have missed out on a higher education place entirely will now get to enrol. Over time, this policy could greatly increase the number of places in Australian universities. Up to 25 per cent of course numbers can be fee paying once the institution has met its target enrolments, so the potential numbers of new undergraduate students on a Commonwealth funded base of over 360,000 is very large indeed. Another important point to recognise is that this policy ends the previous government's discrimination against Australian undergraduate students and ensures that Australian students have equal rights of entry to Australian the universities with overseas students. Under the Labor Party, if you were from overseas you could invest in your future via education, but not if you were Australian. Under the Labor Party, if you were a postgraduate you could invest in your future via education, but not if you were an undergraduate. This was a very unfair policy, yet it is a policy the Labor Party intends to bring back. Their draft platform released last week promises the abolition of this new opportunity for students to invest in their futures. This is a very backward step. . As higher education numbers expand we must make sure that opportunities to participate are widespread. The government wishes to increase opportunities for groups that have been underrepresented in higher education. People with disabilities, people from disadis an vantaged socio-economic backgrounds, women in non-traditional areas of study, people from rural. and isolated areas, people from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are all beneficiaries of the merit scholarships introduced in 1997. These scholarships provide exemption from the HECS charge to an additional 1,000 effective full-time student units each year. By the year 2000 the scholarships will provide exemptions of 4,000 equivalent full-time student units, which means that well over 4,000 students will benefit each year. These groups of people also benefit from the higher education equity program, which assists the universities in developing appropriate programs to improve educational outcomes. Additional measures costing $72 million over three years were announced last year by Senator Vanstone for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander higher education. The distribution of growth places is designed to ensure that potential students do miss out because of where they live. Between 1996 and 1999 Queensland's Commonwealth funded undergraduate places will increase by approximately 14 per cent and Western Australia's by around five per cent. The higher education system cannot just be assessed by the number of students within it at any given time. A high quality education is essential if the potential present in Australia's students is to be realised, and if our universities are to remain competitive in the world market. The universities, and many dedicated individuals within them, have already taken steps to maintain and improve teaching standards. The introduction of first overseas and now Australian fee-paying students means that the universities have strong financial incentives to deliver a high quality product. Since it is in most cases impractical for the universities to differentiate between feepaying and non fee-paying students, the policy of liberalising access to the education system produces spin-off benefits for non-fee paying students. The government has taken other measures to help improve the quality of teaching. The Committee for University Teaching and Development was established in July 1996 with 11 budget of $20 million over three years. It makes recommendations for grants to encourage practical improvements in teaching and provide for staff development projects. The status of teaching within ties is being enhanced by the Australian Awards for University Teaching, announced in the Great Hall last Monday night. These awards recognise and reward excellence in teaching, in the way that the grants administered by the Australian Research Council recognise and reward the many outstanding researchers in our universities. Funding for higher education research through the targeted higher education research program has been increased over the 1997-99 triennium, with additional funding totalling $129.3 million including the $90 million for research infrastructure. The quality of research training is being enhanced through an addinot tional $9.3 million in support for Australian Postgraduate Awards. Funding for collaborative research grants, now re-aligned in the strategic partnerships with industry-research and training scheme, has been increased by $30 million. This collaborative funding forges stronger links between industry and universities, providing mutually beneficial opportunities for researchers in both sectors and helping universities diversify their funding sources. It is important to look at the overall impact of higher education funding decisions taken by the government. The government's financial commitment to higher education remains, of course, very substantial indeed. Despite the efficiency cuts to the forward estimates total Commonwealth expenditure on higher education will remain higher under this government than it was under the former government. In considering higher education funding it is important to look not just at Commonwealth funding but at the total revenues available to the higher education sector. These are the figures that represent the true resources available to higher education. They show that substantially greater funds are becoming available to the universities. About a third of all university revenue now comes from non-government sources. These revenue sources have the potential for growth. Total funding from all sources to the universities is estimated to have increased by around $460 million between 1995 and 1997. By 1999 it is estimated that the universities will have revenues around $650 million greater the universi- than in 1995. While the Commonwealth government will remain the largest single source of funds for higher education, significant growth in higher education funding will be coming from the entrepreneurial activities of the universities themselves. To spread the burdens of fiscal restraint fairly, the Commonwealth has phased in the reductions in the growth in the amount of money for higher education. On top of that, we have provided the opportunity for the sector to expand and become less dependent on Commonwealth money by creating the opportunities for the universities to raise revenue in other ways. Australian universities have been very successful in capturing as'izeable portion of the overseas student market. Despite the currency difficulties in some parts of Asia the prospects for the Australian educatiqn export industry are positive and our universities should still be able to derive a substantial income from overseas students. Growth in higher education overseas student numbers in 1997 is approximately 16 per cent. Our ability to sustain growth student market is because so far studying in Australia is still comparatively cheap. The United States and the United Kingdom are still more expensive study destinations than Australia. Demand for study abroad is likely to be somewhat dampened by the current economic downturns in Asian economies. Nevertheless, currency devaluations may in some countries have worked in our favour by widening the cost gap between us and our major competitor countries, strengthening Australia's position in the education export market. The most recent evaluation of the situation is that, due to relative movements in exchange rates over recent months, Australia's competitive position against the US, the UK and Canada has improved in all our major markets-Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, China and India. Overseas educational qualifications will continue to be strongly valued in Asian economies and the longer term demand for skilled labour will persist. Australia has a good reputation for providing a quality education and therefore I expect that Australia will also continue to capture a significant share of the overseas higher education market This government will assist where it can. In order to more fully understand the situation facing the Australian international education and training industry I have commissioned Professor Raoul Mortley to undertake an investigation and report to me by 15 December 1997. It is important that the higher education sector, and all other sectors of education and training, meet the needs of the community and employers as well as those of the students. This leads me to the important theme of lifelong learning. Gaining skills is now much more complex. In the higher educatipn sector this means that education and training does not necessarily happen at one institution in a continuous block of time. This allied to the increase in student numbers and the diversity of student backgrounds has placed greater demands on in the overseas universities. As the notions of lifelong learning-and the need constantly to update skills-take greater hold the education and training sector must develop appropriate delivery systems at a reasonable cost. The ramifications of lifelong learning will go across boundaries. Schools, universities and vocational education institutions traditionally have different missions. It is - already apparent, however, that the boundaries between the sectors are becoming blurred. We have higher education institutions which offer sub-degree programs and some TAPEs now offer degrees. Considerable attention is now paid to articulation arrangements. I expect this trend to intensify. An increase in flexible arrangements in the post-compulsory education and training sector will help to achieve one of this government's priorities-to ensure that every young person wanting to pursue education or training after the compulsory years of schooling can do so. The fact is that about one quarter of 16-, 17and 18-year-olds are not in any form of post-compulsory education or training. This federal government will do its utmost to expand opportunities for and lift the skill levels of these young people. At the same time we want to ensure that adults of all ages have good access to post-compulsory education and training at different stages throughout their lives. This government intends to progress this agenda with the cooperation of all education and training sectors. I will now tum to other specific measures in this bill. The bill is designed to improve and streamline the operation of the higher education program, and will also provide increased funds to the sector over existing legislative amounts. In addition to legislating for the major funding amounts I have already mentioned, the biII amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to provide supplementation for price movements, covering items such as superannuation expenses, teaching hospitals, special capital projects, grants to open learning organisations and the total limit for certain grants. The total increase on existing amounts in 1998 will be $165,000. The biII also builds on the streamlined arrangements for applications for remission of debt under the higher education contribution scheme, HECS, and the open learning deferred payment scheme, OLDPS, introduced by the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act (No.1) 1997. It introduces provisions to streamline the administration of the remission arrangements by deeming applicants to have received notification of a decision on their application within a reasonable period. The amendment also places the emphasis on the applicant to advise the Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs of a change of address. The amendment will streamline the remission process for students and simplify the administration of the process. The bill also amends the Maritime College Act 1978 to ensure that the Australian Maritime College's ability to charge fees is linked to the conditions of grants specified in the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. Unlike the statutes of other institutions, the College Act 1978 currently does not contain any provision to link the charging of fees to the conditions of grants under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The amendment will ensure that the government may take action against the institution for any breach the arrangements for charging fees to students. This is consistent with conditions already applying to other institutions. This bill reflects the government's commitment to a higher education system that is efficient, relevant and of a high quality, striving for excellence and innovation in teaching and research. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. CRIMES (SUPERANNUATION BENEFITS) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",16
5,Mr WILLIAMS,IDGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 and the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. Those two acts make provision for the making of superannuation orders against corrupt Commonwealth employees, which have the effect of cancelling those employees' Commonwealth-funded superannuation benefits. The bill improves the operation of superannuation orders and makes provision for a more efficient recovery of benefits that have been paid by Commonwealth schemes. The bill allows superannuation benefits that have been rolled-over or transferred from Commonwealth schemes to be traced and recovered from roll-over institutions. That closes a gap in both acts which has allowed some roll-overs to escape the operation of superannuation orders. The bill also provides a mechanism by Maritime which Commonwealth employees charged with or convicted of corruption offences may have their employer-funded superannuation benefits temporarily suspended. Those amendments bring the Crimes Superannuation Benefits Act in line with the Australian of Federal Police Act which already makes provision for the suspension of benefits of AFP members and staff members. Where a person has been charged with or convicted of a corruption offence, the minister may make a written direction to the accused's superannuation fund, the effect of which is to temporarily suspend the accused's employerfunded superannuation benefits. The suspension prevents the dissipation of superannuation benefits which may later become the subject of a superannuation or recovery order. Suspension or 'freezing' of employer benefits preserves the benefits in the Commonwealth scheme until the finalisation of superannuation order proceedings. A person's own contributions are not affected by the suspension and may be withdrawn or cashed in accordance with the cashing restrictions of the superannuation law. The suspension expires after 12 months, or sooner, for example, if the person is acquitted of the offence or if the charges are withdrawn--or otherwise not proceeded with. The bill also authorises the Official Trustee to take charge of and sell restrained property in satisfaction of a superannuation recovery order. Those provisions are modelled on similar provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. The Crimes Superannuation Benefits Act has always made provision for restraining orders but, until now, there has been no mechanism to dispose of restrained property to discharge superannuation order debts. The bill simplifies the way in which information is provided to a court that certifies the extent of a person's superannuation benefits in superannuation order proceedings. It seeks to relax the rules concerning the admissibility of certain documents. Finally, the bill facilitates the provision information by superannuation entities concerning Commonwealth employees to the Commonwealth. The extension of superannuation recovery orders to roll-overs, the suspension of employer-funded benefits of persons charged with or convicted of corruption offences, and the new role of the Official Trustee, fortify the operation of the two acts and ensure that corrupt Commonwealth employees do not either receive or retain the benefit of Commonwealth-funded superannuation. That is consistent with the underlying policy of superannuation orders that a Commonwealth employee who discharges his or her duties in a corrupt way has failed to fulfil a fundamental condition of employment and, by doing so, forfeits his or her entitlement to publicly funded superannuation. Under the two acts, a person is entitled to a refund of his or her own contributions and interest and these amendments do not disturb that position. The amendments are expected to have a minor and unquantifiable financial impact on government revenue. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",20
6,Mr WILLIAMS,IDGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill amends the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 consequent upon the proposed enactment of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1997. Among other matters, the amendment bill contains administrative provisions relating to the collection of charges of for classification and other services imposed by the classification charges bill. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 is part of a Commonwealth, state and territory cooperative legislative scheme for the classification of publications, films and computer games and enforcement of classification decisions made under it. That act establishes the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board and provides the procedures for the classification of material. Complementary state and territory enforcement legislation contains offences relating to the exhibition, sale or hire of publications, films and computer games, both classified and unclassified, in the respective jurisdictions. At present, fees for applications for classifithe cation and other services under the act are prescribed in regulations made under that act. From 1 November 1997 the fees so prescribed are set at 100 per cent cost recovery for the provision of those services. In the May 1997 budget context, the government decided that from 1 July 1998 full cost recovery would be introduced for the Office of Film and Literature Classification by changes to the charging structure for those using its services. The office services the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board. This decision means that revenue from classification and other services provided by the OFLC must also cover activities ancillary to the provision of classification services. These include certain research, policy development, ministerial support and payments to the states and territories for enforcement and related purposes. These activities are related to an efficient and effective cooperative classification and enforcement scheme. They assist in ensuring that the classification decisions are acceptable to applicants and the public generally and in maintaining the integrity of the Australia-wide scheme. However, they cannot, for constitutional reasons, be included in the fee for the provision of classification services. Implementation of the government's decision therefore requires that charges for classification and related services be imposed as a tax. This decision ensures that those who benefit directly, and indirectly, from the work of the OFLC pay the full cost of its operations. The amendment bill proposes the removal of references to prescribed fees in the principal act and their replacement with references to charges prescribed under the classification charges bill. An exception applies to applications by the Commonwealth, states and territories for use in the investigation and prosecution of an offence. The efficacy of the cooperative censorship scheme depends on effective enforcement. Under the intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories the fees applications for classification for enforcement purposes will not exceed the cost of providing services and these fees will continue to be prescribed by regulations under the act. The amendment bill also removes some of the formal requirements in making applications for classification of material for the investigation and prosecution of an offence. This is to overcome the failure of two prosecutions earlier this year due to a lack of compliance with all the formal requirements of an application for classification of the material concerned. The charges, which are to apply from 1 July 1998, are set out in the schedules to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill. They have been set at an amount calculated to meet the estimated revenue needed to fully fund the OFLC's operations for the financial year 1998-99. The structure of the charges set out in the schedules reflect the approach, which was agreed to with the industry, in the current fees regulations which came into effect on 1 November 1997. The classification charges bill makes provision for amending the schedules by regulations made under that bill. There is no real alternative to such a provision as the revenue needed to meet full cost recovery for the OFLC will vary over time and the charges set out in the schedule will need to be revised accordingly. Parliament will, however, retain ultimate control over the level of charges to be imposed. The government is aware that the fees for classification and other services which came into effect on 1 November this year are of concern to some of the users of OFLC services. In particular, concern has been expressed about the effect of the fee increases on the classification of material that has a limited market appeal in Australia. In these cases the unit cost attributable to classification charges is higher than in media which has wider appeal and thus attracts a lower unit cost due to its much larger distribution vohime. It has, for example, been suggested that a popular first release cinema film, where a significant number of prints are distributed, should attract a higher charge than a film that has more limited appeal. Where, as at present, fees are set on the basis of the cost of providing the service there is limited opportunity to provide for ential level in setting fees for the same category of material. This is because the cost associated with the classification of the materThe ial is not dependent on its end use or its ularity or otherwise. The fee must be directly related to the cost of providing the service. However, when charges for classification services are imposed as a tax, there is a much greater capacity to differentiate between material for the purposes of the imposition of the charges. I therefore propose to appoint an independent person to review the charges structure with a view to seeing whether greater equity can be provided to applicants who submit material for classification that has a more limited market appeal. I have requested that report be provided to me no later than 30 April 1998 and the structure of the charges proposed in this measure will be reviewed in light of that report. Implementation of full cost recovery for the OFLC means that the industry should expect that the OFLC will be efficient and effective in delivering high quality and impartial services on behalf of the Australian community which represent value for money to its clients. To ensure industry input into the operations of the OFLC, it is proposed to establish formal. consultative mechanisms. This will give - he mdustry opportunities for providing input mto charges scales and appropriate performance standards for the office. To this end, my department has commenced consultations with interested parties on the best method of achieving this result. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill which is also the explanatory memorandum to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1997.

8,Mr TRUSS,GAS PIPELINES ACCESS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill represents a key component in the delivery of increased competition in the natural gas sector, competition which will provide significant benefits to all Australians in the form of lower prices and increased economic activity. The bill fulfils the Commonwealth's obligations in respect of the natural gas pipelines access agreement signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and all other heads of government at the COAG meeting of 7 November 1997. The agreement by all governments to the natural gas industry reform package is a significant achievement in competition reform. The agreed arrangements will enhance competition in the natural gas sector and establish the basis for the best possible use of Australia's gas resources and the lowest possible prices for all. gas consumers. The economic benefits from increased competition in the gas sector are considerable. Competition will increase efficiency in production, haulage and delivery, leading to lower energy costs for industry and other users with consequential increased economic activity. There are also substantial greenhouse benefits from the increased use of natural gas over other fossil fuels for electricity generation and energy. In the new competitive gas market, gas consumers will be able to contract directly with a gas supplier of their choice for the supply of gas and contract separately with the pipeline owner for the transportation of the gas. This will encourage 'gas on gas' competition between producers within a basin and between basins for the supply of gas to consumers as well as increasing competition between gas and other fuels. In the downstream sector of the gas market where competition is constrained by natural monopolies, the reforms, of which this bill is a part, have been designed to replicate the outcomes of a competitive market. It seeks to do this by providing a transparent, industry specific, third party access framework. Natural gas is already a major energy source in Australia providing an economic and environmentally efficient fuel source for industry, electricity generation, transport, commerce and households. For the sector to continue to grow at the forecast three per per annum in order to provide 28 per cent of Australia's primary energy demand by 2030, it is recognised that competition reforms in the gas sector need to be delivered. Heads of government have indicated their continued commitment to the national competition reform process, specifically to the implementation of the proposed regulatory framework for the gas sector. The national third party gas pipeline access regulatory scheme was developed through a process which included the Commonwealth, states and territories and gas industry members-gas producers, pipeliners and major usersrepresented by their associations. The agreed reform arrangements reflect a sound and balanced outcome which is acceptable to all nine jurisdictions and the four peak industry associations. The national gas pipeline access scheme will provide a legally enforceable right for third parties, such as suppliers, retailers and users, to negotiate access to pipelines for haulage services on terms and conditions which are fair and reasonable to both access seekers and pipeline owners. At the same time, the access regime provides incentives for pipeline owners to grow the market and provide innovative and competitive pipeline haulage services, with the discretion for pipeline-specific circumstances to be taken into account. Access to markets through pipeline networks will provide incentives for petroleum exploration and development and for pipeline infrastructure construction and interconnections between markets. This will further enhance competitive outcomes through intraand inter-gas basin competition, which will provide lower energy costs to industry, commercial and domestic users. The outcomes of third party access are expected to be the development of an integrated national gas market and an interconnected pipeline grid, which will allow gas to be freely traded across jurisdictions and a national market. There are two components of the reform arrangements to be noted. One is the national element. The other is the regulacent tory approach adopted by the scheme. National consistency National coverage and consistency in regulatory approaches and outcomes is very important to achieving the benefits from competition reform. Inconsistencies in regulatory arrangements between the states or between ownership of pipelines within an integrated network could frustrate and constrain the opportunity for trades across the grid by raising the regulatory transaction costs of industry 'and causing delays and uncertainty. Establishing and maintaining a consistent and uniform national regulatory framework is central to delivering the reform benefits to gas users and to the economy. This uniformity has been established in a number of ways. Firstly, a common third party access code is to be adopted by all jurisdictions. Secondly, to ensure consistency, an 'application of laws' approach to give legislative effect to the national Gas Pipeline Access Law and the code has been chosen. This will best maintain the uniformity and integrity of the regulatory arrangements across all jurisdictions and eliminate the danger of variations over time as a result of uncoordinated changes being made to jurisdiction based legislation. South Australia will be the 'lead' legislature and will enact a bill with the Gas Pipelines Access Law and the Gas Pipeline Access Code as schedules. Each jurisdiction will enact legislation to apply the South Australian law, other than Western Australia which will enact legislation to apply the Gas Pipeline Access Law and code directly, with essentially identical effect. The Commonwealth legislation will complete the national coverage of the scheme. A seamless, consistent approach will be further enhanced by using national competition bodies to undertake key roles in the scheme. Approach in access regime The code details matters which need to be included by the pipeline owner in an access arrangement and specifies the pricing principles for determining the tariff for specific haulage services. The access arrangement for a pipeline, to be approved by the regulator, subsequently governs third party access terms and conditions to that facility for a specified period. The monopoly component of a pipeline business is to be separated from related but contestable components of the business-for example, the transportation of gas will be separated from retailing of the gas commodity-to reduce the likelihood that related businesses will receive preferential treatinent. The arrangements provide a balance between the right of parties to procedural fairness through an appeals process and the timeliness of regulatory outcomes. In this regard, there is provision for judicial review of decisions and administrative appeals for certain decisions of the regulator. The scheme also contains arrangements for resolving disputes between access seekers and the pipeline owner over the terms and conditions of access. I now tum to examine the main provisions of the bill. Commonwealth role The Commonwealth legislation is critical to establishing the national character of the access scheme. The bill extends the scheme to areas where legislation of the states and territories could not operate without Commonwealth assistance. In this respect, the scheme will be applied to offshore waters, relevant external territories and the Moomba-Sydney pipeline system. To establish a regulatory and legal environment conducive to producing' nationally consistent economic outcomes, Commonwealth competition policy institutions will have key roles in the scheme as regulatory, appeal and enforcement bodies. The states and territories will also apply Commonwealth legislation governing judicial review. Specific amendments are to be introduced by the Commonwealth bill to give effect to the national scheme. Trade Practices Act 1974 The bill includes amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 to enable Commonwealth bodies to perform regulatory functions under the national access arrangements. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be the regulator for all transmission pipelines, other than in Western Australia, and for distribution pipelines if a jurisdiction so chooses. The National Competition Council will advise on whether a pipeline meets the criteria for coverage. The Australian Competition Tribunal will hear administrative appeals on specified matters. Amendments to the Trade Practices Act will remove any uncertainty surrounding the application of the competition principles agreement principles. The changes are to make it plain that there is flexibility in the application of the competition principles agreement principles in determining whether a state or territory access regime is effective. In addition, the bill will extend the applicaTerritory tion of part IlIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to Commonwealth waters and apply certain sections of part IlIA to services to be provided by infrastructure facilities in the future. The bill will also provide the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission with greater flexibility to authorise conduct which might otherwise constitute anti-competitive behaviour. The later amendments are particularly relevant to network industries where industry codes are in effect, such as electricity, or being introduced. Courts and legal interpretation The uniformity in the rights of parties created by the adoption of a national scheme of access to pipelines must flow through to greater predictability in interpretation and, when appropriate to the case, to decisions. Accordingly, it has been agreed that the Commonwealth's Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 will apply to decisions taken under the code and the national access law and for concurrent jurisdiction to be conferred on the Federal Court and the Supreme Court. The latter also entails an amendment to the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 to allow the Australian Capital Territory to confer concurrent jurisdiction on the Federal Court. Extending the operation of the scheme The Moomba-Sydney pipeline· is a major gas pipeline system and will be integral to the development of an integrated eastern state pipeline network. The bill will repeal the Commonwealth's specific access legislation contained in part 6 of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 to enable the national scheme to apply to this pipeline when it is enacted by New South Wales and South Australia. The Commonwealth bill provides for the application of the national scheme to Commonwealth waters and to certain external territories. When the scheme is applied by the states or Northern Territory, the state or territory legislation will be applied by the Commonwealth's legislation to pipelines in their offshore waters and in any relevant external territories. If a state or the Northern does not apply the scheme, the scheme is called up directly by the Commonwealth legislation and applied in that jurisdiction's offshore waters and any relevant to be built external territory. The common carriage provisions in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act will be displaced for gas transmission pipelines covered by the scheme. The gas pipeline access scheme is to apply to gas transmission and distribution pipelines in Australian territory, but it is not intended that the scheme apply to that part of a pipeline which is located in another country, even if the pipeline is partly in Australian territory. Conclusion This bill ushers in a new phase of development in the domestic natural gas industry. This scheme is to be implemented by all jurisdictions and is the culmination of extensive development and discussion with the gas industry and users. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned.",23

11,Mr TRUSS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.6) 1997, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals during the current Spring sittings, with the exception of the textiles, clothing and footwear amendments in schedule 3. I will briefly outline the changes. Schedule 1 of this bill commenced on 3 July 1997. The customs· duty on aviation gasoline, avgas, contains a component to recover the costs of aviation terminal and en route navigation services provided to the general aviation sector by Airservices is. In reviewing the costs of providing these services for 1997-98, Airservices Australia proposed a reduction in the duty of 0.6 cents per litre on avgas, which represents a five per cent decrease in real terms. This reduction in costs to aircraft operators follows the implementation of an election commitment by the government. This commitment was to freeze the airways component of avgas duty in 1996-97, except for movements in the consumer price index, while working towards the implementation of a fairer system of funding for the general aviation sector's contribution to Airservices Australia. The component of duty on avgas payable to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority for the costs of aviation safety regulation remains unchanged. The amendments in schedule 2 commenced on 1 September 1997. They will give effect to the government's decision on passenger motor vehicles and automotive components from 2000 up to 2010. Honourable members will be aware of the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 5 June 1997 of the key elements of the government's response to the Industry Commission's review of the automotive industry. The government delivered an integrated package of reforms and measures designed to promote a sustainable and internationally competitive automotive industry into the next century. A central element of the package was the government's decision on the tariff arrangements to apply to passenger motor vehicles and automotive components from 2001. There are to be no changes to the tariff phasedown as provided for in the current legislation up to the year 2000, when the tariff will be 15 per cent. This will hold constant till 2005. The changes to be introduced through this bill effect a reduction in tariffs on passenger motor vehicles and certain components of five percentage points from 1 January 2005, reducing the general rate of duty to 10 per cent. Tariffs on four wheel drive and light commercial vehicles are to remain at their present rate of five per cent. Tariffs on microlight vehicles are to stay in line with that of Austral- passenger motor vehicles. This delivers clear and certain policy settings that will ensure that the automotive companies can invest and operate with confidence. The industry is now well placed to build on its achievements to dateand to continue to move toward global integration. At the same time the government is maintaining the trend towards lower tariff levels. In 2005, automotive tariffs will be at 10 per cent-a significant achievement since 1985 when assistance measures included import quotas and a tariff of 57.5 per cent. The decision also demonstrates anew the government's commitment to the APEC goal of trade liberalisation by 2010. This benefits all trading countries and will enhance opportunities for all globally competitive firms. It will benefit Australia's automotive industry as well by enhancing the opportunities for further growth through exports under the APEC agenda. The government's decision was endorsed by industry and state governments. It was unanimously supported by the Automotive Manufacturing Council which provided advice to the government throughout the review process on issues critical to the future viability of the industry. Schedule 3 of this bill will take effect from 1 July 1998. The amendments contained in this schedule implement the government's 11274 decision on the Industry Commission's report on the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. The economic conditions under which Australia's TCF industries have operated in the past 15 years have undergone dramatic change. In the 1980s, the effective tariff rate for clothing and footwear was 250 per cent. By 1996, the effective tariff rate had fallen to about 40 per cent. The tariff rate in 2000 will be 25 per cent for clothing and 15 per cent for footwear. The rapid reductions in tariff assistance have caused Australia's TCF industries to implement radical reforms so as to maintain competitiveness. This transformation has not been easy. There have been significant impacts on employment and the overall strength of our TCF industries. Australia's TCF industries must be able to compete in the free trade environment that will exist from 2010. The proposed legislation allows for a step down in TCF tariffs on 1 January 2005 after a pause from 1 July 2000. The step down will put tariff levels within striking distance of achieving the APEC goal of free trade by 2010. The pause will give Australia's TCF industries an opportunity to consolidate and strengthen by investing, restructuring and identifying global business opportunities which are necessary to achieve sustainable, internationally competitive tries in a free trade environment. will fall from 25 per cent to 17.5 per cent for clothing and finished textiles; from 15 per cent to 10 per cent for cotton sheeting, woven fabric, carpets and footwear; and from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent for sleeping bags, table linen and footwear parts. The government is supporting this legislation with a range of TCF industry assistance measures aimed at encouraging investment, research and innovation, and the achievement of international best practices in management, marketing, processes, and product design and quality. These assistance measures are fully consistent with our World Trade Organisation obligations. In 2005, the government will review the tariff arrangements. This review will incorporate a detailed analysis of the progress that other countries are making toward achieving their free trade commitREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, 26 November 1997 ments.

Second Reading",27
12,Mr TRUSS,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (l0.43 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The legislative changes made by the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997 are threefold. The first will implement the government's decision to allow an extension of the patent term to a total of 25 years for patents relating to pharmaceutical substances. The second will provide for the introduction of a new regime for regulation of the patent attorney profession and deregulate professional practice in trade marks and designs. The third will make minor changes to the patent regime of a technical nature, making it easier for applicants to transact business before the office. indus- Extension of term scheme for pharmaceuTariff levels tical patents This government is committed to the development of a viable pharmaceutical industry in Australia. In April this year, we announced three new initiatives to ensure an internationally competitive operating environment for the industry into the 21st century: the introduction of the pharmaceutical industry investment program; the extension of patent terms for pharmaceuticals by up to five years; and the provision of a regime of data exclusivity. These measures were announced in the context of the government's response to the Industry Commission report No. 51, The Pharmaceutical Industry. This bill implements the second of these measures. The development of a new drug is a long process. A new chemical entity, from which a pharmaceutical is derived, is patented early in the process. However, considerable research and testing is still required before the product can enter the market. This long development time, combined with the considerable regulatory process to register and market a new product, means that companies usually have considerably fewer years under patent in which to gain a return on their investment. This becomes significant to the industry, as companies rely heavily on patents to generate the substantial cash flows necessary to finance the development of new drugs. A country's patent system is also an important factor in investment decisions. A strong patent system contributes significantly to a positive investment climate and sends a signal that Australia values an innovative pharmaceutical industry. The objective of this part of the bill is to provide an 'effective patent life' more in line with that available to inventions in other fields of technology. It will also create a patent regime for pharmaceuticals which is in line with our competitors. An extension of up to five years will be available for a standard patent relating to a pharmaceutical substance that is the subject of first inclusion on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. The scheme will apply to all existing 20-year patents as well as those patents granted after the commencement of the scheme. An extension is not, however, automatic. Companies will need to apply within six months of the inclusion of the product on the ARTG or within six months of the date the patent is granted, whichever is the later. Transitional arrangements will be put in place to accommodate existing patents. The new arrangements make provision for 'springboarding' activities. This allows manufacturers of generic drugs to undertake certain activities prior to the expiry of the patent solely for the purposes of meeting pre-marketing regulatory approval requirements. Companies will be permitted to springboard any time after the extension has been granted. Regulation of professions Professional practice in patents, trade marks and designs has long been regulated by governments throughout the world to ensure that professionals in the field have the high level of technical and professional competence necessary to foster high quality rights that support strong innovation and trading regimes. In Australia, patent attorneys hold an exclusive right to draft patent specifications on behalf of others for gain. Patent attorneys and the legal professions have exclusive rights of practice in respect of the prosecution of patent applications and all aspects of the prosecution of trade marks and designs applications where owners choose not to prosecute the application themselves. To ensure Australia's continued competitiveness in innovation and research, the government examined the current regime to ensure that the profession would be better placed to continue support of these vital activities in the future. The government has been concerned to ensure that the profession continues to offer a high quality service while being subject to competitive pressures. It wishes to ensure that there are no undue barriers to competition in professional practice that might adversely affect the public interest. The government recognises that allowing unqualified persons to perform the highly specialised activity of drafting patent specifications would itlVolve unacceptably high risks to both consumers and the public. However, in the less specialised areas, greater competition would afford benefits to the public with little risk. It is these areas of lesser specialisation that the government considers should be opened to greater competition. The existing restrictions require a level of technical qualification that is higher than that required for effective practice. The bill will make a number of changes to the existing regime contained in the Patents Act 1990, the Trade Marks Act 1995 and the Designs Act 1906 to provide greater access through a wider choice of providers of professional services. In trade marks and designs, it will remove restrictions on who can practice. Restrictions on practice in patents will be retained, given the technical and demanding nature of patent regimes and the potential cost to the applicant of a poorly constructed or prosecuted application. Suitably qualified persons will be entitled to registration as a trade marks attorney and will have the same rights of privilege as patent attorneys and lawyers in trade marks and design matters. Trade marks attorneys will be given the same exemptions from obligations over copyrighted material for the purposes of the provision of professional advice as are currently available to patent attorneys and lawyers under the Copyright Act 1968. Qualifications for registration as a trade marks attorney will be less rigorous than those required for registration as a patent attorney as there will be no requirement for a technical qualification. The bill proposes that the existing partnership arrangements for patent attorneys should be relaxed to improve the public's access to the professions by encouraging a broadening of the competitive base within the patent attorney profession. The proposed system will allow mixed partnerships with other professions where at least one member of the partnership is a registered patent attorney. However, patent attorney partners. will still required to prepare patent specifications. The government is taking the lead and providing for these new partnership arrangements to foster linkages in the provision of professional services. The rules of practice amended to make it clear that an employee is not infringing the restrictions on practice in patents by undertaking patent work for the employer. The government intends that the education and examination functions should be moved from the narrow base of the existing Patent Attorneys Professional Standards Board to the universities to make them more accessible to people seeking entry to the profession. Other minor amendments The bill also introduces other minor amendments to the Patents Act 1990, some of which are of a technical nature. Amendments will allow employees of the Patent Office to provide a higher level of advice to applicants while not compromising their official duties and revise procedures for the payment of certain fees. I believe that the amendments proposed in the bill will enable the government to meet its obligations and objectives of balancing a strong intellectual property system with competent professional advice against the benefits of greater competition. There will be no additional cost to government from any of the proposals as the patents, trade marks and designs systems operate on a cost recovery basis. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned. COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997 Consideration in Detail The bilL Consideration resumed from 25 November.",28
13,Mr WILLIAMS,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"I want to respond to some matters mentioned by the member fOr Canberra (Mr MCMullan) last night. I suggested that he had asserted that the 1990 PSA report did not find that prices were unreasonably high in Australia. He queried that and he queried my response to it. I indicate that the be government relies in this respect on the 1990 PSA report. Page 83 of the report states: The inescapable conclusion from the data is that record prices in Australia are substantially higher than those in the six other countriesare Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States of Amel'icawhatever exchange rate is used to convert prices. It can be seen, for example, that CD prices in Australia were 42 per cent higher than in the USA. It is also the case that CD prices in Australia are generally less out of line with other countries than the prices of cassettes and vinyl. The opposition also claimed that there will be no falls in prices of CDs, yet maintains its claim that cheaper imports will devastate the local recording industry. On the one hand, the member for Canberra claims that, as a result of introducing parallel importation, prices for CDs will not fall and that there is no evidence that parallel importation will result in cheaper CDs for Australian consumers. On the other hand, he insists on making hysterical claims that this measure will· result in severe damage to the local recording industry, including Australian artists, independent labels and small retailers. If the claim that prices will not fall were true, then why would a retailer source product from overseas and lose the advantages of readier and cheaper access to local product? Australian retailers and distributors will only embark on the greater complications of buying offshore and the greater delay in delivery of overseas product if that overseas product is cheaper. If, as the opposition maintains, there is no price advantage, then they will continue to source supplies locally, and there will no damage to the industry by imports. However, the government maintains that there will be a fall in prices and a ponding benefit to consumers. The Copyright Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 gives local suppliers an incentive to match overseas prices and thus maintain their competitiveness as suppliers to the local market. The member for Canberra also sought information relating to the report of the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, which has been referred to. The member sought a copy of that report from the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, who responded that the report in question was a cabinet-in-confidence attachment to a cabinet submission and that he was, therefore, unable to release the report in full. However, he did provide information to the member for Canberra on the figures quoted from the BTCE report. The minister indicated that the report estimated that allowing parallel importation may result in falls in the price of a full price CD of between $1.60 and $3. He said that these figures are estimates which were provided at the request of the BTCE by the Australian Music Retailers Association, AMRA, and a major retailer. The minister also indicated that the BTCE report cited a survey by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which suggested that the difference between the average retail price of a top selling, full price CD in a specialist music store in Australia and the US---exclusive of sales taxes, which are different in the two countries, and converted at the prevailing exchange rate-is $A 7.61. The member for Canberra suggested that if the exchange rate used were 78c rather than 68c the price differential disappeared. I am unable to comment on the actual exchange rates utilised, but that proposition, on my arithmetic, could not be sustained. The report also quoted a similar comparison provided by the Australian Record Industry Association, ARIA, which, using the standard Australian full price of $29.95, with estimated sales tax at $4.59, and the ARIA estimate of the standard US full price of $A21.91, generated a smaller price differential of $A3.45. (Extension of time granter) Even on that, there is corressome scope for movement in exchange rates before the price differential disappears. Exchange rates are always going to fluctuate. The principle of relying on one exchange rate at one particular time is obviously not something that ought to be relied upon, but in this particular case the differential on the data available to the BTCE provides for such a significant difference that the usual fluctuations in exchange rates will have no effect.",30
14,Mr MCMULLAN,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"In accordance with the undertaking I gave last night, I will not extend this debate for very long. I will respond very briefly to those comments, and I will then raise one other matter, to which I hope the AttomeyGeneral (Mr Williams) might respond. The Copyright Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 can then proceed to its subsequent consideration elsewhere. I want to go away and think about the material about the assumptions and its impact on the price. The arithmetic did not seem to me to add up, but there is not much point in our having a wonderful discussion about that here because, if we convince each other, the rest of Australia might still be a little bit dubious. Let me go away and look at that. However, I can say that I was pleased to hear-and it was my understanding from previous comments-that one of the bases of the price estimate was AMRA. My advice came indirectly from AMRA, so I want to check it, and at this stage I will not be unequivocal. As I understand it and as I am advised by the Australian Music Retailers Association, with the then current exchange rate at the time that I got this advice-which was 69c to 70c, and it is actually a bit lower than that now-imports would be selling at $34. That is AMRA's advice to me, but I want to make it absolutely clear to the House that I did not get that directly from AMRA. Others have conveyed it to me as its view and, until I have double-checked it, I do not want to say unequivocally that that is AMRA's view because it is just possible that I have not been accurately advised-although I think I have been. It seems to stack up. I not query it until today because it seems to with my understanding of the arithmetic of how the exchange rate would work, but I will double-check it before I go any further. At least we have some more information, although not as much as I would have wished, and it is my all too long but nevertheless limited experience in opposition that we do tend to find that reports that favour the government lose their confidentiality very quickly and reports that do not retain it. That gives me some sense of what the BTCE report would actually say if it were released, but that is a crisis for another day. I was just recounting my experience, but of course you will prove me wrong in time, I am sure. I want to go to a different matter just briefly and it is more directly in the Attorney's area. It relates to the piracy question. We support the increase in penalties. I do not want to argue about that; it is not a matter of controversy. The controversy surrounds the extent to which the parallel imports are part of the current Customs procedures for effective detection of piracy and whether removing parallel imports will undermine that effective protection. There are substantial arguments put by people in the industry that that is so, that Customs relies upon the exclusive licensee for advice as to who should be receiving CDs and that there is no alternative practical way for Customs to effectively vet CD imports. That does not mean that none will ever be caught, but it would mean the prospects and proportions, and effective operation and enforcement, of the piracy laws would be dramatically undermined. I am interested as to whether the Attorney, in his investigation of this matter, has been assured that it is not the case-as I am advised-that the current Customs procedures rely substantially on the parallel importation provisions as the basis for objections from copyright owners, which is the trigger mechanism enabling Customs to pursue and effectively enforce the piracy provisions. It is that which is our concern. It is not the biggest concern with the whole legislation, but it is a continuing concern which would apply irredid spective of all our arguments about price, et fit cetera. I would appreciate your advice on that matter.",31
15,Mr WILLIAMS,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"I will respond very briefly on that point, simply to say that I will seek advice from the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) on the issue raised by the shadow minister, the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan). As a personal comment, I know that Customs is most effective when it operates on informationintelligence-and is nowhere near as effective when it simply operates on random investigations. I suspect that is as true in relation to pirate record imports as it is in relation to other illicit goods, but I will seek advice and I will respond to the shadow minister in due course. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Williams)-by leave-read a third time. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1997-98 Second Reading: Correction",32

18,Mr FAHEY,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"On 29 October 1997, in my second reading speech for Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1997-98 I inadvertently omitted the word 'not' in paragraph 5. I wish to correct that sentence. On that occasion I said: Honourable members should note, however, that this increase does translate to a similar increase in either the estimated headline or underlying outlays as ... The correct sentence should read: Honourable members should note, however, that this increase does not translate to a similar increase in either the estimated headline or underlying outlays as ...

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1997-98 Cognate bill: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1997-98 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1997-98 Second Reading Debate resumed from 29 October, on motion by Mr Fahey: That the bill be now read a second time.",32
19,Mr MCMULLAN,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"While I welcome the correction by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) of the record, and appreciate the manner in which he has expressed it, for somebody who has had the chance to read a few second reading speeches I have to say that I do not think I can recall anybody who was quite so literal in their reading that they failed to pick up so fundamental a typo, but we all have entries in the Guinness Book of Records from time to time. This might not have been one he would have sought, but it is perhaps the world's most extraordinary performance in that regard. It does not go to the substance of the matter before us, but it is very interesting. The appropriation bills of course will be supported by the opposition. We have never opposed such and we do not go in for that sort of constitutional vandalism. In fact, I think there are now only two members left in the House who have ever participated in a sustained attempt to block the parliamentary appropriations. I think they are the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Those are blots on their history and record with which they have to live, but we will not be emulating it.",33
20,Mr KERR,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,A stain on their escutcheon.,33
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,But not very germane to the bill before the House at the moment.,33
22,Mr MCMULLAN,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"It is absolutely. The fact is that we are supporting it and that it would be improper not to do so; and there are two people who have been so improper, Mr Deputy Speaker, with respect.",33
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,I am glad you added that.,33
24,Mr MCMULLAN,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"I thought you would be, sir. These bills are like all supplementary or additional appropriations bills and in detailed consideration were introduced in a timetable to allow the additional estimates to be undertaken by the Senate, which has effectively already been done in the committee stage. That is a sensible course of action. It is not unique; it is regularly adopted and it was, on this occasion, also a sensible course of action. They are part of a pattern of bills which come to parliament each year to provide from the parliament the approval for the expenditure of Commonwealth funos for specific nominated purposes within the constitutional requirement that money cannot be spent until it is appropriated and it can be spent only for the purpose for which it was appropriated. It is part of the process that keeps government accountable to the people and ensures probity in the financial management of taxpayers' funds. This is but another in that annual cycle of such legislation, in this instance covering expenditure decisions made since the May 1997 budget. They include funds for postbudget decisions up to about the start of November this year. There are, in fact, a few other additions since that time which are not included in this bill. An unavoidable expenditure which has arisen since the budget may cover such things as legal bills, et cetera, and funding for outlays on decisions which were not concluded at budget time; for example, the Tasmanian regional forests agreement. Some of the changes that have been made are changes with which the opposition agrees, some were inevitable, and some are simply a product of weakness in government. But they all have the same impact on the bottom line, although for this year the consequences for the budget deficit may be hidden by what is anticipated to be a revenue surge, so that revenue will exceed budget expectations and, therefore, disguise a softness in some of the outlay assessments which are reflected in this legislation and in the decisions which this legislation reflects and in some subsequent ones. The three bills are seeking approval for gross additions of, with regard to bill No. 3 which covers the ordinary annual services of government, $1.17 billion, and, with regard to bill No.4 which covers the capital works and services payments to the states-a new policy-$51O billion. If we lump those two together, which are the substantial money and take into account the offsetting savings which were the elements that the Minister for Finance and Administration was trying to refer to in the sentence which he has just corrected, we get net increases in outlays of $1.311 billion. I am not including in those figures the separate appropriation of a small nature for the parliament in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1997-98. Since the May budget, the Howard government has added nearly $2 billion to the outlays bottom line in 1997-98. In some instances, that includes figures for the outyears. The $1.3 billion in this bill does The $1.3 billion in this bill is all to do with 1997-98 and it includes: $34.7 million extra for legal aid, an outcome of an earlier policy backflip by the government; amounts in excess of $20 million· for the Tasmanian regional forest agreement which, I think, properly is in this bill-there are some who have disagreement with the agreement itself, but the funding is properly here because it appears that negotiations were not finalised at budget time so the amount of money could not be incorporated; and we have $11.2 million for the Constitutional Convention, in addition to the $24.4 million in the May budget. Nobody could now, I think, confidently say, 'This is taxpayers' money well spent.' . That we should be having the convention at all, rather than going to a direct indication of view by the people, is a fundamental policy disagreement. That the process of electing the Constitutional Convention has been well managed would be one of the world's most heroic assertions because we have a very disappointingly low turnout, disappointing to most Australians, disappointing to me, disappointing to the opposition, but I think entirely predictable and perhaps desired by the government because they have put in place a series of measures to make it virtually impossible for many Australians to effectively participate in this ballot. We have extra money for the Medicare agreement and for the Olympics and we have $10 million for the Newcastle package, money which should have been in the budget because the decision should have been made so much earlier. The Prime Minister should have gone to Newcastle so much earlier and support for that city in its hour of need should have been decided earlier by the government in response to the prompt initiative of the New South Wales government and it should have been in the budget. There is extra money for one of the government's favourite courses of action; that is, sacking Australians. There is $71 million extra for redundancy and so-called staff management costs in the Department of Administrative Services and we have this continuing problem of the government which not. is very mean-spirited in funding everything except the costs for sacking public servants and other employees of the government. And they wonder why we have a sense of some insecurity in our society. We have traditionally in Australia had the sense where parents have felt that, if they got their child a job in the bank or the public service, they had a job for life and they could relax. The world is tougher now. Changes are occurring more rapidly and the government cannot prevent that. No government can unilaterally play King Canute and stop that tide. But you do not have to consciously set out to make it worse. This government will, over its three-year tenn-if it runs the full tenn-have got rid of 50,000 people previously employed by the Commonwealth. We will find in the economic analysis of the consequences of these billswhich I will come to once I deal with the detail-some of the consequences of that profound insecurity which the government always seems surprised about- 'Why are these people feeling insecure?' Perhaps it is because they see that their jobs or the jobs other Australians are disappearing as a result of conscious decisions by this government.",33
25,Mr KERR,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,They gloat about it. They wanted a recession in Canberra.,35
26,Mr MCMULLAN,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"My colleague the member for Denison plays on my sensitivities as member for Canberra, Mr Deputy Speaker, correctly referring to some of the consequences reflected in this particular appropriation for the city of Canberra and the extraordinary outburst by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell). The position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer is a position which I hold in high esteem. It has been held by some very significant Australians in the past and is not one to be taken lightly. But we have had an extraordinary outburst by the current incumbent saying that one of the achievements of the government was to bring a recession to Canberra and wasn't that a great achievement. He was humiliatingly forced to apologise after several failed attempts to justify the unjustifiable. It is a sad reflection on the government's attitude to my constituency and my home town. It has caused grief not only to all Canberra residents but also to the hundreds of thousands of Australians who depend upon the Commonwealth for their employment and the income of their families.",35
27,Mr KERR,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,He was the only one who was not being hypocritical.,35
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,Mr Nehl)Order! The member for Denison does not have the call.,35
29,Mr MCMULLAN,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"A very substantial contribution nevertheless, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to focus on these appropriations and their immediate consequences for the budget bottom line and on some of the extraordinary backflips and policy reversals we have had recently from this government, which have, amongst other things, consequences for the budget bottom line. That is their main area of significance. I am referring to really important issues for the social and political life of this country. I am talking about nursing homes, tax changes, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the greenhouse package, the Tough of on Drugs package, the domestic violence package and the disabilities package. The changes in policy and sometimes straight backflips from previous policy in all these areas are part of the cause of the emerging perception in Australia that the government has lost its way; that it is a government that does not have a sense of where it wants to take Australia and does not have any idea about how to get to the vague destination it sees somewhere in the hazy future. Let us have a look at some of these back"" flips and policy reversals. Some of them are welcome, even if all too modest. First of all, there was the nursing homes backflip. The government never seems to have come to the conclusion that the fundamental problem is that the policy at its heart is rotten and should just be discarded. The government keeps trying to find ways to make minor modifications, patch it up here, put a bandaid on there. The government does not go to the core of the problem. In the 1996-97 budget they said they would pull out almost $500 million worth of funding from nursing homes. That is the core of the problem with that policy and it remains the core of the problem. It is absolutely unbelievable that a minister can say, 'The problem the government developed the new policy to cope with and to respond to was inadequate capital injection to nursing homes. Our solution is to cut the funding.' It is the oxymoron of oxymorons to say that the problem is lack of capital and that the solution is to cut the funding. That is an extraordinary proposition. The opposition found that $60 million is the prevailing assessment of the 1997-98 budget consequence of the partial temporary backdown that they have made so far. There are clearly more backdowns to come. In response to a question from me in the House, the Minister for Finance and Administration said that when the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) had released all the details of the new policy there would be no shortage of capital for nursing homes. I have to say that at the moment that remains a source of some mystification to everybody I have met in the nursing home sector. They are waiting for the information that will support that position. There was, at the time that statement was made, some media speculation that the government was going to put $20 million into capital for nursing homes. There has been no sign of that commitment. There has been no indication of any extra funding of that sort. But perhaps that is the next backflip. It is likely that backflip so far will have outyear consequences for the budget, although on the preliminary assessment we have made it will decline from the $60 million in 1997-98. The best assessment we can make at the moment is that, over the four-year budgetary forward estimates cycle, it may be an extra $130 million. Until now no-one has challenged our assessment of $60 million for 1997-98. It is getting harder for the opposition to precisely forecast the cost consequences of such a policy thereafter, but we think that over the four years it certainly will be more than $100 million: it will get up towards but probably not be quite as much as $150 million. That is a most extraordinary policy reversal because it does not go far enough. It is a policy that just needs to be abandoned. We have had a policy reversal with regard to the capital gains tax and the new cost based rules and their impact on the budget changes. It is assessed that they will add $135 million a consequence of the '2 November 1997 announcement by the government. We had the pharmaceutical benefits scheme backflip on the therapeutic goods decision, which adds about $100 million over four years. Then we have extra expenditures not included in these appropriations bills. They will probably therefore appear in the next budget appropriation-we do not expect aQy1thing else before next May. two of them are remarkable examples of expenditures by government announced with fanfare as initiatives, new policy, but they could most accurately be described as 'filling in holes you've dug yourself'. We have the $180 million greenhouse package and the $87.5 million drugs package, in both instances responding to huge cuts made in those very same programs by the government in 1996. The huge cuts were made, and then they hoped to win applause from the Australian people for saying, 'Well, we'll put the money back in.' In the case of greenhouse, some of the research which they hope the funding will pick up and which they hope will make a substantial contribution to the resolution of the greenhouse both domestically and internationally-as it might-has been stopped as a result of the previous cuts. We have to go back and try to pick up the pieces and put the research process back together again. It is appalling government, appalling mismanagement, to have thought that that was ever a sensible thing to do. It says that the government has no understanding of the profound concern that Australians have about greenhouse, the profound concern any intelligent, thinking citizen has about greenhouse and its consequences. We get a lot of talk from this government about intergenerational equity, and that is the justification for their focus on debt reduction. I welcome belated recognition of intergenerational equity as an issue, but it is a very profound issue in the area of the environment. If, as a result of excessively parsimonious behaviour by a government, we leave people with an unsustainable environment, we have not been equitable to future generations. Perhaps not just our children but our grandchildren will pay the price. The drugs package is the same. I have some profound doubts about some of the underlying policy elements of it, but it was essentially a series of initiatives announced at a forward estimates period cost of $87.5 million, which simply replaced money that had previously been taken out. It is a feature of this government in a number of areas that they look for applause from the Australian people when the net effect of their activity has been nothing. The expectation is that disaster will occur, and then they come up with an announcement and say, 'No, we've changed our mind. There is not going to be a disaster. We're going to do nothing.' I find all the time in my capacity as shadow minister for the arts that this is the most constant theme: 'The worse fears have not been fulfilled. Isn't that wonderful?' Nothing new has happened. No improvement has occurred. We simply have 'It could have been worse.' I turn now, as is standard in discussion these sorts of bills, to a broader assessment the Australian economy and its current cumstances. We do find belated evidence an uplift in economic growth in the first quarters of calendar year 1997. It is very instructive to consider why we did not the economy was. achieve it before. This is not some intellectual point of nomic policy or some arcane debate among economists. We had a government inheriting an economy growing at more than four per in cent slugging the economy, hitting it over the head and slowing it, with very profound adverse consequences for employment and economic growth and for the strength of our economy to meet the great challenges that Asian economic crisis is putting before us. Now the government is saying, got to the level of growth it was when we started. Isn't this a fantastic achievement? nearly as good as it was when we got elected. It's growing almost as fast. Aren't we clever?' The problem is that it was slowed too much in the first place. Higher economic growth is absolutely crucial for Australia's shortand medium-term future. Sustaining that with low economic growth and without running into current account deficit is a fundamental element Australian economic management strategy. And we must remember that this government did not invent or create low inflation. Australprevious is has been in a low inflationary growth phase for five years-not for 18 months. There have been 4Y2 to five years of sustained low inflament-that tionary growth. It is what they inherited the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in a burst of honesty said that the economy he inherited was 'better than good'. When international financiers came to consider investment Australia he told them the truth about economy, but he never sought to tell it to the Australian people. From the time they were elected they set out to talk down the economy. In this one instance, they backed up their words with actions. Their talking down, their overzealous cutting of the budget in 1996-97 and their failure to show economic leadership in key areas, their failure to recognise the importance of of exports and government support for exports of all combined to slow the economy . Year ciraverage economic growth for 1996-97 was a of mere 2.5 per cent. Of course, consumer two confidence has been low because the government has continued to tell everybody how bad We have had the effect of the budget ecodenied for a while, when people tried to assert-and the government still from time to time seeks to pretend-that the 1996 budget particular did not have a negative effect on the economy. Fortunately, the facts are beginning to emerge. The Reserve Bank and the Treasury have both commented on the dampening effects of the 1996 budget. In terms of the comments from the official famili about consequences of government policy, that is 'We've nearly very strong language. Senator Vanstone, who was for a while the It's person who spoke for the government on employment-she did not act for the government on employment, but she spoke for itobserved that the 1996 budget had hurt the economy. We have paid the price of that budget in lower economic growth. The growth in Australia in 1993-94 was 4.6 per cent; in 1994-95, 4.4 per cent; 1995-96, 3.8 per cent; and 1996-97,2.5 per cent-which makes the of employment consequences unsurprising. If you compare the first 18 months of this government with the last 18 months of the government, in the last 18 months of the previous government employment grew by 393,000. In the first 18 months of this governis, effectively until now-total when employment grew by 47,000. In relation to full-time jobs, the contrast is between 242,000 and 21,000. The only way in which the Howard government have increased the in numbers is that they have increased the the numbers of long-term unemployed. They inherited a too large but falling number of 216,000 unemployed, and they have managed in 18 months to increase the long-term unemployed number to 247,000 as at August 1997. They have taken a situation of falling unemployment and managed to make it rise. In the last four minutes before concluding on the bill and reiterating our position on it, I want to make some brief comment on the economic situation in Asia, the circumstances in which Australia finds itself in dealing with it and the extent to which we have been well served by the government in positioning us to cope with it. Nobody doubts that the circumstances in South-East Asia, particularly now that they are spilling over into North-East Asia, will have an adverse effect on Australia's economic growth. Nobody can judge how much. I think the government has been a little complacent in its assumption of how small the effect will be, but there is a prevailing sense that the spill-over into Korea and the potential for it to spill over into Japan increases substantially its potential to affect Australia. There is a very sensible, thoughtful article by Ross Gittins in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald on this matter which says that, with the addition of Korea-this is not including Japan-we find that these economies that have been so adversely affected take 36 per cent of our exports of goods and services. If you add Japan, it rises to 57 per cent of our exports. So this government will have to come to terms with the consequences. It does not matter how often the Prime Minister wanders around saying, 'We are not part of Asia; we are not Asians' - not that anybody ever said we were--our economic future is fundamentally tied to the success of our region. That is why the opposition eschewed the short-term political benefit of the crude populists like the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and supported the government's decision in providing support for Thailand and Indonesia. If the circumstances were the same, we would support a similar participation in support of South Korea because it is part of a commitment to the economic success of our region on which Australia's future so fundamentally depends. But the government's policy framework leaves us very vulnerable. Its failures in industry policy, its failures in regional development policy, its failures in education and training, and its weakening of our growth momentum have all :left us more fundamentally vulnerable in response to this prevailing economic concern than we need otherwise have been. We find the government lurching between complacency and wild excess. We had the stupid effort by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) claiming that, if the government had not cut Commonwealth expenditure in Australia, the IMF would have been in Australia by Melbourne Cup Day 1997. I hope his other tips on Melbourne Cup Day were more accurate. We cannot find, and he cannot find, a credible economist who shares that absurd view. Nor can you find any responsible commentator who thinks it was a responsible or helpful thing for a Deputy Prime Minister to say. We need to focus on this. I think one of the reasons for complacency is that while our currency is being affected against the US dollar it is not being affected against the trade weighted index. I suspect there are some compositional factors there that are not being properly assessed: that our dollar is falling against the countries from whom we import and growing against countries to whom we export. That has been cancelled out in assessment of the trade weighted index, but might be hiding a serious economic problem for us. We as an opposition obviously support the passage of these bills because this is a standard package of appropriation bills that all responsible oppositions and every member of this House will support. But it does provide an important opportunity to provide a critique of the government's weakness in economic policy and the flaws in its budget management and to focus on the important issues for the economic and financial success of the Australian economy over the next 12 months. (Time expired)",35
30,Mr ZAMMIT,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"I rise to contribute to this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1997-98 together with Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1997-98 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1997-98, the intention of which is to appropriwe ate additional moneys out of the consolidated revenue fund to meet essential and unavoidpressure able expenditures. I want to refer to the comments made by the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), leading for the opposition, which he stated that the opposition would never oppose such bills. In so doing, he attempts to take the high ground in relation some historical events. The fact is that, no matter what the opposifamilies tion says, had there not been a change of more jobs. government on 2 March 1996, then, I venture to say, there may well have been no bills before this parliament seeking approval for additional expenditure without first having to refer the matter to the IMF. I suspect that approval would not have been forthcoming because the way the Keating government was headed economically-and I will say a great deal more about that later in my speechwould have inexorably led to a request by the Keating government for an IMP bailout, as has occurred in some of our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. I want to make reference to the situation we found when we came to government on 2 March 1996-we found an economy that was again. totally burnt out. Australia's economy fered from record high foreign debt, high unemployment, the worse current account tion deficit among major industrialised countries, an unacceptably high level of interest rates and inflation rates and a substantial drop in our standard of living compared with other of developed nations. This was Labor's legacy. of Under Labor, high foreign debt led to high consequences interest rates and that meant higher mortgage to payments for families and small businesses and fewer jobs for battling Australians. In fact, Australia had the worse current account deficit in the OECD and this included Mexico. In contrast, after only 18 months of the coalition's first term and for the first time more than a decade, this year the Commonlast wealth government will not run up a debt. fact, not only will we not run up a debt, we have started the long and painful journey towards repaying the debt left to us. This will be repaying over $5 billion in debt, and in so doing will be taking some of the off future generations of Australians. All this will occur without us having to increase taxes. The coalition's first two budgets have put in us back on track. We have been able to successfully tum a $10.3 billion budget deficit into a coalition surplus and by cutting debt to we have been able to cut interest rates and in so doing have provided substantial relief for and small business working to create One. of the worse legacies of 13 years of Labor was their dismal attempts at cooking the books to conceal from the people of our nation the true state of the Australian economy. I am sure that we all remember what occurred prior to the 1996 federal election when the then Labor Prime Minister and his Treasurer were thumping their chests and saying to everyone who wanted to listen that their budget was in surplus to the tune of $2 billion. Documented evidence has now shown that the real situation was a $10 billion deficit and not a $2 billion surplus. This must never be allowed to happen That is why one of the first steps taken sufby the Howard government was to introduce the charter of budget honesty. In my contributo the debate on this bill in this parliament earlier this year, I said, and I reiterate: Clear and transparent accountability in government will serve as a disincentive to future governments Australia to blur the exact situation without fear discovery by the electorate with the appropriate in the ballot box. Additionally, all future governments will be on notice that they go an election with deliberately misleading information on fiscal and economic projections only at grave risk because the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill will expose such covert acts before irretrievassessment able damage is done. Yet again, Labor, to its shame, continues to campaign against the passage of that bill in in the national parliament. Even as recently as Sunday, 23 November 1997, the Leader In of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on national but television complained that the charter of budget honesty would be used to release year budget figures undermining the opposition's election costings after they have been released. He said: Well, because what they've said is that they release a set of figures about the direction of public outlays or direction of the budget overall in immediate week or two of an election being called ... Now, no party can put itself at risk like that. It seems obvious to me and my colleagues this side of the House that the Labor Party does not want to put itself at risk from truth about the budget. That is why they concealed Beazley's $10 billion black hole the 1996 election campaign. The charter of budget honesty would prevent such deception, yet Labor opposes such a needed reform that has the overwhelming support of all Australtive. ians. The fact is that under the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill both the government and the opposition would have to present policies using the same budget figures. What is wrong with that? The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is intended to provide a better understanding the full cost of policies, including those may be deferred, and their economic impact. This, in tum, should promote better decision making and a better informed electorate to assist them in deciding who they will vote based on fact and not on any rubbery or 2000-01. suspect figures. The pre-election outlook is the responsibilinet ty not of the government but of the secretaries of Treasury and the Department of Finance cent. and Administration. If the opposition is so concerned about pre-election budget updates, why did they not move an amendment have them removed from the bill? Instead, the opposition lamely puts forward a amendment which would provide pre-election costings five days after an election is called, rather than allowing for a period of 10 days. It is almost impossible to produce meaningful updates in only five days. What is the national opposition's real agenda? I suspect it is derail the bill so there will be no budget honesty. I think the Australian nation should be aware of that. The Senate again failed to pass the charter of budget honesty for the second time insisting on a number of amendments that would make the charter unworkable. It is obvious that Labor's approach to the bill continues their long standing record of avoidwill ing budget honesty and scrutiny. This should serve as a warning, as I said earlier, to all the the Australian public that the Labor Party want their legendary type of deceit to continue. When the government took office in March on last year we knew swift and decisive action would have to be taken to repair the state of the our economy. Since coming to office the government has moved quickly to place fiscal in policy on a sound footing. We aimed to return the budget to underlying balance within the term of this parliament. We adopted a medium-term fiscal strategy to pursue this objecThe major element of the government's program of fiscal consolidation was provided in the 1996-97 budget with the announcement of measures amounting to $3.9 billion in 1996-97 and $7.2 billion in 1997-98. The 1997-98 budget sought to build on this conof solidation. Together, measures taken in the that 1996-97 and 1997-98 budgets provide for a return to underlying surplus by 1998-99 and are expected to contribute to an improvement in the underlying balance of around 3.75 per for cent of GDP between 1995-96 and the year Over this period, the general government debt to GDP ratio is forecast to have from around 20 per cent to around 10 per As a result of fiscal consolidation efforts to date, the 1996-97 budget was in underlying deficit by $4.9 billion. This represents a to significant improvement on the 1995-96 underlying deficit of $10.3 billion that was questionable inherited in March 1996. The coalition's efforts to eliminate the budget deficit and to make the economy more efficient are paving the way for higher living standards. Ending the budget deficit will boost savings and take pressure off interest to rates and inflation. The urgent need for budget repair reflected the fiscal position inherited by the government in coming to office. Adherence to the medium-term fiscal strategy will ensure that, over time, the by Commonwealth budget makes no overall call on private sector saving and therefore does not retract from national saving by raising national saving relative to national investment. This strategy will contribute to improving our current account position and assist in creating the conditions for stronger sustainable growth. Moreover, it will achieve and maintain prudent levels of government debt thus allowing fiscal policy to respond flexibly during periods of economic weakness. It is interesting to note the very high standards that have been set by the European Monetary Union. I would like to state them. I think that the Australian nation should know what some of our competitors are trying to achieve and how we rate with that. The European Monetary Union targets are: a general government budget deficit no greater than three per cent of Gnp; gross general government debt no greater than 60 per cent of Gnp; inflation no greater than 1.5 percentage points above the three lowest inflation countries; and long-term interest rates no greater than two percentage points above the three lowest inflation countries. The Labor Party failed on each of these four fundamentals. We are now one of the few countries to meet all of these criteria. The government is complementing improved macro-economic policy with a wide range of efficiency reform to boost long-term growth. These include the partial sale of Telstra, improved corporate regulation, reform of the financial system, measures to enhance competition between businesses and a broad tax reform agenda. The achievement of macro-economic stability will also be assisted by the forward looking setting of monetary policy by the Reserve Bank. Monetary policy is being conducted by the Reserve Bank with the objective of maintaining the underlying inflation rate between two and three percentage points on average over the course of the cycle. A new framework for the conduct of monetary policy has been introduced by agreement between the government and the Reserve Bank setting out an inflation objective and enhancing the independence of the bank. Since the election of the Howard government, there have been five cuts to official interest rates. The difference between long term interest rates in Australia and the US, as a comparison, has been virtually eliminated. Rapid capital flows have also made currencies more sensitive to perceptions about the credibility of economic policies. As such, the international financial markets have been an important barometer of the success of Australia's economic reforms. This success is reflected in the fact that Australian lO-year bonds are currently trading at yields less than 0.1 of a percentage point away from US yields, down from a differential of well over two percentage points at the time of the election last year. The last time such a narrow spread occurred was in 1980 before financial deregulation. This is an acknowledgment of Australia's return to the ranks of the low inflation countries and a reflection of our commitment to keeping inflation low. We are committed to low inflation because it gives savers and investors the confidence to make long-term decisions and provides clear signals on the best allocation of resources. It also assists businesses to make sound investment decisions and underpins the creation of new and lasting employment opportunities. This government is keenly aware of the need for investment in the Australian economy in order for us to grow at a rate which increases living standards and reduces unemployment. It is interesting to compare our macro-economic settings with forecasts for the world over the next two years. The IMP predicts US growth of 2.6 per cent in 1998, European growth of 2.8 per cent and growth in the developed world of 2.7 per cent. As a comparison, Australia is expected to be at the top of this table with a growth rate of four per cent, and that is the IMF forecast, not the government's forecast. Labor's legacy of high debt, high interest rates and high unemployment will not be fixed overnight. However, we have already started to deliver concrete benefits that Labor not only would be unable to deliver but .lso has actively opposed. The coalition government will deliver a budget surplus next year without r&ising the tax burden. Our reductions to the budget deficit have taken pressure off interest rates, and that is obvious to everyone. I think it is one of the great achievements of the Howard government. Mortgage interest rates are now the lowest in nearly 30 years. The variable home loan rate charged by three of the four major banks is 6.7 per cent which compares to a peak of 17 per cent in the period from June 1989 to March 1990 under Labor. It is also very interesting to note that, under Labor, Australia's primary lending rate skyrocketed to 11.63 per cent. Under the coalition government, that primary lending rate is now down to 6.05 per cent,a massive reduction of 52 per cent in 18 months. Under Labor, the unemployment rate peaked at 11.2 per cent in December 1992. In October 1997, we have an unemployment rate of 8.4 per cent. The coalition government has established a much better foundation for sustainable growth. Growth in Australia in 1998 is expected to be one of the strongest among major industrialised countries. The fact that Australia's financial markets have been relatively stable despite financial problems in other countries in the region illustrates how strong our position now is. In conclusion, I view tr future prospects of the Australian econonlY with great optimism. We have a great deal to be very proud of as we work towards a better future not just for ourselves but for our children and future generations of all Australians. The coalition government is committed to pursuing forward looking economic reforms across a broad range of fronts to create conditions for improved living standards based on sustained economic growth. For all these reasons, I very strongly support the bills before the House for additional appropriations.",38
31,Mr WILLIS,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"I would like to make a number of points about the budget and the economy in the context of discussing these appropriation bills. At the outset, I would like to correct the continual misrepresentation by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of Australia's budget deficit and the government debt position that the government inherited on the change of government. The Treasurer continually claims in question time, and we have all heard it time and time and tedious time again, that there was a high level of government debt when they came into office in the order of $90 billion to $100 billion-he varies in the numbers that he uses-that there was a supposed $10 billion black hole in terms of a budget deficit and that all this indicated how fiscally irresponsible the Labor government was. I will make a number of points about that. Firstly, it is true that debt did increase substantially in the first half of the 1990s. That, of course, was because of a recession. In a recession, all governments find that they are faced with an increasing budget deficit, or reducing surplus. That is because of the automatic effect on the budget of a recession-that is, reduced tax revenue as unemployment increases and fewer people are earning incomes, company profits fall so there is less company tax, fewer things are bought so there is less in the way of sales tax and, on the other hand, there is a much higher expenditure on unemployment benefits. These things happen automatically. So the budget turns around in a recession quite quickly through these automatic factors, which are called automatic stabilisers in so far as they mean the government is cutting taxes and spending more so there is some kind of impetus to the economy. Also, there are discretionary increases that all governments use to try to get the economy out of a recession more quickly than would otherwise be the case. These discretionary measures-increases in public works, cuts in taxes, whatever the government decides to use to boost demand-have the effect of increasing the budget deficit and, therefore, increasing government debt. Both these things happened in the early 1990s. We had the automatic increase in the budget deficit. We had the discretionary increases to try to get us out of the recession quickly. So the budget surplus at the end of the 1980s of two per cent of GDP turned around quite quickly into a deficit by about 1993. The same thing happened in the early 1980s when the then Treasurer, John Howard, now Prime Minister, was presiding over the country's economic fortunes and there was a recession. Immediately the budget started to deteriorate through the automatic factors and also because of the discretionary measures brought in by the Fraser government to try to get the economy back onto a growth path. So, when Labor came into office, we inherited a budget deficit heading towards four per cent of GDP. In today's money, that four per cent of GDP would be about $20 billion. That is what we faced. Did we rush in and say, 'This is terrible. We've got a budget deficit of four per cent of GDP. We have to slash and bum in order to get the budget back into surplus as quickly as possible'? Had we done that, we would have kept the economy in recession for longer than it was and prevented the recovery, which occurred fairly rapidly after Labor came into office. We gradually pared the budget deficit back through the combination of repair through growth and also through discretionary changes to the budget to reduce outlays in the main. Over time that took us back into a budget surplus of up to two per cent of GDP by the end of the 1980s. The contrast between the way in which Labor went about dealing with a budget deficit which it inherited and the way in which this government went about dealing with a budget deficit which it inherited is stark. One sought to do it in a graduated, sensible way, not impairing the growth of the economy; the other one belted into it and said, 'This is disastrous. We have to take big steps,' and, therefore, put a damaging antigrowth and anti-employment factor into the economy. I will come to that factor later on. It is very important to understand exactly what the situation was and the contrast between the situation that Labor faced when it came into office and the way it handled it and the way in which the current government handled the situation of trying to repair the budget deficit. If in the eyes of the Treasurer it is so important to attack budget deficits as soon as they emerge, does that mean that in the face of a recession he believes that the appropriate policy for the government to pursue is to slash government expenditure and increase taxes to repair the deficit? He seems to be implying that, when the recession occurred and we had an automatic deterioration of the deficit, we should have dashed in there and repaired the budget deficit. Had we done that, ' we would have had a much longer recession, maybe a depression. It would have been absurd policy to do that. No Western government faced with the same situation did that. They all did what we did-that is, they took discretionary action to try to get the economy back on a growth path. That did not involve tightening the budget; it involved loosening the budget. Of course one does not do this forever. The day comes when you have to repair it, as we did in the 1980s and as we were doing through the 1990s subsequent to getting the economy back on a growth path. But the Treasurer seems to imply that we should have got stuck right into the budget in terms of tightening it up in the midst of a recession. It would have been an absurd policy. It would have been totally counterproductive. We would have had a much deeper recession. We would still have substantial budget deficits, but a far worse economy. What happened in Australia with regard to the budget deficit and debt happened in most Western countries for the same reason. Virtually all of them went into recession in the first part of the 1990s. It was not in the same year-some went early like us, the United States, Canada and a few others. The English speaking nations tended to go early. The others came a year or two later. But over the period of the early 1990s most Western countries went into recession. All of the G7 countries did. It was not just Australia. The whole of the G7, the major locomotive forces of the world economy, went into recession over this period. Most of Europe went into recession over this period. In other words, the developed world as a whole went into recession at some stage or other over this period. It was not an isolated Australian experience. The OECD figures for general government financial balances, which give a comtfton basis for analysis of country's budget positions, show that in 1989 the OECD average budget deficit was 1.2 per cent of GDP and that by 1993 that had increased to 4.3 per cent of GDP. So the figure for all the Western developed countries in the OECD went from 1.2 per cent of GDP deficit in 1989 to 4.3 per cent of GDP deficit in 1993 because of recession. It was a common experience for all of us. Some countries had a dramatic turnaround. Sweden went from a surplus of 5.4 per cent of GDP in 1989 to a deficit of 12.3 per cent of GDP in 1993-an extraordinary turnaround. Most were nowhere near as dramatic as that. Certainly, Australia's position was not in that kind of order. So what happened to us in terms of budget deterioration was pretty much on a par with what happened to the Western developed world generally. Also, Australia's budget deficit and official debt levels were not at high compared with many other countries. In regard to the budget deficit, in 1995, the last year before Labor went out of office, the general government deficit for Australia\ as shown by the OECD figures was two per cent of GDP. The OECD average for that year was 5.2 per cent of GDP. So our budget deficit in 1995 was far less than the average for Western developed countries-two per cent compared with an average of 5.2 per cent. We did not have a high budget deficit. It was a relatively low budget deficit compared with most Western countries. The average deficit for the G7 countries, the major economic forces, was 3.4 per cent of GDP in 1995well above ours of two per cent. Also in regard to government debt, the OECD table in relation to government financial balances shows common analysis of gross financial liabilities for OECD countries. It lists 21 countries and shows their gross financial liabilities as a percentage of GDP for 1996. It shows only two countries out of 21 had a lower level of debt than Australia. We get this ridiculous nonsense from the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), all the backbenchers and the Prime Minister about Labor's legacy of debt and deficit. It is just an absolute nonsense. Labor's debt and deficit was low by the standards of Western developed countries. We did not leave high levels of debt or high levels of deficit. The argument that continually comes from the government about this is just make-believe. It is just their own propaganda. It has no substance in fact. It is a complete untruth and its repetition does not make it any more correct. It is a total falsity. They continue to say it because it suits their position politically, but it is totally and completely untrue. Australia's level of debt as a percentage of GDP in 1996 was 43.8 per cent. Compare that to the average level of debt for Western developed countries of 78.8 per cent and for the G7 of 73.8 per cent. We were far below the average and we were almost the lowest, apart from Korea which was very low. Of the Western developed countries, we were almost the lowest. It is so important that this House all and the Australian people properly understand that what they are told time and time again is a complete and utter untruth. Clearly, this analysis shows that Labor was not a fiscally irresponsible government. Its levels of deficit and debt were well below the levels of most other Western countries. As for the alleged budget black hole, if Australia had a black hole with its low level of budget deficit, what does that say about all the other Western nations with much bigger levels of debt and deficit? You have got a whole world economy full of black holes in that case. The Treasurer must think he is the Stephen Hawking of fiscal analysis. He has found black holes everywhere. They are all over the place. Everyone has got terrible black holes. Australia's black hole is a fairly small one compared with the black holes that exist all over the rest of the world. He has discovered a whole universe of black holes. Certainly, there were sizeable forecasting errors in the 1995-96 budget, both in outlays and tax revenue. That is now quite clear. These were even greater in the outyears. Let me say that these were not my mistake or the mistake of the cabinet; these were the mistake of our advisers, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance, whose figures we took and incorporated in the budget. They were not false figures, they were not figures that we dreamed up or that we changed from the analysis that was given to us by Treasury and Finance; we used their figures. Subsequently, they changed their estimates, but that does not mean that those figures we put in the budget were initially false. The budget outcome was then made to appear worse by the government presenting the budget numbers differently than ever before. It excluded asset sales receipts and advances from the states, something that the now Prime Minister when he was Treasurer never once did. He always produced his budgets in the same way as we produced ours. He never once used the presentation that is now being used to try to make the picture look a lot worse. Despite these real and presentational changes, the fact remains that the fiscal state of Australia at the change of government was far from disastrous. Indeed, it was one of the better budget and debt situations ama""ngst Western developed countries-with regard to debt, it was very close to the best, so too was our economic performance, both in respect of overall growth and of employment growth. In regard to economic growth, the OECD figures show that Australia's GDP growth in the three years up to 1995 was 13Y2 per cent. That is more than double the OECD growth in that period of time of 6Y2 per cent. So in our last three years we were increasing the economic growth of Australia at double the rate of the Western developed world. But growth has slowed under the Howard government. In the first five quarters, which is all that we have so far since the change of government, we have seen GDP growth slow considerably. It has grown by 3.2 per cent in those five quarters compared with 4.5 per cent in the five quarters prior to the change of government. In the first year of the Howard government, we had growth of only 1.9 per cent in that 12-month period-very slow growth indeed. The 1996 budget must take some substantial blame for that. The talking down initially by the government depressed confidence in the economy, and then the action taken in the budget obviously had an impact on economic growth. Having some $7 billion taken out of the economy through 1996-97 and 1997-98, which is over 1.5 per cent of GDP, has clearly slowed economic activity and thus slowed employment growth substantially. What has happened in relation to employment is quite extraordinary. Since this government came into office, despite all of the boasting about employment positive policies that they are supposed to be putting in place net and that we hear from government ministers at question time, the fact is employment has increased by only a miserable 121,500 in the 20 months since February 1996 of which only 24,500 are full-time jobs. What a pathetic performance in 20 months-an additional 24,500 full-time jobs! The number of unemployed has gone up by 5.8 per cent. The unemployment rate is the same but the participation rate has declined by 0.8 per cent, which means people have dropped out of the work force. If participation had remained where it was at 63.8 per cent, the unemployment rate today would be 9.5 per cent not 8.4 per cent. They have been saved, to some extent, by the fact that there has been this decline in the participation rate-a decline which the government has, in part, engendered by such actions as slashing funds for child care, making it much more difficult for women to afford child care so that they are dropping out of the work force. Let us compare all that with what happened in the previous 20 months before Labor went out of office. In our last 20 months, we h-d employment growth of 453,000 compared WIth the next 20 months under this government which had a miserable growth of 121,500. We had a growth in full-time employment of 265,000 compared with a growth of-how much?-24,500 in the next 20 months under this government. What an incredible contrast: this government has achieved less than a tenth of our development of full-time jobs. The number of unemployed under us declined by 103,000 in that 20-month period and the unemployment rate fell by 1.5 per cent. Despite the fact that the participation rate actually increased from 62.8 per ceQt to 63.8 per cent, we were still able to get the unemployment rate down by 1.5 per cent. You can see that the contrast on employment is extraordinary. Labor increased employment in its last three years by a whopping 733,000 jobs. So far, in lo/a years this government has increased employment by just 121,500 jobs. The Prime Minister boasted in the election that he would 'boost jobs growth' - I think those were the exact words. If he is going to at least match Labor's 733,000 jobs, then in the next year and a quarter he will have to produce 611,500 additional jobs. You reckon he has a chance of doing that? Obviously not a hope in hell. This government has no idea about creating employment. Its performance has been ghastly. Even if it were performing at Labor's average rate over its 13 years-where we produced over two million jobs at an average of 157,000 a year-it would by now have produced some 260,000 jobs, but it has only produced 121,500. So even compared with Labor's average performance over 13 years, this government is way behind. Yet to hear the ministers at question time boasting about what they are doing to improve employment-the Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Prime Minister-one would think that this was a terrific record that they could point to. In fact, their record on employment is a disaster. That is partly because of reduced economic growth but it is also because of the way in which they have gone about their budget cuts by slashing the Public Service, cutting Public Service jobs to an incredible degree, abolishing the Working Nation programs, pushing up long-term unemployment and destroying employment services.

32,Mr RICHARD EVANS,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"Isn't it really sad to see someone who has held a high office in this place, someone from Williamstown, deluding himself about some of the facts about what has happened in the past? The one thing I guess he is saying is that he does not believe that the electorate in March last year dumped his party comprehensively for the way it managed the economy. It is a little over 18 months ago that the electorate did respond in such a very gentle way with so many seats being lost. Let me recap on a few of the legacies associated with the speech by the member for Gellibrand and former Treasurer (Mr Willis)-his valedictory speech, I would think. Labor's legacy included a $10.3 billion deficit in 1995-96. The member for Gellibrand and former Treasurer denies that deficit was there, but it is there. He blames the Treasury officials for giving the wrong figures. Labor's legacy also included record small business interest rates, which were up to 24 to 26 per cent during their term. But Labor-not understanding what small business is all about-would not appreciate how much of an impact that had. Labor also introduced a fringe benefits tax during their term, which meant the closure of many towns in the north-west of Western Australia. They had an 800 per cent increase in foreign debt since 1983 and they had the worse current account deficit in the OECD. And despite what the former Treasurer said, because no-one can believe anything the Labor Party says these days, it was worse than the deficit in Mexico. The real startling point about Labor's legacy is that they promised in 1993 not to put up tax. They went to the Australian people in 1993 saying they would not put up tax; yet they increased taxes by $10 billion in their last three years of government. Here we have opposition members saying how wonderful they were. That is why the previous speech from the member for Gellibrand was a very sad speech. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gareth Evans, on 19 March 1996 said, 'We were a good government, and we are not going to apologise.' In a radio interview in September last year, an interviewer asked the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), 'When do you think you will be Prime Minister?' He said, 'In three years.' What an arrogant statement from someone who has just been dumped out of the electorate. Labor's Martin Ferguson, the member for Batman, said on 25 November 1996, 'The Australian people are a pretty forgiving population. They basically threw us out on 2 March not on the basis that we were a bad government but basically because of the ""It's time"" factor.' They do not yet have the message. Mr Beazley, the opposition leader, said on 22 June 1996, 'We don't need to go through the sort of soul searching that the state parties went through, because we were a competent government.' The electorate did not believe that. Former Labor minister Bob Brown, the member for Charlton, said on 28 May 1996, 'Whenever the next election is held, be it an ordinary election or a double dissolution, we will come back into government with a majority of 16.' A majority of 16! Gareth Evans, the member for Holt, said on 13 December 1996, 'Paul Keating was the finest parliamentarian of his generation. We shall miss him, and this country will miss him.' Hands up those who miss Paul Keating. Not one hand has gone up in the House. In Cowan at the last election, they were worried about the things that were important to them. They are things that were forgotten by the Labor Party. They were worried about debt. The former Treasurer said that there was no debt and that there was nothing to worry about. However, in Cowan, they were worried. They were worried about job opportunities for their young people. Those opposite did not worry about that, but they were worried about it in Cowan. Those in Cowan wanted some incentives for families. Families were being ignored in Cowan. Those in Cowan wanted help for small business. They were concerned about community safety. Not a lot of politicians talk about community safety, but people in Cowan were talking about community safety. When we came into office and gained the confidence of the electorate in 1996, our goal was to govern for all Australians, not just a few, to try to meet these concerns. We wanted to make all Australians participate in the community and get involved with the things happening in the electorate. Whilst there is much more to be done, we are taking some steps in the right direction. It is interesting to note Labor's history when it comes to debt. Labor members do not recognise debt. They say that debt is good. If you went to any household in Australia and said, 'Don't worry about it. Debt is good,' occupants would throw you out the front door, because debt is not good. The Labor Party thinks it is okay to overspend what we earn. The current account deficit in 1994-95 was equal to six per cent of GDP, contrary to what the former Treasurer just said. Perhaps he has the wrong advice again. It was the worse in the OECD. We had high interest rates under this Labor government. They did not care. They had high unemployment. I think it touched about 11 per cent. In my electorate alone, there was 27 per cent youth unemployment. Mr Hollis-What is it now? What is the youth unemployment rate in your area now?",46
33,Mr RICHARD EVANS,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"It is about 25 per cent. It has gone down. I thank the member for Throsby. Where was the growth? They said that growth was occurring and that it would create employment. It was not occurring at all. What have we done? We have come in and addressed the debt problem in Australia. We have come in and said that we will get rid of the $10 billion plus deficit and tum it around, which we are going to do in our first term. We are back to a surplus in our first term. We are going to cut our debt by half by the end of this century, which is only a couple of years away. That is what our relationship is with debt. The current interest rate on debt is about $9 billion per year. Could you imagine a party that was happy to pay $9 billion per year in interest payments on debt? Those opposite were prepared to pay $9 billion. There would be no payroll tax in Australia if we had not got rid of the interest debt of $9 billion. There would be no fuel excise in Australia if we did not pay the interest debt of $9 billion in Australia. Yet they are happy with paying the interest debt. We are addressing the debt and meeting those issues within Cowan. We are concerned about young people in Cowan. There is no doubt that young people are the most important segment of the Australian community. They are the future c.mmunity leaders. Young people are the future, so we have to give them educational, employits ment and training opportunities. We have to let them participate in the Australian community. Yet those on the other side ignored them for so long. What are we on this side doing? We are out there producing things for young people. We are getting them involved ians. in education if they cannot go to university. Only 30 per cent of young people go to university. They are getting opportunities TAPE training and other work opportunities. We promised that we would provide a secure future for young people, and we are doing that in government in a short time. I acknowhelping ledge that there is much more to do. But we are providing for them. Labor provided incentives for young people to not go to work or school. They paid the dole to young people. We have changed that to a common youth allowance which allows them to go back to school and get their education. There should not be unemployed young people in Australia. We must adopt attitude in Australia that they are either undereducated or undertrained. We should think, 'If you are unemployed, we'll see later. Go away, wherever you are. Here's some money. We don't want to know you any more.' That is the attitude of the not ours in government. There is a lot more to do. Labor was very poor when it came to apprenticeships. My colleague the member for Throsby would appreciate that the manufacwe turing industry and other industries require skills training for their young apprentices. This year, we have more apprenticeships the Australian economy. Why? Because the government is focusing on providing apprenticeship opportunities for young people. On families-and I am sure the member for Throsby knows all about that-and their importance to Australia, the government promised a number of things to the Australian people. We said we would give families a tax break. I cannot recall the last time that Labor Party gave the families of Australia tax break. We promised them a tax break the last election-and we delivered. The people of Cowan wanted a tax break at the last election. We delivered. They wanted a commitment to small businesses to help families get their businesses up and running. We have provided families with a with a tax cut of up to $450 a year on interest on savings or personal superannuation contriwill butions for approximately six million AustralWe now have faster Medicare claims processing. We introduced a $450 rebate on with the cost of private health insurance from 1 July 1997. We are remodelling and improving child care. We are concentrating on carers, who were ignored by the Labor Party . We are the carers in our community. We are helping families. In its period in government, the Labor Party ignored all those areas. The people in the Cowan electorate want help for small businesses, which are the very essence of the community in Cowan. What did the Labor Party do for small businesses? It drove them into the ground with its IR issues and interest rates. When we came into the government we promised that we would give small businesses capital gains tax relief. We not delivered. We promised to cut red tape. We you delivered. We promised to improve apprenticeship and trainee schemes. We delivered. We promised to scrap Labor's unfair dismissLabor Party, allaws. We delivered. We delivered a low interest, low inflation economy which is ripe for small businesses to kick into. However, they are still trying to recover from the Labor Party recession that had to have-the one that drove small businesses into the ground, drove their knuckles into the dirt and got their fingernails very in dirty. They are now recovering from that through the optimism that we are giving them. We are also doing something about community safety. In my electorate of Cowan, community safety is a very important issue. For people in my electorate of Cowan, the No. 1 issue is community safety. It is very hard to talk about community safety at a federal level, but the government has listened the and it has responded. We have launched a a national campaign against violence and crime. at For the first time, a Commonwealth government has taken a strategic leadership role in crime prevention. Some $13 million is to be spent on a three-year program, which was launched in June this year. That was a major , government election commitment, and it has lot of help, been delivered in full. The first phase of the focus of this program be crime prevention and dealing with fear of crime. Residential burglary, domestic violence prevention, early intervention in crime, young people's use of public space-a very important issue in Cowan-and the problems of homeless youth are all issues we want to work on, and thus give people some hope for the future. We also want to prevent crime and violence at public events. This government is focused on the big issues. We are focused on the environment. No-one could say that the Natural Heritage Act was not good for Australia. It was good for Australia. It was the biggest environment package ever delivered to Australia. We promised it and we delivered it. In relation to health, we said we would not touch the Medicare system, and we have not. We are working hard to improve the area of health. The Labor Party has no idea how the health system operates. Former health minister Graham Richardson said that 40 per cent of people needed to have private health insurance. What did the Labor Party do? It drove people out of private health insurance. What did we do? We gave people incentives to get private health cover. We gave them the choice. Labor is anti-choice; the government is pro-choice. We have been working on jobs as well. We promised the electorate that we would change workplace reforms and give employees better choices so that they could talk to their employers, rather than having this confrontationist attitude that the Labor Party always on. We promised to give small businesses relief from tax and red tape. We have delivered. We promised to provide more apprenticeships and practical training. We have delivered. I am not saying that in an arrogant way, because there is still much more to do. What about the Labor Party? Its members will say and do anything to get a vote. In fact, they are hoping that this former politician from the disgraced Dowding and Lawrence governments-the one who said that he did not want to continue in politics, and wanted to step aside for a young person-is now running against me in the seat of Cowan. He has to get preselected, but he said that he was going to retire, and now six months later he is coming back. Labor would say and do anything to get re-elected. In government, Labor said that Australia needed to continue the process of economic reform; now it says that it wants to reverse the reforms. In government, Labor said that tariff cuts help boost exports; now it says the direct opposite. In government, Labor said that privatisation was consistent with job creation; now it says the opposite. In government, Labor said that cutting the budget deficit would lower interest rates; now it denies there has ever been a connection. In government, Labor said that reducing the deficit would boost jobs growth; now Labor tells us the direct opposite. Why? Maybe it is to get votes. In government, Labor said that industrial relations reform was important to create jobs; now it is voting against change. In government, Labor argued for tax reform; now it is saying that we do not need tax reform. In government, Labor said that higher education should not be exempt from budget scrutiny; now it argues the opposite. Why? Maybe it is to get votes. In government, Labor said that the Commonwealth government should fight the compen&ation claims of separated indigenous children; now it is demanding the opposite. In government, the minister at the table, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), said that Labor was going to provide security for leaseholders and land-holders in Western insists Australia; now it argues the opposite. After 13 years of Labor government, much needed to be cleaned up. A lot of work still has to be done. You cannot fix 13 years of neglect in 18 months. We are heading in the right direction. Our strategies are in place. We are working on the debt. We are working to bring hope and opportunity to young people. We are providing a bit of certainty for families. We are providing some hope for the future for those in the community who want to participate. We are heading towards a better environment through our policies. We are also tackling the unfortunate social problems of community safety and crime. We are heading in the right direction. Our strategies are right but there is much more to do. I can assure the electorate of Cowan that whilst I am their member and whilst they have meMr Stephen Smith-Until the next election! Mr RICHARD EV ANS-I must say the ,member for Perth has been very keen to get rid of me for the last two elections but has been unsuccessful. He will drag anyone out of the melting pot to try to work against me. But whilst I am the member for Cowan, and whilst I am listening to what the people are saying---constantly representing them in their areas of need-I will represent them to the best of my ability. I am their member of parliament. I will continue to be their member of parliament whilst they choose for me to be there; whilst I am, I am proud to be a member of this government and I am proud to represent the people of Cowan in this place.",47
34,Mr HOLLIS,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"It is a great pleasure to follow the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) in debate in this chamber. He is someone I have a certain degree of affection and admiration for. He is a littleMr Stephen Smith-Come on, Colin!",50
35,Mr HOLLIS,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"One has got to be generous, but I must say he really stretched that friendship a long way today. The honourable member for Cowan said that he was proud to be a member of the government and that it was heading in the right direction. All I can say to the honourable member for Cowan is: keep heading in that direction. We are delighted that you are heading in that direction because that is why you are where you are in the polls today. Have a look at the Morgan polls and the other polls and see where you are going. We encourage you to keep going in that direction-and the direction of the polls will be down, down and down. Whenever that election is held, instead of us this temporary sojourn on this side of the chamber, we will resume our rightful place on that side of the chamber. Keep heading in that direction; we are delighted. One wonders if everything is as wonderful as the honourable member for Cowan has spent the last 20 minutes telling us: how great it all is and how great society is today. One wonders why the coalition parties are where they· are at the moment, because the community is sending them a message. Far from going in the right direction, on so many issues they are going completely in the wrong direction. Let me take up some of the points that the honourable member for Cowan raised. He raised the question of youth unemployment. We all know that youth unemployment is a very difficult problem. It was a problem when we were in government and it is an immediate problem for them. But government members keep saying this phrase, which apparently carne from the former Senator Richardson-'promise them anything'. I remember the last election. Next door to me is the seat of Gilmore, and I remember the now member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash)-again someone who I have known for a long time and have an amount of admiration and respect for-promising the youth of Nowra that if the then opposition, now the current government, were elected, they would no longer tolerate youth unemployment in the Shoalhaven. As anyone knows who cares to read the figures, youth unemployment in the Shoalhaven has gone up significantly since the government was elected. There were lots of reasons; I am not saying it was all the government's fault. Nevertheless, the member for Gilmore made much of it during the campaign. She used to come on television and say, 'We will not tolerate this, we will not tolerate that, we will not tolerate youth unemployment in the Shoalhaven.' I was quite interested in what the member for Cowan was saying about the job training schemes. Whatever people might argue about Labor when it was in government, we did have a commitment to the youth. You only have to look at some of the programs that we initiated-the training programs and othershaving to give youth not only jobs but also some feeling of worth in the community and some money in their pocket. I agree· with the member that there should not be any unemployment, but there will be unemployment. The member for Cowan must live in a very different area from me or he must have read different newspapers from me: he is talking about apprenticeships. I have been reading in the paper this week that Qantas-in an act of spite, I believe-are not taking on any apprentices. I know that in my own area, where we could always rely on BHP to take on apprentices, they are not taking on apprentices. I can remember at one time BHP at Port Kembla had an apprentice training school. They had an apprentice master and staff there. All that is gone today. I do not know where the honourable member for Cowan, gets these apprentices that he is talking about. He also says that families are better off today. Are they? Go and talk to the families. The families that come into my office most certainly do not feel that they are better off. He made much of what they are doing for the family, but they are also causing a lot of divisiveness in the family. One thing he did say, which I agree with wholeheartedly, was that they remodelled child care. You remodelled it all right-you remodelled it right out the door. The people in my area, a working class area, who came to see me cannot afford to pay the fees in child-care centres today. People come even from the member for Gilmore's electorate to see me. People come up from Nowra and Kiama to see me. The other child-care operators in my area and the workers at those centres come to see me. You have certainly remodelled it. I remember when we came into power in 1983 what the child-care provision was in this country. It was way down on OECD levels. One thing we can be proud of when we were in government-there are many things we can be proud of-is that we made good quality child care accessible to all and affordable by all. You have most certainly remodelled it so that it is not accessible to all and affordable by all. We all represent areas in which there are child-care centres, thanks to the Labor government, and these people have been to see each of you as they have been to see me. The claim that they are making is that child care is no longer accessible to all and no longer affordable by all. Again, the honourable member spoke about small business. If business is rosy for the small business community today, why are they coming to see me? Why are people going out of business today? You cannot tell me that there are not more people going out of business today than there were when we were in power. When you listen, to the honourable member for Cowan, you would think that no business person is going bust. They are going bust today-and they are going bust because of your policies! So let us hear no more of this nonsense about small business. Small business people are not our traditional supporters. They do not vote for us; in the past they have not. You will see where they are going to cast their vote at the next election. I am afraid, colleagues, it will not be for you. I am so grateful to the honourable member for Cowan for making such a wide ranging speech because I did not have a lot prepared. He has given me the opportunity to respond to his comments. He touched on Medicare and said that Medicare is preserved. You are trying to gut Medicare; you are trying to kill it by 1,000 stabs. Let me tell you of the commitments made during the election campaign. In the last federal election campaign, the Liberal candidate for the seat of Throsby was a chicken farmer from Liverpool-he did not even live in the electorate. This chicken farmer-we called him 'the chickel1 man'fluttered into my electorate on one day during the four or five weeks campaign. For some time, there had been a campaign in my electorate to open ,a new Medicare office at Dapto. I was very involved in this. It was put through the Dapto branch of the ALP and many people came to see me. The combined pensioners were running a campaign on it. There were letters in the paper and it went over a couple of years. When Graham Richardson was a minister, I remember a deputation went to see him. When the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) was a minister, we had a meeting here. We said to the people, 'In the growth projected for Dapto, in a couple of years time there will be the population base for a Medicare office and I am sure we will eventually establish a Medicare office there.' They were a bit angry with me and the government that we had not immediately seen the validity of their arguments and immediately opened a Medicare office in Dapto. But we had produced all the figures to show that, in the long term, we would open it. The chicken man came down campaigning against me in the seat of Throsby on his one day. His big announcement on the television that night and in the local newspapers was, the Liberal Party is elected to government, we will immediately open a Medicare office in Dapto.' 'Great news,' everyone said. Everyone was ringing me up and saying, 'The chicken man'-whatever his name was-'is so successful he is going to open a Medicare office in Dapto.' As history records, the Liberal and National parties won the federal election and we waited with bated breath for the Medicare office to open in Dapto. What did you do? Instead of opening one, you closed two Medicare offices. You closed the Medicare office at Warrawong and you closed the Medicare office at Corrimal! Instead of giving us an additional Medicare office in Dapto, which was a solemn promise from the Liberal Party, immediately they won the election, what did they do? Instead of opening one, they closed two. Unbelievable! And they are expecting us to believe that they are not determined to destroy Medicare. Now we come to the environment. Unless things have moved a little more quickly than I have known them to move, the whole question on the environment is still a promise. It is still a gleam in some Liberal Party member's eye. Like us, you are committed to the environment, but do you think that it will really be delivered? Why are the environmental movements throughout Australia, those who you conned, so worried about you? It is all very well for Liberal Party members to stand up in this chamber and say that the Labor Party would promise us anything. Any of us who lived through the last election know the sleazy deal you did with the environmental movement. The deal that was done then was not delivered on. So don't you people lecture us on promising anything to get government. You promised anything to the environmental movement and, as I always say to the environmentalists when they come to see me, the problem with the Liberal Party is that they have the chainsaw wielding National Party to contend with-the chainsaw gang. You are a coalition and you always have to go for the lowest common denominator and accommodate the chainsaw wielding National Party members. You know that. Whatever you 'If may want individually to deliver on the environment, you always have to deal with the chainsaw gang. They are the ones who are going to dictate what is delivered on the environment. Okay, there may be some desalination of rivers, there may be a few more trees planted, but the real question on the environment will be what the chain saw gang say it is going to be. You know that and I know that. So let us wait and see, instead of talking as if you have already delivered. You have made a promise but the goods have not yet been delivered and I doubt whether they will be before the next election. I do not want to go on about the indigenous people, although the honourable member for Cowan did. It is a debate that is going on at the moment so perhaps it is not appropriate to delve into that, but let me say that there are a lot of disappointed and disillusioned people there. Moving on to workplace reform, most workplace reform-and I notice it has been in the media this week-is to do with the waterfront. It always amazes me that, when those opposite talk about the waterfront, they talk as if taking the W aterside Workers Federation of Australia membership out, lining them up against a wall and shooting them would immediately solve all the problems on the waterfront. Of all the trade union movements in Australia, the Maritime Union of Australia-the former Waterside Workers Federation of Australia-is the most reformed. The shipping unions are the unions which have been most reformed over recent years. It is a lean and mean team on waterfront today. A few years ago on the waterfront a lot of people could be seen. They are not seen today. The union movement has been restructured. The waterfront is an extremely complex business. There are a lot of cogs in the chain there and the waterfront workers are but few. I hear the people over on the other side talking about the waterfront, but how many times when ships are being loaded do farmers or producers not deliver the goods on time? They leave it until the last possible minute. Those on the other side talk about truck queues outside the wharves. How many of them ever ask or even realise how many truckies are paying off their trucks through demurrage? They are stuck there because of waiting time. What about the number of times stuff is taken off the ships and left there by people for three days? We should start being sensible about the waterfront. We should start charging storage time to keep goods on the waterfront instead of it being a cheap method of storing goods. We should do something about the paperwork, about bills of lading. We should have an electronic exchange and things like that instead of this grab bag of ideas that people are always putting up. People are always arguing about the waterfront and saying, 'We've got to do something about the wharfies.' That is a nonsense. Those on the other side are very keen to read out letters that they receive from constituents. It seems that the constituents who write to those opposite are always very critical of the Labor Party and always full of praise for the good things that those opposite are doing. I-like, I guess, many other members-received a letter this week from the Missionary Sisters of Service in Queensland. It was signed by some 50 other people. It said: Dear Mr Hollis This letter is being sent to each of our Federal politicians. A nun wrote this letter. The letter continues: In all my 58 years of life I have never felt so disillusioned at the Federal Government, yet wondering how we, the citizens of this country can be heard by those supposedly representing us. I feel much shame at John Howard's decision on the standards of output of greenhouse gas emissions-he is an embarrassmentI am not saying this-I would not say this about our Prime Minister-this is what this sister, this nun, is sayingto our country as he promotes a policy that brings long term damage to our planet, saying that jobs and industry in Australia are higher priorities. I think that your stand on greenhouse gas emissions is a disgrace. I represent a coal producing area; I've got a lot of coalminers in my area. Last week, the Prime Minister stood in this House, pointed out to us who represented coal miners and said that he was working to save their jobs. I got on to the union and asked them. They said that no way-this is right from the top: John Maitland and others· right down to the coalminers in my area-did they support the Prime Minister's view on greenhouse gas emissions. He should stop using that argument. We all know the tragedy that a goods and services tax would be, especially for the lower paid people in Australia. He also talked about selling off government owned assets. Our record is not all that good on that either, so I will not debate that issue. I must say that I have always, even when we were in government, opposed selling off our assets. I am one of the few from this side who is on the public record as standing up in this chamber and opposing what we were doing there. This letter also says the question of Aboriginal reconciliation is being poorly handled by our government---one wonders if it will ever be resolved-and says that the decision to impor.t pork and chicken meat means that our local primary producers will eventually be put out of business. This is just one letter. I am sure that members opposite have received this letter. In future, when those opposite read out their letters we will trot out some of the letters we get that show that everything is not as rosy as the honourable member for Cowan would have us believe. (Time expired)",50
36,Mr NUGENT,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"I think the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) gave a spirited defence of the former government. Considering the damage that they did to this country over a lengthy period of time, I think it took a lot of courage for him to stand up and make some of those statements. I would like to deal with a few of the comments that he made. I do not intend to produce a letter; I just want to calmly deal with a few of the facts of life. I also caught a few of the remarks earlier on by the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe). There is a fairly consistent theme emerging from the other side in this debate. They conveniently forget the damage that they did in government. The legacy that they left was not just left to this government; it was also imposed on the people of Australia-a very poor legacy it is, too. They have jumped from that situation, glossed over the unfortunate damage that they did and started berating us for not having fixed all those ills in 19 or 20 months in government. For example, the member for Maribyrnong talked about growth and unemployment, and the fact that he did not think there was any commitment from this side to fix unemployment. On that subject, I remind the House that the previous government ran very high unemployment rates for very many years and tried all sorts of programs, special initiatives, and special legislation, spent literally billions dollars on special unemployment programs and so on, and still were unable to fix the problem. Although the unemployment rate today obviously remains at a totally unacceptably high level and is something that does cause all of us concern and that we all are trying to find ways to deal with, to suggest that that is something that has occurred under us or that could be fixed very quickly under us is, frankly, very hypocritical, given that after 13 years the previous government was not able to fix the unemployment problem in general and the youth unemployment problem in particular. The member for Throsby, who has just been speaking, raised a number of points. He also went down the route of unemployment, and particularly youth unemployment. He talked about the impact of some of the things that we have done. He talked about the way we have remodelled some of the services out there in the community. Mr Hollis-The member for Cowan said that, not me.",53
37,Mr NUGENT,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"The member for Throsby us-d the word 'remodelling', so I quote his own words. The point that I want to make is that I think there is a fundamental truth that the gentleman opposite needs to understand. You get to the point-and we saw it at a federal level; and I come from Victoria, and certainly saw it with the last Labor government in Victoria-that you can get into debt for a certain period of time, but you cannot just keep running up the bill forever and ever. Two things happen. One is that you have to pay interest on your borrowings, and that becomes a larger and larger proportion of your recurrent expenditure, which therefore means that the amount of disposable money you have to spend on services diminishes. The second thing is that if your debt gets too high those from whom you have borrowed the money will actually move in and will not give you the freedom and the flexibility to sort out your own problem; they will impose solutions. What happened with the previous government is that they were getting increasingly of into debt. So when we came to government less than two years ago, we inherited a very adverse financial situation. Therefore, it is important on a national scale as well as in our own home budgeting-and I think everybody can relate to home budgeting-that if you are living beyond your means ultimately there comes a point in time when you have to take some fairly drastic action. This government had to take that action. I notice that unfortunately the honourable member for Throsby, who was making so many complaints, has not stayed around in the chamber to listen to the response to what he had to say. Of course, we know that it is pretty unpalatable from the opposition point of view. The reality was that we inherited a $10 billion shortfall in the government's budget and we have had to try to put that right. Nobody suggests at all that that has been without pain. Of course, it has been painful. It has been painful in a number of areas of government expenditure. And a lot of the decisions that we have had to make have often been a choice between two unpalatable options. Sometimes it is a question of doing less damage in one area than you might do in another area. But of course we have felt pain. I also draw the parallel I mentioned earlier of the situation in Victoria. The Kennett government, before the Howard government, had to undertake a similar exercise in terms of the Victorian economy. And Victoria is now very much getting back on their feet. They have paid off much of the debt and are able to now start to spend some more money in the services area of education, health, and so on. So they are getting back on their feet. Clearly, that is the route that the federal national government has to undertake. It is no good the other side talking about what we have done to child care or what we might have done to health or education or complaining about any of those other areas. The reality of life is that they had 13 years government to put all those things into place. And had there been a paid for, effective, operating set of systems in those areas when we came to government, then there would have been no need for us to take the painful action that we have had to take. So it seems to me that if they could not fix those problems in 13 years they are really speaking with forked tongue or, at the most charitable, with tongue in cheek, in standing here and complaining that we have not fixed the unemployment problem or that we had to take some of these strong measures in a relatively brief period of government. Like the Queen Mary or any other large ship or tanker, if you are sailing along in a particular direction, you cannot just change direction very quickly; it does take time for these matters to work through. We would all like to see it happen a lot more quickly. We would all like to see improvements occur without any pain. But the reality is that we have to deal in the real world and not in the wishful thinking world. The member for Throsby talked about small business. He complained about the fact that there were still small businesses going bust. As I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know many other members of this chamber will be aware, small businesses go bust on an ongoing basis. To say that there are a few small businesses going bust today is in itself obviously regrettable in the individual cases, but it does not actually mean a thing in termS of looking at what the government has done. The reality is that small businesses were going bust at a far greater rate under the previous government than they are under this government. In fact, this government has introduced a number of measures that have helped small business very significantly. I was very disappointed when the member for Throsby talked about small business. One of the things that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology did recently was to conduct an inquiry into the operation of small business, which looked at predatory practices of large companies against small companies, in retail tenancies and a whole range of other issues that are of critical importance to small business. That inquiry received a lot of input from small business. When its recommendations were published they were lauded by the whole small business sector and all their spokesmen. This government picked up those recommendations and not only implemented them fully but in some areas went even further. Again, the whole small business sector stood up and applauded what this government has done. And that was on top of earlier measures that we had taken in terms of capital gains tax-measures aimed at helping small business. Of course, there are always problems out there. Nobody is suggesting that the small business climate is perfect, but the reality is that this government has done a great number of things for small business. It was interesting that the member for Throsby talked about Medicare. He said that this government is 'trying to destroy Medicare by 1,000 stabs'. That is not the case. We have not, in any shape or form, tried to destroy Medicare. In fact, closing the odd Medicare office is often a matter of prudent administration when you decide to open an office here or close an office there. Obviously cost factors and population shift come into it, and clearly, on an ongoing basis, offices will be closed from time to time and new offices will be opened. It seems to me that whether you have got a Medicare office or not is not the core of whether you are destroying Medicare. Medicare is about delivering medical and hospital services to people. We are not talking about the administration. If the strongest point the member for Throsby can make is that we have closed some Medicare offices, he has not got much to complain about at all. What the member for Throsby did not mention was that in the 13 years of the previous government there had been a very considerable degradation of medical facilities available to people in this country, particularly in the private health sector where, under the previous government, we saw participation in private health insurance drop from around 70 per cent down to around 32 or 33 per cent. What that meant was that those people not only. were taken out of the private health area, which left a number of facilities underutilised, but then went on to the public health system which, in tum, put huge stresses and strains on the public health system. That has caused much more damage to the health system in this country than our closing a few Medicare offices around the trapsThe member for Throsby also talked about waterfront reform. He painted a graphic picture about us wanting to take out people from the waterfront, line them up and do terrible things to them. That is not what the argument is about at all. He said that they were lean and mean, there had been a lot of reform and we were performing much better on the waterfront. I agree with him. We are performing much better on the waterfront. He also talked about the problem of people not collecting their goods, resulting in the goods being left for three days on the wharf, and said that perhaps we should do something about that. I agree with that. The reality of life is that, although we have improved handling on the waterfront-let us talk about handling on the waterfront: the loading and unloading of ships and so on-in the last few years, and there is no argument about that, we function in an internationally competitive environment. What we have done on the waterfront has been an improvement, but it has not been a sufficient improvement. Five years ago on the Melbourne waterfrontand Melbourne is one of the largest ports around the traps in our neck of the woodswe were handling something like 11 containers an hour. That figure, up until a couple of years ago, had improved to about 25 or 26 containers an hour-a significant improvement. The trouble is that if you look at Singapore, which is one of our competitors, five years ago they were already handling 20 or 21 containers an hour. We are up to 25, but they are now at 45 and so, in relative terms, in competitive terms, we have gone backwards. That is why people on this side of the chamber are talking about the need to improve our performance on the waterfront. It does not matter how effective and efficient our manufacturers or our road transport systems are if, when goods get to the waterfront, the costsand we are talking about cost of ultimately delivering to the customer overseas-of slow handling, of getting things through, of the number of employees needed to handle a particular container load and so on are uncompetitive with our overseas rivals. It has been well established in the waterfront area that because of the handling costs and often because of other transport problems as well you can often produce goods in America or Japan, ship them here and quite frequently land them at a price that is much more competitive. I think the member for Throsby really does have to look very hard at the realities of life. It is not just measuring where we were before; you have to look at where we are with the rest of the world. In debating this Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1997-98, the Appropriation Bill (No.4) 199798 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1997-98, it is important that we look at the broad sweep of economic activity. Obviously, any specific proposals that are brought to this chamber have to be looked at in the context of the overall state of the economy. It seems to me that there are a couple of perspectives: you can look at it from a broad national perspective or you can look at how it affects people on the ground. I am not one of those who says, 'Let's just get the gross numbers right.' Let us look at how it affects people on the ground. My electorate of Aston is in· the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne, about 30 kilometres due east of the centre of the city. The profile of my electorate is overwhelmingly young, with lots of young families, lots of small business, very few public servantsinterestingly enough-and not many older people. We have more mortgage payers than any other electorate in the country. In other words, my electorate is the mortgage belt of Australia. This government has done a number of very significant things in a short period of timewe have not fixed everything; we have a long way to go and we are the first to say thatfor people who live in my electorate, which is typical of many suburban electorates around the country and typical of middle Australia. We obviously have had to work hard to put the budget in surplus, which will happen in the next budget year, and then we will be in a position to be a bit more generous with a few things. There has been some pain with that but, because of this prudent financial approach, we are in the fortunate position where we have got not only zero inflation but also interest rates down to the lowest level in living memory for most of the people who live in my electorate. When I was elected to this chamber in 1990, home interest rates in my electorate were around 16 or 17 per cent and small business interest rates were 22 or 23 per cent. Today home interest rates are, as we all know, around the six per cent mark and business interest rates are a bit higher. For people in my electorate who are buying their homes-and I might add that per capita incomes in my electorate are not particularly high but household incomes are quite high, which tells you that both husband and wife are working because they have had to pay off those big mortgages-the decline in interest rates means a saving of several hundred dollars a month. That is a significant and very specific benefit brought to the people of my electorate and many other parts of Australia by the responsible fiscal management of this government. We have achieved in less than two years something that the previous government could not do in 13 years. So I frankly find it pretty hollow when people stand up on the other side and complain about what we are doing. We have started to deliver a number of the things that are very important. I might also mention that, in terms of people on the ground, we all remember a previous Prime Minister from the other side and his infamous l-a-w tax cuts which never occurred. This government went to the last election campaigning on giving a family tax package-a series of tax cuts-which we delivered within 12 months of coming to government. We put it in our first budget, they were paid on the 1 January, and people have had those benefits in their pocket. Those are two very simple, straightforward examples of where this government's financial policy has been very successful. Of course, there are other things we need to do. My time is running out and I have not got time to go into a whole range of other issues, but I want to conclude by saying that I commend these particular bills to the House. We need to remember they are just a micro-part of a broader scenario wlti.ch is delivering benefits to people in Australia. (Time expired)",54
38,Mr ANDREN,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"I take great pleasure in following the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), one of those in this House who is prepared to speak out on matters of fairness and justice, and I listened with great interest to his comments. I realise he strongly supports the government's economic policies, but I suspect he may have a struggle at times with defending the economic rationalist philosophy. He is a person for whom I have a great deal of time and respect. One of the most disturbing political news stories to emerge over the past week would have to be the decision by the National Party to scale down its national headquarters here in Canberra. I say this in the context of these bills, the Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1997-98, the Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1997-98 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1997-98. I am trying to set out the fact that, whatever this government and the one before might do in an economic sense, I believe they are being driven by a theory about economic performance which is perhaps getting the bottom line right and delivering growth in one sense, but it is not having the desired impact on, or the return for, regional Australia. I think patience is running out in the regions, and I want to raise a few issues which I think the government and the opposition could well take on board in framing their policies down the track. I think there needs to be a softening. That is not to say that you give away the bottom line economics, but the equation needs to include something that I call 'social economics'-not socialism. I think we are lacking that and, in doing so, we are missing the point and letting down a lot of people out there. According to the reports, the decision to close down the national headquarters of the National Party was taken because membership of the party has fallen off dramatically. It gives me no great pleasure to draw attention to the fact that I think the reason why the National Party is losing members is that so many people in rural and regional Australia are suffering. After 13 years of Labor in government, the people of rural and regional Australia had very high expectations of this government when they overwhelmingly voted in support of the coalition in last year's election. But, where they believed there was a viable option, they took out an insurance policy and gave support to Independents-we can all debate the wisdom of that, I suppose-and strong support to the options that were available in the Senate. The National Party's membership crisis is a clear illustration that people's expectations have not been met. It is fair to say there are many reasons. Perhaps some people's expectations were too high. Politics is, by its very nature, a field of endeavour where you cannot please all the people all the time. I think it is fair to say that the gulf between the major cities and rural Australia has continued to widen in the last 20 months. The sandstone curtain, as I call the Blue Mountains, separating my electorate from Sydney has grown even higher it seems. When I came to this place last year, in my first speech I highlighted many of the problems facing people in rural and regional Australia. I said how I felt I was elected because there was so much disillusionment with the major political parties that when given a credible choice of candidates who were not part of the system voters were happy to take a gamble with an independent. Certainly the recent South Australian election and the last by-election in Victoria have demonstrated that that trend has not changed since the federal election in March 1996. I cannot ever recall a period in my life when I have heard so many people decry what they see as a lack of leadership in this country. That is probably very unfair to the current government in some regards because right around the world we are seeing the difficulties people are having in coming to terms with the internationalisation and the globalisation of their economies and the trade liberalisation programs, where, in the case of many Australian farmers, they are not seeing the sort of return they were led to expect would be there nor do they see it happening at any point further down the track. Now we see the partial collapse of some Asian economies or at least extensive difficulties in their economies. We see a devaluation of their particular currencies. We now have the prospect of even cheaper imports from. those markets that we are battling to contend with, with their current protection regimes. With the problems that are being demonstrated in the Asian economies at the moment there are people out there who are perhaps a bit unsophisticated in their economic understanding but who see more danger signals on top of those that have been piling up over the past couple of years and the past few months and they are saying that the situation is looking even worse for us. Not only are we having to prop up-and I have no difficulty with propping up these economies because therein lies our future market potential-but they see further danger signs ahead and they say, 'What are we sacrificing in the interests of trade liberalisation and when will we derive our benefit?' It is a very difficult job for the government to sell these policies. There also seems to be a misunderstanding by this government that getting the bottom line right is enough on its own. Social economics is not part of the equation. What is the cost of not putting more money into, say, our rail infrastructure? What is the cost of not having heavy freight on rail instead of on roads where we are using our scarce road dollars to chase the heavy transports along inadequate routes to repair and restore them? If we again made some sort of public commitment to our rail infrastructure we could then privatise to the point of offering a fair access rate to the people who would use that rail network. I have said before that TNT have told me that they would access the main western line but for the Carr government's access charges. They are a factor of four or five out of the ballpark. This just does not make sense. It seems the Carr government wants a return to the user pays principle without any consideration of the down side of not offering that infrastructure at a reasonable rate and what it is costing in terms of road damage. That is just one example. The other part of social economics is the cost of not providing a proper public service out there in the bush so that people, many of whom are ageing, can rapidly access real people. I notice that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) has taken steps to remedy this in his area by training people in Orange and Oberon to provide veteran services. There is a real feeling out there amongst not just the older people in the bush that they cannot cope with a lot of technology such as the 1800 numbers and more and more they need people on the ground to talk to. There is one financial information service officer to service the whole Bathurst-Orange-Oberon district at a time when there are all of these changes to aged care deli very, general welfare deli very , the youth allowance and Austudy. All these things require people sitting down one on one, looking at particular circumstances and working it out. The people who are there are overworked. They cannot make enough appointments. They need more assistance, It is a cost to the bottom line, but it is certainly not a cost in terms of delivering services to the electorate. We have had three to four per cent economic growth without any improvement in the unemployment figures, particularly in the regions. We are dealing with an electorate which is highly intelligent and volatile. They know they had services before. They know they enjoyed a standard of living before. Why things have changed, particularly economic theories, has not been properly understood. I had someone ring me the other day and say, 'Why is the Prime Minister advocating foreign takeovers of one our major banks or foreign investment in our banking system? Wouldn't it be better if we maintained control of that ourselves?' The internationalisation and deregulation of the financial market has not been explained. It has been done at a level of debate above which the general population can't climb let alone partake in. It is very obvious that. all of these things come to bear in the city of Lithgow-a very resilient place, battered by all the forces of economic rationalism, downsizing, bank privatisation, withdrawal of services and so on. It is a regional centre that has copped it all over the last little while. Still it is fighting back. Only yesterday, the city suffered yet another blow with the closure of the Berlei bra factory after 50 years of operation. On the news last night we did not see them sitting glumly, we saw them painting faces on their staff and playing around-enjoying the last moment together, rather than, necessarily, saying, 'Woe are we.' But woe certainly are they because for most of those women that was their family's sole source of income. They cannot just up and move into the city, over the mountains and look for other work. Many of them, if they are not sole parents, are the wives of people in the coal mining industry500 of whom, out of a work force of 1,500, will have lost their jobs by August next year. Lithgow is the town where Ben Chifley is still held in such high regard that his portrait takes centre place in the city council chambers,with the Duke and the Queen about six inches lower on either side. There is a certain symbolism in their appreciation of what Ben stood for. Ben's policies of nationalisation may be well out of date by now, but his belief in the benign hand of government in the economy should certainly not be out of date. That is what is lacking in the economic theories that are part of these appropriation bills and the economic policies of this and the previous government. I notice, though, that the opposition is starting to deal with these issues. They are not easy ones, I know. You cannot tum back the clock. We cannot pull up the drawbridge-as my colleague the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) might want to dobut we can certainly listen and explain a lot more than we are at the moment. Lithgow, for instance, was the strongest Labor voting area in NSW, but today the people of Lithgow are not as loyal as they once were. They are willing to swing their votes if they are not offered better alternatives. Despite the battering the city has ped, there are still people in Lithgow with a lot more vision than you will find in Canberra amongst the people advising. I recently met with local union officials to discuss the problems facing the coal industry. As I said, 500 coal mining jobs out of 1,500 will be gone by August of next year. International coal mining companies do not give a stuff about the welfare of their workers. They see them merely as units of labour. With international prices for coal now so low-the 'great' Australian, BHP, has gone out into the spot market and got contracts at $26 a tonne; it costs $17 a tonne to get the coal from the western fields onto the boat at Port Kemblathere is no margin there. I am not blaming one particular foreign operator for that. You cannot use that excuse. I believe there is a policy at work here to batter the unions into submission. Some of them need a bit of a clout around the ears about some of their work practices, but coal mining is a filthy, dangerous job. They are up to their waists in water sometimes. The western field is underground. It is fraught with dangers. We have had tragedies within the last 10 years in that area. Unfortunately, we will probably see more. But those people are prepared to go down there, as their fathers did, and dig out coal. They do not get a huge reward for that, but they certainly require some sort of return of faith from their employer, which they are not getting in many cases. Having spoken to the coal industry unions, I can assure the Prime Minister that these workers are well aware of the debate over the greenhouse gas targets. They are not sticking their head in the coal, in the ground or in the mine and saying, 'We do not want to know about it.' They realise that we cannot keep digging black rock out of the ground and burning it forever. We have to look at alternatives. Likewise, farmers in my electorate have been absolutely dumbfounded by this government's decision to cut off support for - he emerging ethanol fuel industry. It was killed off with the ethanol bounty system that was to deliver $21 million by the year 2000 cop- to get what was developing into a very feasible industry under way. The Manildra group and CSR have had to can that operation. What do we get in its place? A program worth a couple of million dollars for an ethanol pilot plant. They had the dashed things going, and we canned it. What commitment is there to any sort of alternative energy policy? I have had a suggestion from fanners out in the Mudgee area for carbon trading. Why are we not pushing that harder? Are we going to push it at Kyoto? There is potential for trading carbon world wide. We are in a prime position to be planting the trees for the carbon sinks that can develop income streams for farmers-I am not talking about harvesting trees; I am talking about measuring the carbon uptake and issuing certificates. They become tradeable commodities on the Australian or the world market as a trade-off for carbon dioxide emissions. That is perhaps what we should be looking at so we can trade off our emissions without any helter-skelter rush to reduce our emissions, costing jobs. Jobs will be created in the alternative energy industry if we do it creatively. Why do we not put more money and support into research into alternative energies alongside those greenhouse emission industries-the coal fired power industry and the coal mining industry, in areas like the Bowen Basin of Queensland. Let those areas become the areas for research programs into wind and solar energy so the people involved in the carbon creating industries can see, developing alongside them, the alternative that will, inevitably, be the source of energy that we will have to adopt. Then they can see that there can be jobs created-it is not just killing off their industry-and it will not become a political short-term problem about votes next time. I have votes down there in the coal ing industry too. It would be safe for me to ,stand up here and say, 'Let's protect the coal mining industries-all. of those jobs.' But I am prepared to stick my neck out, and so are the coal unions, to open up the debate without just hiding behind the fear of lost voting opportunities that might be out there. That is such a short-sighted vision. Parliament is three years. If we have a double dissolution, for heaven's sake, it might only be two. Let us not even contemplate that. Again, with a little bit of explanation and debate about native title, people in my electorate are understanding what it is all about. They might not necessarily agree with my point of view, but they are certainly better educated about it, and I cannot recall one complaint in the last six months about native title. On the contrary, it has been a very supportive electorate for the principles of delivering to our indigenous people a true native title that means something-not freehold, but something that offers them something to work with down the track with perhaps negotiation for commercial gain at some point. Recognition of native title is what they basically require and my electorate is supporting that. Having said that, I support these bills with a warning that you have to get a little more of the social economics into the equation. (Time expired)",57
39,Mr TAYLOR,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"Groom) (1.31 p.m.)Before the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) leaves the chamber, I would like to thank him for what was a very balanced, perceptive and intuitive insight into the way many people out there see the contemporary issues that face us at the moment. That is not to say that I agree with everything he said, particularly some of his economic theories. Nevertheless, I think his contribution today reinforces a view that this chamber is the richer for having some independent thought. On that point, I am very pleased that he differentiated his views-and this would be the case with the views of the members for Moore (Mr Filing) and Curtin (Mr Rocher)from the more extreme partisan views of the members for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and Oxley (Ms Hanson). I thank him for a balmin- anced contribution to this debate. Appropriation Bill (No.3) mentions a $111,121,000 allocation of appropriations to the Department of Defence. Of that, a little over $88 million is for equipment and stores. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) made the point that this appropriation was for high priority logistic items, including spares and equipment repair activities. One thing that does frustrate and disappoint me at times in this place-and indeed as I look at the record of the other place-is the degree to which national security and strategic issues are not debated comprehensively. There are but a handful of people in this place and in the other who attempt to address some of these issues. I am not being unduly critical, because there are, in some people's views, more important portfolio, public policy issues that need to be addressed. I am very pleased that the opposition spokesman for defence, the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), is here because I am about to talk about defence. I also congratulate him on some of his balanced views, although I do not agree with him all the time, either. Nevertheless, as the opposition spokesman, he provides a balanced view on government policy and undoubtedly at times disagrees with that policy. What I want to do in the time available to me today is talk a little about defence funding generally, the defence efficiency review-one of the commendable initiatives of the present Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan)-and the ongoing defence reform program. Finally, I will relate back to my comments in terms of the defence logistic expenditure and the item in Appropriation Bill (No.3) and talk a little about the Australian National Audit Office report No.5, which was highly critical of the performance management of the defence industry. Assessing the level of funding required for the defence of Australia is a complex and challenging task. It involves judgments about likely political, diplomatic, economic and industrial trends, it involves developments in our increasingly sophisticated and uncertain regional security environment, and it involves the rate of advance of technology and the changing nature of warfare. It also involves careful assessments about the level of assurance required by, or conversely the level of risk likely to be acceptable to, the Australian government and the community in the provision of their defence. Government policy is to assure the promotion of Australia's security and the protection of its people and interests through the development and the maintenance of the self-reliant capability to defeat any use or threat of armed force against Australia. It is important to note that capability is the combination of force structure and its preparedness and encompasses equipment, trained people to operate that equipment, facilities and the total support required to operate efficiently and effectively. Preparedness comprises readiness, which is the ability of forces to carry out operations within specified time frames, and also sustainability, which is the support required, including personnel aspects, consumables and the maintenance of systems to sustain operations for specified periods. Defence funding has traditionally been measured in terms of the proportion of the nation's or the government's resources allocated to defence. The 1997-98 budget of a little over $10.4 billion represents 1.9 per of gross domestic product and 8.2 per cent of Commonwealth outlays. These proportions have declined over the last decade, from 2.6 per cent and nine per cent respectively in 1986-87. In comparison, the proportion of Commonwealth outlays for health, social security and education has grown from 12 to 16.3 per cent, 27.2 to 40.1 per cent and 6.8 to 8.2 per cent respectively over the same period, and the percentage of GDP for each department has also grown over this period. Put another way, defence funding has been reduced in real terms in recent years by 0.75 per cent in 1993-94, 0.5 per cent in 1994-95, 0.5 per cent in 1995-96 and again 0.5 per cent in 1996-97. This represents an ongoing reduction of some $230 million per annum compared with pre 1993-94 levels. For the period 1997-98 to 1999-2000, defence funding is planned to remain constant at zero per cent real growth. Given anticipated growth in GDP, defence outlays are forecast to be 1.8 per cent of GDP at the end of this period. Whilst percentages of GDP or overall Commonwealth outlays provide useful measures of trends in spending-for example, these figures demonstrate that there has been a relative decline in Australia's spending on defence compared with the major areas of Commonwealth outlays-they do not provide an objective b\lsis for the amount of funding that should be provided to a specific function. For example, much depends on the movement in GDP itself. Australia's GDP has grown in real terms from 1986-87 to 1996-97 by some 33 per cent. If defence outlays had remained at 2.6 per cent of GDP, as they were in those earlier dates, the 1997-98 defence outlays would have been a little over $14.2 billion, and I compare that with the $10.4 billion that is included in the 1997-98 appropriations. However, the level of funding for defence needs to be determined not on the basis of share of GDP, but rather on the basis of overall government objectives in terms of fiscal policy, a realistic assessment of the resources that government will be able to allocate to defence, the strategic environment and the task to be achieved in the defence area. To achieve an acceptable level of risk cent necessitates a balance between defence tasks and resources. Should the resources required to achieve the task not be available, the level of risk will of course increase. The government and the Australian community rightly expect Defence to use its funding wisely. The government must also ensure that full value is being achieved for the resources allocated to defence-that is, that existing resources are being used in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Turning quickly to the defence efficiency review and the defence reform program, I wish to refer specifically to excerpts from a couple of speeches the Minister for Defence gave a few months ago and highlight one or two points he made. About six months ago in one of those speeches he said: The reasons why the Government embarked on the Defence Reform Program are, in fact, very simple. He went on to say: Prior to the Efficiency Review, the Defence Organisation was not many years away from facing a severe budget crisis brought on by a need to replace ageing equipment reaching block obsolescence. The problem would have peaked after the turn of the century, when our need to address that block obsolescence for major equipment across the services far exceeded the levels of resources likely to be available. He went on to say: The Defence Department was drifting towards a point where the only choice was to cut capability. In fact, that was no realistic choice at all. Defence had been making reforms designed to bring in savings. But the Commercial Support Programand a very commendable programand a number of other initiatives were not producing enough to solve the problem. As he said: The Defence Efficiency Review aimed to change how we do business to prevent us cutting military capabilities not many years from now. He also went on in that same speech to differentiate between the defence efficiency review and the strategic review, and I hope we will hear a little more on the latter in the ministerial statement from the Minister for Defence which, I understand, could be as early as next week. He said: Some commentators have said that we got the Efficiency Review and the Strategic Review the wrong way around. I have to say privately that I was one of those; I thought at the time that we did get them back to front. He went on to say: They are wrong. And I think he is right. In hindsight, I think the order was about right. As he said: The DER was not about-and was never intended to be about-setting strategic and spending priorities. That will come with the Strategic Review, which I put in train well before the DER. The Strategic Review will set the directions, equipment and capability priorities for the future. And it will be completed before the Reform Program starts to free resources. We wait with interest to see what he mayor may not have to say on that sometime next week. In a second speech about a month later, the minister went into much greater detail, and I really do not have time to do that today. He talked about the specific measures under the defence refonn program in tenns of policy and strategic guidance, in tenns of the acquisition programs and in terms of relations with industry. He said: ... we see it largely as a task for the private sector to determine how they will structure themselves to supply our needs. Competition for Defence business encourages not only engineering excellence but also innovative investment, calculated risk taking, and more sophisticated arrangements for out sourcing and finance. The record of Government ownership of defence industries around the world shows that public sector ownership is not an efficient way to buy equipment. We also await the results, particularly, of the Australian Defence Industries sale and what that may bring, both for AD! and indeed for the nation. He talked about science and technology initiatives and facilities initiatives. In tenns of this Appropriation Bill (No.3), he talked about logistic support. He said: Currently. over 21,000 uniformed and civilian personnel work providing logistics and administrative support at a cost of some $3.5 billion a year. He talked in some detail about the creation of a joint support command and some measures taken in tenns of the improvement of knowledge regarding what inventories the Defence Force needs to hold and what is actually in stock. He also talked about personnel management measures and the personnel executive. I hope, from a personal viewpoint, that there will be some further rationalisation as the reform program proceeds, particularly in tenns of training and education, where I think there is more scope for rationalisation and, therefore, savings. He finished by talking about the management of information, information system management and an administrative support executive. The upshot of all that was that we will find one-off savings of over $500 million from the rationalisation of defence facilities and stockholdings, mature annual savings of over $700 million, and targeted annual savings of $1,000 million or 10 per cent of total expenditure. The bulk of the savings will be achieved over four years from the elimination of duplication; a reduction, unfortunately, of 4,700 or eight per cent of military positions; a reduction of 3,100 or 15 per cent of civilian positions; and a further 12,900 positions to be subject to market testing. There are a number of other initiatives that I do not have time to go into. That leads me to the final point in terms of logistics-the report from the Auditor-General, Audit Report No.5, which was tabled last month, in which there was some substantial criticism of the performance management of the defence industry. I will quote one or two excerpts from the brief overview, in which it is stated: The current Defence inventory of spares, consumables and repairable items (excluding explosive ordnance) is valued at approximately $3.9b, with $lb expended annually on further procurement and the maintenance of repairable items by external contractors. Defence holds stocks of these items primarily to ensure their availability in support of ADF requirements. In some cases, this has meant procurement of sufficient stocks to maintain equipment to the end of its forecast working life. Retirement of equipment by other countries has also created opportunities to purchase bulk stores at low cost. Referring to the DER, the defence efficiency review, it said: The Defence Efficiency Review (DER) highlighted that there are significant opportunities to improve the management of Defence inventory. The DER logistic review team concluded that current levels of operating stocks are far too high. This was con.sidered to reflect a 'just in case' cultureas distinct from 'just in time'which had been exacerbated by a poor, disjointed and unresponsive distribution system. It went on to say: Defence has now embarked on the Defence Reform Programthe DRP that I have just referred toon the basis of the DER findings and recommendations. This includes a strategic logistics planning process. The ANAO considers that an important element in the implementation of that planning would be an effective performance management strategy and framework that enables both its effectiveness and efficiency to be measured and to be managed. The absence of such a framework has contributed to many of the inefficiencies in inventory management identified by the DER. It went on to say: In summary, the ANAO found that, despite increased focus in this area in recent years, performance management practices used in regard to the Defence supply chain do not reflect best practice. That concerns me, of course, because before I came into the parliament I was the Director General of Supply within navy. The audit report continues: As a result, managers are not provided with adequate information or incentives to ensure decisions are based upon consideration of the efficiency and effectiveness of the total supply' chain. It ended by saying: The ANAO estimated that even a five per cent reduction in the current stock levels of spares, consumables and repairable items could yield annual savings in inventory carrying costs of at least $23m and a potential one-time capital release of $197m. In the ANAO's view, this is the minimum possible outcome thilt could be delivered. It then makes those firm recommendations. I understand that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts will automatically look at this report and report back to the parliament and to ministers. I feel sure that the Minister for Defence would see this as a positive step forward-a critical but nevertheless positive step forward-in optimising our defence budgetary output. I commend the ministers, including the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Mrs Bishop, for the initiatives in these areas. I look forward to the initiatives being proven over the next 12 months to two to three years. I commend these bills to the House.",61
40,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS,"The appropriation legislation before the House today presents us with an opportunity to discuss matters of major national importance. Before I discuss the matter that I particularly want to refer to, I point out that we have sat through weeks and weeks of government blustering and high-wire performances. We have got a Treasurer (Mr Costello) who claims the credit for low inflation and low interest rates. We have had this absolute nonsense about deficits and the whole spectre of fearmongering which has done enormous damage to our economy in terms of public confidence. While all this has been going on, while that charade has been played out, the government has been presiding over a m.ajor national disaster. It does not even know It to date, despite the fact that it has had a report on the matter for more than two months. I am referring, Mr Deputy Speaker, to our exports of iron ore, iron and steel. You will recall that this matter was discussed in the parliament last year and there has been an ongoing discussion about that matter. The government's response to this, as to so many other matters, is that it is none of its business; that the government has no real role in iron ore exports-whether we export metal or ore or whether we do it or someone else does it. That attitude has been so transparent that it is now obvious. Back in mid-September, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) presented to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) a report on the Australian iron and steel industry by an ad hoc committee which comprised members from both sides of parliament. It is a very useful report, even though some of us disagree with many parts of it, because it represents the first full lation of the activities of the Australian iron and steel industry, as well as putting the matter in an international context. When the report was put forward, there was a request to the minister for it to be tabled in this place so that it would become the property of the parliament, which would allow all of us to debate those issues contained within it. It is now two months later. I wrote to the minister again last week, asking him whether he was going to table it and, to date, I am still awaiting an answer. The fact is that for two months he has had a report on a major national issue which he has chosen not to bring to the parliament and, what is more, he has not responded to it, either. There has been no comment from the minister; even though he made it available publicly, there has been no government response. We are talking about an industry which is of major consequence. In speaking to the report, I point out that the committee was not a parliamentary committee, therefore it had no resources. We are appreciative of the fact that departmental staff did provide some back-up, and that was extremely helpful. I personally made a request, as did the parliamentary committee back in September last year, to the minister for a parliamentary inquiry. That was refused. The government refused to allow us to conduct a normal parliamentary inquiry and we ended up instead with a watered down version of a committee of parliamentarians, which lacked both the resources and the authority to conduct a full-scale inquiry. Despite that, some members of the committee worked very hard. I appreciate the efforts of the chairman, the member for Wannon. In recent weeks, we have seen letters to the local media in the Hunter from the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), claiming what a wonderful report it is. Unfortunately, the member for Paterson did not attend the last four meetings; in fact, he never got involved in the report discussion at all. I think he is becoming known as the 'fatuous phantom for Paterson' because with regard to the committees he is involved in-small business, iron and steel-he did not bother to compi- show up for most of the meetings. That is rather unfortunate. The report went to the minister, and in the report a number of things are obvious. Firstly, there is the fact that we, as a country, export 130 million tonnes of iron ore a year at an average price of $23 a tonne. We earn .$3 billion a year exporting iron ore. If that was all converted to steel and exported as steel, it would earn $36 billion a year. In other words, there is a $33 billion gap between our ore exports and what we would earn if we were exporting metal. For many of us, that gap has been an issue of major concern for a long time. We see that gap as being resolvable. Aspects of the national balance of payments, aspects of massive national unemployment, would be dramatically addressed by that shift. The report goes to those issues. The unfortunate part about the report in that context is that government members felt constrained by their ideology, if you like, or by government policy of non-intervention, so that the formal recommendations of the committee are very bland. Mind you, they were actionable. Right now, for example, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) could be taking up these matters. I refer, for example, to the recommendation about barriers to exports from Australia. Of course, the country with the worse barriers is America. The fact that companies in America are taking anti-dumping action against BHP has wiped out current steel exports to that country. The government, today at APEC, could be arguing with the Americans, both publicly and privately, about their barriers to our exports to their country. The fact that we are not doing so is indicative of the lack of genuine concern by this government on things that really matter. We hear a lot of bluster about our so-called deficit. We hear a lot of claiming of credit for low inflation and low interest, but where there is a report from their own members regarding a matter on which they could take some action-particularly, for example, the anti-dumping action by Americans against BHPthere is not a word, not a murmur. The fact is that the main recommendations are bland and non-specific. There is a minority report which goes into the iron and steel industry in much more detail, and the issues that confronted BHP both back in 1995 and now. What we have seen in the last eight months is a national disaster. Our biggest and strongest company is melting down in a major way. More importantly, our prospects for exporting more metal rather than ore have evaporated. The report is potentially misleading in that it confuses iron and steel, but the fact is that minority report does point out how that occurred. The issues that are before this parliament and this government with regard to employment, economic growth and the balance of payments could all be very largely affected if we could add more value to our iron ore exports. For all of us, it should be a matter of major priority. The government's failure to table the report, to respond to the report or even to discuss it publicly in any forum, including APEC, indicate to all of us that this government neither understands the problem nor is prepared to even address it. Mr Speaker, I will resume my comments later. In the meantime, I urge all parliamentarians to ask the minister for a copy of this report, and to read it. It is a major matter of concern for this parliament.",64

43,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indeed have indicated that the arrangements that I put in place on 6 November generate a level of capital that I believe will substantially address the needs for capital in the sector, and I have left the door open for the sector to give me more information, which they have not yet been able to do. I find it interesting that you should be the asking this question. This question comes from an opposition that did nothing about the capital needs of the sector. You actually oversaw a decline in the capital provided to the sector. You were the ones who did nothing for four years. Mr Beazley interjecting",66
44,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You were the finance minister. You received advice from Professor Gregory that there was a crisis and a shortfall in capital and you did nothing about it. We put in place a policy to deal with this issue. On 5 November we announced that we were varying that policy, and I announced the new arrangements on 6 November. They are in place, and the sector appreciate the fact that they were put in place the day after the Prime Minister's announcement. I have offered them the opportunity to provide more information to me, and I will welcome that further information. They wanted time to gather that information, partly because the certification process-which is the assessment of the building levels within the nursing homes-has now obviously called into question some of the original Gregory estimates which are now four years old. Native Title",66
45,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. How does the government's 1O-point plan restore certainty for farmers and pastoralists holding pastoral leasehold property across Australia? What would be the implications for Australians, especially those in rural areas, if this 1O-point plan fails to gain the assent of parliament and become law?",67
46,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I preface my remarks by saying that, with some 650 unresolved claims out there, just one has been resolved at a cost in excess of $200 million. There is a degree of uncertainty of a sort that can only be appreciated by the pastoralistsand, for that matter, the miners-who live out there producing wealth, export dollars and jobs for so many Australians. Many of those people face not just a claim but multiple claims. They have no idea what the outcome might be. They do not even have an idea as to when they might know what the outcome might be. It really gets pretty demotivating to face not just the harshness of the environment and the economic stress that many people in the more remote parts of this country face but also, I have to say, the real lack of understanding of some of the armchair critics around the place, very few of whom face any of the uncertainty or the dislocation themselves, and many of whom reassured pastoralists, until quite recently, that the of a lease extinguished native title. It has to be said that it is very easy for critics to attempt to label legislation as racist when it deals with a form of title that by definition can only be held by one racial group. The original Native Title Act was subject to the very same criticism, and that ought to be remembered. The originallegislation was subject to the very same charge, the very same criticism. The fact of the matter, though, is that we are respecting the principles laid down in the Mabo and Wik decisions, and we are not removing common law rights from indigenous Australians. We acknowledge the existence of native title. In broad terms the bill will, amongst other things, achieve these objectives: firstly, it will confirm that native title on freehold, residential and commercial land and on some agricultural leases is extinguished; secondly, it will confirm that the rights of pastoral leaseholders will prevail over those of native title holders; thirdly, it will ensure that pastoralists will be able to carry out any primary production activities permitted under their leases or under government permit, regulation or legislation without any right to negotiate; and, lastly, it will, regardless of any coexisting native title that might be found to exist over the land, be subject to any land management, environmental or other relevant laws and regulation .. In a very important bit of research released yesterday by the National Farmers Federation, it was found that Australians regard agriculture as the country's most important industry. In fact, farming and agriculture was regarded by 46 per cent of respondents as the most important industry in Australia, followed by tourism at 15 per cent, manufacturing at 12 per cent and mining at 10 per cent. I then considered the Morgan poll published in this week's Bulletin on this issue that we are grappling with. It found that by far the largest number of respondents-81 per centagreed with the proposition that farmers should be guaranteed that they can use the land they lease as needed. Mr Tim Fischer-The outcome we delivered.",67
47,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is plainly the issue outcome that the Australian people believe ought to be delivered, it is plainly the outcome that the government believes ought to be delivered and that is what our legislation will secure. Let me issue two challenges. Although the Morgan poll shows strong support for our objectives, it also shows that two-thirds of Australians do not feel that they understand the issues. Surely then contributors to this debate should accept their responsibility to ensure informed, balanced and rational dialogue. I made the comment this morning that some of those who seek to taunt supporters of our approach based on the lO-point plan are in fact in danger of doing the very thing they say would be undesirable: promoting an unhealthy racist debate in this country. Let me pose one final question. As one who represents many Aboriginal people as well as farmers, I want to ask this question: how can reconciliation, which has to involve better relationships between indigenous people and pastoralists where they live cheek by jowl in Australia's real communities, possibly be advanced in the current climate of uncertainty and animosity over this issue? I conclude by making this point: this legislation needs passing because time is not on our side. NA",67
48,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I advise the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Mike Board MLA, Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs; Works; Services; and Youth in the government of Western Australunder is. On behalf of the House, I extend a warm welcome to you. Honourable members----Hear, hear! NA Nursing Homes",68
49,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, given that you are willing to consider the nursing home owners' case for additional funding, does this mean that the government will finally agree torestore the funding that you cut from nursing homes or are you going to increase the size of the annual fee?",68
50,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have already pursuing answered the question in my previous answer. But let me ask you a question: why was it that you took out of the capital for nursing homes more than $150 million in your last four years? Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: ministers are required to answer questions, not ask them. If he is going to be allowed to ask them, can the member for Jagajaga have the opportunity to answer them?",68
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,68
52,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, you took over $150 million out of the sector in your last four years. You did nothing for the capital. Here it is again. Let me remind you of what you did for capital in the sector. You reduced it by 75 per cent. You have done nothing. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: this has nothing to do with the question. Is the fee going to go up as a result of his changes?",68
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,68
54,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has everything to do with the question-the hypocrisy, the confected indignation which you have displayed throughout. How can you ask us about issues with regard to capital? We proposed a scheme. We varied a scheme which protects the family home. The family home is safe our policy. What happened in your . draft policy? There is not a word about a plan in here. There is not a word about capital. All it says is that it will be paid out of consolidated revenue-new taxes. We remember the co-payment on Medicare. You were the architect-new taxes. What are you going to do-capital gains tax on the home? How are you going to fund it? Why don't you start giving answers instead of asking questions which are totally irrelevant? Foreign Policy",68
55,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to the government's success in the comprehensive test ban treaty and the elimination of landmines. Is the minister aware of recent comparisons which highlight the true significance of all these and other foreign policy achievements of the Howard government?,68
56,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I think it is fair to say that two of this government's proudest achievements are in the foreign affairs area. The first of those achievements is the role we played in bringing to fruition the comprehensive test ban treaty. The comprehensive test ban treaty was signed in New York at the United Nations General Assembly in September last year. As members of the House may recall, when this government was the opposition we took a very strong stand against the decision by the then French government to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific. When we got into government we put our money where our mouth was. The House will recall that even President Clinton, the President of the United States, congratulated this government on the role it played in making the nuclear comprehensive test ban treaty a reality. That stands as one of the truly great achievements of this government. Secondly, since this government came to power we have played a leading role internationally in pursuing a global ban on landmines. The culmination of the role we have played will be next week when I go to Ottawa and on behalf of the Australian governmentand I know with the support of the opposition, because they put out a press release to say so-sign the landmines treaty. We have played a very significant role as a government internationally in the field of disarmament. I have to concede that I have flown all through the night from Vancouver. Opposition members-Ah!",69
57,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you for your sympathy. When I arrived at Sydney airport this morning I decided I would browse through the newspapers, and imagine my surprise when I turned to page 7 of the Australian, always an accurate and sensible newspaper",69
58,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,69
59,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Often-well, it was today in any case-and there was a headline 'Keating foreign policy a failure, says Brereton'. I wonder, Gareth, if you read that little headline. I read the article fairly carefully. When I got to my office, I asked my staff if I could have a look at this great speech that had been made by the member for Kingsford-Smith. It did cOme as some surprise to me that the member for Kingsford-Smith described the previous government-in particular he was referring to his deputy leader-as suffering from foreign policy fatigue and referred to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's extraordinary lapse in the way he handled the issue of French nuclear testing. It is clearly the view of the opposition that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has graduated from policy fatigue to relevance deprivation syndrome. To be fair, the Leader of the Opposition, who is after all supposed to lead the opposition, should tell us whose view he shares. Does he share the view of the member for Kingsford-Smith that the previous foreign minister suffered from foreign policy fatigue? Is he one of the critics of his own deputy or is he going to stand by the deputy and bring the shadow minister into line? I think we are entitled to know what is the position of the opposition. You are its leader, so maybe you would like to tell us. In conclusion-I do not want to delay the time of the House too much on this, although I could be tempted-I would like to say that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should do the honest thing by his own reputation and make a personal explanation at the end of this question time and defend himself. I have to say that, in all honesty, I do not very often stick up for the shadow minister for foreign affairs, but this time. I think he got it dead right. Industry Policy",69
60,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Minister, in August this year the Prime Minister promised to respond to the Mortimer report 'shortly'. Last month you told the MTIA: I'm not quite ready yet. Urn, look, you know, you'll have to wait. It's clearly a very big response. The government will respond in due course. Minister, will you now tell the House when you will be announcing a real industry policy for this nation?",69
61,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would anticipate on 'Monday week.,70
62,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. What will be the consequences for Australian business if the government's Native Title Amendment Bill is 'not passed?,70
63,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I would like to begin by quoting a person I regard as ,a great Australian. I refer to Sir Arvi Parbo.",70
64,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He backed away from that.,70
65,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So I understand you . do not regard Sir Arvi Parbo as a great ,Australian, a great migrant, a person who has given service to Western Mining, BHP and beyond, to the community at large and Australia? Sir Arvi Parbo said: Major mineral developments today usually have very long lead times from discovery, let alone the beginning of exploration, to production. Australia should be now discovering the oil bodies which ,will be the main producers 20 to 30 years from ,now. This is not happening. Establishing a clear 'and practical regime for access to prospective land 'for exploration and mining purposes and security of titles is important to the industry but is even 'more important to Australia, The legislation now before the federal parliament would, if passed, meet the majority of the concerns. Industry does face a major challenge with the Wik legislation-the manufacturing industry less so, but obviously 'the mining industry. The September edition of the Delta Electricity ,and Access Economics Investment Monitor shows that 21 projects worth $13.7 billion are subject to Aboriginal land claims. Wik must be passed to ensure that these projects do go ahead without undue delay. It was pointed out in, the Australian today in a joint statement by the Minerals Council, responsibility for which 'was fully accepted by the Minerals Council: We believe itthe Wik legislationwill encourage jobs and investment in Australia by improving certainty and clarity; not just for the mining industry and farmers but also for aborigines. The industry respects aboriginal community values, culture and heritage and provides opportunities for mutually beneficial co-existence, This is reconciliation in practice. This new relationship requires underpinning by legislation. The law must Native Title provide for timely, fair and certain resolution of issues concerning the interaction between native title and other land uses. This is why the 10-point plan legislation now before the Senate should in fact pass the Senate-and the sooner the better for the preservation and expansion of jobs in the Australian economy, Aboriginal jobs and Australian jobs more generally. As the debate unfolds in the Senate, I also draw your attention to the advice of Senator Bob Collins. Senator Bob Collins is not a member of the coalition; Senator Bob Collins is a Northern Territory Labor senator. He has said that we should avoid emotion and we should avoid raising the temperature. He gave advice to his own colleagues and to the parliament that people should think very carefully about their contributions to the debate. What we have seen already over there is Senator Bolkus shooting from the hip; we have seen the term 'racist' falling off the lips of Labor members and senators like confetti at a wedding; we have seen about enough of the gutter-type debate which is taking place in the Senate. I invite the Leader of the Opposition, for the first time in the Wik matter, to exercise a bit of leadership over his Senate team and urge a purposeful way forward with the Wik legislation. Finally, there is the matter of Noel Pearson and his contribution to this debate. Two nights ago on the 7.30 Report he said that all Aboriginal people wanted was access to land for traditional purposes. He put it in terms of collecting some wood to make didgeridoos. When challenged on that and asked about ambit claims-the claims that seek exclusive possession to the exclusion of all others-he said that these claims were 'not very intelligent and not helpful to the native title process' . Yet in claim C0065 lodged a month ago in . Cape York a parcel of land was claimed in an ambit claim which has this clause attachedand I invite members to listen to this. No matter that they are leases in transition where the pastoral leaseholders are still on the leases involved, this is the first clause of claim C0065 lodged by Noel Pearson and other signatories: ... the right to possession of the land, the and the resources and attributes of the lands and waters to the exclusion of all others. It is an area I Y2 times the size of the ACT, an area of 4,000 square kilometres. Here is the claim document.",70
66,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You're a scaremonger!,71
67,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Daryl, you have had it too easy in this debate for too long. We are now going to get the truth out with regard to the outcomes of this legislation which is about providing certainty to Aboriginal people and Australians as a whole. I simply challenge Noel Pearson to remove his signature from that ambit claim if he is going to be consistent on these matters.",71
68,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement when announcing the automotive tariff freeze six months ago. He said: This is a package. If it is amended in any way whole package will be off ... I ask the Senate guarantee immediate passage. Minister, can you confirm that, apart from tariff cuts legislation, the automotive and packages are still not finalised? Will you a guarantee that the full package will be made public and debated in this parliament before the next election?",71
69,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It must have been a big day at the strategy meeting this morning. The government's commitment to the automotive industry is a complete package. It is totally course. We undertook consultations with the industry as it related to export facilitation ensure that it was WTO consistent. Those discussions are well advanced, and the government will have legislation before the House before the next election. Native Title",71
70,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Acting significantly Prime Minister aware of a Western Australian nickel mine project called Yakabindi which has five native title claims claiming such things as mineral rights and exclusive tenure? Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that mediation, as described under the current waters 1993 Native Title Act, has allowed this process to extend over many years, thus effectively vetoing any significant development of the mine, adding uncertainty for overseas investors and ending any immediate development? How. will the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 help sort out this complicated claim process where it seems no'"" one benefits?",71
71,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, there are considerable elements in the legislation which address the particular problem which the member for Cowan raises in respect of the Yakabindi Mine in Western Australia. It is another example of how claims mounting up right across Australia have not been processed successfully under the Labor legislation Tariffs whereas our legislation offers a fair and proper process. There has been just one claim determined in all these years under your legislation. I will offer a wager to this House that, if our legislation passes, under the proper the process provided for in the Wik 10-point plan to. legislation, there will be a large number of claims determined, and they will be deterthe mined fairly. For those who want a bit of TCF extra insurance, the High Court awaits a test give case and no doubt will be exercised with regard to a test case at some future date. All our legislation is going to be subjected to the High Court. In answering the member for Cowan, Western Australia in particular has reached a circumstance where there are claims, counteron claims and overlapping claims-a raft of claims-which put in jeopardy a large number to of mining projects, export projects, the standard of living of Western Australians and, through that, Australia as a whole. I draw your attention to the statement of the President of the Business Council of Australia who said: Continuing land tenure uncertainty detracted from Australia's ability to draw much needed investment. Australia's national development will be in jeopardy until native title issues definitively and effectively resolved. I call for the early passage of the government's bill. I tell the gallery, the House and the nation that our bill is about a fair outcome. It is about allowing farmers to manage their farming lands-whether they are Aboriginal or whatever. It allows mining companies to negotiate in certain circumstances with indigenous people so that mining projects can be developed, jobs created and export efforts sustained to the world. It allows native title to be claimed on 79 per cent of the Australian landmass, no matter that the original Mabo court decision was in respect of the Murray Islands off the mainland of Australia and no matter that the Wik test decision, 4:3, was in respect of two brilliantly selected leases by Professor Reynolds. Full credit: they have played it absolutely brilliantly in selecting two leases which were nonconforming, absolutely non-typical leases and had been deserted for many decades. We are accepting the challenge of getting it right. As soon as the Senate passes the legislation, the sooner we will have more job certainty across Australia. Veterans: Radiation",71
72,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. With regard to the estimated 12,000 Australian personnel who were involuntarily exposed to radiation during the British atomic tests at Monte Bellos, Maralinga and Emu between 1952 and 1963, why have these veterans not received service recognition or ·public recognition? Why cannot these servicemen access benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act hazardous service clause? Why are the names of those who served still secret after all these years?",72
73,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to the forces exposed to radiation that the member referred to in her question, my understanding is that those people exposed to radiation were covered under the Commonwealth's compensation scheme, not under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. If she would like any further answer in relation to that service, I am happy to provide further information, particularly in are relation to the Commonwealth compensation scheme. Veterans: Health Research",72
74,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The minister would be aware of my interest in the welfare of veterans. I would like to ask him how important he considers research to be undertaken in areas directly relevant to the health and well-being of the veteran community. What is the government doing to encourage such research? Minister, are you aware of any other proposals that seek to address the increasing health needs of the veteran community?",72
75,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to thank the member for Mallee because he does have a very strong interest in veterans' issues and is a great advocate for the veteran community, as I know many on this side of the House and many on the other side of the House are. Research into areas of health relevant to the veteran population is extremely important. The needs of veterans and war widows are special and are different as a result of their war service. In addition, their needs continue to change as they age. We as a nation and as a government must ensure that the treatment and the services made available to them are at the cutting edge of medical practice. The government has just allocated something like $468,000 to four research projects covering the areas of the transition of genetic disorders, community nursing, palliative care and the relationship between social isolation and health. These are all very important priority areas for the government in terms of meeting the needs of our veteran community. The most significant of these projects is the research into the links between herbicides used in the Vietnam War and birth defects, particularly spina bifida. The government believes that there is still much to learn about this issue. To move forward we need more research and, as promised, we are funding that research. In relation to the second part of the question, I was wondering whether there would be any interesting proposals put forward by the Labor Party in their statement last week. I was obviously setting the bar a little too What we got from the opposition was just one page-seven dot points, in fact. That is what they think of the veteran community. We had cliches and platitudes. Mr Anderson-Could you understand it?",72
76,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The platitudes rambled on and did not make much sense. Labor said that they would continue with what is already in place-in other words, the programs that we have put in place in relation to research. What they have not done is focus on-what they must focus on-the evolving issue of how to deal with the changing needs of our veteran community. When it comes to costing the opposition's platform, there is nothing to cost. The· approach of the opposition stands in stark contrast to what this government has done. Defence service home loans have been cut as a result of the economically responsible approach we have taken to the economy. Because of this government, an extra 10,500 veterans are now entitled to claim compensation benefits, including for service in Vietnam, the British Occupation Forces, the Far East Strategic Reserve and others. Veterans living in remote regional and rural areas, who were largely neglected under Labor, are now getting their fair share of resources and services. The vocational rehabilitation scheme is about to commence. It is particularly important to our younger veterans. The medication management program is particularly important to those veterans who are at risk from medication misuse. The list goes on and on. In conclusion, the shadow minister recently told a meeting of veterans in relation to Labor's platform, 'There will be very little in respect of veterans.' He exaggerated, because there was nothing. Outworkers",73
77,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Minister, in March last year after axing support for clothing outworkers you promised through your department, 'The government shortly expects to announce the new program delivery arrangements for outworkers.' high. Minister, with 20 months gone and nothing yet delivered, could you explain your definition of 'shortly'? How long will Australia's outworkers have to wait before they see any results?",73
78,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Corio, being the principal pencil writer for the former industry minister Mr Button, should not be commenting too much about the record of the Labor Party . You know that for 13 years you did nothing at all about outsourcing problems within the industry-not a thing. Mr Crean-You cancelled the program, you dill.",73
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham!,73
80,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The government's TCF response quite clearly set out what we proposed to do. Civil Marriage Celebrants Program,73
81,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Attorney General: has the Attorney-General announced a review of the civil marriage celebrants program? Can he outline to the House the reasons for doing so?,73
82,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question and commend him on his long standing interest and commitment to marriage.,73
83,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,73
84,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is some good news. Maybe the members opposite are not aware of the member for Menzies' long standing involvement with marriage guidance and Centacare. The government is committed to ensuring that the community has reasonable access to high quality civil marriage services. As part of a review of the program, I have today released a comprehensive discussion paper covering all aspects of the civil marriage celebrant program. Members would be perhaps surprised to learn of the role of civil marriage celebr-ts today. Just over 20 years ago, the concept was created. There are now some 1,700 civil marriage celebrants around Australia, far short of the number of religious marriage celebrants, who exceed 20,000 in number. Of the more than 100,000 marriages conducted each year, nearly half are now conducted by civil marriage celebrants. Couples should be confident that their wedding day will be one of the most memorable days of their lives. Those who wish to have their marriage conducted by a civil marriage celebrant should be confident that the celebrant is providing a high quality service which meets the couple's needs. The review aims to make the program more relevant to the needs and aspirations of couples marrying and to ensure that civil marriage celebrants are thoroughly professional, sensitive to the wishes and needs of their clients, and committed to marrying couples with dignity. The discussion paper covers matters such as ethics, a code of conduct for civil marriage celebrants, service standards, professional development, training, fees, advertising standards and legal matters. Once the review is completed and implemented, civil marriage celebrants will have an integrated policy framework and clear guidelines within which to operate. Couples in the community, irrespective of where they live , will have access to a choice of high quality civil marriage services. This initiative is a further demonstraWhat tion of the government's determination to uphold and enhance the institution of marriage in Australia.",73
85,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. On Monday, the Acting Prime Minister listed a number of industries given A plus priority for fast-track tariff reduction at APEC. Given your government's plans to automatically cut Australia's automotive and TCF tariffs in 2005, why did you not put these industries on your A plus list to ensure that our competitors keep up to the mark? If it is good enough to fast-track trade liberalisation on toys, jewellery and fish, why will you not do the same for cars and textiles?",74
86,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hotham probably does not know that the auto industry is on the A list, so that comes into the second area. While he is campaigning on this particular area, what is the Labor Party's policy in relation to all this? You would tum it further back. You do not subscribe to trade liberalisation. Your total policy is opposed to it. Mr Crean-Of course we do.",74
87,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is different from what you said before. Mr Crean-Read the policy.,74
88,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is why they call you Cheapjack: you never know where you are. You are over there one day and back here the next.,74
89,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why would people believe you anyway-1993?,74
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor! Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar Network Project,74
91,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Can the minister inform the House of the arrangements which this government has put in place to finalise the JORN project and rectify the inadequate management and oversight of this project by the previous Labor government? are the cost implications for the Department of Defence and the Commonwealth? Mr Wilton interjecting,74
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Tariffs Isaacs.,74
93,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He, like a lot of people on this side of the House at least, has become increasingly concerned as he learnt of the facts relating to the Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar project. In 1991, the then Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, awarded that project to Telstra.",74
94,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What party was that?,74
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor.,74
96,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Telstra was an unproven supplier of defence systems with no track record in Skywave radar at the time.,74
97,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Marconi?,74
98,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, you know the story as to how they finished up. The total approved project cost was $1,116 million in December 1996 prices. Robert Ray, when questioned at Senate estimates in June 1995 as to the completion date, advised the committee that it would be 24 months until the radar was fully operational. Far from being delivered last June, the situation is this: Telstra is now no longer the manager; someone else is the manager. Telstra has had to make provisions for losses of $211 million in 1995-96 and $394 million in 1996-97. Mr Bevis-What about Defence?",74
99,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will tell you that in a minute. That is a total of $605 million at least in losses and provisions, and the project, far from being delivered last June, is now running four years late. So it is not surprising that last December, the First Assistant Secretary, Development and Analysis in the 1980s, Dr Michael Gilligan, told the Joint Committee of Public Accounts: By a series of default decisions ... that had nothing to do with the probability of a successful outcome-we ended up with a combination that really had no experience . . . He also said: ... discipline just fell away in the late 1980s. If you add it all up-this is the figure you wanted-the complete cost of JORN, including additions, is $1,116 million to Defence, which is the proper price, plus $605 million of losses and provisions that your government racked up. That makes a grand total of $1,721 million, which is an overrun of 53 per cent on the original price. My guess is that, if you were able to get into the Telstra books, you would find that it is more than that. Mr Lee-Why didn't you disclose it?",75
100,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is disclosed.,75
101,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They would have been included in the float. Mr Lee interJecting,75
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Dobell.,75
103,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Leader of the Opposition raises the subject, let me say that the member for Kalgoorlie asked that very question only the other day and the Minister for Finance answered the question. It raises the point that maybe it was not $14 billion! but more if you had not racked up these losses for one-third of Telstra. The situation now is that the project is: under new management. Future Defence. contracts will be paid for by a combination of: project milestones and earned value. This .is, an amazing story of pathological financial, incompetence, as usual. It is a depressing but not unique example of Labor's staggering, incompetence. Information Technology: Outsourcing '""",75
104,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is, directed to the Minister for Industry, Science,. and Tourism. Is the minister aware that Commonwealth government expenditure on information technology has declined sharply by about $100 million over the last 12' months, with Australian companies especially hard hit and local jobs placed at risk? What steps will you now take to ensure that the government's outsourcing program is restructured to give Australian companies a realistic chance to bid as principal contractors, thereby' helping to reverse our growing deficit in IT? Do you have an industry policy to promote our domestic IT and telecommunications' industries or is your government's onlyinitiative the outsourcing of all government IT' services to overseas multinationals?",75
105,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--,As the Minister for Finance and Administration, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the nonsense that was just put into that question by the honourable member opposite. The question was: what is this government doing in respect of promoting Australian industry in the information technology area? The government indicated some time ago that we were going to outsource, information technology on a whole of government basis subject to market testing. There have been some clusters that have:' been put together. By the end of this week; the first cluster will receive tenders frdin' various people who are capable of delivering the services and complying with the criteria within all the documents that have been put, out for tender. Can I indicate to the honour-, able member what those criteria are. They' very much centre on supporting Australian business, particularly small and medium enterprises. Mr Beazley interjecting",75
106,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can do all the ranting and raving you like, but I am going to give you this answer. For once you might like to have a little listen to it, because it is about supporting Australian business. If you do not want to hear it, just keep babbling. The criteria will indicate very clearly that the multinationals are welcome, if they wish, to tender for this work. But they must do so by showing who their partners are. Those partners must be small and medium enterprise Australian companies. They must show what content, in terms of the hardware, is Australian produced. That is also about supporting Australian business. They must show what other work they will do for Australians in Australia outside of the government contract-not just work for the government but also work in other parts of Australia-as a consortium. On top of that, they must show where they will do work as a consortiumthat is, the multinationals with small and medium sized businesses---outside of Australia. It is about growing this industry, which has growth built into it. They must show what they will do for regional development. We know that, down in Launceston, if you wish to book a ticket on an Ansett flight, you speak to someone in Launceston. Two hundred people are down there at that call centre. They take the calls from all around Australia. Call centres and databases can be located anywhere. They need not be in the capital cities. We are interested in seeing regional development. As a government, we will promote regional development. What the outsourcing will do for government, through its purchasing power, is provide savings. I can say that we are on target. All the indications are there over the sevenyear contract to save $1 billion in respect of outsourcing. We are about growing the industry by the criteria I have indicated. We are about supporting small and medium Australian enterprises in the course of seeing this growth industry develop over the next several years. The jobs will grow significantly in this area. The government's purchasing power will also assist it. So do not come in here with rubbish about our not supporting small, medium or any Australian businesses. We as a government are demonstrating that very much. When these contracts are signed, it will be there for all to see. Overseas Trained Doctors",76
107,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister inform the House of the procedures by which doctors from overseas are accredited to practise medicine in Australia? Can he assure the House that the current high standards of Australian medical care will continue?,76
108,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. At the moment there are a number of overseas trained medical practitioners undergoing a hunger strike in Sydney. I think it is relevant that I inform the House what the procedures are and what the situation is. First, it is my view that people who come from overseas who wish to have their qualifications assessed should be able to have that done on a completely nondiscriminatory basis. To this end, we as a government have not sought to reinstate the quota that used to exist on the AMC exam. We have also said that, for doctors filling country positions before they come from overseas, Australia should look to overseas trained doctors here in the first instance. We give a substantial amount of assistance to help doctors from overseas try to pass the exams. We spent $900,000 last year on 153 bridging courses that we paid for for doctors, and we spent $400,000 paying the examination fees of unemployed doctors who could not afford them. Unlike comparable countries-such as the UK, Canada or the United States-in Australia the Australian Medical Council actually publishes a booklet of test questions. However, there are countries that have a very variable pass rate in the AMC exams. Some countries, such as Hong Kong and South Korea, do very well, and that reflects the very high standards of their medical schools. Other countries, such as Colombia and EI Salvador-and Italy, for that matterdo poorly, and that reflects a different type of medical education in those countries from the situation in Australia. The whole point of the AMC exam is to make sure that people who want to practise here are safe. That was illustrated in a recent exam where, I am informed by the Australian Medical Council, a question was asked about what you would do if, 20 minutes after childbirth, a woman had a substantial postpartum bleed. Eighty per cent of the people got the answer wrong, and 56 per cent of the people gave an answer that would have killed the woman. That said, since 1990, '1,600 doctors who trained overseas have passed the AMC exams-about 220 a year-and that is an addition of about 20 per cent of the total number of doctors we graduate ourselves. So the system is a fair one, but I concede that some people have difficulties. In the end, not all medical universities overseas are the same and, as health minister, I have no intention of allowing people who are not properly trained loose on the Australian public. Bipartisan Steel Industry Committee Report",76
109,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer the minister to the bipartisan industry committee that he announced in February of this year. Is it a fact that the report, entitled The Australian Iron and Steel Industry, which I am waving now, has been sitting with you for over two months? The committee asked you if you would table the report. Would you indicate if you will do so and, if so, when? Will the government be announcing a formal response to the report? If not, why not?",77
110,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I congratulate the member for Wannon who was chairing the committee that looked into the steel industry in Australia. The committee travelled widely, visited various sites in Australia, and I thought that the outcome of the committee's findings were very informative, well based and very thoughtful. However, on reflection, I looked at the Labor Party platform and saw in that that they are coming back to a steel plan-the usual old thing. There is nothing new in the Labor Party's proposals whatsoever. They had a steel plan to help Newcastle before, and none of the bounty that was paid under it went to BHP's Newcastle steelworks. It is no wonder that employment fell out of it completely. The industry eventually announced that it would close down. Quite clearly, a steel plan organised by you would fail. Mr Allan Morris-Will you table the report?",77
111,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to the report, it is available to all members. I recommend that they read it, but it is not proposed that the government will respond to it. Women in Business",77
112,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Status of Women. Minister, with 33 per cent of women now owning and operating businesses throughout Australia, could the minister please outline what the government is doing to support women, particularly those in small business?",77
113,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Gilmore. We know that women are strong contributors to our economy steel through their work in the small business sector. Although women are frequently partowners and partners in many of our nation's small businesses, only a small percentage of these women run the businesses in their own right. This demonstrates a clear imbalance in the number of women in key management roles. In recognition of this, the coalition government has approved $V2 million for the establishment of a business incubator. The business incubator is to be delivered through the Victorian Women's Trust. We recognise 'that small and medium enterprises are the engine room which drives the Australian economy and is a major producer of jobs, particularly for our young people. We need to take every opportunity to assist small and medium enterprises to develop in this country. Called the business matrix, the program has been designed as an incubator to nurture new businesses though the start-up period. The project will cater for 35 small businesses at any given time, and it will provide a range of services, including office space, management assistance, marketing advice, financial and legal services, and network and business mentoring. The business matrix program was launched in Victoria last Friday and it will be administered by the Victorian state office of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. This innovative project is just one example of this government's commitment to providing tangible measures.,-not just the empty rhetoric of La-or' s pathetic 1998 platform but practical, realistic measures to deliver greater equality, choice and opportunity to all Australian women. It is projects such as this that will ensure that women are also able to take full advantage of this government's policies for strong economic growth and participation in the business sector. It is measures like this that will enable women in business to prosper from responsible financial policies, low inflation and the lowest level of interest rates on small business loans in over two decades. Anti-Dumping",77
114,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer to the recent economic downturn among a number of our Asian trading partners and the potential for this to result in a signifiover cant increase in dumping from these countries. Minister, what have you done to safeguard Australian manufacturers frbm unfairly priced markets and imports? In particular, when will you implement the recommendations of the Willett anti-dumping report?",78
115,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought this question had been dealt with a couple of weeks ago on two fronts. Firstly, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs is handling the Willett report, and he is quite adequately doing that at the present moment. Secondly, as it relates to other areas of dumping, you should wait until we respond to the total Willett report. Greenhouse Gases",78
116,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer to the enormous level of investment in the Australian mining industry and I ask the minister: is the government co'mmitted to further enhancing production and export income from the minerals sector? What would be the impact of a shift away from Australia's responsible policy on greenhouse gas emissions?,78
117,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The fact is that a shift away from the government's greenhouse policy would place in jeopardy some very important Australian industries and the jobs that go with them. Apparently those opposite would be quite happy to go down that road, but we have a number of projects which could very well be put at risk: the Korea Zinc refinery in Townsville; the South Australian steel and energy project; the Comalco alumina refinery in Gladstone; the direct reduction iron project in Western Australia; the Chevron gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea; the An Feng/Kingstream steel project at Geraldton in the Leader of the Opposition's home statehe is not too worried about jobs in his own home state-the Bass Strait to Sydney gas pipeline; and three proposed liquid gas developments. These projects amount to thousands of jobs for Australians, and the fact of the matter is that the opposition has come up with a greenhouse policy that it has stolen from the United States government. They have been there borrowing ideas from Clinton-or is it from Gore? Perhaps they want to reposition themselves in case they are seen as wanting to imitate the United Kingdom Prime Minister. The fact of the matter is that you have not said much about the policy . You are probably ashamed of it, because you ought to be. Your position on this immediately calls into question that very dubious document, your policy platform, which states that Labor will 'encourage downstream processing of minerals, resources and energy products, and promote the sound development of Australia's coal resources'. This sort of goes hand in hand with the very rubbery figures that they have been promoting in relation to what they claim was their effort on greenhouse versus our effort greenhouse. I find it amazing that they are claiming that $400 million of their expendiing, ture on greenhouse gas has been cut; $300 million of it is related to the defunct LEAP. That is where $300 million of their $400 million was supposed to have been. That program was a labour market program, not greenhouse program. It was not even a good labour market program! It certainly was not a good greenhouse gas program. Then you have other tenuous links that tried to establish, such as cuts to cooperative research centres-you claim. They do not all fall on greenhouse gas emissions efforts ·by any means. In fact, the reality is a simple one-that we have significantly increased expenditure in the very areas that you are claiming that we have made cuts. What you cannot bring yourselves to acknowledge is that Australia's greenhouse response reprerecycling sents an effective and credible package measures to address the issue of climate change. Really, despite the difficulties left by Labor, in budgetary terms, we have put together a very substantial and impressive package which will make a real difference to enviquestion. ronmental outcomes and demonstrates a very real commitment ahead of Kyoto. Your greenhouse statement shows quite clearly you do not care about jobs, you do not about restoring the economy, you do not care even about the environment. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, after 20 questions and answers in record time, I that further questions be placed on notice. NA Parliament House:· Energy Efficiency",78
118,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a rather timely question to you, in view of the latest frivolous answer from the minister. Mr Speaker, one of the measures that was announced by the government in the Prime Minister's greenhouse statement was a commitment to a review of energy efficiency in the government sector, but of course no dollars were provided for its funding. Can I raise with you the process that I would ask you to consider about reporting to this parliament about our on own parliamentary departments' contribution towards energy efficiency. Might I, in passmention that in fact we actually have a very good record of some very significant energy efficiency gains-I think about 40 per cent since the building was first commissioned. Might I ask whether you would a consult with the President of the Senate to undertake an annual review of environmental and energy efficiency practices in the parliament and to produce to the parliament-I you know sometimes these are mentioned in the annual reports-a specific report on these measures against best practice settings and an external review through an organisation such as the Sustainable Energy Development Authority. Might I specifically ask whether you might consider, as an interim measure, one particular measure: that is, whether it is appropriate to establish a glass and aluminium facility in the cafeteria and coffee of shop areas so that members who currently throwaway bottles and cans can actually contribute towards energy efficiency practices in the parliament.",79
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Denison for his multifaceted I will be happy to take up the matter with the President, but you have already acknowledged that we are in fact world that leaders in many of these areas of energy care efficiency. The parliament has on many occasions received very high national and international awards for the way in which we do manage, and the way we have improved, ask our energy management in these last few years. As I said, it is multifaceted. I will be delighted to take it up on notice and report back to you at a later date. NA",79

132,Mr EOIN CAMERON,REFERRED TO IN THE HOUSE,"by leave-This brief statement is from the Standing Committee of Privileges. Members will be aware that on 27 August 1997 the House agreed to a resolution establishing a framework under which citizens may apply for the publication of responses to comments made about them in the House. The main features of the framework are as follows: citizens who wish to make a response to comments made about them may make a submission to the Speaker; unless the Speaker considers that the subject is obviously trivial or that sion is frivolous, vexatious or offensive, the Speaker must refer the submission to the Committee of Privileges; the Committee of Privileges must consider the submission. The role of the committee is to recommend whether a response, in terms agreed between the person and the committee, should be published. The committee may confer with the applicant and the member involved, but it may not consider or judge the truth of any statement made in the submission or in the House. The resolution of the House sets out the key features of the mechanism, but the resolution allows the Committee of Privileges to agree on guidelines and procedures to apply to the consideration of applications. I am pleased to report to the House that, while the committee will consider each application on its merits, it has agreed to draft guidelines to apply to the consideration of applications. I ask leave to present a copy of the draft guidelines. Leave granted.",80
133,Mr EOIN CAMERON,REFERRED TO IN THE HOUSE,"No doubt, as the committee gains experience in this matter, it may find it necessary to refine and develop these guidelines further. The committee would also welcome any comments members may wish to make on the draft. I also inform the House the Mr M. Salwin of Anders, Salwin and Salwin of Melbourne has made an application for the publication of a response to a statement made in the House. The Committee has considered Mr Salwin's application and recommends that no further action be taken on the matter.",81
134,Mr SPEAKER,REFERRED TO IN THE HOUSE,I thank the honourable member for Stirling on some splendid work on our behalf. NA Industry Policy,81
135,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House the submis- for discussion, namely: The government's failure to develop a comprehensive industry policy which directly encourages growth in investment; exports, jobs and research and development. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",81
136,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The charge levelled at the government in this matter of public importance is its failure on industry policy. The consequences have been lower economic growth and fewer jobs. The culprit is the inability of the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to show any leadership, not only on this issue but on any other, and the inability of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to win an argument unless Labor creates a sense of urgency for him. This matter of public importance is about establishing that sense of urgency on industry policy. Where did the problem begin in relation to this? Their election promise 18 months ago was to create 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing by the year 2000. They also promised not to cut research and development funding, not to cut the computer bounty and not to weaken our anti-dumping system: all of them core promises, all of them now ditched. In the first budget we saw a $4 billion cut from industry support, and manufacturing was hit particularly hard. There the programs have been cut to 20 per cent of that which prevailed when Labor was still in office. And this is the sector that they were going to make the only focus for an employment target. I challenge the minister, in his response today, to recommit their target of the 200,000 jobs in manufacturing but, more importantly, to tell us what sort of progress he has made now that this government is more than halfway through its term. We also saw in that budget assistance to exporters declining· over the period and we saw research and development assistance cut by .$500 million off the amount when Labor was in office. All of these cuts were dressed up by the minister and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in particular as an attack on 'business welfare' and that they were covering the rorts. Yet they have produced not one example of a rort associated with the programs. If the minister is still going to resort to this argument today, I challenge him yet again to just give us some examples. Your budget has also been responsible, Minister, for reducing economic growth in this country by between half a per cent and three-quarters of a per cent. That is why we have unemployment in this nation stuck at 8.4 per cent. It should have been pushing seven per cent. That was what Labor was on track to do as evidenced by the department's own analysis of Labor's program. Since August last year you have destroyed 15,000 full-time jobs-not one added but 15,000 lost. Let us have a look at the minister's record. Affectionately known in some quarters as Black Jack, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has only had success, if we can call it that, at stopping things: for example, the tariff cuts in both auto and TCF. But who led the campaign in these areas? It was Labor in consultation with the industry. They just followed. We had to create the environment in which he got the win. The minister has not created anything new in terms of industry policy initiatives. Look at steel. Rod Cameron's research showed that the weakness of the government's response to the closure of BHP's steel plant at Newcastle was a turning point in how this government is perceived in the community. If we cannot keep the steel industry in this country, what industry can we keep, Minister? Yet you indicated again today that, despite the fact that the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) participated in the steel report, it good report and that we should read it but that he is not going to act on it. The minister is directly responsible. He was out to lunch at the time, something that he keeps confirming every time he turns up in this place. We might actually get an answer if we put question time on before lunchtime. Next week we will be changing question time to an hour later so the Prime Minister can visit his cricket match. Can we have one that starts at 10 o'clock? We might get an answer from you. Not only was he out to lunch when the BHP announcement was made; he was nowhere to be found to make a comment. When he was asked to attend a meeting in Newcastle he refused to go, saying he had too an important meeting. Do you know where he was? The opening of the Crown Casino. He was rolling the dice but gambling on the future of the Newcastle workers. They lost because of your high stakes arrogance and your incompetence. What have you done to assist the automotive industry? You have adopted Labor's plan. That is what you have done. You have done the same thing with the TCF industries. You described the decision on the tariff concession orders as 'dreadful' but would not lift a finger to change it. The government has failed to meet its election commitment to reduce the time for anti-dumping complaints from 245 days to 155 days. Instead the government called for a inquiry, resulting in the Willett report. The government has failed to implement the recommendations of that inquiry and has referred the anti-dumping issue to the Productivity Commission. As yet, the terms of reference have not even been announced. We have had another fiasco in this country. Because the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) made such a botch of scrapping the DIFF scheme, it counted against us in our international trade relations. He went to China and said to them, as part of the trade-off, 'We are now prepared to treat you as a market economy. '. Despite the fact that we produced evidence that shows there is price fixing going on in China, this government now says is a China is an open market and that we will accept fixed prices on any product that is alleged to be dumped in determining whether or not to act. This is a sham. Minister, you negotiated a $200 million deal with the pharmaceutical industry to replace our factor F'scheme. Industry welcomed the announcement, but two months later we had the budget announcement on drug pricing; The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has been running away from that ever since because of the attack on him by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). That has resulted in a twofold negation of the first announcement. Industry was not even consulted. The Prime Minister holds this industry up as the shining light of his new interventionist approach to industry policy, but he never satisfies the claims. He does not know what he is doing and he cannot get his ministers to act in concert. The simplest form of industry policy is to have two departments working together. This minister cannot coordinate a thing with the health minister, and that is why the industry and future investment in that industry is under threat. Now we hear that the government is going to announce its response to Mortimer. The only answer we got from the minister today in response to a whole series of questions was that he only 'anticipates' it will be Monday week. He did not say it would 'definitely' be Monday week. Isn't it funny that Monday week is the day after the House gets up? Isn't there a pattern about this? They will only announce things when they are not accountable in the parliament. Why don't you bring it down next week, Minister? Why don't you bring this great policy down? Let us try to anticipate what it will contain. As I understand the hotchpotch of measures, it will put back some of what they took out, it will reannounce measures already announced, it will set up an investment committee and trade promotion agen.cy as the chief substitute for real action and it will reannounce their automotive and TCF package. We will be very interested to see this replacement export scheme not only for the car industry but also for the textile industry. That is what your agreement promises to do. You will put a bit extra into R&D, you will introduce Labor's manufacturing in bond scheme, you will announce an investment facilitator, you will announce a list of industries that will get sectoral plans, 'you will replace some of the money cut from the export market schemes and you will re-create something approaching the DIFF scheme. However, there will be no investment fund, no targets and no restoration of the 150 per cent research and development tax concession. It will not be good enough because this government is not committed to industry policy in this country. This government believes that iridustry should be cut loose and left on its own to try to get into markets without a partnership with government. It is only Labor that is committed to developing that partnership. We have our policy out there; we announced it last week. It is built around the concept of strategic intervention, partnership, mutual obligation on the part of the corporate citizen in return for assistance and government schemes to commit to targets in exports, jobs, research and development and investment. That is what we need by way of an industry policy, but we will not get it from you. Let us look at your performance today in question time. You made a complete goose of yourself yesterday. We thought we would test you out, today to see if you could redeem anything. The minister's only answer to the first question was that he anticipates we will have an industry statement next week. The second answer was in response to a question from the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) in relation to the automotive plan and the export scheme. The minister said the scheme is complete, then he said it is well advanced and discussions are continuing. Can you make sense of that gobbledegook? Do you know what you are talking about, Minister? On the question of outworkers, you said Labor did not have a scheme in place, yet the whole question was: why did you cut Labor's scheme and still have not replaced it? How can the Labor government have been doing nothing on this, Minister, if you cancel that which we were doing? There are two APEC lists, Minister. The automotive industry is not on the' A plus list and the textiles industry is not on either of the lists. Why aren't you fast tracking these sectors? Why are you going to unilaterally expose these important sectors with us cutting tariffs in the year 2005 with no obligation on the part of our trading partners? It is a complete mockery, and that is why industry still does not have confidence in you. You could not even cope with the question on outsourcing and industry policy for IT by the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans). You flicked it to another minister, and you have policy responsibility for it. You are earning money under false pretences, Minister. You should give it back. You are interested in savings for the government so give it back, because you are doing nothing. On the steel industry, we have got the position where you found it interesting; it is a good report, but you are not going to be responding to it. They will love that in Newcastle. Black Jack at the casino, but now he is not even going to respond to the steel industry report. Then, on the issue of dumping, again he buck-passed on the basis of saying he did not have responsibility for it. I happen to have a letter here which I would like to table, if the minister will allow me. In response to a query, this is what John Moore said: I am responding as the minister for anti-dumping and countervailing policy. And yet you come into the House and say you do not have responsibility. Give the money back, because you are a joke. You are not performing for industry and you are not even keeping your side up over there. We have heard stories about you-you have got this appointment to London; the staff are moving on. We had the story the other day of Mr Abjorensen who went to a senior cabinet minister and put this proposition: 'This was arguably the worse government Australia has ever seen.' The senior minister responded, 'You're expecting an argument with a proposition like that, but you will not get it from me.' Yesterday we were in the position of the minister admitting in the parliament to being that minister, but then he wrote a letter saying that he had misconstrued it. I woke up early this morning, at a quarter to six, and there was a Fawlty Towers grab on ABC radio. For people who are Fawlty Towers fans, it was the waldorf salad grab. There was a great quote. at the end where an American tourist, having been insulted, says to Basil in frustration, 'This is the worse hotel in western Europe.' But the major, who was always sticking up for the person running his home, said, 'No, no, no, there's a worse one in Eastbourne.' Here we have that position in relation to the minister. You can almost tell the story here. The journalist says, 'Would you say that this is the worse government that Australia has every had?' And John Mooreor whoever else-replies, 'No, Billy McMahon's was worse.' You are a joke as a government. You cannot introduce any policy or any direction. We are now taking a book on how that senior minister was. I must say that you were clear favourite yesterday, but the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) is closing fast on you. There is Peter Reith. He is second or third favourite-not a bad position to be in; one back, nicely placed, ready to run. This is a government that is a shambles. It is a government that has got no leadership, no commitment to industry policy, and Australians and their jobs are suffering as a consequence. with responsibility (Time expired)",81
137,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is no doubt about it. After the editorials in the Financial Review, the next best laugh you get is from the industry spokesman for the Labor Party-the battler from Bordeaux. There he is, squawking about who has been paid too much. But he takes a long extended trip to have a look at the new French governmentfrom the Left Bank and then from the Right Bank. Then we catch the TGV down to Bordeaux, have a little bit of a look around and take in a few sights down there. No trouble. From there we go to look at the unemployment problem in Venice. We are off to Venice. We catch the Orient Express, no doubt, across to there. And then, to top it all off, we go down for a couple of days in Rome. Really, what a trip-looking at unemployment and left-wing governments. And you come back here and talk about some people putting in a long day's work. Getting up at quarter to six in the morning to watch Towers is about the size of your industry policy. It is about the size of your strategy committee too, because they really did make a bit of a boner today. They were out there having a right old go, but they failed the lot. It is no wonder, Simon, that you are saving up for Christmas. It is not far away, mate. I were you, this time. I would go to Alaska. top There are not so many wines up there, so might not be so bad for you. When the Labor Party fell out of governalmost ment, a totally disgraced government, they left this government with a deficit of $10 billion, a deficit which they claimed did not exist and which we then had to approach in the oncoming budget. They left able set of industrial relations laws. They left the lowest business investment on record and the poorest overseas perceptions of our investcircumstances, ment climate. Australia's share of world direct investment was four per cent in the 1980s; it is now less than three per cent. That is a reflection of what goes on under the Labor Party. Business expenditure on R&D as a share GDP was 25 per cent lower than the OECD average. There was an average productivity improvement of just 0.9 per cent-half the world average this century. An accelerating manufacturing trade deficit went from $7.7 billion in 1982 to $27.5 billion in 1995. It no wonder that when they left government with that record the current spokesman for industry was moved to say on Radio National on 11 August 1997, 'I think we have to admit that we didn't get it all right.' It was after came back from that trip to Bordeaux that talked about those little situations where had to admit that they did not get it all right. There is no wonder that he went to the archangel of the Labor Party, Graham huge Richardson. In the Bulletin on 17 June 1997, he said: The greatest failures of successive Labor governthat ments from 1983 to 1996 was the failure to develop a coherent industry policy. Well, hear, hear! You got that one right. When you look at the state of the nation when they fell out of government, there is no R&D programs. a wonder that there was a huge task to be done Fawlty by the government. The government has accepted that complete picture. We have turned Labor's financial deficit around. We will have halved the government debt by the year 2000. Interest rates in Australia have had five official cuts from 7.5 to five per cent. We have the lowest borrowing If costs for business for very many years. On of that, inflation in Australia is at a record it 10V\'"",/making it certainly a 30-year low. Business investment shows strong growth20 per cent in the year to 30 June, 1997. The Reserve Bank, for the first time in my time as minister, has noted that growth of more than four per cent would not have a bad effect on the balance of payments or interest an unworkrates within Australia. So I welcome the opportunity, under those to look at what we have been doing in relation to industry policy in Australia. For the whole of this year, the government has had a very busy time in terms of addressing all of the matters left by the previous Labor government. At the end of this year, by the time we have the response to the of Mortimer inquiry, more will have been done on industry policy than John Button or the Labor Party ever thought of in 13 years. I am pleased this MPI was put on this afternoon because it gives me the opportunity is to look through the history book to see just what we have done this year. Let me start with the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry investment program was initiated-a $300 million program, not $200 he million as was suggested by the previous he speaker, the honourable member for Hothain he (Mr Crean)-to encourage investment in that area. In a world in which major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly merging, and in which there is more capital investment and a development program, it is very important that we keep our eye on research and development in this area. There is no doubt development in pharmaceuticals does lead to open-sided areas of research and· development. They are no longer concentrated in one place such as New Jersey. AllY country can attract pharmaceutical R&D with the right In response to the Productivity Commission's report, we then moved on the automotive industry. Here is another example where nothing much had been altered for many years. The Labor Party program would have run out in the year 2000, and the government decided to act decisively by deciding not to carryon the program. It had led to very significant reductions in employment, and there was huge uncertainty within the industry. They did not know what was going to happen past the year 2000. The government addressed this in its policy statement in June. trioA high priority was to ensure that the next round of major investment was carried forward into the auto industry. We did this in no small measure and got commitments from the corporations themselves to investment between now and 2005 of something like $6 billion. All the major corporations that are currently manufacturing here are committed to a new round of model development in this country. Combined with that is the huge spinoff that goes to the auto component area, which is very important indeed and certainly world class in itself. We then moved to addressing the TCF industries. This was a very difficult one indeed because of the regionality of those industries, the high levels of unemployment and because investment in that area is hard to come by. Nevertheless, in September we announced a comprehensive package in response to the Productivity Commission report. The expectations are that we will get $400 million worth of new investment between now and the year 2000 on a per annum basis. The certainty corporations get from that will enable them to develop investment programs, to get up new product and to carry out whatever amalgamations may be necessary in the future. It was very important, when we looked at what the right response would be on the TCF and auto industries, that we looked to the investment, the employment side of itMr Crean-Look to Labor.",84
138,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If they looked to Labor and looked at their platform, they certainly would not be voting for them; that is one thing for sure. We made quite certain the responses were in a way in which all companies in those two sectors could have a future in terms of committing themselves. If corporations are prepared to commit to investment programs, there is no reason to suspect that those programs will not be very successful in the future. Mr Martin Ferguson-You are in trouble now, with seven minutes to go.",86
139,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There is no doubt about the member for Batman. Here we have the ACTU Mr Crean-Trio? He can't even count.,86
140,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Here they are, the twoheaded show: one on the left and one on the right-you know how they bounce around down there. All you have to do is look at the public opinion polls and all of a sudden they don't trust the member for Hotham. They say that even the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) is polling better than he is. That is how badly he is polling. On top of that, the government then asked Mr Mortimer, Mr Goldsworthy and Mr Cutler to carry out a series of reports into the whole of industry assistance in Australia across the board, including the IT area and computers and intellectual property. Mr Crean-That's called the IT area. Mr Martin Ferguson-Not the G and T area.",86
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Batman, I would be very careful; your credit is running out.",86
142,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"These reports were addressed by the government and, as I said, they will be publicly responded to before the end of the year. These reports are significant in themselves. The inquiries were wide ranging and came up with a number of significant recommendations. I am quite sure the industry response will blow the Labor Party away. It is a complete and comprehensive report on the whole of industry in Australia. So at the beginning of this term we had a shambles. We corrected the budget and then moved to pharmaceuticals. We then moved to the responses from the Productivity Commission in relation to both auto and TCF. We then set up a series of inquiries-Mortimer, Goldsworthy and Cutler-and their recommendations have been answered by the government. That has been a comprehensive program for the whole of the year and an outstanding achievement by the government as a whole. I want to tell the House about the three goals which all of these answers were directed towards. Firstly, there is investment. We will not get employment growth in Australia, and we will not have Australia in the competitive position we want it to be in, unless we attract significant investment to this nation. That must be the hallmark of what we want to see in the next few years. To do that we firstly addressed the fundamentals in the budget in terms of the debt and the question of industrial relations and all areas of industry. We are now moving to taxation reform. All of these will indicate positive nature of Australia for investment in the future. When you look at the last five years you will see that $40 billion of foreign investment has gone into South-East Asia. All of it has swum past Australia. Why? Because we have not been a competitive nation to attract that investment. Governments of the day have not gone out there and sold the story of what we have here. This government will address that problem, because without adequate investment you will not have the necessary record to build on. Secondly, there is research and development, the most significant driving force in Australian industry. You must have research and development and innovation for the future. As a consequence of that, we wiped out the Simon Crean rorts for all his mates, all the rorts around the placeMr Crean-Name one.",86
143,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, all those driving around in Rolls Royces. Just think of the Rolls Royces and you will be right.",87
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)Order! The minister will address the member for Hotham by his correct title. Let me encourage the minister to ignore the interjections of the member for Hotham.,87
145,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Crean-You're a shonk.",87
146,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask him to withdraw that.",87
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes. I ask you to withdraw it, too. The expression is unparliamentary. Mr Crean-I withdraw it.",87
148,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The research and development tax concession for profitable companies is a 125 per cent tax deduction for moneys spent on research and development. On top of that, we began the START program of some $520 million over four years to give direct encouragement to non-profitable companies. On top of that, we introduced the Innovation Investment Fund. This concept enables private money raised by the private sector to be managed by the private sector and to be the applied to research and development identified by the private sector. With the agreement of the research and development board, they will receive a two for one top-up in terms of a loan over a 10-year period. One of the big failures of research and development in this nation has been the inability ,to carry through with the development of significant research. Far too much of that has been vacuumed out of Australia to foreign corporations or simply left not to be processed. As a consequence of that, these funds are there to pick up the research and development which has been so successful. I hope in the future we will see far greater outcomes in this particular area. Innovation in itself is extraordinarily important. We will not be able to meet the competition in 2010 if we do not spur on commitment to innovation in all forms of business in Australia, be it primary, secondary or in the service sectors. As a consequence of that, these innovation funds will be used in a number of sectors in the future to develop those particular aspects. Thirdly, we must have access to market. With the best research and development, with the best investment programs, with the best set of taxation reforms, with the best macroeconomic settings, you cannot succeed unless you have the ability to sell into other markets. Because of that the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) and I have been very involyed in getting together programs which coordinate industry in Australia with trade outside Australia. One significant development there was in response to the TCF and the automotive industries-(Time expired)",87
149,Mr SERCOMBE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There was a fair bit of banter earlier in the debate about Fawlty Towers. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) tends to remind me more of that John Cleese character out of the Ministry of Silly Walks. The problem is that Australia and Australians cannot afford the sort of incompetence that this government, particularly this minister, shows in such a critical area for Australia's future. We are talking here about investment. We are talking about jobs. We are talking about our trade deficit. Regrettably, this incompetence of the government just keeps coming through. We keep getting press coverage such as a headline in the Age business section: 'Business chiefs hit Howard's industry policy'. The article states: Australia's leading business group yesterday denounced the Howard Government as lacking both a broad national vision and any strategic policy for industry. These blokes are not exactly red raggers; they are the leading business people of Australia who are saying that this minister and this government are simply incompetent. They have to be dragged to make every decision they have made with respect to industry policy. I suppose the classic case was the example of Prime Minister (Mr Howard) sitting in his bunker the night before he made the government's announcement with respect to the automotive industry umming and ahing and finally coming out of his bunker. He had to be dragged screaming to make the right decision for Australian industry. That sort of pattern still goes on. It is Labor that is providing the lead on the vital issue of ensuring that this country has appropriate anti-dumping legislation. We have heard the minister's corny efforts to avoid debate in this parliament on the crucial Mortimer report. It simply goes on. ANOP research services in August produced a report of their survey of Australian attitudes to industry policy. They characterise it as follows: There is a prevailing mood of uncertainty, despondency and apprehension in the community-a strong feeling that Australia has currently lost its way and left its potential unfulfilled. The report goes on: The implications of the despondent mood in mid 1997 are that the community knows something is amiss-and will respond to sensible, practical and constructive ideas. There is a strong belief that government and business should be acting in concert to address the community's concerns. It goes· on: The community perceives a clear lack of leadership and direction, and it believes the government has a role to play in revitalising manufacturing industry. This is the view of the Australian community. This is a set of views that the government simply do not adequately respond to. We have seen them being dragged along all the way. We have seen them dragged on reversing the ship and book bounties. We have seen them dragged on the automotive industry and also on the TCF industry. They do not seem to have understood that what Labor has been about in both government and opposition with respect to those industries is not some sort of MCEwen style protectionism; what we have been about is creating an Australian industry that is internationally competitive and export oriented. That is why under our policy Toyota invested at Altona. That is why the TCF industry almost incredibly, if one looked at it 10 years ago, is exporting $1 billion worth of Australian products and it is an industry committed to a target of $3Y2 billion of exports within the next decade. That is why companies like Churinga Designs, one of Australia's fastest growing companies according to BRW, derives something like 40 per cent of its total profit from export. That was inconceivable up until fairly recently for an Australian TCF company. That is why companies like Bradmill, which is located in my part of Melbourne in the western suburbs, are so concerned about this government's failure to recognise the importance to them of the import credit scheme. Bradmill is saying, 'The import credit scheme has allowed us to commit millions of dollars to our position as an important Australian manufacturer. The downgrading of the ICS and its eventual abolition is affecting us right now. We're facing the end of our ability to continue at the same scale and imagine further growth here.' Mr Crean-There is no answer from the minister.",88
150,Mr SERCOMBE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is no answer from the minister on any of this stuff. We have had the minister think the unthinkable in terms of the steel industry. He pretends that it is actually possible for this country to have a vibrant, viable manufacturing industry without a steel industry operating. We have seen the contemptuous way he has treated the work of the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) in terms of producing a report that the government is not going to bring on to debate on this critical issue. Whichever way one goes, one comes across further evidence of the incompetence of the government. I referred to anti-dumping earlier. Antidumping is absolutely critical because of the changing circumstances Australia is going to find itself in as a result of the continuing turmoil in the financial systems of the Asian economies. Legislation has been introduced into the House to implement the key recommendations of the Willett anti-dumping report. Legislation has been introduced into the House to unravel the mess caused when the government agreed to treat some market goods from China as being sourced from a free market. Were those items of legislation introduced by the government? No, that would have shown some degree of responsibility and some degree of competence and responsiveness. That legislation has been introduced by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) on behalf of the opposition. That shows who continues to have to drive the industry policy agenda in this country, simply because the government does not have the competence to do it. I referred earlier, as has the minister, to Mortimer report. We believe the minister might eventually get around to responding to the Mortimer report, when he drags himself out of the Commonwealth Club. He is a bit concerned about the Commonwealth Club because he has discovered that some of the Comcar drivers do not know the way there. That has been a source of some aggravation to him. Mr Moore-I have to walk home.",89
151,Mr SERCOMBE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Indeed. It is a bit hard to walk home from the Commonwealth Club with a skinful of G and Ts.,89
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will withdraw that.,89
153,Mr SERCOMBE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do withdraw that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I agree that that was uncalled for.",89
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It certainly was.,89
155,Mr SERCOMBE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I was entering into the spirit that the minister,89
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I advise you not to enter into any spirit at the present time.,89
157,Mr SERCOMBE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mortimer stressed, as has the minister, the importance of investment. In looking at the position the government takes on investment, I quote a recent report prepared by the Metal Trades Industry Association that quotes Chris Dixon, the managing director of a company called Containers Packaging. He says: Our experience in investing overseas really makes us question Australia's whole process for winning and assisting the establishment of new investment. We've just set up a new plant in Virginia-the speed of approvals, the level of incentives and the overall efficiency of the process far outclassed anything we've experienced in Australia. It gives me no pleasure at all to read that sort of comment in the Australian parliament, but that is what important Australian companies and important Australian industry associations are saying about the way in which this government presently operates in terms of facilitating investment. I have referred to the importance of creating the investment and the decisions that have been taken in the TCF and auto industries, but there are a whole range of other areas in which Labor is committed to developing strategic action plans: pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical and scientific instruments, information technology, telecommunications, metal production and fabrication, advanced manufacturing technology, shipbuilding, resource processing and environmental technology. These are crucial industries of the future that we do not hear anything about from this government. What we do hear, however, is the government talking up the possibility of a race based election. If one wanted to think of a scenario that is going to be massively damaging to this country in terms of its capacity to attract overseas investment, if one wanted to see something that damaged the social and economic stability of this country even more, one would have to go a long way to beat a government that is talking up the prospect of a double dissolution election on race issues. The minister also talked about innovation, as of course does the Mortimer report. The Melbourne Centre for Strategic Economic Studies makes it quite clear that Australia has strong competitive strengths in R&D. It is a much cheaper place to do R&D than places like Japan and Germany. Yet industrial research and development over the next two years is going to fall from $820 million to $286 million. This is at a time when the best part of $1 billion is being cut out of this nation's higher education budget, which decreases our capacity to sustain the clever nation that is required to create that innovation. In terms of exports, which is another important area the minister and Mortimer refer to, we have a situation where the government is chopping back the export market development grants. It is clearly failing to understand says: the importance of setting a direction and creating the partnerships that are needed to ensure successful manufacturing exports. Manufacturing, particularly elaborately transformed manufactures, is the fastest growing area of international trade. The government is failing in all these areas. (Time expired)",89
158,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If there is one area that .has distinguished the coalition from the Labor Party over the years, it has been the Labor Party's inability to understand how business works, what it wants and how to nurture it. They have absolutely no concept whatsoever. The concluding remarks of the previous speaker, the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), highlighted that when he raised the matter of Wik. If they want·to get business rolling in this country, they would pass that piece of legislation through the Senate tonight. In my electorate alone I have 40 projects held up because of this intransigence of the Labor Party. I will just mention one. An emu abattoir is waiting to be built in Cobar with 100 jobs going on it and this opposition is holding it up. If they passed it tonight, it could be under way tomorrow. If you go and talk to the Mayor of Cobar, a previous Labor voter on some occasions, you will get the full story of how vehemently people feel because of this anti-business policy that the Labor Party continues to rtin in this country. The wording of this matter of public importance we are debating here today is quite bizarre. We do have a comprehensive policy. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has done a magnificent job. The policy is in place and working well. I looked up the Internet site for the British Department of Trade and Industry, and under the heading 'Australia' it says: There has never been a better time to do business in Australia. That sort of encapsulates what other countries think of us now that we have a coalition government in this country. If you take the 13-year record of the opposition, there is no better quote than that of Graham Richardson in the Bulletin of 17 June this year where he The greatest failure of successive Labor governments from 1983 to 1996 was the failure to develop a coherent industry policy. That was their greatest failure, and the top guru number counter in the Labor Party admits that now that he is out of politics. It is a pretty damning statement indeed. Who is leading the industry policy in this country now for the opposition? The shadow minister was described by one Labor unity faction supporter in the 25 July edition of the Republican this year as an empty suit, someone who will argue anything. That just about sums it up in this country. Everything they did over the last 13 years was anti-business. They had no more damaging a policy than the one for interest rates. They were over 20 per cent, record levels for record periods of time leading to record bankruptcies and enormous hardships, the legacy of which we are still feeling in small and large business today. Since we have been in power-18 or 20 months-there have been five cuts in interest rates, and they are down to record low levels. On top of that, they had record debt. Their overseas debt when they were in power rose from $23 billion, which was high enough, to over $180 billion because business in this country, starved of capital, was forced to borrow offshore. As we heard the Treasurer (Mr Costello) tell the House this week, in the last five years they were in power, the Commonwealth debt rose from $16 billion to in excess of $90 billion with no plan to stabilise that debt at all, let alone pay it back-a shocking indictment. We are left with the legacy of paying the interest on that-$9.4 billion of interest every year. As the Treasurer said, if we did not have to pay off Labor's interest bill which they left us, we could abolish payroll tax in this country-and you could imagine what that would do for industry, how it would stimulate it. We could abolish the fuel excise. The people of Australia could be buying their petrol and diesel for 40c a litre if we did not have to the interest debt that Labor left us, most of which goes to overseas countries. Alternatively, we could have the company tax in this country. That, more than anything else, would give industry in this country a tremendous boost. On top of that, they left us a $10 billion budget deficit, which we have just about paid off-we will move into surplus next year. It is interesting to contemplate what is happening to our north, where we send two-thirds of our exports. There are economic bushfires raging all over Asia at the moment which, hopefully, we will be able to put out. But, if we had continued to pursue Labor's irresponsible business industry and financial policies in this country, we would probably have the IMF knocking on our door today. Mr Crean-Oh, come on! Mr Bevis-What!",90
159,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He roles his eyes, having left us with an overseas debt of $180 billion, more than half of which is Commonwealth debt, and a budget deficit of over $10 billion, and he says, 'Oh, what!' They think this is boring, or they think it is inconsequential. I have just explained to him how we are paying $9.4 billion in this country to pay your interest bill. We have to suffer. Taxpayers of Australia have to suffer paying your interest bill when we could be halving company tax, abolishing fuel excise or abolishing payroll tax in this country if we did not have your legacy, and he says, 'Oh, what!' This is the culture that they have built up in this country today. We in Australia are proud that we lead the world in sport. We are No.1 in cricket. We are No. 1 in certain areas of athletics. We are No.1 in some codes of football. But, when it comes to industry, when it comes to productivity, when it comes to business, we are running almost last in the world of OECD countries. While the rest of the world is out there breaking four minutes for the mile, our best athletes are barely struggling over the tape in business in six minutes for the mile. That is what we have in this country, and that is what we have to tum around. While you pay maintain those sorts of attitudes, even in opposition, it is going to be harder to fix. Look at the fair trading policy that we have brought down. You had 17 reports of one kind or another on it, and what did you do? Absolutely nothing. We came into power and zilch had been done in this area. Small business was crying out for relief, for something to be done. We had one report and we implemented the lot, every recommendation in the report. We even went further. That is the sort of thing that the coalition is doing and has done in its first 18 months in government. All you did while you were there was create new taxes and put up taxes., You introduced a capital gains tax. You introduced a fringe benefits tax. You shoved provisional tax through the roof. Since we have been here we have reduced provisional tax and we have given capital gains tax relief to business, particularly small business. They can roll over the first $5 million when they sell their business and, when they leave their business, each, taxpayer can take half a million dollars wIth them capital gains tax free. We have also given relief in the area of fringe benefits We heard today from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, who is at the table, about your steel plan. It delivered not one dollar for Newcastle. The few plans that you had in place were totally and absolutely ineffective and have failed. That is why Newcastle is in the trouble that it is in today. There was probably no worse area for business in this country than that of industrial relations. You left a legacy there which has slaughtered business in this country. It has been up to us to abolish secondary boycotts in this country because it was you who abolished sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. We have also had to change the unfair dismissal laws in this country. Even in the short time that we have been in power we have seen the claims for unfair dismissals fall by more than half. If you would support us in the Senate, we could go even further in this area, particularly for small business. But your reaction to this is to oppose it outright-'To hell with small business' - because you do not care about them. You are just on some ideological kick, taking your instructions from the ACTU, from whence you came in the first place. The policy you released the other day is nothing less than jargonistic cliches which nobody can understand. You stand condemned for the policy you have brought out. (Time expired)",91

161,Mrs SULLIVAN,CHEMICAL WEAPONS,"Moncrieff-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (4.02 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Chemical Weapons (prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997 amends the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 in order to tax. implement refinements to the administration of that act to rectify certain problems identified during its initial implementation. The Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act gives effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, usually referred to as the Chemical Weapons Convention. The convention bans the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer and use of chemical weapons and provides for the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons. Australia has long supported the Chemical Weapons Convention as a key international instrument in the fight against the spread of weapons of mass destruction and was the sixth country to ratify it on 6 May 1994, following the passage of the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act three months earlier. Three years later, on 29 April of this year, the convention entered into force and less than 27 days later Australia's initial declarations were submitted to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention requires Australia to make regular declarations concerning activities with chemicals listed in its schedules and activities producing discrete organic chemicals. The Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act allows the Chemical Weapons Convention Office in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to collect, through a system of permits and notifications, from chemical facility operators the information required to compile these declarations. 1997 National inspectors appointed under the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act have the power to inspect chemical facilities to ensure compliance with obligations imposed by the act. Certain facilities are also subject to inspection by the Technical Secretariat of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The task of preparing Australia's initial declarations has highlighted some aspects of the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act, which needs to be refined in order to simplify its overall administration, to promote compliance with it and to ensure more effective fulfilment of Australia's commitments under the Chemical Weapons Convention. A key element of this amending bill is the provision it makes to automate the annual permit renewal process in the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act. This will simplify the compliance obligations for each company or organisation requiring a permit, but maintain the annual reporting cycle that is needed to fulfil our convention obligations. Simplification of compliance obligations should reduce the possibility of inadvertent breach of the act. It will also provide for continuity in the relationship of each permit holder with the Chemical Weapons Convention Office. This bill also provides for clarifications of some outstanding technical issues to be implemented through regulations under the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act. The Chemical Weapons Convention is a complex instrument and a number of technical issues related to its implementation remain unresolved internationally. Some of these issues bear directly on which industrial facilities should be subject to declaration and inspection requirements. Understandings clarifying these issues are expected to be reached by the organs of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The bill also includes amendments which refine its secrecy provisions, streamline certain administrative procedures and provide for applications, notices or reports to be made by way of electronic lodgement. To reinforce the effectiveness of Australia's compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, this bill also includes amendments dealing with minor drafting errors identified in the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. Before concluding, I wish to thank all those from Australia's chemicals industry for their input with respect to this amending bill. In particular, I acknowledge the very important and useful contribution made by the Plastics and Chemicals Industries Association. Australia has been at the forefront of efforts promoting the effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The refinements to national implementing arrangements in this bill demonstrate an ongoing commitment by the Howard government to that goal. I present the explanatory memorandum to the House.

During the few minutes I had available to me last week, I took the opportunity to outline the basis of the legislation and what it attempts to accomplish. I had then moved on to discuss a recent report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which is entitled Youth employment: a working solution. The committee took some 15 months to interview and consider submissions from employers all over Australia-from employer bodies, from educational institutions, from educationalists, from parents, from business people, from ANTA and from representative bodies of the education and training industry itself. We held forums where we interviewed 303 young people-themselves involved in secondary education-who are looking forward to some future and to getting a job. One of the central themes of the common youth allowance is that we want young people to remain in formal education and/or training for as long as possible. There is a very good reason for that: Australia has an unacceptably high rate of youth unemployment. This report dealt with the other side of that equationthat is, youth employment, not unemployment-but there is no doubt that the two are interrelated. We would wish that, when every young person has received at least an initial education-in terms of literacy and numeracy, in terms of understanding society and in terms of learning how to be able to learn again in the future-they be given the opportunity to continue with that education through training courses at our institutes of TAFE or with private training providers to obtain specific skills for doing specific kinds of jobs in specific industries, or that they be given the opportunity to go on to university and to obtain a more broad based and higher level qualification which would prepare them either for some specific career or for a. broad based participation in the generalist career. It is true that entry level jobs in Australia for young people have shrunk, particularly over the last decade. One of the reasons for that is that unskilled jobs have fast been disappearing from the Australian landscape. It is appropriate that young people obtain the right kinds of skills and education before they go out to enter the formal job market itself. Not only that; they also need to approach that job market with the right kinds of attitudes. One common theme amongst the over 300 young people with whom we discussed these issues in great detail was that, if you want a job, there are jobs available. It did not necessarily mean, because they were young and they were still in secondary school, a full-time job or exactly the job that they wanted. But if you wanted to work, you had the right attitude to work, you could speak, you could write and you could read, then there were jobs available and you could get a job. It might not be exactly what you want: it might be clerking in Woolies or in Coles; it might be cleaning up in a hairdressers' salon; or it might be a skilled job at one of the MCDonald's outlets-but, nonetheless, ajob. I was highly impressed by the attitude of the young people that we talked to throughout Australia. We talked with young· people not only in the capital cities but also in the regions and in the outback-indeed, all over the country. I was very impressive by their attitude to work. Some of the recommendations that we made are perhaps appropriate to this debate on the common youth allowance. The first recommendation concerns the government's funding of labour market programs. That includes those programs which, one way or another, help find jobs for young people and pay for them to be in employment because, for some reason, they have either missed out on part of their education or they have not been able to find work for whatever reason. When labour market programs are being developed, the government should favour programs which address attitudinal and other barriers to learning and employment in individuals. That is code for saying that labour market programs need to address pre-employment training. One thing that employers all over the country told us is that the first thing they for in an individual they employ is attitude. The second, particularly with young people, is literacy and numeracy. The third, way down the list, is specific skills for the job. It is interesting that we had some debate in Victoria recently about the acceptance by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) of a training program for young people in school at the MCDonald's training facility in Melbourne. Some of the trendies thought that was pretty terrible, because they seemed to hate MCDonald's. The committee heard over and over that where an employer had a short list of potential young employees, if one of those individuals had worked at MCDonald's, the chances of that individual obtaining a full time job were greater than they were for any of the others. Why is that? Because MCDonald's gives young people personal skills and attitudes, such as how to show up for work on time, how to work with colleagues cooperatively, how to approach customers with a smile and willing service, how to produce high quality work quickly and how to be responsive to your employer's needs and the clients' needs, the ones who come into purchase. Those attitudinal skills are highly important. Another recommendation the committee made is that literacy and numeracy are of critical importance to our young people. That is another good reason for young people to stay in school. It is also a good reason for us to do a much better job in basic literacy and numeracy teaching in the very early, formative years of primary school, which are perhaps grades 1, 2 and 3. It has been recognised nationally, and absolutely accepted by everyone in the business, that if a young person has not achieved satisfactory levels of proficiency in reading, writing and maths by the time they reach age 7 or grade 3, the chances of them being kept behind in their studies, ultimately failing and winding up on the dole scrap heap, in correctional institutions or on the streets or whatever are enhanced immensely. We are saying that if we fail to teach any young child to read, write, count, add, multilook ply and divide, we have failed that child absolutely. Our recommendation is that literacy and numeracy teaching needs to be comprehensive, which means that you need to go about it every day in the early years of primary school. If that means it displaces some of the other curricula that has been crowded into primary schools, so be it; let us be done with the other curricula. There is also the quaint but important recommendation that you teach literacy in the morning, not in the afternoon after lunch when the children are sleepy and less attentive. It is the most important grounding element of their entire education program. Fancy trying to study Australian history if you cannot read. It is not difficult; it is impossible. The committee recommended another very innovative device that would go with the common youth allowance. The committee recommended that the government institute a national youth guarantee, which entitles every Australian under 21 who has not attained year 12 at school to a funded place at a high school, TAFE or a recognised training provider to complete their year 12 education or its equivalent. As I recall, the common youth allowance says that if you leave school before you are 17, the dole is no longer available. You will need to stay in school or in training. The Commonwealth, through the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation and other programs with ANTA and the state, is work.:. ing very hard to try to increase the availability of skills training in our secondary schools. That includes apprenticeship training or other kinds of skills training that will help lead young people into jobs or, if they do well enough in that extra training, get themselves back in shape to be able to study again, and then perhaps go on to T AFE courses or university at a later time. The committee believed it is important that if young people leave school early and (ind they need further training, we say to them, 'Look, as long as you undertake this work, by the time you are 21 we guarantee that you can have a funded place at TAFE, with a private training provider or back at school to get the equivalent of a year 12 education for yourself. This will help you to ultimately find a job and live a rewarding, self-satisfying and self-fulfilled life. ' The committee made a number of recommendations regarding the standards of the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation and the portability of training outcomes. In this way, young people who take a course in one location can take that qualification to another state or territory and have it recognised. People will then not look askance at the piece of paper and say, 'You're from Victoria and I'm in New South Wales, so we will not consider that piece of paper. You will have to start all over again.' Another important issue that teachers tell about is that, for some young people in secondary school, by the time they are in year 9 or year 10, the teachers know that they are likely to leave school without finishing. New programs are being developed-and the Commonwealth is beginning to fund some of those programs-to try to retain those young people who are likely to leave school without completing a year 12 qualification, with programs which are different, which will excite their imagination, keep them interested in the learning experience, and keep them in touch with formal education. Most of those programs involve some experience with real work. The student might spend one or two days a week in a real job, and the rest of the time in formal training mode within the high school. The formal training time should also, in my view, include attitudinal and pre-employment type training. At least one hour a week should be devoted to trying to impart work skills to these young people who do not have work and real life experience-whose parents may not work, and whose grandparents may have never had a job-and to teach them about the things that employers are looking for so that they can successfully take their place in the employment market. If those kinds of programs are successful, then we will not need the common youth allowance, except to the extent that it replaces Austudy. Wouldn't it be a fantastic day if the common youth allowance were about helping students with their living expenses while they are studying? That would be a terrific day, because then we would not have high youth unemployment. We would not be destroying young lives. We would not be creating a situation where future generations of young people will not thank us because they will not have the work ethic at all. The committee made a series of recommendations regarding a national youth wage. We said that it is time to do something radical, something different. While we made substantial recommendations regarding curriculum advice, which I think are perhaps the most important recommendations we made, nonetheless, it is clear that, with youth unemployus ment stuck at between 25 and 30 per cent, we need to do something radical. The coalition members of the committee believe that we ought to take youth wages out of the hands of the tribunals. We ought to take them away from the control of the unions, and we ought, by statute, to establish a system for a national Il).inimum youth wage. (Time expired)",92
162,Mr NEVILLE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I commence my address on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bi1l1997 this afternoon by complimenting the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) not just for his very fine address but for the contributionhe made to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. He has moved on to greener fields, but very few members of the parliament have shown such singular commitment not just to youth employment and youth education but, more particularly, to those aspects of youth employment and youth education which can be facilitated and improved. I have been on inquiries with him, and he is a very persistent questioner in cross-examining people on what factors really affect the educational and workplace needs of young people. Moving on to the subject of the youth allowance, one of the most demoralising things I see in my electorate is young people on Austudy or partial Austudy struggling to stay at university or TAPE, who find that down the street there is a houseful of young hoons, who are all on the dole, who sometimes might even have a swimming pool if they can get a house for the right rent, or they are spending their time on the beach, and they have a better lifestyle than the young person who is making a contribution to society and his future. That is very demoralising for that student and his parents. For someone on the margins of either studying or dropping out, the incentive not to go on and do something useful with your life becomes very attractive. To some extent, this bill tries to go to the heart of that problem. Recent statistics in the Wide Bay-Burnett area where I come from show that, with 36.6 per cent of young unemployed-that is an extraordinarily high and unacceptable figure-school leavers have never had more pressure on them to find a job which will lead them to a satisfying career. From their point of view, things look bleak unless they are better equipped. With such high unemployment in the area, there is an added incentive for young people to drop their bundle and, in doing so, drop out of school. Research shows that there was strong school retention growth during the 1980s-the percentage had risen to 77 per cent by 1992-but that last year it started to drop away again, and it was down to 71 per cent. The male dropout rate was higher than the female rate. A second reason for wanting to keep young people at school and in training is not just to keep them off the street, as the common idiom has it, but to keep them focused and motivated so that, when regions like mine go through tough times, the young people are given skills with which to advance themselves when better opportunities arrive. If you provide unemployment benefits at a higher rate than Austudy, young people are not going to want to continue their studies or further training if there is some incentive for them to drop out or if they are not achieving well at school. The students' view often is that they do not think they will get a job anyway, so why bother studying or training. Young people need skills such as computer skills for clerical work; retail training skills, as the retail trade is expanding; trade skills in plumbing, carpentry, mechanics and hospitality; and short-course skills to drive bobcats, operate cranes or whatever. Many of these courses today are delivered either at a school or at a TAPE. Many schools are now taking up these school to work opportunities. In my electorate, the first of which came from Toolooa High School in Gladstone, we even have school to apprenticeship programs. But, if you do not keep students at school for grades 11 and 12, they are never going to get that opportunity. When we were young people-there are many people of my age group in this parliamentgetting a job was not a problem. Today, young people are expected to have many more skills. Why are we replacing Austudy and unemployment benefits with a youth allowance? The government recognised there is an increasing number of young people who do not go from school straight to full-time work. Young people need to be able to make key decisions about education, training and employment without the pressure of losing financial support. Young people should complete or further their education and this bill removes the incentive to leave education early or to choose unemployment over education and training. Those young people whose circumstances change slightly will no longer have payments cancelled, thus giving them the flexibility in training and looking for work. For example, an unemployed person who undertakes training will not be required to switch to Austudy for short periods, nor will a student who drops a subject lose their entitlement altogether. This legislation also encourages those families who can to provide support to their children until they reach the age of financial independence. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has said this legislation tries to defy diversity. I disagree. The legislation recognises the diversity of individuals more than the current legislation. Many young people do not find full-time work straight away; they undergo training, part-time work and more training until they find a full-time job. This legislation also recognises the discrepancies of payments between those who are studying and training, and those who are looking for work. Why should someone be paid more for looking for work than a person who is studying? That seems to me to be illogical. This is a question many young constituents and parents often ask me. I put it to the member for Werriwa: what makes looking for work more important in terms of the amount of payment than studying or training or, to put it another way, investing in your own future? The legislation goes on to recognise the diversity of the community, and the new system will not affect payments for those young people who collect Abstudy, assistance for isolated children, pensioner education supplement, disability support pension, sole parent pension, parenting allowance, the veterans' children education scheme and wage top-up agreements for apprentices and trainees. Unemployed people over 21 years of age will receive the newstart allowance, as before. If this does not recognise the diversity in the scheme in our communities, then what does? The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has been bleating in the chamber and in the media that the government is abolishing payments for 16and 17-year-olds, again proving Labor is equally irresponsible in opposition as it was in government. Young people aged 16 to 18 will not get the youth allowance if they are not studying or training. There is a need to encourage children to stay at school. The legislation goes on to recognise that it is not all smooth sailing for young people in those instances where young people suffer from a short-term illness, substance abuse, family problems, caring for the ill or the frail, skills. parents at home and so on. But the average 16-year-old will not be paid the common youth allowance if they are not studying or training, and I reiterate that point. The member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) has called the youth allowance an assault on Australian families. On the contrary, many Australian families will benefit from the introduction of the youth allowance, including many families in my electorate of Hinkler who send their children away to university. They will receive assistance for the first time. For others, it will be a return to parental love, guidance and-dare I say it in this chamber-discipline. Our electorate office has roughly 12 different types of computer programs which we use on a regular basis. We have word processing, databases, Internet, e-mails, spreadsheets, Pagemaker and so on. My staff are highly skilled and computer literate. They have good communication· skills with the public and senior government officials. They interact with community leaders in business and industry. That is the environment that a lot of young children will go into. If they do not stay at school and if they are not well educated, if they are-in the words of the member for La Trobe-not literate and numerate, they are going to have a very tough time of it. Keeping young people at school at 16, 17 and 18 years of age, or in training, is not a bad thing. We need to give children time to plan and to organise their lives. They need to know how to spell and to write a good letter. They need to know a bit about the world, about economics, about history, about how Australian government works, and so on. They need to know a lot about many things. While some of this knowledge is gained on the job, I could not employ a person who did not have at least some experience in computer skills and customer service. I think that is one of the reasons that at times over the years we have suggested in this place that perhaps we should have juniors in our office, but successive governments have not agreed to that. I think part of the reason for that is that, for young people to participate effectively in an electorate office, they must have those basic I do not think my office is any different from any of the small businesses across Australia. In everything today there are electronic developments and computerisation of all sorts of things from cash registers through to computing, right through to accountancy. Again, if those skills are not in place, those young people are totally disadvantaged in getting a job. I have heard it said that if a young person completes grade 12 they have a 60 per cent better chance of obtaining a job than a young person who does not. That is a very sobering thought. At the end of the day, no young person can seriously hope to drop out of school without qualifications and pick up a job, as they might have done 30 years ago. The point bears reiterating once again: young people aged 16 to 18 years of age will not be eligible for the youth allowance unless they are studying. The days of young people copping out, three or four moving into a house, living the life of Riley and going into their 20s without any experience whatsoever of work are finished. And so those sorts of things should be finished. In effect, they were holidays at taxpayers' expense. The member for Werriwa has said that we live in the 'post-traditional age of families' in order to describe the Labor Party's policy which, incidentally, contributed to the dependency on the Australian social welfare system and the taxpayer. It has robbed many young Australians of their birth right. First and foremost, we must look after our families. We must encourage families to look after their children and encourage them to achieve. When 16-year-olds drop out of school or T AFE because they do not like it and sit around watching television every day, I cannot see parents being very happy with that in the long term. It will bring home to parents, in a very forceful way, that there are other opportunities for their children. I think it will encourage parents to take up the traditional role of nurturing, caring, loving, guiding and perhaps disciplining their older children. What I can see is many parents insisting their children put themselves into a TAFE course or go back to school to get qualified and, as such, be eligible for a decent job. By encouraging families to take responsibility for their children, we put the onus of raising children in their teenage years back onto the family, but we support families giving their children focus and opportunity through the youth allowance. It is not the government's job to raise children. I have said this in relation to the changes to child care where it applies to nonworking parents, and I say it again in this instance when it comes to our older children not making an effort to find jobs or to undergo training. This legislation will benefit more people than the current legislation. It is fair, it is equitable and it gives them goals. The question that follows from this is: who benefits from this legislation? First and foremost, the whole community will benefit, including taxpayers. Seventy thousand young people who are studying or training and living away from home will get rent assistance. The average will be $31.30 a fortnight. Also, 41,200 students will benefit from the abolition of the $1,000 per annum Austudy minimum requirement. These aspects seem to have been lost on the member for Jagajaga. That does not bother me much because I know a few of my constituents will appreciate receiving even a few dollars a week to send their children to school or to university. A family living in Gin Gin, just outside Bundaberg, and sending their child to the University of Central Queensland campus in Bundaberg-a 30 minute drive--or in the Boyne Valley sending their child to the Gladstone campus of the same university, will probably appreciate $20 extra a week to encourage them and to make it easier to get their children to and from the university. Labor has forgotten how hard and how expensive it is to raise a family. So I would not expect the member for Jagajaga to appreciate how difficult it is in regional areas where the average family income is less than $20,000 a year. They are not the only ones who will benefit; 16,600 students will benefit from the independence criteria which are more lenient than those for Austudy. Fifteen thousand unemployed and 19,500 students, most of them under 18, who are living away from home and/or are independent will benefit from receiving an increased rate of payment and 9,300 continuing students aged 25 and over will benefit from the alignment of rates with the youth allowance. Thirteen thousand four hundred families of youth training allowance recipients will benefit from access to the family payment initiative. In short, lots of people will benefit. Legislation creates social expectations, and Labor's badly planned social security legislation implemented over the last 13 years has fostered, whether we like it or not, a welfare mentality. Legislation which creates a climate such as the one we have in Australia today is indefensible and this government has accepted the responsibility to change it, just like we accepted responsibility to pay back the $10.5 billion black hole debt. Do not believe young people are the little horrors the media paint them to be or that society would sometimes say they are. Most are upstanding young citizens who make an effort to contribute to the economy and to society. Many young people strive to get qualified and get a job, but the system is too forgiving on those who do not make an effort to contribute. We can attribute that to the social environment which Labor fostered, especially over the last 13 years. Finally, looking over the whole ambit of this problem, we need to get those young people in the age group of 16 to 18 years of age better equipped to compete in a much more demanding work force. On all the inquiries I have been on with the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training that have involved young people and the suitability for education, one thing has come through clearly: disadvantage can be linked to literacy and numeracy, or literacy and numeracy can be linked to disadvantage. The experts disagree with comes first, the chicken or the egg in that instance. That there is a correlation between the two things is beyond any doubt. If we extrapolate from the young people that the member for La Trobe talked about at the very critical ages of their school development out to the 16to 18-yearolds, it follows that if they are going to advantage of the new programs, the new computer skills, the school to work opportunities, the TAPE opportunities, the university opportunities that are folding out before Australians, then there must be encouragement and support. That can be found in this youth allowance.",96
163,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997, I would like to thank all the members who spoke in the debate. While I recognise the two members who have spoken here this afternoon, the debate has been a long one and many have contributed. The non-government speakers in this debate have focused on several specific issues to which I will refer. Several speakers have suggested that the requirement that a young person aged under 18 must be in education or have finished year 12 to qualify for youth allowance should be omitted from the bill and that those who have not finished year 12 should be able to enter into an activity agreement which would be included in case management. It is worth reminding the House of Labor's own rhetoric in this area. For instance, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) told the Age newspaper on 15 November that Labor would recognise the lack of entry level jobs for 16to 18-year-olds and design policy to support this group to stay in school or training. The youth allowance provides positive incentives to realise this objective while also making provision for those young people for whom education or training may not be a reasonable requirement. For instance, in cases of illness, the imminent or recent birth of a baby, living in a remote area, recent job loss, inability to seclire an appropriate education or training place, caring responsibilities, learning difficulties, major personal crises, homelessness, major disruptions to the home, substance abuse, substantial part-time study and/or workload, having been a refugee prior to claiming youth allowance, being subject to a community service juvenile justice order or some other special circumstance which may take include non-employment related case management, youth allowance will be available. Employment case management will continue to be available to young people who are not on youth allowance through FLEX, that is, flexible labour exchange services, from May 1998. It has also been claimed that the education sector will not be able to cope with the numbers of students who stay on at school or seek education or training places. The government is funding a range of innovative programs to improve education and training opportunities for young Australians, particularly in the area of vocational education and school work experience programs. Funding has been provided through a number of measures. Firstly, the Australian Student Trainee Foundation has been allocated funding of $9.9 million for each financial year for its core operations, that is, approxirecognised mately $40 million over four years. The budget also increased funding by $10 million in 1997-98 and each of the following two financial years to support workplace coordinators, that is, $30 million over three years. Secondly, the National Training Authority Ministerial Council agreed in 1996 to provide $80 million over four years-1997 to the year 2000-to state training authorities for allocation to schools for vocational education and training. Thirdly, the school to work program funded for $23 million over the four financial years 1996-97 to 1999-2000 promotes effective and reliable pathways from schooling to employment for young people. The honourable member for Jagajaga expresses concern about the extension of the parent means test under the youth allowance to unemployed customers aged 18 to 20. However, she fails to explain why it is acceptable to means test Austudy recipients but not their peers who may be unemployed. This inconsistent treatment sends the wrong message to young people that they may be better off on the dole than in education or training. For example, in a family on $30,000 per annum with an unemployed child and a student child, both aged over 18, while the student would be paid $111.60 per fortnight, the unemployed sibling would be paid $174.80 per fortnight. That difference of almost $60 a fortnight could be a persuasive argument against taking up education or training opportunities despite the obvious longer term benefits to the young person of doing so. It has been suggested that the rules for de facto couples should be aligned with those for other social security payments, so that people would not have to have been in the relationship for two years to be considered members of a couple for youth allowance independence purposes. The arrangements for members of de facto couples under youth allowance represent a compromise between arrangements under Austudy and those under other payments under the Social Security Act. Currently, de facto relationships are not recognised at all in relation to Austudy independence, whereas de facto couples are under the Social Security Act regardless of the length of the relationship, although there is no financial gain for people to present themselves as members of a couple if they are not genuinely in a relationship. The youth allowance position of recognising relationships of two years duration is a fair compromise which recognises that young people in long-term relationships should be considered independent, without providing an easy means for young people to avoid having their payments parentally means tested. Young people who are in a relationship where one or both are not considered independentfor other reasons-will not be subject to the partner income test. It has been suggested that the youth allowance should be indexed every six months, in April and September, in line with the arrangements for pensions and other social security allowances. The youth allowance indexation provisions are not in fact contained in this bill at all-they will be introduced in the forthcoming consequential amendment bill-and they therefore cannot be amended now. However, the intention is that indexation will occur once per year only, based on the June CPI, effective on 1 January each year. This is in line with current arrangements for Austudy. It is also in line with current arrangements for social security allowances for single people aged under 21. Contrary to suggestions that the latter are indexed twice yearly, in fact they are not. Clearly, it would be ludicrous to move to twice-yearly indexation when both major customer groups are currently accustomed to indexation only once a year. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Latham's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [4.57 p.m.] ,:.(Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr H.A. Jenkins) ...

164,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"by leave-I move: (1) Schedule 1, item 6, page 10 (line 27), omit ""subsections (5) and (6)"", substitute ""subsection (5)"". (2) Schedule 1, item 6, page 11 (line 29) to page 12 (line 16), omit subsections (5), (6) and (7), substitute: Meaning of approved course of education or study (5) For the purposes of paragraph (l)(c), the course is an approved course of education or study if it is a course that the EmployNOES ment Minister has determined, under paragraph 7(1)(c) of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, to be: (a) a secondary course or a tertiary course; or (b) a part of a secondary course or a part of a tertiary course; for the purposes of section 7 of that Act. Note: For educational institution see subsection 23(1). (3) Schedule 1, item 6, page 28 (lines 22 to 25), omit paragraph (c), substitute: (c) the person is undertaking full-time study and is at least 25 years old. Two of the three amendments remove from the bill the authority for and all references to the secretary to the Department of Social Security being able to approve or not approve courses of education or study for the purposes of the new youth allowance. This power is to rest solely with the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The third amendment is a technical amendment to better express the fact that the maximum age for youth allowance for a person undertaking full-time study is 25 years.",102
165,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"The opposition is not inclined to oppose any of the three amendments. I will make some brief observations about them. The first is that if Minister Kemp wishes to take away from the Secretary to the Department of Social Security the approval for courses of education for the purposes of the youth allowance, the opposition will not stand in his way, although I do suggest that the minister will be creating somewhat of a rod for his back. We will be following with great interest the sort of approval and disapproval that he brings to these particular matters. I can only join with his Victorian Liberal colleagues in suggesting that, contrary to 20 or 30 years of public rhetoric, he is in fact one of the great centralists of federal government and the federal parliament. I am told that, in the Victorian Liberal Party, to call him a centralist is the greatest insult that can be levelled. I am sure to be called a centrist or a centralist is an insult in the terms and conditions of the Victorian Liberal Party. The third provision concerns the maximum age requirements for youth allowance. The amendment provides that a person simply has to be undertaking full-time study and have turned 25 to reach the maximum age. It is poor indeed for the government to be moving amendments at this late stage which deal with fundamental questions like the maximum age for qualifying for the youth allowance. This is sloppy drafting which in fact is typical of the whole bill, and the opposition expects there will need to be a raft of government amendments in the Senate to correct similar problems in other parts of the legislation. We will be watching those amendments with interest. But, as I mentioned, we are not inclined to oppose any of these three government amendments to the youth allowance bill. Amendments agreed to.

167,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I wish to continue from where I left off last night in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is currently supporting our legislation. His support for unconscionable conduct being included in the bill is unchanged. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) said that the opposition would try to amend the legislation to remove unconscionable conduct from the bill. After 13 years in government, 17 reports and reviews on fair trading, the ALP have not learned any lessons about small business. There is a history of procrastination, reports, reviews, white papers, et cetera, but they still have not learned that small business wants an end to uncertainty. This bill is about a new deal and a fair deal, which is what small business wants. The evidence presented to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology inquiry further exposed the abuse of market power and unfair conduct in commercial transactions. The intent of the committee and the government was to make changes to induce behavioural change on the part of big business towards small business. By nature I am not a person of regulatory mind, but in this instance it was necessary to introduce some changes. There has been an ongoing debate on the Trade Practices Act for something approaching 20 years. By way of confirming that I am not overly regulatory, the other major inquiry I did was in 1988 in the Victorian state parliament, an inquiry into 'electricity supply and demand in Victoria intent beyond the 1990s'. That led to deregulation of the whole electricity industry in Victoria and was the forerunner to the establishment of the national south-east power grid in Australia. I want to come back to the unconscionable conduct provisions and talk about the changes to the Trade Practices Act. The government has decided to establish a new small business provision in that act, section 51AC, that builds on well understood consumer protections against unconscionable conduct to small businesses and provides further protections against the business conduct issues identified by the standing committee. It is based on established legal doctrine in that there is already a body of case law on the protections available to consumers against unconscionable conduct. The approach will also provide small businesses with the protections they need against a range of unfair business practices. The new small business provision is designed to induce behavioural change in dealings between large and small business and ensure the commercial dealings are carried out on a more equitable basis. It balances the need for fair conduct in commercial relations with the need to maintain an open market and does this without compromising the basic principles of contractual relations and commercial risk which remain at the core of our free enterprise economy. A bargain or commercial transaction will be deemed to be against conscience where one party is at a special disadvantage and the other party unconscientiously or without conscience takes advantage of the opportunity thus placed in their hands. The key is still that a party has to be in a position of special disadvantage, so the new amendment will not provide relief simply because there is some difference in the bargaining power of the parties. The new legislation goes beyond this base point, however. Our proposed section 51AC suggests the court must take a number of items into account when hearing a case of unconscionable conduct against the small business. Many of these items matched those proposed by the fair trading committee report in its suggested prohibition on unfair conduct. In fact, our provision in the government's bill is an amalgam of the factors the court may have regard to in the existing consumer provision with the final five factors of the committee's recommendations. It is set out in the bill and it goes through all of the recommendations that were contained in recommendation 6.1 of the committee's report. Clearly, these items, as spelt out in proposed subsection 51AA(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (i), (j), (k) and (1), are the additional provisions which the court may take into consideration in deciding unconscionable conduct. Clearly, all of those items go to the heart of the issues raised by the committee. One of the important things that I do want to mention about the work of that committee is the way the committee operated. I believe that one of the major reasons for the success of the committee in developing that report was the composition, the membership, of the committee. They had extensive experience in business both large and small but no formal legal qualifications. That was important. None of the members of that committee-I took the opportunity to check this-from either side of the House had any formal qualifications in law. So there was a very clear intent by the committee-and they did an excellent job on this report-for the recommendations to be formulated as clear statements of principle rather than formal legalese. This led to the opportunity for the bill to be introduced into the House, which makes it very clear that recommendation 6.1 has been adopted with all of those enumerated factors which I went through included in it. An important adjunct to the inquiry that we conducted is the fact that the government has taken all of those things into consideration without destroying the intent of the committee. The government's response to those recommendations subsequent to the tabling of that report included good legal advice. I wanted to mention a couple of other issues as well which relate to the matter that I just raisedthat is, the government's decision to establish a new small business provision, proposed section 51AC, in the Trade Practices Act. This particular matter had a very long history and went right back to the days of Charlie Blunt. Then there was the Beddall report and the Schacht report. In all, over the time of the previous government there were 17 matters of inquiry and no action for small business. Small business were very frustrated by the inaction of the previous government. I have taken great satisfaction from being (h), able to work with the members of that committee. They were very clear on what their intent would be. I want to particularly mention them: the members for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), Petrie (Ms Gambaro), Lowe. (Mr Zammit), Canning (Mrs Johnston), MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), Mallee (Mr Forrest), Aston (Mr Nugent), Paterson (Mr Bob. Baldwin), Scullin (Mr Jenkins), Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), Rankin (Mr Beddall), Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and Corio (Mr O'Connor). They did an excellent job in bringing that report to fruition. It was supported by both sides of this chamber. In conclusion, I want to place on record my thanks to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). It is great to have a government which has small business representation in the cabinet. That has been very well received by the small business community in Australia. He is doing an excellent job. I compliment him for his open-minded approach to what appeared initially to be a very difficult task. No doubt with that open-minded approach we were able to introduce this measure which constitutes this legislation. It has been, as I indicated to the House, subject to ongoing debate for tQPre than 20 years. The legislative amendments provided in the bill are key elements of a multidimensional reform which, once implemented, will constitute a landmark change for all small business, will improve business conduct in Australia, will find a balance towards fair trading in Australian economy and, together with the government's other initiative New deal: Fair deal will encourage businesses to deal with each other fairly and reasonably. The government's framework will build a sophisticated, innovative and strategic Australian industry. (Time expired)",104
168,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In speaking to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 and the amendment, I should firstly lay a few ghosts to rest. The suggestion has been coming through over and over that there were 17 reports under the previous government and that nothing was done. The Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), knows that is not true. He is very aware of that. In fact, the report goes through a lot of the changes that were made. He also quite rightly paid tribute to a number committee members who worked quite hard on this inquiry, and I agree with him on that. I note that my colleague the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) is on t1c.: speakers list. He is now becoming quite falnous as the fatuous phantom from Paterson-fatuous because he trivialises most things he touches and phantom because he does not come to committee meetings. He attended one hearing. Of all the hearings we had, he came to one only because it was held in Canberra. If you look at his record, you will see that between September last year and February this year he did not come to one meeting at all. He missed virtually all the inquiries, yet he talks about what a great report the committee he is a part of produced. Phantom because he does not turn up; fatuous because he trivialises everything he touches. The fatuous phantom will be speaking later in the debate and we look forward to his comments. Those of us in the previous government who were involved in the inquiry in 1989-90 attempted to warn current government members what to watch out for. One of the things to watch out for was the word 'unconscionable'; we had been got by it before. As the chairman of the committee well knows, the recommendations of the previous report, the the Beddall report, were not adopted but they were modified. The spirit was picked up, as we were advised by the then bureaucracy. What was asked for was not provided. What was provided was a new section on unconscionable conduct. Up until now, as the report demonstrates, that has not been able to be used. The committee very carefully, after a lot of advice and consultation, shifted to 'unfair' because 'unconscionable' does not work. It is a bit rich for the chairman to now tell us that 'unconscionable' is okay. After going through all the discussions on that word, he knew that the bipartisan agreement was that 'unconscionable' was not a goer. You have been tripped up by the bureaucracy again. And you have the gall to come in here and talk about previous governments and previous reports. That report, which was a good report, had been gutted with your approval. Do not betray your own report. We were ignorant in 1996; we did not realise the implications of it. We are not lawyers and were not able to provide a legal response to it. We were advised that the word 'unconscionable' was applicable when, in hindsight, it is clear that it was not and will not be in the future. The government's shifting of that one word is absolutely critical, as is the amendment to reinsert it. The adoption of the committee's report-the report which the chairman oversaw and spoke in favour of in the parliament when he introduced it back in May-is important. It is also important to go to the next step and to understand a couple of things. Firstly, the nature of business has been changing dramatically in Australia and in various parts of the world. Governments and communities have responded in different ways, as have the states. We have seen the contraction of the traditional small corner store and the small retailer. Corner stores are almost a thing of the past. The advent of shopping centres has been one part of it, bilt more importantly there has been a taking over by large chains of the areas of business that were normally supplied by smaller operators. An example is the expansion of Woolworths, Coles, Franklins, Bi-Lo, Jewel and the few others expanding into bakery products, confectionery and all kinds of things and opening, in some cases, for 24 hours a day seven days a week. That is changing the nature of business entirely and causing major problems, which is one of the reasons why the report recommended a national code of tenancy. Part of all of this is to do with who can sell what in what set-up. Take, for example, a butcher in a shopping centre who discovers, out of nowhere, that Woolworths is suddenly selling meat, as is Coles, in the same centre. What is more, they are open 24 hours a day and selling it for less than he buy it for. In a similar situation, a shop that sells cigarettes and gifts finds that the Coles supermarket in the centre sells cigarettes at lower price than it pays the suppliers, the manufacturers. In fact, in that one centre Garden City at Kotara in Newcastle not only did that occur but also the shopping centre management allowed in a cut price cigarette retailer. So you had what was a reasonable disaster. business at one stage being cannibalised by the introduction of a competitor on a nationsurface wide franchise buying at nation-wide levels at a much better buying price than a sale trader. Subsequently, and partly in parallel, the chains operating in the same centre were selling at a lower price as well. So what has happened to that business? That business has suffered grievously. That is the kind change that is occurring. With the report and the inquiry, we were trying to change the rules a bit to ensure the giants-whether they be the giant chains increasing or the giant managers such as Lend Lease, Westfield or AMP-were not simply consumNewcastle, ing the small traders. 'Consuming' is a appropriate word. It is not an exaggeration. the last 10 years we have seen the conversion of goodwill into rent. It was put to us very clearly that a business now has a business as long as the lease lasts. When the lease finished, you are finished. That was made absolutely clear during the inquiry. In many cases people have paid good money for a business which on the surface was excellent only to find out that after the two-, threeor four-year lease was up for walk, renewal, either they have had to pay higher rent, or rent which is not affordable, or they have had to go. Cases have been brought ,tp us. One example was given to us where. & tenant attempted to sell the business and ihbuyer disappeared, but the buyer came ba,C,1S after they closed and went into that centre., We are seeing a conversion of what w.a$ goodwill into rent. The ratio of rent to tU1l1-., over is increasing, and the figures on that .a,tt1 fairly evident. It may vary from centre to centre, but the overall trend is very clear. Within that, we are also seeing a potentiaJ' can fraudulence in the value of these centres> Again, I do not say that lightly either. If we; go to the Hansard and look at the evidence of the Australian Institute of Business Brokers a and the Institute of Valuers, we see that; iii both cases when asked if centres were overat valued, the answers were yes. In fact, th¢, Institute of Valuers was asked, 'What's gol'ng to happen? What will be the result?' The answer was, 'Armageddon.' In other words;' ': There has been a factoring in of rents at t-b level, at the gross level, into the valuation of the centres. It is distorting quite seriously the actual value, which in turn' - s, putting more pressure on centre managers and; owners to extract more and more rent. On the' one hand, we are seeing the chains sayin.g,: 'Let us sell what we like for as long as W'?: of like and for as many hours of the day we want or else we will go and open our own centres.' On the other hand, we have clauses, that and turnover figures which demand ever; profitability out of the same centre,.: For example, in Charlestown Square at we have a situation where thvery centre management and a number of the In tenants are now locked in combat in the, courts, would you believe. Tenants are paying; lawyers to fight their landlord. There are' al for few examples of this, but perhaps the most is controversial example is the attempt to con-i vert part of what would be the public spa-e, the open space, in a centre into a coUye lounge or eating area. ., In these centres, the open space, the amouof free space in which people can congregat--: and feel some sense of spaciousness,< ,i-: now being converted mto more and mor,e. - - ""/I'! rentable space. The Lake Macquarie couric,i,rejected that application for 70-square metres, so Lend Lease appealed to the land and environment court. In the mediation process the council offered a smaller figure of 50square metres. It was trying to seek a solution. That has been rejected by Lend Lease and they are back in court next week, I think. Here we have the situation where tenants are paying lawyers to represent them against landlords. What kind of business are we in? What kind of mentality is it when people who have major investments for themselves and their families in these centres, and whose future depends on the success of the centres, are being forced into confrontation and legal battle with giants like Lend Lease? This did not happen last year. The events I am talking about now did not happen last year, before the inquiry, during the inquiry or four years ago. They are happening right now. Next week they will appear before an arbitrator in the land and environment court to make a judgment. The landlord versus the tenantsno-one wins. There are other parts that concern me, and this is why I think these amendments are so important. It is important that there is a national code of tenancy. It is important that there are national standards because, quite frankly, in many cases the landlords are bigger than the states. The variations from state to state have always been a problem and always will be. It will be very difficult to get a uniform code across the country. We need to have a uniform code. We are, after all, one country, not eight. The need for a national code was canvassed strongly in the report and was adopted unanimously. The fact that the government is not supporting it is a grievous weakness on its part. It has been rolled by the big end of town. The government that supports small business has been rolled by the big end of town by that part of the report, and for many people that is the only part. For many people out there, the tenancy laws are the only things that they have. That is all there is. All the is for nought. If the landlord can dictate the terms and cannot be trusted, then all the rest is· worthless. In that context I have to explain that, having now spent quite a lot of time talking with landlords and with tenants, I no longer have confidence in the management of the centres that I represent. I believe I have been misled in those situations and I believe that the tenants are not getting a fair go. I personally cannot act on their behalf unless there are laws made by this parliament to empower me and my colleagues. All of us need a federal code and federal laws so that we can make representations to federal bodies and to federal ministers. I am sick and tired of being helpless, watching things happen which are unjust and having no-one to turn to because there are no laws covering it at this level. An example of what is occurring right now happened in recent weeks. A particular tenant in Charlestown was having difficulty. The landlord was aware of that back in February or March this year. They spent a lot of time trying to improve that business and worked very hard at it. It was quite coincidental, but within a matter of days that tenant was visited by a prospective buyer who told him and his partner that, if he waited a fortnight, he would get the business for nothing, and that his fixtures and fittings were worth only $1,000that was all he would get for them.· He also had a letter from the landlord terminating his lease and a letter from his major supplier issuing a summons for unpaid accounts. So within days he had three major events. I have talked to the landlord and I have talked to his major supplier and I accept that these things may have been coincidental. But I do not accept that, between May and now, when both the landlord and the tenant were trying to get that business to become successful, there were liabilities built up. When the tenant moved out, he gave a fortnight's notice, which was incorrect. The notice was extended for four or five days, almost a week, and they were charged an extra $3,000 for those days. Having been in partnership since May, which we were all applauding, guess who rest pays the bill? The tenant was slugged for the whole lot. Those partners have no money. They have gone broke. They have had to walk out. But the landlord was getting a new tenant instantly, therefore he was not suffering. The whole mon-hs of experiment and testing were then put down to the tenant alone. When the tenant put to his various creditors a repayment schedule offering particular cents in the dollar, having lost a lot of money himself in the meantime, guess who did not agree? The landlord. That means that the landlord, who has control, effectively has the potential to bankrupt these people. And for what? They have already lost their shirts. These are people with some pride. and some dignity. They have been in a business and it failed. They have been punished more than enough. What did the landlord say to me? He said, 'I have got a duty to my trust holders.' I said, 'Your trust holders have investments in an organisation which is almost certainly overvalued. What are you doing about that?' The same management had put to me some weeks back that they would be sensitive to these people's misfortune and that they were very mindful of the circumstances. Yes, their actions were pre-emptory in the way it had been terminated and they had done things which could have been done better, if I can put it that way. When the departure occurred, the bill turned up for the full amount. Now they are settling for 50 per cent. These people have nothing. The parliament may well hear some more about those matters because, between now and when this bill finally gets dealt with, we will see case after case brought forwardwhether it be in Charlestown Square, Garden City or another centre in Australia. I am encouraging all my colleagues to keep this in mind because tenancy laws are fundamental. This government cannot walk away from the most important part of the report. The bulk of the submissions were from tenants. The bulk of witnesses were tenants in centres. The bulk of the heartbreak was suffered by tenants. The bulk of the problems in small business that we were exposed to were to do with the need for a national tenancy code. This government has done what it accuses us of doing. We may have been excused for that seven years ago because there were no examples. We put in place what the bureaucracy and the big end of town said would work. The report proves that it does not work. So what is the government doing? It is putting back unconscionable conduct, knocking out unfair trading from the report and not adopting a national tenancy code. Speaker after speaker has said how the report is being adopted in full. That is misleading-even more, it is deceitful. The report is not being adopted; bits of it are. The key part is not. Do not think this is over. Tenants out there still want a national code. Tenants out there are still suffering. They will go on suffering until we end up with a decent national system that protects people who pay rent. These people are consumers and they are entitled to some protection. They are entitled to a uniform national system because they are all Australians. I am optimistic that the Senate will agree with us and adopt the report in full. Then the onus will be on those government members to come on board and support their own report. It was a good report. Let us not undo the good work by gutting it the way the minister has. If it is fully adopted, it will work. If it is only partly adopted, this battle and these troubles will go on and on. This is the one chance that many people will have and it must not be missed.

169,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It is a pleasure to be speaking on this very important bill, the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997. I want to cover a couple of points raised by the previous speaker, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). It was amazing to listen to the contributions of the first two speakers for the opposition: first, the shadow minister, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who spoke for some 30 minutes about retail tenancy; and then the member for Newcastle also spoke about retail tenancy. But the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and TechnoJ.ogy entitled Finding a balance is not only about retail tenancy. The problem with the Labor Party is that they have no idea about small business: they have no idea about the small manufacturing businesses, the small distribution businesses and the small franchise businesses-they are only interested in retailers and in politicising this whole particular issue. The whole question about this legislation is the difference between hardball business and unconscionable conduct. That is what this bill is all about. The previous speaker talked about retailers and how they are getting a bit stiff at the moment. One of the reasons why they are getting· stiffed at the moment is that they are not making any money at all; they are not making any profits. If they were making money and they were making profits, they certainly would not be putting submissions into an inquiry. One of the reasons retailers are putting in submissions is that their customer base has been destroyed by the policies of the previous government. That is why, in a general sense, they were forced out of their previous jobs, given big payouts by their superannuation funds and have gone into business without any advice at all. Then they expect to make a big profit, a return on investment within two years of the lease, knowing that the lease expiry was in two or three years-just silly things associated with going into business and not seeking appropriate advice. Hardball business is, in fact, legal. The area between hardball business and unconscionable conduct is grey and uncertain, which is the reason why the committee developed its report and why the government has responded on this particular issue. This piece of legislation going through at the moment is very important for small business. It will protect small businesses against the predatory conduct of those who have power above themwhether they be big business or other small businesses. This bill shows how the Howard government has acted quickly in responding to small business needs, unlike the previous speaker who suggested that we are not. We have given small business tax cuts, we have cut the red tape and we have done a lot of thingsyet business wants more from us. But what small business really needs is a bit of certainty and security of tenure. That is what a lot of small businesses do .not have at the moment under the current regime. They want to go about their business without having to worry about others impacting unfairly on their business. If you ask any small business out there at the moment, 'What does unconscionable conduct mean to you?' they would put that at No. 100 out of 100, not thinking that it is important. But it is very important, especially when they become threatened by those using hardball, unconscionable conduct against them. That is why we need this legislation. That is why the government has responded to the committee's recommendations. We are taking action on this issue-action that those opposite, when they were in power for 13 years, did not respond to after having 17 reports. In fact, in response to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman) interjecting, 'It didn't happen 18 months ago, though,' the member for Cunningham said in his speech on the second reading: He is dead right. That is quite true. It did not happen. Minister Beddall, in the former Labor government, did have as an inquiry reference an examination made of the same issue. He put his recommendations forward and, as I am sure he will say in this place when he comments on this legislation, he was unhappy that the government of the day did not take them up. I regret as well and I have said that in many places. He has said many times that the previous Labor government did not bring these things forward. This government has. The Labor government promise so much: they always promise, promise and promise, but never deliver. They deliver misery. There is a lack of seriousness on this particular issue. That is why I reject totally the second reading amendments being put forward by this opposition because they just do not understand small business. They have promised much in the past and never delivered; they were always promising, yet always never delivering. The member for Cunningham admitted so in his speech on the second reading. Labor's attitude towards small business is what really motivated me into politics in the first place, which might disappoint the shadow minister, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who is at the table. Unfortunately, his party's policies motivated me into politics: their IR, their tax, their ance and their paperwork. Labor just demanded from small business and screwed small businesses into the ground. The reason I am in politics is their attitude towards small business. Opposition members now want to delay and stop this from happening. Looking at the speakers list for this very important piece of legislation, what do we see? We see that there is no-one on it. There are only five members of the opposition on the speakers list, including former Minister Beddall, and not one of them has small business experience. Where are they all? All 40 of them should be in here speaking on the bill and supporting their amendments. But they do not care about small business. Looking at our speakers list, we have about 20 or 30 speakers because the government cares about small business. They do not. Just a quick little reference to the Parliamentary Handbook about this: how many of the Labor Party actually come from small business?",109
170,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Tell us, come on. How many?",111
171,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I do not know, it was boring reading, but I think it was about one of them-in fact, none. Where was the current shadow minister, the member for Cunningham, when the Labor Party was giving us bad deficits and high debts? What was he saying to protect small business? Where was he when we had some bad recessions and weak recoveries? Where was he then, speaking up for small business? In fact, he was not speaking up for small business. Currently, Australia is committed to $9 billion a year in interest on debt which was run up by the member for Cunningham and his colleagues in the Labor Party. We have to pay $9 billion interest every year because of this party opposite that is against small business. This $9 billion bill, $9 billion of interest every year, could cut company tax in half if we did not have to pay it. It would get rid of the fuel excise tax; it would get rid of payroll tax-that tax against employmentyet Labor Party members ran up the bill. They got the interest rates going up. They do complinot care about small business. Labor Party members are not good for business, particularly small business. They are destroyers, and they want to destroy this legislation. Small business wants this legislation to go through parliament quickly, yet what do those opposite want? The previous member said that he hopes it gets delayed and amended in the Senate. That will mean a Senate committee, which means that the legislation will be delayed for at least three or four months or maybe even six months. It may not even get in before the end of this election term. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said in a public meeting on 17 September that he would support our legislation if it reflected the report and that he would try to get it through before March. He also said that the tenancy agreements should be left to the states. That is what he said at the time. But the ALP members want to destroy this good intention. They have nothing and they will not do anything. They will say anything and they will not do anything, yet they promised everything. They said in government that Australia would continue with the process of economic reform, but now they are reversing reforms. The Labor government said in government that tariff cuts help boost exports. They are now saying the opposite. Why would they say that? Just 18 months ago, they were saying one thing and now they are saying another. The reason is that they want the vote. They want to delay this because they are going for the vote of the retail tenancies. But the retail tenancies are smarter than the Labor Party. They realise that you cannot have a Corporations Law which covers trusts in Australia. This may come as a shock. to the member for Newcastle. He must have been asleep in the inquiry when we heard evidence on this. You cannot legislate Corporations Law Oller property trusts, as those opposite want to with their amendments .. They are recommending that we should do that. There is delay, delay, delay and delay. What for? Because they are positioning themselves as some sort of allconquering heroes when they are not. Who could ever forget the promises they never kept? In 1993, they said that they would never increase taxes, yet they increased taxes by $10 billion in the last three years. Let us look at the amendments that the honourable member for Cunningham wants us to put forward. He challenges me and my colleagues to support his amendments. After looking through this book and after seeing the experience of my colleagues in this place, I wanted to know who has been a shopping centre manager. The honourable member for Forrest, Mr Geoff Prosser, is a shopping centre manager and so was 1. How many franchise owners are there in this place? I do not know of many, but certainly I was a franchise owner. How many corporate managers in this place looked after franchisees? I was one of them. I do not know how many on the other side there were. So there are quite a few examples of my experience in this field. The member for Cunningham talked about his experience. It came not only from an association with small business over a very long time but also from 'having a family tie in small business'. He said that most of his family members are involved in it in one way or the other, whatever that means. Perhaps they bought some soap or something; I do not know. What is he saying? He wants me to cross the floor and vote with him on amendments that I do not agree with because I have experience. I can say with some conviction that the principles of the fair trading report have been delivered by the Howard government into legislation. Let us go through the amendments that those opposite are talking about. The first amendment says: (l) is of the opinion that the Government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled 'Finding a balance: Towards fair trading in Australia' does not reflect the intent or recommendations of the Committee; That is absolute humbug. The intention and principles are clearly in the legislation. The second amendment states: (2) recommends the Bill be amended to incorporate the recommendations of the Committee; Where has the member for Cunningham been? Of course the principles are in place. The third amendment states: (3) considers the Government's response is inadequate and its rhetoric does not match either its election commitments or the committee's findings; What a piece of humbug to have the Labor Party even suggesting minutely that we do not meet our election commitments. Of course we do. When it comes to small business and any other business area, we do. Those opposite do not, and they never have. They let the small business community down for many years. That is why it does not vote for them, and that is why it will never vote for them. With these approaches, they try to get that vote. The fourth amendment calls on government members to cross the floor and support the recommendations. That is clearly not going to happen because the government members of the committee are very happy with this report. I am sure that the committee members from the other side who are speaking on this will support it. If they do not support my assertions on this, let them clearly articulate where they do not. I will look forward to their speeches. Mr Jenkins-You are ignoring the whole of chapter 6.",111
172,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,I will get to chapter 6 in a moment. Mr Cadman interjecting,112
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Order! The honourable member for Mitchell and the parliamentary secretary will refrain from interjecting across the chamber. Mr Martin Ferguson-Hear, hear!",112
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,I ask the honourable member for Batman to do the same and allow the honourable member to make his comments in a reasonable amount of silence.,112
175,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. A media release dated 23 November-this will make you laugh-is headed 'Labor's first down-payment to small business'. After 17 reports in 13 years, this says 'first down-payment to small business.' The amendments mention utilising the term 'unfair' instead of 'unconscionable'. Do those opposite not understand that the Trade Practices Act involves not just small business but also big business? I do not know whether they have read the legislation. We have developed a new section 51AC, which deals specifically with small business. It covers this unfair and unconscionable part of it. If you take the word 'unconscionable' out of section 51AA, you threaten contract law in Australia. Yet this is what they want to do. They want to take 'unconscionable conduct' out of section 51AA and then threaten contract law in Australia. You cannot do that. We have given consumer law to small business in proposed section 51AC. The member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) suggested 51AC to me. Clause 51AC covers such things as: when detennining such a judgment, the court should be considering the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the supplier ness consumer. It mentions: whether, as a result of the conduct engaged in by the supplier, the business consumer was required comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the consumer; It also goes on to say: whether the business consumer was able to understand any documents relating to the supply or possible supply of goods or services; Is that unfair? Is that unconscionable? I think it probably could be unfair or unconscionable, so it is covered. It says: whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the business consumer by the supplier; Unfair or unconscionable, it is covered in 51AC. It continues: the amount for which, and the circumstances under which, the business consumer could have acquired identical or equivalent goods or services from a person other than the supplier; Unfair or unconscionable, that is covered in 51AC. The next one is: the extent to which the supplier's conduct towards the business consumer was consistent with the supplier's conduct in similar transactions between the supplier and other business consumers; That is covered by 51AC. The next one is the requirements of any applicable industry code, and that is also covered-unfair or unconscionable-by 51AC. To continue: the extent to which the supplier unreasonably failed to disclose to the business consumer the intended conduct of the supplier that might affect the interests of the business consumer and any risks to the business consumer arising from the supplier's intended conduct; Unfair or unconscionable, it is covered under 51AC. Next: the extent to which the supplier was willing to negotiate the terms and conditions of any contract for supply; Unfair or unconscionable? It could be, but it is covered under 51AC. Finally, it says: the extent to which the supplier and the business consumer acted in good faith. That is also covered under 51AC. Where are the principles of the Reid report? They are all and the busi- covered under 51 AC. What was the next problem that the member for Cunningham had? He talked about amending the government's limit of $1 to million transactions. Does the member for Cunningham understand small business? Does he want to have $10 million or $100 million transactions? Does he want to tie the courts up forever? He does not understand the principles of small business. In all my years of dealing with small business I have never had $1 million contracts. If they are dealing with $1 million, that is really good. How many businesses have turnovers of $1 million? You are talking about a transaction-not the turnover for the year but a transaction of $1 million. The member for Cunningham also says that he wants to introduce a uniform tenancy code called URTC-it sounds like a training code for the army. Doesn't the opposition realise that constitutionally you cannot do that with Corporations Law? You cannot run roughshod, as you want to do, over trusts, because trusts are not covered under Corporations Law. You cannot do it. The member for Cunningham also talked about lease renewal and extension. Doesn'the realise that at the end of the lease, that is it? It is renegotiation time. One thing about the inquiry that I changed my mind over was the issue of goodwill. I argued strongly in our deliberations that I do not believe there is goodwill. Goodwill is only as good as the end of the lease term, yet so many people came to us and said, 'I bought the business 12 months out of the lease term expiry. I paid $400,000 for the business, so how come r can't extend my lease?' The owner of the lease can say, 'Sorry, the lease has expired, you are out of here.' Is that the owner's fault? No. Whose fault is it? It is probably the fault of the advisers of the people going into it in the first place. You must return your investm.ent within the lease period. There is no question about that. We put forward some recommendations about the Tenancy Act to help overcome this problem so that when someone buys they actually get a new lease developed then and there, rather than extending the two years or whatever time is left on the lease. I would support that. However, it does not say here that that is what they want to do. This is typical of the Labor Party. They want to delay this bill. They know that the people who came to see us during the inquiry were keen to get this up. In Melbourne on 17 September the Leader of the Opposition virtually promised that the bill would be through by March. I challenge him to support this bill and get it through by March. The Labor Party is not pro small business; the Liberal Party is. This legislation meets the principles of the report. I support A lot of good work was done by every member of the committee. There was a lot of goodwill. I am convinced that this legislation supports the principles of the committee report. (Time expired)",112
176,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) says that the Liberal Party is the friend of small business. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. In October, the report of the Inspector-General of Bankruptcy was tabled in this House. It dealt with the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997, a period during which the Liberal Party-the friend of small business-was in government. That report said that a record number of people went bankrupt last year, and they blame tough economic conditions and high unemployment for their downfall. A record 17,324 bankruptcies occurred in Australia last year, up 23 per cent on the previous year, and well above the record set during the 1991 recession. Business bankruptcies numbered 4,773, up 19 per cent on the previous year. This is the record which this government has; this is the support they are giving to small business. Since I was elected to this place in March of last year, this is the 10th speech I have given which has been devoted in whole or in part to the plight of retail tenants and franchisees. It is, regrettably, the first speech on a bill intended to do something in this areathe Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997. In Australia today, if you have a lease, the question of what legal rights that lease confers on you depends, according to the Liberal-National government, entirely on whether your lease is a pastoral lease or a retail lease. The member for Cowan just told the House that, at the end of the lease, as far as he is concerned, that is it. There is no such thing as goodwill. If it is a pastoral lease, according to the government, you deserve every consideration. For that kind of lease, your legal right to lease renewal, to keep everyone else off the property, should be absolute. Listening to some government members talking about pastoral leases, you would think that those it. leases were hardly any different from freehold. The fact that those pastoralists do not have freehold is just a minor oversight. If you are a retail tenant, to have a lease is to have a very precarious thing indeed. You have no security of tenure at all. You cannot build up your business in the expectation of being able to renew your lease or sell your business to someone else. Within large shopping centres you do not have any right to the space that you occupy. You can be forced to relocate somewhere else during the term of your lease at your own expense. If your business goes well, the landlord is likely to evict you and put in someone else at a higher rent in order to profit from your work. If your business· goes badly, they will enforce the conditions of the contract to the letter, even if it costs you your house. Heads-the shopping centre owner wins; tails-the retail tenant loses. In 1995 Labor introduced the Trade Practices (Better Business Conduct) Bill, which was to prevent harsh or oppressive conduct by retail landlords and franchisors, and which was to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission greater powers to stamp out such conduct. Let us be clear about the history of this. The Liberal opposition refused to pass this bill. The fair trading section of their small business policy, which was released prior to the last election, said: Complex black letter law, as proposed by the Labor government, will stifle the dynamics of the small business sector and lead to greater uncertainty and cost. Therefore it is not seen as the most appropriate starting point to address current small business difficulties. This approach is also not consistent with small business' repeated calls for less government interference with and regulation of the affairs sector. So they would not support Labor's bill in government. So much for their claims that Labor did not act on this issue. Those claims are nonsense. And so it continued after the change of government. When Kim Beazley, as opposition leader, introduced a private member's bill in the same terms as Labor's original better business conduct bill, the Liberal government refused to pass it, nor would they put through their own bill. We would have been happy to support one if they were precious about the idea of who should claim the credit and be seen to be running the show. Instead, they said they would have an inquiry-the House of Representatives fair trading inquiry. That inquiry did excellent work-no question about it. I made a submission to it; I appeared before it myself. The members of that committee, such as the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), did an excellent job in a bipartisan way. I have praised them in the past for their work on this report and I am happy to praise them again. I, and other Labor members, fully support that committee's recommendations. The problem was whether or not the government would implement those recommendations. Under the previous small business minister, Geoff Prosser, the member for Forrest, part-owner of Bunbury, that certainly would not have happened. Mr Martin FerguSon-A large part! .",114
177,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"A large part. The Labor Party did the small businesses of Australia an enormous service by exposing the conflicts of interest of this member and forcing his resignation, and the record has to show that. Following his resignation, retail tenants asked Ple, 'What will the government do?' I said, 'I think we have backed them into a corrier. They now have to make a very public choice between their big business mates and small business. I think they will implement some of the report's recommendations with accompanying fanfare about how small business friendly they are, but they will leave enough loopholes to enable business as usual.' And so it has proved, although for a while we did see the small business minister of the feverishly working that small business constituency. We could even discuss him positioning himself as against the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who is manifestly more comfortable with the big end of town and invariably hostile to government action to solve any kind of problem whatsoever-PI versus P2. Mr MartinFerguson-With Count Yorga thrown in!",115
178,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I did not see him positioning himself. I did not notice him there in either sense. He does not appear in mirrors. The small business minister was sneaking into the enormous leadership vacuum which our ailing and failing Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has created. The more we looked at the government's response to the fair trading report, the less we could see. Now we have the bill before the House. It fails to implement key recommendations of the fair trading report and it will not solve the problems of retail tenants. In the first place, it does not provide for a uniform retail tenancy code. What the Liberal government has done is to handball this issue back to the states, and we all know how easy it is to get the states to agree on these things. How long did the national companies and securities legislation take-lO years? Half the nation's retail tenants could be out of business by the time we get a national uniform retail tenancy code. If you think that is an exaggeration, I will take you back to that recently released bankruptcy report and its figures on small business bankruptcies. What is the government's excuse for not implementing a national code? It claims it does not have the constitutional power. I know it has troubles in the area of constitutional power, but what a lot of rubbish: subsection 51(xx), the power over corporations, clearly covers the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act and would cover its application in this area. Labor proposes an amendment to this bill to set up a uniform retail tenancy code. To avoid duplication, the code will be integrated with existing and developing state and territory legislation to create a federal safety net for small businesses. The provisions of this code would cover precisely the things that the committee came up with in its report. For example, upon lease, renewal or extension, the code would require an independent market rent review jointly financed by the lessor and the lessee; the code would include a pre-contract disclosure statement, as per recommendation 2.5 of the fair trading report-disclosure would include disturbance to trading, retail tenancy mix, consultation with merchant associations, and a statement of outgoings; the code would provide for a step by step dispute resolution mechanism and also cover service stations. These are all recommendations of that government appointed and established committee. When these amendments are voted on, I believe that the government members of that committee, in all conscience and all decency, should vote to support them. They have heard the evidence. They know these things are needed. So the members for Bendigo (Mr Reid), MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), Petrie (Ms Gambaro), Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and Lowe (Mr Zammit) should all support these amendments. The Liberal Party says its members can cross the floor if they choose and I note that the Prime Minister shrugged his shoulders when the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) and others moved amendments to his Wik legislation. He said som.ething about them being good local members. I say to the m.embers of the fair trading inquiry, 'You represent your electorates too and you support these amendments.' Our amendments will also use the term 'unfair' instead of 'unconscionable' in line with recommendation 6 of the fair trading report. This will significantly widen the number of situations in which retail tenants and franchisees can get legal redress. I noticed on Monday night the member for Bendigo said that 'unconscionable' was okay because that was what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) had supported two years ago. That is the tragedy of this bill for the hundreds-I think in reality thousands-of retail tenants who have been done over during the past two years by avaricious shopping centre landlords and retail managers. The Liberal Party would not pass the Beazley bill. They said they would have an inquiry instead. They had the inquiry and now they are back to the Beazley bill. I want to give the House one example of just what this means in practice. It comes from Pam Cleland, who set up a Granny May's business in Northland. In 1989, she put $180,000 into buying the franchise for Granny May's at Northland. In November 1992, she paid a further $74,000 for an enforced shop refit. She received no rent reduction while the shop was closed. In 1993, her trade was down 20 per cent despite a guarantee from Granny May's that this refit was going to improve the figures by 33 per cent. The business ran at a loss. She paid herself no wages but still she had the rental and outgoings put up by the traditional 8 per cent by Northland. When she asked about rental relief, she was asked to produce a profit and loss statement. She paid to have that done. She still got no response from Northland. At the end of 1994, after a great deal of agonising, she renewed the franchise agreement and the lease. Now 1994 had been a better year but, if she did not renew, she would have had no business to sell and she had invested a large amount already. She was already risking a great deal of money. In 1995, trade went down again. She stopped paying herself again and 1996 was worse year for Northland generally. She still got no help from the franchisor. Fosseys, important store just across the corridor from her, closed and that site was empty for months. Trade at Franklins, another large happen. store nearby, was down 33 per cent on the previous year and so was Granny May's. She got no assistance from Granny May's mantions agement or from Gandels. In August 1996, she told Granny May's management she would have to walk away if for no improvement was provided concerning her rent. They said, 'We will pursue you for every penny you've got.' In July 1996, she put $50,000 of her own money into the business. It still made a loss of $50,000 year anyway. She put her shop on the market and the franchise alliance told ness was virtually unsaleable due to known Northland problems and known Granny May's problems. This year in February, despite all retailing in Melbourne being down and despite the oversupply of shops, Northland began huge three-storey extension building works at Granny May's end. Indeed, work is still going on on this extension. There was no passing traffic. The place was in darkness, there empty shops. At times there was complete closure with no access to that part of Northtered land. There was still no compensation from Gandels. They still passed on the rent inintended crease. They began charging interest when she could not afford to pay it and now they have engaged legal action to recover rent owing. In desperation, her solicitor wrote to both Gandels and Granny May's management and eventually forced a meeting. Granny May's management refused to attend the meeting with their solicitor present unless Pam Cleland paid for Granny May's solicitor to attend from Sydney. That conference produced accountant's rubbish from Gandels representative John shop and so on. O'Loughlin. For example, he said Best and Less, another store, were up $1 million on year. In fact, Best and Less were not even there that year-the shop was empty. Gandels offered to let Pam Cleland out the lease-which was due to finish in the year 2000-without penalty, if they could not a afford another $80,000 to $100,000 refit. Nor could they afford to move sites, which was an being suggested should happen at Pam Cleland's expense. Both Gandels·and Granny three May's management were keen for that to I digress for a moment to perhaps ask the House: what is it with all these refits, renovaand relocations? I know from time to time retailer outlets have to have a facelift, but it cannot possibly be good for business tenants to have to carry out incessant refits at their own expense and you have to ask the question: is this another way that shopping centre owners line their pockets with retail tenants' money? You wonder whether the that shopping centre owners have related companies that carry out the building works, the her the busirefits, the renovations. At that same meeting, Mr O'Loughlin assured Pam Cleland that compensation for the disruption caused by the building works was coming 'for those down your end and should be there by the end of next week'. Pam Cleland has received nothing to this day. the They were asked for yet another profit and loss statement at their expenses. Gandels blamed Granny May's management; Granny were May's management blamed Gandels. Of course, Pam Cleland would never have eninto the new lease and franchise agreement had Gandels disclosed in 1994 that they to spend the whole of 1997 engaged in massive extensions, blocking off their end of the shopping centre and destroying their business. Gandels said they wanted Pam Cleland to relocate so they could make the area all fashion shops. One week later, Gandels offered the site to Donut King-an interesting idea of fashion! That fruitless meeting cost Pam $2,000 in legal costs, to say nothing of time, staff to replace her in the Before Christmas 1996, Granny May's last stopped the production and distribution of seasonal catalogues throughout Melbourne via the popular newspapers and· replaced them of with smaller deliveries. They said too many franchisees were not paying the advertising levy-I guess that was just bad luck for those who were. Pam Cleland's solicitor wrote to Granny May's management saying that, unless urgent help was received, they would have to close in May. They still got no response. They tried to deal with Gandels who replied that they could only legally deal with Granny May's management. That did not stop Gandels calling Pam Cleland when they wanted to. In May, Pam was advised to give up. She was losing $1,000 a week. She had run out of money. She was working excessive hours and suffering medically, emotionally and physically from stress. Gandels and Granny May's management were advised in writing in May that the business would close on 4 July. On 26 May, Gandels representative O'Loughlin agreed with the accountant over the phone that he would not be charging any rent for the last month of trading as everything was 50 per cent off. Four weeks later Gandels called up the bank guarantee anyway to cover the rent for $13,000. Gandels denied that O'Loughlin had made that undertaking. During that period-we are talking about a period in which people like the honourable for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and I were involved in discussions with NorthlandGandels suddenly offered a 25 per cent rent reduction three weeks before they closed with conditions: an annual rent increase, a bond increase and another immediate refit. There is the old refit again. Where does all this leave Pam? All their savings are gone, they owe $200,000 in loans on the business and Granny May's management is claiming $155,000 from them in back rent, franchise fees, advertising levy and loss of future earnings. They owe the solicitor $1,500 and, if they have to defend the case and counter sue, they will incur further legal costs. Perhaps Pam was a poor businesswoman but, then again, maybe not. Seventeen Granny May's stores have closed in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland this year and not one store at the eastern end of Northland broke even this calendar year. How does a terrible case like this relate to the bill before the House? There is nothing in the bill that makes it retrospective to cover this case, but if the government had passed the Labor bill, Kim Beazley's bill, two years ago it could have made the world of difference to Pam's situation. So it is for hundreds of retailers who have gone to the wall these past couple of years while the government worked up a report which it is now backing away from. Labor dragged you kicking and screaming to include the good things that this bill· contains for small business. Without our 1995 bill, Kim Beazley's private members bill, and our pursuit of Minister Prosser, this bill. would not be here at all. It is still short of the mark for retail tenants, which is why we have moved the amendments we have. Everyone should support them. (Time expired)",115
179,Mr BILSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) might recall that the only kicking and screaming that has been going on about small business is the kicking and screaming the small business community directed at the Labor Party at the last election-and kicked they were and kicked they deserved to be. You might recall that it was the Labor Party that went to the last election without a small business policy. So concerned were they about the interests of small business they could not muster a few lines like they have mustered now on their platform for a small business policy-not even a few lines. That shows you the type of interest the Labor government had in small business during its 13 years in power. Is it not of the utmost hypocrisy for the member for Wills to talk about a Beazley bill two years ago? If the Beazley bill was available two years ago Beazley could have done something about it, because Labor was in office. Labor was at the end of a 13-year term during which it did absolutely nothing to help the small business community other than conduct 17 inquiries. Very little came of them. There was inquiry upon inquiry and, at the end of the day, nothing at all for small business. The Labor Party do not understand small business. They have never understood small business. But the small business community understands that Labor's noises of interest and sympathy now are more about Labor believing it sees an opportunity to grab some votes. If it was genuine interest, if it was interest from the heart, if it was interest from the old Labor that still represents the new Labor with a makeover, they would have done something about it during their 13 years in office. But they did nothing-absolutely nothing. It is on that strength that most of the small business community just listen to contributions like that of the member for Wills and the ranting and raving that he often goes on with and understands that if the opposition was genuine in their concerns they would have done something about it. This must simply be a ploy that they think will get them some votes-populism, whatever it takes, this is more of it from those opposite. You might hear some thunder this evening, Mr Deputy Speaker. It reminds me of the sort of relief that citizens of Canberra and Melbourne will receive shortly; the thunder that brings the storm, the great relief. This is the sense the small business community had when the coalition was elected to government in March 1996. It was the storm that broke a very hot spell of disinterest, harshness and indifference by the Labor Party. Since that storm in March 1996 and the relief that came with the rain and the cool change, the small business community has seen a government in power, led by some very competent ministers, most particularly the minister who currently has responsibility for small business, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who is interested in small business concerns and is actually doing something about it. He is acting on the concern that is being feigned by those opposite. This side of politics has a genuine interest in small business. It has always had that concern. It has always worked for the small business constituency because it understands the importance of small business to our economy and to families. So many small businesses are family businesses. So many of the starts people get in their lives are through small business. Jobs growth into the future is going to rely upon the small business community. The coalition has always understood that and has always respected and actually celebrated the greatness of small business in a way that those opposite now seek to emulate. But everyone knows better because of the form of the opposition in these things. The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 may only consist of nine pages, but it is nine pages of substantive amendments to the Trade Practices Act. It is a bill that I wholeheartedly support because of its great significance to the vital small business sector; a sector so fundamentally important to our economy and to the electorate of Dunkley that I will always be out there cheering its cause and supporting its interests. These reforms are not called 'new deal, fair deal' for nothing. In fact, we are probably better off calling them 'new deal, fabulous deal' because of the reform package that has been introduced under that banner of 'new deal, fair deal'. As I said in my recent small business newsletter distributed to all small businesses in the Dunkley community: For years we had a Labor government that just didn't understand small business-simple things like reducing tax and producing some real protection against unfair trading by the big end of town. This package is about encouraging businesses to get alopg so they can get on, so everybody can profit from their endeavours, so there is a respect and a decency in the way transactions are conducted in commerce in this country and, at the end of the day, a very distinct understanding that in many respects small businesses are caught a little bit short when it comes to negotiating with the big end of town. As my hard working parliamentary colleague, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, said on September 30: We are going to continue to be pro-small business . . . The Government will listen . . . and if other things need to be done, we will do them . . . There is an invitation to the small business community which says, 'These are all the things' - and I will run through them later in my contribution-'that we have done for small business. If there are more, talk to us, because we are always interested, because our interest is sincere and we have a track record of interest in concerns to small business.' Contrast that with the disinterest and indifference of those opposite. Unusually, because of the community's reaction to the package of small business reforms introduced by the coalition being so positive, Labor's spokesman on small business, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has actually endorsed these changes. Labor was even forced to concede that the minister had been 'able to achieve through his cabinet far more than we anticipated.' And what was left off there, though, is that the minister has been able to achieve through a coalition cabinet things that could never be achieved through a Labor Party cabinet. The only criticism of the bill I could find from Labor was in a 14 October article in the Financial Review when the member for Cunningham claimed that the bill had not been listed in 1997. We are debating it today. As today's debate shows, this statement was also nonsense. Of course, in their draft policy platform, Labor says that they will not have anintegrated policy for small business. They al-o claim that industrial relations is not a core issue small businesses. Yet these important employers provide jobs for over two million Australians. Where has the Labor Party been? Industrial relations is a fundamentally significant issue for small business. That is why we are trying to introduce reforms in that area-that are being impeded by the Labor Party. Why do they think that the small business community will think that they are a good alternative to the coalition when they are not even planning an integrated policy for small business? They are just going to bolt bits on here and there throughout the rest of the platform. That is not a genuine interest in small business; that is an afterthought. That is not sincerity. That is just jingoism tacked on to the end of Labor Party rhetoric which, as we have discovered in the last week, has not amounted to anything. So the small business community can see that old Labor, who were disinterested in their situation, continue to be disinterested but will try to cobble together some bits and pieces tacked on to other bits of their platform to make it look like they are interested. Fortunately, the small business community knows better. The Democrats spokesman, Senator Murray, described the changes as 'fair and a good effort' on 30 September. The Australian's small business editor, Peter Switzer,summed up the situation well on 1 October by saying: A fair go for small business has been a long time coming, but this offering from Peter Reith may prove to be worth the wait. . . if these changes had been implemented 10 years ago, the former owners of Cut Price Deli might still own their franchise . . . the Opposition is bound to find fault with these changes but Labor's record on small business was ineffectual ... And it sounds like it is going to continue to be that way. This bill is part of a package that the Howard government intends to provide to deliver confidence and certainty for the future for the small business community and all those who work and transact with it. The coalition has listened to the small business community. With some 8,000 in the Dunkley electorate alone, the small business people for themselves are a wonderful source of advice and of input. Labor had 17 reviews into small business during 13 years of the Hawke-Keating governments, but nothing was achieved. As I said earlier, if they had been sincere, if their concern and interest had been from the heart, they would have done something over 13 years. Heaven knows-anyone from the Labor Party who had 13 years to do something would have mustered just a little token of interest if they had had one ounce of sincerity about the small business community. But no, not a thing. I would like to publicly thank the chairman of the House of Representatives inquiry into fair trading, the Hon. Bruce Reid, for taking such an interest in the Dunkley small business community, as I certainly do. In between numerous commitments in Bendigo, Castlemaine and all the other places Bruce represents, he found the time to join me at a meeting of small business operators from the Dunkley community that I convened at the Mount Eliza Community Centre. We discussed these issues with the people who have to live and work with them. There was a good roll-up of some 35 people that night, including visitors from as far away as Deer Park. I might suggest that some of those contributions from members opposite actually represent the Deer Park community. Well, they decided to drive for a good hour and a bit down to my community to get involved. The meeting provided a very strong message for us to take back to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business: small business wanted constructive measures from the coalition after the dry spell of l3 years of Labor inactivity. They wanted the relief that the cool change in Canberra and Melbourne that is happening right now is delivering to the fair folk of those two areas. Retail traders at the meeting also expressed particular concerns. There was a good number of them, because the Dunkley community is the heartbeat of the retail community in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It is the place to shop. It is an outstanding retail community that those people wishing to make Christmas purchases should certainly consider-whether it is the Karingal Hub centre, Frankston's multitude of retail outlets, down in the Mornington community or the many other smaller retail centres around my electorwere ate. These retail traders echoed the evidence presented to the Reid committee that smaller businesses often have to pay far more rent per square metre than larger tenants and were not able to get the sort of support that many of the larger anchor tenants enjoyed from centre management. There will always be some sort of premium on smaller space, but I wonder whether the in excess of 1,000 times quoted in the examples to the committee is fair. I do not think it is. Some of the community that I represent are also paying 35 per cent of their total sales in rent and outgoings. That is before they pay any wages, before they pay for their stock and the electricity and those sorts of things. They are paying 35 per cent of every dollar coming into their business as rent and outgoings to centre management. That is an extraordinary figure, but I hope that is not something that happens more widely through the retail sector. In my media release of 30 September welcoming the government's release of the new deal fair deal small business package, I said that giving small businesses fair treatment in their dealings with landlords and other big businesses is one of the keys to creating more jobs in the Frankston, Langwarrin, Karingal and Mornington areas. As I said earlier, small business is fundamental to the economy of Dunkley. Proposed new section 5lAC in this bill will prohibit unconscionable conduct by corporations against persons, other than listed public companies, or by persons against corporations, with the same exception. Effectively, the existing protections available to consumers under section SlAB of the Trade Practices Act will be extend to small businesses. The coalition government is undertaking these steps because small businesses and their situation are, in our view, analogous to that of consumers. In considering whether conduct is unconscionable, the Federal Court will have regard to such matters as whether the supplier's conduct was the same to other like business consumers, whether there was good faith inherent in the transaction, whether conditions sought by the supplier that were not reasonably necessary and whether undue influence, pressure or unfair tactics were exerted upon or used against the business consumer. That sounds like a comprehensive package to me. It is real and it is sincere. The. new rights are limited to business transactions under $1 million. I want to stress that most corporate citizens, large or small, act honourably. However, with around 900,000 small businesses in Australia today, even .01 per cent of contracting parties acting unethically or unconscionably means almost 1,000 potentially serious disputes-serious disputes that can put people's investments, enterprises and, in many cases, their homes and family situations at risk. The Reid fair trading inquiry received over 200 written submissions regarding unfair commercial conduct on the part of large firms. The committee found that harsh business conduct within a commercial relationship does not just have economic costs, but social costs as well. Marriage breakdown, poor health, suicide and stress are some of the possible consequences. As many of us in this place know, with banking institutions not being prepared to provide financial accommodation on business plans and sales performances alone, many of these small business people have put their homes, family savings and many of their other assets on the line to be entrepreneurial and to get involved in the small business community. The consequences of small business failure can reverberate through many aspects of people's lives, across many family members and into the wider community. There is an existing body of case law on unconscionable conduct. While the Reid report recommended the prohibition of unfair conduct in the Trade Practices Act, the government viewed this as a recipe for uncertainty because this legal term has not yet defined by the courts. So what we are talking about is a reform, a practical measure, with certainty involved. That is a sensiblecompromise in my view. As the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry correctly warned, an attempt to define unfair conduct would only land businesses, both small and large, in court. Billable hours for lawyers is the last outcome I would like to see from my contribution in this place. The government's overriding objective is to force a change in business culture and behaviour. It will encourage compliance rather than a reliance on litigation, which was a risk if the Reid committee's recommendations had been adopted in the manner proposed. There will also be $480,000 a year in funding made available to the ACCC to conduct test cases on small business matters, again strengthening that body of law. This will further encourage a business environment of certainty which will help small businesses to have the confidence to expand in an environment of rising retail spending-and I am pleased to add that Victoria is leading the way across the country, and certainly in the Dunkley electorate-low interest rates and small business lending costs starting to tumble with groups like Aussie Home Loans offering small business finance and established players like the National Australia Bank realising that this is a very important sector. This additional protection will enhance rather than detract from the marketplace. It is not in the best interests of Australia for one group to have massive power while another is virtually powerless. The other major step forward in this bill is the underpinning of business codes of conduct. While the Reid committee suggested the insertion of a new section in the act for the Australian Competition and Consumer Comright mission to approve codes covering matters such as franchising, their recommendation was based around the words 'unfair conduct' . That, as I explained earlier, would have created some legal uncertainty. On balance, the government has decided through this bill to insert a new part 9B and a new section 51AD in the act which will cover industry codes. These codes may be been either mandatory or voluntary and can be specified by regulation. This will give the opportunity for industry to have substantial involvement in determining what is an appropriate level of regulation within their sector. The new codes of conduct enforcement unit will be established within the ACCC to offer educational explanatory material on prescribed codes, as well as assisting in carrying out those test cases I mentioned earlier. The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs will have policy responsibility for the development of codes. Because all proposed codes will have to be subject to a legislative instrument proposed under the Legislative Instruments Bill, a rigorous cost-benefit analysis will be mandatory. There will also be a five-year sunset clause applicable. These twin safeguards will allay the unfounded fears of some groups that the government is introducing excessive 'black letter' law. I believe the coalition has found an appropriate balance. I am delighted that the Property Council of Australia and the Australian Retailers Association have agreed on a framework for better state laws for retail tenants. Allied with this bill is the government's determination to see a better deal for small business on retail tenancies. I regard this as one of the most important areas of change. The minister is working diligently to encourage state jurisdicliability tions to improve the standards of existing legislation. We are taking a leadership role encouraging ministers like Victoria's Louise Asher to propose a fairer deal for small businesses. Why? As mentioned earlier, we would have to t;'ely upon the corporations power ourselves to directly intervene legislatively in this area and, as many of us in this place know-and for the interest, I trust, of those on the opposite side of this Housethese shopping centres are more often than not state listed property trusts. They are outside the jurisdictional reach of the Commonwealth. That is something that seems to have been lost in the debate that has been going on, particularly in the offerings from that side of the House. With the Small Business Advisory Network in Victoria led by Noel Johnson, I have been lobbying to ensure that other sensible changes, such as the core hour concept that is already available in South Australia and Queensland, are looked at for the Victorian jurisdiction. It is unfair for a few trade all night in a shopping centre and expect other tenants to be involved in contributing to the outgoings during those hours. Show me a more liberal concept that says to the small business community, 'Get together within a shopping centre and agree on what is a spread of hours that everybody will undertake. to be open. We can market the shopping centre as being fully operational at that time across those core hours and then, if it suits you to open beyond those core hours, do so, but you carry the commercial costs that go with that.' If the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) and I happened to operate a florist shop and on the eve of Valentine's Day think that there would be a lot of lovesick males trying to make the right move towards the ones they are fond of and we will stay open just so that everyone can buy some roses, then that is a call we can make. But that is a call we make on our commercial terms and, therefore, we do not impose our judgments, business acumen and decisions on other people. So I encourage the Victorian government to look closely at that. Adequate disclosure, the discontinuance of ratchet clauses, the introduction of landlord for reasonable tenant relocation costs during the term of a lease and the availability in of complete information on a confidential basis to valuers when undertaking independent rent reviews are some of the changes the federal government is encouraging. I have much more I could say about the small business community. I enjoy talking about the small business comrpunity because they are fundamentally important to the electorate I represent. I would like to outline to this House that there have been more than 25 to 30 specific, tangible, practical and positive initiatives that this coalition has introduced to help small business. That is our record. That is form that shows we have a genuine and sincere interest. Contrast that with the inactivity of those opposite and you will understand the shallowness of their words about the small business community.

180,Mr MILES,ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (6.39 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I do not want to go into details on the different amendments here. We are agreeing to all of these amendments. Some of them have been proposed by the opposition and some of them by the government. Obviously we do not believe that the opposition amendments were necessary, but we want this legislation to go through and it is agreed that we will support those amendments. There is basically a bipartisan position on this. So I will.not take any more time of the House other than to make those few comments.",124
181,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION,I am surprised to learn that the Eligible government is agreeing to all the amendments. It was my understanding that there was payment still an area of difference involving the issue of interest on those members who fail to provide their tax file numbers when the first opportunity has passed and therefore are required to pay the full 15 per cent superannuation surcharge. Mr Miles-That is No.7.,124
182,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION,So this is a matter that is coming up later? Mr Miles-Yes.,124
183,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION,"The amendments that have been agreed to in the Senate cover the issues which we raised concerning, firstly, deferral of the application of the allocated surplus amounts from 20 August 1996 to 1 July 1997. Secondly, we moved to to the ensure consistent future treatment of golden handshake payments regardless of whether they are rolled over or taken in cash with rolled-over payments exempt from 20 August 1996 to 1 July 1997. I must say this was a matter of great concern amongst a number of people around Australia who had taken golden handshake payments in good faith and based on the statement made by the Treasurer at the time had rolled them over only to find that they were going to be subject to the surcharge whereas those who had taken them in cash were not going to be subject to the surcharge. So that was causing them great concern. In the interests of keeping the Treasurer honest, an important objective at any time, we supported these amendments in the Senate. We also moved to insert a surcharge tax anti-avoidance measure and to allow for a superannuation fund to object to surcharge tax assessment based on the tax officer's calculation of the adjusted taxable income of the member who incurs the liability. I am pleased to see that the government is not opposing those amendments and that enables us to make progress. I do make the point that we continue to believe that the collection method adopted by the government for the superannuation surcharge tax is a very poor collection method, leading to a great deal of administrative inefficiency and concern within the superannuation industry.

184,Mr MILES,TAXES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (6.42 p.m.)-I move: That amendments Nos 1· to 6 be agreed to. I note the House of Representatives is being asked to consider a number of amendments by the Senate to the government's package of superannuation contribution surcharge legislation. The government will be accepting Senate amendments Nos 1 to 6 on this bill. I will briefly cover these amendments. Amendment No. 1 proposes to amend the operative date. of a provision which was introduced as a revenue protection measure after significant consultation with the industry. The operative date is being deferred from 20 August 1996 to 1 July 1997. It is not anticipated that many funds will be affected by the provision and the government Will therefore liability to pay accept the amendment. To prevent the use of golden handshakes as a means of surcharge avoidance, the government provided for the application of the surcharge to excessive termination payments. Amendments Nos 2 and 3 seek to apply a consistent treatment for golden handshakes whether taken as cash or rolled over after 1 July 1997. Amendment No. 4 was moved by the government in the Senate and corrects the minor cross-referencing errors resulting from an amendment made by the bill. Amendment No.5 provides for a superannuation provider to be able to object to an assessment. The government does not believe this amendment is necessary as the trustee can contact the Commissioner of Taxation before the due date for payment to resolve the concern. Amendment No. 6 is intended to discourage the use of anti-avoidance arrangements with respect to the surcharge. The government questioned the effectiveness of this provision. We support these amendments. Question resolved in the affirmative.",126
185,Mr MILES,TAXES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (6.45 p.m.)-I move: That Senate amendment No.7 be disagreed to. First of all, the government cannot accept penalty rates of interest as will be the case if the amendment is accepted. It is not accepted by the government for that reason and the following reasons. The amendment would result in inconsistent consequences for the failure to quote a tax file number. In other legislation administered by the Commissioner of Taxation, interest is not applied to amended assessments after the quotation of a tax file number. The legislation already imposes significant requirements on the commissioner to identify members of superannuation funds before issuing a surcharge assessment on the basis of a non-quotation of a tax file number. In addition, the legislation provides that certain superannuation accounts are to be assessed at a nil rate of surcharge where a tax file number has not been quoted. The effect of this amendment is effectively to provide encouragement for people not to quote their tax file number for surcharge purposes. There are, therefore, no reasonable grounds for this amendment to be accepted.",126
186,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The opposition does not support the government's motion to reject this amendment. What the amendment is endeavouring to do is to ensure that those superannuation funds that are entitled to a tax refund from the Australian Ta-ation Office because an individual taxpayer did not provide their tax file number and was hit with the full rate of surcharge tax will get the value of interest the tax office holding those funds for a period. The need for this amendment in the first place highlights the absolute stupidity the government's superannuation surcharge tax collection method. To illustrate how dopey and complex this collection method is, let me explain again how this tax is supposed to work. As a general proposition, this is a tax on a third party-a superannuation fund-resulting from the actions of a superannuation fund member. The tax is assessed based on the adjusted taxable income of the member by the Australian Taxation Office which advises the super fund of its tax liability. The member is also advised of the tax liability by the tax office, but the member does not have to pay the tax. That is a problem for the super fund. The super fund then pays the tax to the tax office and may choose to pass the tax on to the member, but it may not choose to pass the liability on to the member. In some cases, it will not be able to pass it on to the member meaning the fund will have to carry the liability itself. In that case, you will see members of the superannuation fund paying the tax regardless of their income level. In the situation where the member does not provide their tax file number to the fund the tax office will levy the full amount of the surcharge tax-that is, 15 per cent of surchargable contributions on the fund. That means that low and middle income earners who do not provide their tax file numbers to their superannuation fund will pay the full 15 per cent of the surcharge tax. This is a terrible situation. As an example, someone from the emergency services superannuation fund said to me that he has about 23,000 fund members. He has to do all the calculations when 60 members end up being liable for the surcharge. If others in the fund do not provide their tax file number, they will end up paying the 15 per cent surcharge. If the situation that I have described does occur, the member can subsequently provide their tax file number to the tax office and the tax office may reassess the tax liability on the super fund. This amendment is designed to bring some justice to the situation. Where a for reassessment of the super fund's liability is made by the tax office after receiving the tax file number of the fund member, the fund of may be entitled to a refund from the tax office of the amount of surcharge tax overpaid. This amendment will require the tax office to pay interest on the refunded amount. In the eyes of the opposition, that is fair and that is reasonable. The refund should include interest on that amount which the tax office was holding unnecessarily as a result of the government's complex collection method. It would have been earning interest had it stayed in the member's superannuation fund account. Again, the complexity of the government's collection method is still apparent in what the fund should do with the refund if it got the money. The superannuation fund paid the tax to the tax office but mayor may not have passed the tax on to the member. If it did pass it on, then the fund should give the money back to the member. If it did not pass it on, then the fund can keep the money itself, but what to do with the interest payment? Perhaps the Parliamentary all Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) might like to respond to that. . The government is telling us that low and middle income earners can avoid paying the surcharge tax simply by giving their tax file numbers to their superannuation fund. It is also telling us that the colleCtion of tax file numbers is going well, with Senator Kemp telling the other place when these bills were debated yesterday that: ... collection rates of tax file numbers are currently in line with expectations at this stage of the process. I am not sure what 'expectations' are, but that is contrary to the advice which some other superannuation funds are saying, which is that only a small number of people are providing their tax file numbers meaning that their superannuation provider will be subject to a tax liability which they will pass on to all those individual fund members who are not high income earners. Even if we ignore that advice from the superannuation funds and take the government at its word, which is a risk at any time, then what do we see in respect of the collection of tax file numbers? Reportedly, there are six million individual taxpayers in Australia who are covered by superannuation. That comes from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing of 26 February this year. If the collection rate for tax file numbers is as high as 65 per cent, which is the figure given by the tax office, we still have over 2,100,000 people unaccounted for. (Extension of time granted) The tax office assures us that it can locate another two-thirds-that appeared in the Financial Review of 21 November-leaving 700,000 people unknown. If those people are earning average weekly earnings-$35,000 a year-they would be liable for a surcharge per person of around $315. The total surcharge collected by the tax office from low income earners on this basis would be some $220 million in the first year alone. Some 700,000 people may ertd up paying the 15 per cent surcharge which they should not have to pay because they have not provided their tax file number. So our amendment will go some way towards limiting the impact that the surcharge tax will have on low and middle income earners. There will be a higher compliance cost to the tax office in processing the plethora of claims for the refund and the interest of surcharge tax payments that will certainly arise next year. The fact that low and middle income earners are going to pay this tax is an inevitable consequence of the bizarre collection method which this government has chosen to adopt. Labor believes that the amendment we have here will provide low and middle income earners with some justice for having to pay the surcharge tax provided that superannuation providers pass the interest payments and the refund onto the individuals. For those reasons, we support the Senate amendment, and we hope that the government will be gracious enough to do so as well.",127
187,Mr MILES,TAXES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (6.54 p.m.)-People have a choice to put in their tax file number and avoid this problem. If they do not do it, you are arguing this case. It really is a matter of choice, and that is pretty reasonable really. I just want to point out the fact that people do have a choice of putting in their tax file number. If they do that, everything sort of runs very smoothly and they will not have the 15 per cent surcharge. It is a matter of choice. If people do not want to do it, okay, but it is a pretty reasonable proposition and it is up to people. If they put in their tax file number, as they do for many other things, everything flows smoothly. If they do not, there are some consequences.",128
188,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The fact is that the evidence coming before us suggests that many low and middle income earners will end up not submitting their tax file numbers and, as a result, being liable for the 15 per cent surcharge. When the government introduced the 15 per cent surcharge, it said, 'This is a great equity measure. This is going to affect high income earners-those over $85,000. This shows that this is a government which supports low and middle income earners.' But in fact we are going to have a situation where quite a number of them do not provide the tax file number through inadvertence and a whole array of reasons. As a result, they will be hit with the 15 per cent surcharge. We do not think that is a fair situation. It has come about because of the collection method they have chosen to adopt. If they had used the group certificates, or a different collection method, it would not have come to this. But we think requiring the superannuation funds to get hold of tax file numbers, which they do not have customarily as part of their information, is a silly situation. It is bound to leave some people being taxed on their superannuation for the surcharge which they should not be liable for. That is why we have moved the amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Miles) agreed to: That Mr Bob Baldwin, Mr Hardgrave and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendment No. 7 of the Senate.",128
189,Mr MILES,TAXES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (6.57 p.m.)-On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendment No. 7 of the Senate, I present the reasons, which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsSenate Amendment No. 7 The amendment proposes the insertion of a new Part IIF into the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983, to provide for the payment of interest on overpayments of surcharge which result from a person's failure to provide a tax file number. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment which would result in inconsistent consequences for the failure to quote a tax file number. In other tion administered by the Commissioner of Taxation, interest is not applied to amended assessments after the quotation of a tax file number. The legislation already imposes significant requirements on the Commissioner to identify members of superannuation funds before issuing a surcharge assessment on the basis of non-quotation of a tax file number. In addition, the legislation provides that certain superannuation accounts are to be assessed at a nil rate of surcharge where a tax file number has not been quoted. Motion (by Mr Miles) agreed to: That the committee's reasons be adopted. NA (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",129
190,Mr BEDDALL,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997. This bill is a small step in the right direction for small business across Australia. As a former minister for small business, I know first hand the frustrations felt by many small businessmen and women. In particular, they feel powerless in their dealings with big business. The report into fair trading was the most significant inquiry for small business since the same House of Representatives committee brought down a report in 1990, which I had the honour to chair. Mr Stephen Smith-So well chaired.",129
191,Mr BEDDALL,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Thank you very much. The 1990 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology's inquiry into small business in Australia was entitled Challenges, problems and opportunities. I am delighted to say, as many members would know, that this became known as the Beddall report. I am also delighted to see the. tradition has continued with the fair trading inquiry report becoming rightly known as the Reid report. The 1990 report has laid the framework for much of the policy that is now before the House. When you read the fine print of the glossy literature of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and look beyond the rhetoric, it is not as clear, as legislathis minister would have us believe, that change has in fact happened. The legislation, unfortunately, does not go far enough. The small business people out there are looking for help and for some justice. As a result, the Labor Party has moved a number of important key amendments, which I wholeheartedly support. The Labor opposition amendments moved by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) seek to implement the recommendations of the report, which was entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia. I was honoured to be the deputy chair of that committee, and I am someone in this parliament who is pleased to be able to say that I have taken an active interest in the small business sector over a number of years. 11376 The government's bill that we are debating tonight is very similar to the Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill 1995 introduced by my colleague the then Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Chris Schacht. This proposed a new section 51AC to deal with the concept of harsh and oppressive conduct. Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, also moved a similar motion in this House in May of this year. As we have heard from Mr Martin, the shadow minister, the Labor Party will be giving swift passage through both houses to any changes which will benefit this important sector of the community. The government's bill that we are debating amends the Trade Practices Act 1974 to prohibit unconscionable conduct with respect to certain small business versus big business transactions. It also allows for industry codes of practice and, where necessary, to have those enforced as mandatory codes. As has already been outlined, the bill adopts the frequently heard 'unconscionable' under the new section 51AC. These provisions apply only to small business and to transactions that do not exceed $1 million. The bill also extends regulation power to cover the declaration of the industry codes under a new section 51AE of the Trade Practices Act. To determine whether a breach of a mandatory industry code is unconscionable, a new section has been added-51AD. No-one who was a member of this parliamentary committee could have been left untouched by some of"" the evidence given about the complete and utter disproportionate power that is being used against many small businesses in Australia today. It must be remembered by this House that many small businesses-in fact, some 50 per cent-are operations run by one or two people and primarily they are members of the same family. We heard many moving stories of business people being unfairly treated, particularly by large shopping centre management. The most disturbing examples were those of shoddy tenancy agreements being made and the 'take it or leave it' approach used by many of the REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, 26 November 1997 centre managers employed by these large companies. The increase in rents and the personal family stresses were also continually mentioned by witnesses to the inquiry. For me, it was perhaps the most salient reminder that, whilst the economy is perceived to be growing, it is growing too slowly and many small business proprietors are feeling the enormous strain of that lack of growth. We have heard much from the government and in particular from the minister that, when we were a government in power, we should have done more. I can assure the House that we are still addressing the concerns of the small business sector, albeit from the opposition benches. A great deal of support from the small business community was delivered to the coalition at the last election. This government has been put on notice by small business that they are still waiting for the economic growth I mentioned and that was promised to them by this government. Most of all, however, small business want protection. As we have heard from the report, they want a balance between small business and big business. They want to be able to exercise their right to earn a living not dominated by large organisations which exercise enormous economic power against them. The government's bill is moderate in its desire to help small business. It is also moderate in its implementation of the recommendations of the fair trading report. The Labor amendments will strengthen the bill and make it a better piece of legislation. Primarily, our amendments utilise the term 'unfair' instead of 'unconscionable' in line with recommendation 6 of the Reid report. This will have the very beneficial effect of widening the catchment of small business, enabling them to utilise the legal mechanisms in seeking redress when the balance of power moves against them. That is why it is such an important amendment. Some people may say it is semantics, but ask those small businesses and they will tell you that it is a very important change that needs to be made. It is not being done because big business has got to the minister and made sure that the net is as narrow as possible. I would like to add my concerns of the government's greatest failure in passing the buck for responsibility for retail tenancy. Of all the evidence our committee received, the evidence on retail tenancy was the most compelling. The minister says the solution is to gather together the states and territories to get a common solution. However, it is common knowledge that the states and territories will be unlikely to agree on a national uniform retail tenancy code. I wish the minister well, but I tell him from bitter experience that what will happen is that all the states will agree to a national retail tenancy code and then all of them will say you have to adopt that particular state's model. Therefore, you will get no outcome. This is clearly an area which cries out for national uniform legislation. It is now time to act and to impose a solution upon the states. It has been nine years since we first tried to address this issue and nothing has happenedin fact, it has got worse. Voluntary solutions have been tried before, as I said, and the minister is fooling himself and the small business sector if he believes that the states and territories will be able to agree on common ground. This is simply and utterly a nonsense. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business claims to be providing nationalleadership on retail tenancy. Unfortunately, the legislation does not follow those words. The opposition amendments moved by the member for Cunningham will seek to introduce a retail tenancy code utilising the Commonwealth's corporations powers under section 51 of the Australian constitution. The code will require an independent market review jointly financed by the lessor and lessee. In line with recommendations of the Reid report, the code will include a precontract disclosure statement-one of the most important recommendations of the Reid report. Many people sign lease agreements without having adequate knowledge in order to make a considered judgment about entering into a lease. Further to the recommendations, the amendments will seek to ensure that, if there is a dispute, a step by step conciliation process will be available. It is important to note that we recognise that the onus is on the lessor to fix the conflict, ensuring a balance of power between the lessor and the lessee. The government, as I have already outlined, appears to have watered down its approach to these issues. The Labor Party recognises the importance of the small business sector to the community, and the weak approach taken by the government is not the answer. We often hear members opposite talking about the small business sector being the engine room of the economy. This is the micro business sector that they should be looking after. The government's bill is moderate in its implementation of the recommendations, to say the least. The minister is often quick to criticise but, unfortunately, not so quick to deliver. There are many things in the response to the Reid report where the government-and I am quite keen to say this-has done the right thing but, in retail tenancy, they have squibbed it. The minister continues to claim that Labor squibbed the hard decisions. Here is the hard decision for him because, as I have said, he squibbed the issue of retail tenancy. For far too long the small business sector has been ignored. Now is the time, as the report said, to restore the balance. The amendments moved by the opposition are reasonable and well judged. They are what the small business community requested. Therefore, I urge all members to support not only the bill but also the amendments moved by the shadow minister.",129
192,Mr CHARLES,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In the 1996 election campaign, the coalition said that small business had an important role to play in the creation of employment opportunities. With almost 97 per cent of Australian businesses being small business, it is important that their contribution to employment growth be facilitated. Small business created 65 per cent of the new jobs in 1995-96. In the first few months after taking office, the government moved quickly to reduce the red tape on small business through the small business deregulation task force. The government saw the need to form a policy and draw up legislation that would deliver more responsible business conduct, while offering small business real protection. Small business makes a substantial contribution to manufacturing and service exports. The Australian economy is increasingly involved and meshed in with the whole of the trading world. Globalisation of markets and technological change are escalating at an incredible rate. Business is faced with a barrage of information and regulation with the subsequent need to properly manage information and understand the regulatory framework within which business is conducted. With these considerations in mind, the government established the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology inquiry into fair trading, which was chaired by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Bendigo, Bruce Reid MP. Small business indicated they were concerned with existing trade practices and commercial standards, particularly in the franchising and retailing sectors. Many small business operators were, and still are, suffering. The fair trading inquiry quickly identified serious problems for small business in franchising, retail tenancies, petroleum distritransactions. bution, dealing with financial institutions and access to justice. The overall conclusion from small business was that many business practices were unfair. I will give an example of just how serious some of these problems were-and still are today. A Shell franchisee in my electorate was qlioted the following prices for fuel for full load deliveries made from 30 September to 3 October 1997: for unleaded motor spirit, Liberty Oil quoted 66.9c per litre and Shell, whom he is contracted to, quoted 72.16c per litre; for leaded motor spirit, Liberty Oil wanted 69.07c per litre and Shell wanted 74.33c per litre; and, for diesel, Liberty wanted 65.8c per litre and Shell wanted 72.14c per litre. How on earth do you expect that franchisee to operate and be able to give the consumers in his small town a fair break? Many friends of mine who live in that township of Emerald, one of the most magnificent, beautiful townships in our country-I say to the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay), who is at the table, that is Emerald in Victoria and not Emerald in Queenslandhave complained to me about the high price of fuel in Emerald. So they need to drive to Dandenong, Boronia, Ferntree Gully or somewhere else to get their petrol, which does not help the franchisee who is also my friend. In order to address the concerns raised, it was necessary to establish what indeed is 'unfair business conduct'. Current common law does not recognise specifically the concept of unfair conduct. There is a general understanding that concepts such as misrepresentation, undue influence, duress and unconscionable conduct would fall into the unfair category. At this point in my contribution to this debate, I should declare a personal interest in that I have in the past been a lessee and I am currently a lessor of several commercial properties-not, I might add, in a major shopping centre. After considering the Reid report, the government took the view that the Trade Practices Act should be amended to protect small business against unconscionable conduct in relation to certain small business This bill is not about protecting small business from the ordinary forces and commercial risks that are part of the cut and thrust of a competitive free marketplace. The bill is designed to bring about a change in large corporations' dealings with small business that will level out the playing field to provide a more equitable basis for business transactions across the business world. It balances fair trading with free trading. The definition of 'unconscionable' may be determined by taking into account the factors set out in section 51AC. It includes those matters currently listed in existing section 51AB, which prohibits unconscionable conduct by corporations against consumers. In effect, small business will have similar rights to that of a consumer in their dealings with a large corporation. The bill does not remove from small business the obligation to do their homework before entering into a business contract. For many people, moving into a small business is simply buying themselves a job. There is no doubt that over the years small business has often been the milch cow for banks and financial institutions, with homes securing business loans and overdraft interest rates at the top of the scale. But many small businesses are also not aware that banks be negotiated with not just when a loan required but at any time during a contract. How many small businesses, for example, contact their bank manager when sales are down and cash flows start to dry up? usually wait in fear and trepidation for the bank manager to ring them. In fact, the best way to deal with the ebbs and flows of business is to have a forward plan, be hardnosed about expected income streams, read all contractual documentation carefully and closely, including the fine print, always consider the worse possible scenario and communicate with your financial organisation. Flexibility and the ability to change direction are two of the advantages that small business has over big business if, and only the small business undertakes ownership them and uses these tools to best advantage. The explanatory memorandum to the bill states: The objective of this Bill is to address, or ameliorate the effect on small business of: information asymmetries in negotiation of contracts; inability to understand documents; unfair contract terms; unfair conduct within commercial relationagain, ships; and difficulties in resolving disputes in a cost-efficient manner. The bill does not provide relief for bad with. business decisions. A difference in bargaining power between parties is not on its own cause for claiming special disadvantage and invokcolleague ing a case for unconscionable conduct. Small business will, though, have access to protections readily available to consumers but without being limited to the supply of goods and services. The Reid committee identified a number problems in their consultation with small business, including inadequate disclosure, inadequate negotiations, lack of good faith and the need to be covered by industry codes of practice. The bill will address these probthe lems to ensure that the Trade Practices Act covers these areas in which most concerns 'have been expressed, including retail tenancy transactions, financing and security transaccan tions and franchising transactions. Because is retail tenancies are generally within the legislative domain of the states and territories, it is up to those governments to amend their legislation to provide greater protection for They retail tenants against unfair conduct. I note in this respect that the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), a former minister for small business and a member whom I greatly respect in this place, said in his contribution that we should have national uniform legislation. I have to point out to the House that the former minister had years worth of opportunity to bring in this national legislation and we have yet to see the first of it. The member for Rankin is a good, honest if, man. I think he probably did every bit of of negotiating that he could with members of cabinet to try to get something up that would give relief to small traders, small business people in shopping centres and franchisees who have to deal with large franchising organisations and are really powerless to affect the outcomes of their contract. I suspect that he tried to address the way that banks treat small businesses, because he brought down a very significant report in this place. Many of us spoke about that report again and because nothing ever happened. I suspect that he went to cabinet on more than time and one occasion with proposals to address the same issues that the Reid committee came up The member for Rankin was deputy chair of the committee under the direction of my Bruce Reid. After having been a minister for small business, he now supports those measures. What disappoints me is that he has said he wants uniform nationallegislation. The problem is that he does not know how to get it. He did not know how to get it of in the early half of the 1990s when his side of politics was in government and he does not know how to get it today. It is not possible, because the states have control over these issues. We are not going to tum the constitution upside down and all of a sudden invoke the external affairs power of the constitution in order to try to protect small business against the few. Not all major businesses or major shopping centres give small business a rough time. It is not true that they do. T-e-e are a few bad eggs in every basket, and It IS those few bad eggs that cause the problems. It is not the many, because they deal fairly and reasonably. But there are a few bad ones. Once they get going, they have so much power that they make the whole industry look bad. The member for Rankin knows that. He has asked for uniform national legislation to legislate against these matters. He knows that it is not possible, but he has no choice. Caucus decided that it would back the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) in the big amendments he wanted to make to this terrific bill brought down by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). The member for Rankin has no choice but to follow the party line. The Labor Party, unlike the Liberal Party and the National Party, does not allow dissent. Once caucus makes a decision, that is it; you are locked in for now, today, tomorrow and the day after. The Commonwealth government is working closely with the state and territory governments to develop a national set of principles to provide minimum standards for retail tenancy legislation. That is an important issue. We will work closely with them. The minister has experience in negotiating with the states in order to get consistency across jurisdictions with respect to the workplace relations legislation, which came into force on 1 January last year. I believe that his success in those negotiations will prove to be success in this issue as well, excepting that New South Wales",131
193,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,What state was that?,134
194,Mr CHARLES,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"New South Wales will probably continue to be a problem because the Carr government has an ideological problem in dealing in a fair manner with the Liberal Party and the National Party. What a shame. Some of the issues to be discussed with the states include pre-contractual disclosures, rental ratchet clauses, relocation and demolition, rent reviews, outgoings, lease assignments, disclosure of rental, plain English leases, and low cost dispute resolution procedures. These issues largely deal with the big regional shopping centres. . I said before that I own a few shops. In the last few years, my tenants have not had a rent rise of any kind whatsoever-none, zilch, zip. They will tell you that I have not asked them for a rent increase. Why? Because trading conditions are tough. The profit margins for small business are down. We know that life is difficult, and I felt an obligation to try to help their businesses survive, and that meant that I continued to get rent. I thought that was important. I am not saying that I am some paragon of virtue. Sure, I would like more money for the leases, but I am aware of the difficulties. A constituent of mine has a retail tenancy, a franchise operation, in a strip shopping centre and another one in a huge regional shopping centre. The difference in the negotiations he has with his two landlords is black and white. In recent negotiations, the big regional shopping centre wanted a 45 per cent increase in rent in one year. His negotiations with his local landlord are very amicable, with no problems whatsoever. A special ministerial meeting with state and territory ministers responsible for retail tenancy will be held in December this year to discuss national standards. Funding has been allocated to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to undertake test cases and representative actions on the new law. A franchising code of practice will be established, underpinned by and enforceable under the Trade Practices Act. A franchising policy council will be established to advise on the franchising code of practice, with dispute resolution mechanisms introduced into the code to minimise litigation and legal costs. A dispute resolution adviser will be appointed for the franchising industry to assist parties in resolving disputes, with a view to minimising-I repeat: minimisinglitigation and legal costs. Those costs often prove to be a barrier to small business seeking legal redress for unfair trading, and they always will be. The cost of legal action is beyond many small business traders. For many small business people, trading is simply their transferred PAYE income. Instead of working for an employer, they work for themselves, and frequently their income is less than it might be had they worked for an employer. They choose to work for themselves and they help to make this nation greater by doing so, but there are many times when life is pretty tough for them. When you trade with negative income for a while and have to live off retained earnings or borrow from a bank in order to eat, life ain't easy! In order to facilitate the process of businesses seeking redress, the government will develop an information kit for small business to promote alternative dispute resolution procedures. I am very supportive of the government's view that the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman and the banking code of practice should be extended to cover all small businesses, whether incorporated or unincorporated. That is one of the most important issues addressed in this legislation .. It is very important that the banking industry take some responsibility for small business. Take the bloke who has a little business while his wife stays at home to take care of the kids. He operates his small business out of his home and the bank takes his house under a mortgage in order to give him working capital to run the business. But the bank does not charge him the normal mortgage interest rate. The bank hikes it up four or five per cent",134
195,Mr SOMLYAY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,It is a risk loading.,135
196,Mr CHARLES,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Yes, but on top of that, if he gets in a bit of trouble and needs a bit of help, the bank turns the thumbscrews, and it does not matter what you do, it knows he cannot afford to go to court. He cannot afford the legal expense in order to solve his problem. The banks need the Ombudsman to sort out these problems for small business traders, just as though they were individual householders. This government is working closely with small business in formulating a package of reforms that will bring more balance back into the way business is conducted in this country. We believe absolutely in the freedom to conduct business in an open and fair marketplace with minimal government intervention. We have taken the responsibility to provide a legislative framework within which business can operate with confidence and certainty, in the knowledge that it is based on a fair go all round. The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 will provide real protection for small business against unconscionable business conduct of large corporations and provide the encouragement necessary for business to grow and generate job opportunities for Australians. I conclude by congratulating my colleague the member for Bendigo and my colleague the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business on an outstanding job-well done! Debate interrupted. NA",135
197,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being almost 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Unemployment",135
198,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I stand tonight to appeal to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) to show us that he can be a hero to the 800,000 Australian unemployed. Next week the Commonwealth Employment Service will shut down after 50 years of loyal and dedicated service to Australia: It will be replaced by what I fear will be a shambles. To try and convince us all that this is not a shambles, the government is about to embark on an $8 million advertising campaign with a theme song-wait for iturging the unemployed to 'search for the hero inside yourself' . Can you imagine the minister parading himself in front of the mirror repeating, as if it is a mantra from a New Age guru, 'search for the hero inside yourself'? I suppose Senator Vanstone was waiting for the drought to break, when she was the employment minister, to solve the unemployment problem. Maybe Dr Kemp hopes that by repeating this mantra the job numbers problem will be resolved. It is not a question of the government doing anything but merely repeating a mantra: 'Search for the hero inside yourself'. Maybe the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has consulted one of those kooky New Age Californian gurus while he was over at APEC and found this mantra as a solution to his leadership failures. Can't you imagine the Prime Minister, on the flight back from the US, walking up and down the centrepf the plane singing to himself: search for the hero inside yourself? Perhaps the Prime Minister even thinks that this mantra will save his leadership, be it from Peter Costello or Peter Reith, or in more recent times I read in the Melbourne Age, even Dr Kemp. I will give you a tip: the way those polls are going, no Californian guru's mantra or whiz-kid advertising jingle will help the Prime Minister's leadership. The polls speak for themselves. I must admit I have not seen the campaign yet, but the theme lines from this song suggest that once again we have a conservative administration laying the blame on the individuals: the unemployed and their families. Minister, why do you not search for the hero inside yourself by doing something to actually to try and reduce unemployment instead of cutting jobs and services, and wasting money on songs and self-promotion. That is what it is about: songs and self-promotion. Trend long-term unemployment is now one in three and it has risen every consecutive month since May of last. year, when they cut into the jobs programs that were put in place by the Labor administration. This government refuses to take any responsibility for the state of the economy. This government refuses to intervene in the economy to obviously try and kick-start it to get some confidence out there and get some job growth. This government will not grow the economy. The government will not create new jobs by sitting on its hands waiting for the market alone. The government will not grow the economy. The government will not create jobs by singing ditties about searching for the hero inside yourself. That is all it offers at the moment, a new 'song: 'Search for the hero inside yourself'. Dr Kemp has inherited from his predecessor-the minister he stabbed in the back, Senator Vanstone-a shambles in the new employment arrangements with significant private sector job placement providers refusing to take part in the scheme which starts in an interim form next Monday. More job losses for regional Australia-that is the end result of this proposal. I suggest to the House that Dr Kemp can be a hero to the 800,000 Australians by admitting there are problems with the privatisation of the CES, taking a deep breath and calling not for another theme song but for a review of all the new jobs programs to make sure that they will work and make sure that it is all legal. Dr Kemp, it is about time that you took a deep breath and repeated after me: 'I will be a hero to Australia's unemployed; I will not leave them in the lurch with a silly jobs placement program; I will review my predecessor's handiwork-Senator Vanstone, the minister I stabbed in the back.' Dr Kemp, it is about time that you searched for the hero inside yourself rather than pointing the finger at and blaming Australia's unemployed and their families, rather than withdrawing services to the unemployed from regional Australia, rather than putting, as from next Monday, another 3,500 workers and their families on the unemployment queues. One in three long-term unemployed is a disgrace. The CBS will be in a shambles. There will be no decent employment services and all the minister can offer is a theme song, 'Search for the hero inside yourself'. (Time expired) Close Encounters: The Truth Is Out There",135
199,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Bradfield) (7.35 p.m.)Aliens, Mr SPEAKER - they are out there! If you see me in the parliament or you see me on TV saying this, it will mean that I have been taken. My brain is now computer chip driven by aliens in the guise of my senior adviser, Mr David Young Paddock. I have decided to share my thoughts on this and come clean because they are coming to get me and take me to another world. My fear is that it will be one in which it will be necessary to think before speaking. That is why I am speaking here tonight. I want my follower and supporter to carry on any good and important work that I have been doing. And where one or more gather in my name, let there be fish and chips. Before I go, Mr Speaker, I want once and for all to leave my last medical testimony to this House: there is no medical or scientific evidence to support this nonsense that says breathing in fried fish fumes can affect intellectual processes, create feelings of insecurity, resentment of people you don't understand, and paranoia-no truth! But to my followers and those who think like me--other Australians-I say this to him: if my name appears in UFO Anonymous, if the sun rises on the first day of the month six months in a row, and if Channel 7's Witness program has a break for Christmas, you will know certain things that I now predict will happen: the United Nations will meet next year, migrants will come to Australia, and Aboriginals will say they are sick and tired of dying young. I speak the truth, Mr Speaker. But do not ask me to please explain. Please explain? This is me. It is not a figment. I think it is me; it may not be me in the future.

200,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The question is that the House do now adjourn. And may the Force be with you! . Taxation,137
201,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"Two weeks ago in his address to the Senate Economics Committee, Mr Brian Patterson, a partner with Coopers and Lybrand, produced a copy of the recently released Income, Tax Assessment Act 1997. He predicted that many accountants and staff of the Australian Taxation Office would return to using the tax act for the first time in years, as opposed to the Australian Master Tax Guide, as a result of the TLIP rewrite. However, he qualified his comment by noting that they would do so only until legislation like the Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deducti0!1s) Bill 1997 is enacted.  provisions are a 'massive retrograde step' that will 'set back the rewrite to 1936' because of their length and complexity. Comments like that are not unique. In fact, in the 40 months since.the introduction of TLIP, similar criticisms have been voiced with increasing regularity by the tax community. From the beginning, critics of TLIP have questioned the value in committing thousands of man-hours and millions of dollars to a rewrite of the tax act if it is to be made redundant by the eventual overhaul of the tax system. We know that tax reform is very much in the air and that the present government is committed to it-and more power to them. Equally as valid is the perception that the rewrite project will amount to nothing more than a white elephant if tax legislation which undermines the simplification process continues to be introduced into this parliament, as it has been only this week. When speaking of the rewrite of capital works legislation in the first TLIP instalment, Mr Geoffrey Lehmann of Price Waterhouse noted that the rewritten legislation was 'intended to be read by machines and not by human beings.' Soon afterwards, Mr Richard Humphry, Managing Director of the Stock Exchange, spoke publicly about the simplification of the Corporations Law. It was his opinion that the newly rewritten and supposedly improved Corporations Law 'would not stand up to any form of competitive analysis against internationallaw' because of its complexity. In December last year, the government released legislation that would see substantial change to the capital gains tax regime. While the legislation represented a significant win for the small business sector, the President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce :nd Industry noted that 'it came at the expense of some 25 pages of brain numbing legislative amendments'. Mr Samuel went on to ponder why the Australian Taxation Office continued to sponsor TLIP, given its incapacity to 'staunch the flow of legislative gobbledegook' in one single bill. It is widely agreed that the principles of simplicity, efficiency and equity are all essential ingredients in a tax system that accommodates the simple collection of revenue, whilst encouraging business profitability and efficient economic activity. The fact that every one of the above mentioned examples has been characterised as cumbersome and unnecessarily complex makes a farce of the entire TLIP project. In a letter to the editor of the Australian Financial Review in May this year, an academic from the Communication Research Institute of Australia observed: Since 1987, the ATO, in an attempt to contain its own costs, has had a deliberate policy of passing the burden of information complexity management onto the taxpayer. If his observation is indeed accurate-and I believe it is-and such a mind-set has embedded itself into the machinations of the ATO, then it is probable that we will continue to grapple with complex tax legislation like that of trust losses, capital gains tax and the Corporations Law. TLIP will not address the problem of our shrinking indirect tax base, nor will it make any inn Ads into the heavy compliance costs associated with it. It will not bring about any change to a system which falls most heavily on the PAYE taxpayer, nor will it reform our system which fails to effectively tax modern financial markets. However, it is likely that TLIP will improve the reading of the tax act and in this respect it should be supported. Mount Dandenong Primary School: 'Fly the Mountain'",137
202,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to speak briefly tonight about one of the really great primary schools in my electorate: Mount Dandenong Primary School. All my primary schools do a terrific job with their young students and I commend all of them. On Sunday 16 November, the Mount Dandenong Primary School, in conjunction with Jayrow Helicopters Pty Ltd, conducted a helicopter joy flight event designated as 'Fly the Mountain'. Three helicopters operating from Kalorama Recreation Reserve transported 632 p-ssengers over an eight-hour period, creating a new Australian and world record for passenger joy flights in a single day. The event was organised as a special Mount Dandenong Centenary activity and fundraiser. It was successful on both counts with the majority of community members availing themselves of the opportunity to see the mountain from the air and also achieving the fantastic fundraising total of $15,000. The day was a great local tourist promotion as well, with many businesses reporting that there was a great buzz. Planning for the event began early in 1997 and its success was due to the hard work of the helicopter subcommittee which was coordinated by Terry Swanson and comprised Judy Lambden, David Osborne, Ian Bowley, Greg Boot and Geoff Rowell. Local businesses assisted with sponsorship, and service groups such as the CFA and Victoria Police helped with security and crowd control on the day. School community involvement was at record levels with many parents, staff and students freely volunteering to assist with the erection and packing up of marquees, the transporting of materials and the selling of tickets and refreshments. The event was a truly unifying school community activity and a credit to all participants. Part of an article in a local newspaper said: One of the celebration highlights, seats on the helicopter joy ride shuttle service were sold out long before the event. Jayrow Helicopter's Brian Smith, one of four pilots flying during the day, said that in 35 years in business, the previous best Jayrow had ever done was lift about 250 people in a single day. I am sure his boss and my friend, Jack Rose, was absolutely delighted with the event. Jayrow, in communication back to Mount Dandenong Primary School and everyone else who was involved, said: We wish to express our appreciation for the very professional manner in which the ""fly the mountain"" day was conducted. We have been involved in many varied projects ranging from operations in the desert areas to the depths of Antarctica, and we found that very few would proceed as smoothly as did the ""fly the mountain"" day. We congratulate you on your successful day and we commend you for the efforts of everybody involved. Absolutely first class. We will also claim a record for a one day event. We have made inquiries around the industry and we are unable to find another operator who can beat the mammoth task which was carried out on S\lnday. Again thank you very much. Best regards Brian Smith General Manager-Operations May I say it was a fantastic day. The skies above Mount Dandenong were awash with rotor blades. I am sure that the parents, the students, the principal, the teachers and everyone involved, particularly the school council at Mount Dandenorig Primary School, are proud of their effort. I am sure they hope that it will be replicated in the year 2097. Good luck to them. They have done a fantastic job. I know that we all wish them well in the future. Hooray for a world record! BHP: Environmental Report  p.m.)-Last evening I read into Hansard my letter to BHP's Dr John Burgess relating to BHP's 1997 environmental report on Belmont wetlands. The response I received yesterday was not from Dr Burgess but from Graham Evans, who is the Group General Manager, BHP External Affairs and Company Identity. I am fascinated with his title, but the point I am making is that I wrote to the environment manager about an environment report and I received a reply from a different division altogether. It does remind me of Sir Humphrey, as I said last evening. Tonight I want to deal with some aspects of the reply that came back from Mr Evans. One section of his letter which I read into Hansard last night said: At the same time, we have also had to take into account the interests of our shareholders because the commercial potential of the site. This is the long section of wetlands between Belmont and Redhead in my electorate. As I have said previously, they are unique coastal wetlands that have been devastated over some five decades by BHP. They did not do it themselves; they presided over the devastation. BHPgained the mining rights to that area in 1923. They gained the surface rights in about 1963-and, as the older residents tell me, in dubious circumstances-for a peppercorn rental. I know from direct discussions with BHP that the land and the wetlands in question are not shown at any value in their books. They have got a zoning that does not enable anything to be done there, so it does not show at any value. Any gain from that site is fortuitous. I want to make the point that large corporations like BHP-not just BHP, but all those corpo-ations-do have community responsibilities. They, more than government, have to be seen to be doing the right thing in respect of our environment. I find it quite incongruous that BHP publishes a glossy environment report telling the world how wonderful they are in respect of the environment. When I think back to what I have seen on the television screen about Ok Tedi-and it comes back to my mind quite regularly-and what I see in my own area, I can see that what BHP is effectively doing is playing off the city of Newcastle against the city of Lake Macquarie. The wetlands area is in the city of Lake Macquarie, but BHP donates money to beautifying its own works in Newcastle; the wetlands at Kooragang, which are riverine wetlands off Newcastle harbour; and the Shortland wetlands, which are in the suburb of Shortland, not the electorate of Shortland. The Shortland wetlands is really a refurbished garbage dump; it was a garbage dump which was converted into a freshwater wetland. At the same time, BHP say they have to take into account the interests of their shareholders because of the commercial potential of the site. I ask: just how much interest must of the shareholders get? They mined underground, they have royalties from rutile rniniQg above ground, they have had revenues all the way through from the sale of sand and they are now seeking an exploration licence to research the area for heavy minerals. Another division of BHP is also trying to have the whole area rezoned for residential development. Mr Evans went on to say: What we have been trying to do, therefore, is to find a solution that accommodates ests squarely within the framework of the Company's core principles and policies that require us to act in a socially and environmentally sible manner. I appeal to them in the strongest terms that I am able to utter: yes"" please do that. Please have regard to the dividends that you have extracted year after year, decade after decade from this patch of unique coastal wetlands and make a contribution back to the community in that area from which you have drawn so much. The development that they are proposing to put in there is in response to them being able to hand over the area to open space. In that area involved they calculated out about 130 hectares overall that would go back to public use. What they are really counting is the highwater mark of the beach. The beach is several kilometres long and, because of the old AA act, the land title went down to the high-water mark. To suggest that the beach, the dunes and the area behind them are some generous gift from BHP is beyond comprehension. It is misrepresenting the situation completely. It is improper of BHP. The beach and its surrounds are public areas and belong to the people of that region. Through an anachronism they appear on the title of the original land grant back in the 19th century. BHP are actually giving nothing away. I repeat my appeal, as I will continue to do, and express myself in every way possible, that this area is unique. It can be refurbished to an international standard and we want it back. (Time expired) Second Sydney Airport",138
203,Mr BARTLETI,ADJOURNMENT,"Macquarie) (7.52 p.m.}-Last week I opened one of my local newspapers to find an article from the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) questioning my position on the Badgerys Creek airport proposal. While I appreciate her interest in an issue which obviously affects her constituents I was not impressed by her eagerness to come slinking into my electorate to try to score a couple of cheap political points, particularly considering the consistency of my opposition all these inter- to the airport. In fact, I wonder why the member for responProspect has not been so enthusiastic in attacking her own colleagues, who in fact have been very vocal in their support for Badgerys Creek airport. Why was she silent, for instance, when the member for Chifley  decision to build Badgerys Creek' and said it was 'something I have been seeking for a long time'? Why was she silent when the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) repeatedly berated the current government for not moving ahead quickly to build Badgerys Creek, or when the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) repeatedly stated his commitment to Badgerys Creek airport? Why did she not respond when the members for Barton (Mr MCClelland) and Blaxland (Mr Hatton) on a number of occasions over the past year criticised the government for delaying Badgerys Creek, themselves urging the government to get moving on Badgerys Creek? Why was she not critical of the repeated support of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) for an international airport at Badgerys Creek, for curfew free operations? And why was she not critical of him for then criticising this government for delaying the airport through conducting an EIS? Labor's position on this has been all over the place like a dog's breakfast. Particularly hypocritical have been local Labor MPs, exMPs and would be MPs, who took one position when Labor was in government but a different one now that they are in opposition. Despite repeated statements by Labor's transport minister over the years that they were planning a full international, no-curfew airport for Badgerys Creek, these same MPs are now deceitfully claiming they were thinking of something different. This is typical of Labor's cheap opportunism, typical of its lack of principle, typical of its cynical treatment of local communities. I have been consistent in my opposition to the Badgerys Creek airport proposal, both prior to the last election and since. I have repeatedly urged a consideration of other options and will continue to do so. If there is any chance of finding a more viable alternative, it must be given serious consideration. I have received close to 500 letters and a S,OOO-signature petition from concerned residents. I have met with local residents groups and have faithfully relayed their concerns to the relevant ministers. I will continue to do so. However, it needs to be noted that in contrast to the position of Labor, the coalition has been consistent in its position with regard to Sydney's second airport. It promised a full independent EIS, and that is exactly what it has been delivering. Further, for the first time in any Australian environmental impact statement, it has appointed an independent auditor to ensure the transparency, thoroughness and validity of the EIS process, a step that the former government would not even have dreamed of. Compare this with Labor's arrogance, with the comments of the then transport minister who said that Badgerys Creek would go ahead regardless of the findings of an EIS. Labor's position on this issue has been the same as it is on most issues, that is, they are, as usual, confused, chaotic and contradictory. Member for Capricornia: Reported Remarks",140
204,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (7.56 p.m.)I rise tonight to express my outrage and, I hope, the outrage of all members of the House at the comments of the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) as reported on the front page of his local paper in Queensland today. At a time when we are having discussions about the need for Aboriginal reconciliation with post-European settlement, I think it is really an outrage that a member of this House said, 'We should have settled with the Aboriginals for $20 and a packet of Jatz.' That is the sort of disgraceful performance which I thought that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) might have actually distanced himself from. To his credit, the Acting Prime Minister as the Leader of the National Party reprimanded the comments of Bob Katter during the election campaign in the lead-up to 2 March 1996. I think that the Acting Prime Minister has also shown in his stance on guns and on other issues such as racism that he is prepared to speak out. He has shown a commitment to speak out against the comments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). Unfortunately, however, maybe there is something that goes with being the current Pr-me - i-ister. Maybe, whilst he is Acting Pnme MInIster, he does not want to intervene in case he upsets the current Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), because the current Prime Minister has consistently refused to oppose the comments of the member for Oxley after her first speech. In fa-t, the Prime Minister gave a speech in Bnsbane about the principle of freedom of speech. Perhaps we are seeing that it is a disease which is contagious and that it is now acceptable for members of the government such as the member for Capricomia to speak about giving the original inhabitants of this nation $20 and a packet of Jatz. The original inhabitants of this nation in 40,000 years looked after this country in terms of its environment and the societies which they and their nations built up. I think it is an absolute outrage that we have a member of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs standing committee of this parliament making such a statement. It is that sort of statement which does damage to everyone of us. We are all diminished by that sort of racist statement. And it is not just we as a parliament but we as a nation who are diminished, because the eyes of the world are on us whilst we have - the debate about native title. I believe that there are very few people in this House who would agree with those sorts of sentiments. But the time i- right for leadership, and I call upon those tn the government to reprimand the member for Capricomia and expel him as they expelled the member for Oxley from the government parties.",141

But it is administration and implementation of aviation these two crashes and also that there were respect to the entitlements of de factos under aviation disasters.

It is important NA Wednesday, 26 November 1997 to understand that in many cases the owner of of the passenger services. Many times the aircraft the operator conducts the charter or the airline in effect, should be the holder of the insurance. provider of the passenger service? The interpretation given by regulators of the the carrier is the provider of the passenger service of providing insurance. This could cause the separate insurance policies for the same cover. be one claim, it is possible that the insurance themselves as to who is going to actually There is one aspect of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' to many operators and which is not and he alludes in detail to this ... the spirit of the Act which is to ensure passengers actual requirement of the Act The problem is that it is usual for the aircraft real problems. If the owner who already has hires that aircraft to the carrier, the current passenger liability insurance should be held by possible. The problem could simply be solved such as 'It is a requirement for the insurance by the carrier, but simply so that the carrier insurance is in place.' I return to the matter of the amount of $500,000 increased the insurance, I wonder how the $500,000. It sounds impressive-it is half a million of the victims of aircraft accidents so that been in existence if the passenger were still half a million dollars at bank interest at, say, of $25,000 per annum. This does not take into need to be paid out, the cost of education, or I find it timely to encourage people to consider and to seek advice on how best to protect investment, because the likelihood exists that amendment actually provides for. Furthermore, it would be important that have the right to take further legal action against amendment should include a clause which allows without the need to change the legislation. It need exists for continual adjustment. As time A good example of this is to look back and see to come before the House. It would be more efficient the Civil Aviation Safety Authority or whichever regulating this legislation, the option that the MAIN COMMITTEE 11411 the aircraft is not the operator and the provider is hired to the operator by the owner, and business.

(2) Will facilities incur deficits if they are required to meet the additional costs themselves. (3) Will the Government enable facilities to set fees to cover the costs referred to in part (1). (4) Will groups be able to claim an exempt status, opt out of the system and charge fees as they see fit; if so, does this concern the Government. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Government funding for residential aged care is a contribution to the cost of care. Under the previous nursing home system, providers were fully reimbursed for the salary on-costs they incurredprovided they kept full records and submitted a detailed annual claim form. This form, which was used to reconcile nursing and personal care staff costs as well as salary on-costs, ran to more than 30 pages. In contrast, under the previous hostel system, funding for salary on-costs was fully integrated the overall rates structure. Subsidies were not acquitted and providers did not have to put up with such a burden of red tape and form filling. The Government has simplified the administration of all residential care funding. Funding for all levels of care is paid as a straightforward, nonacquitted subsidy that addresses all the costs of delivering care for all categories of need. In the transition from the old system, funds that would have been paid to nursing homes to reimburse their salary on-costs have been incorporated into the rates for higher levels of care. The rates for lower levels of care continue to address salary on-costs in the same way as hostel subsidies did previously. (2) Salary on-costs are addressed in every category of the rates structure. They are not NA additional costs. Funding is paid continuously, as the costs are incurred. Former nursing homes will be protected from excessive deficits in the transition from full cost reimbursement by a system of capping losses. These caps will be initially set to protect the 5 per cent of homes with the highest costs, with the proportion protected reducing over 5 years as the caps are phased out. (3) No. All residents pay the same basic fee and additional fees are determined under an income test based solely on the capacity of a resident to pay additional charges. (4) It is open to service providers to withdraw from Commonwealth funding and regulatory arrangements and operate independently, as they see fit. This would necessitate opting out of the whole system, not single elements of it. There, would, of course, be consequences in such a decision for the approval of care places that they hold. It would be unlikely, however, for service providers to make such a decision, especially nursing home providers whose residents are mostly at the high care levels. The average Commonwealth subsidy for a nursing home is about $30,000 per place per year. Opting out may be a more realistic option for providers at the very low care levels (for example, there are significant numbers of supported accommodation houses, some of whom offer a level of personal care, outside Commonwealth funding arrangements). However, any reduction in the number of Commonwealth funded places in an area of need would be addressed by the planning system into which controls the allocation of new places. Tax A voidance: Trusts (Question No. 2358) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 20 October 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a speech by the Commissioner of Taxation in which the Commissioner indicated a strong desire to crack down on tax avoidance through the use of trusts. (2) Does he support the views expressed by the Commissioner of Taxation.",185
280,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of the speech given by the Commissioner of Taxation on 10 September 1997 that discussed the taxation treatment of trusts. (2) As I indicated in a personal explanation the House on 30 September 1997, the Government is always prepared to take appropriate action against abuses within the tax system, including through trusts. In the 1997-98 Budget. the Government announced that it would review the taxation of trusts to ensure that the taxation system deals with the modem day usage of trusts in an appropriate to manner, and does not permit tax avoidance or undue tax minimisation. The Government also announced that before such a review the Treasury and Australian Taxation Office would release a discussion paper outlining the relevant tax issues and broad policy options.",186
