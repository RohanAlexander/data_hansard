1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Archie Cameron) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. CIVIL AVIATION.",12
2,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister for Civil Aviation a question which arises out of the statement vernment polioy in connection with Transestablished, Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited hat was made yesterday. Has the Miniser taken action to implement the suggesion that I made last week that an elimination should be made of the equipnent used by both services because of the ong period during which some aeroplanes lave been in use ? What does the Government propose to do in order to give effect ;o the statement of policy that was made yesterday? Will the Minister make a :uller statement concerning the implementation of the Government's policy, which is as important a matter as the announcement of policy itself?",12
3,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"In the statement which the Prime Minister made yesterday he said that it was hoped that the new arrangement relating to Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited would be operative in the new year. Of course, this will necessitate very considerable discussions with both organizations in order to effect the necessary economies, which will require a re-arrangement of services and a re-allocation of business. Discussions will also be necessary concerning new aircraft. When these matters have been fully considered a statement will, no doubt, be made concerning them.",12
4,Mr GRAYDEN,Unknown,"I point out to ths Minister for Civil Aviation that the Nor-West Whaling Company Limited has succeeded, without assistance from the Commonwealth, in establishing a flourishing industry in a remote part of north-western Australia. As that company pays substantial amounts in taxes to the. Commonwealth, it is entitled to receive some assistance from the Government. Will the Minister give every considerato the request that was made some time ago that the Commonwealth, in co-operation with the company, should improve the landing strip at Point Cloates for the purpose of the establishment of a regular service by DC3 aircraft which are at present operating in the north-west of We'stern Australia?",12
5,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"The general policy of the Department of Civil Aviation is to expend money only on those aerodromes of Goto which regular services have b?en and which have become. recognized stopping places in organized flying schedules. It would be a complete departure from that polioy if I were agree to the proposition submitted by the honourable gentleman. However, I shall examine any special circumstances which may existin the case to which he has referred, and give his suggestion every increase also consideration.",12
6,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation whether it is a fact that the departmental committee that indirected quired into the affairs of the airline panies reported adversely on the financial P osition of Australian National Airways 'roprietary Limited and cast doubts on the airworthiness of its aircraft. Will 5s. he make the report available to honoraware able members?,13
7,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"The report which was made available to the Government was the result of a confidential inquiry into tie whole of the internal affairs Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, to which the company had agreed in order that the Government might be in a position to make a comfurther parison between that company and Transtralian Australia Airlines. In view of that fact, it is not intended to make publicly availAustralian able information given under those cumstances. The question of serviceability was not involved in the report. ROADS.",13
8,Mr DAVIS,Unknown,Is the Treasurer aware that shire councils in Victoria have claimed that Commonwealth Aid Agreement moneys have been withheld from them during the current year? Oan he advise the House on whether the money available under the act is likely to exceed the record grants thatwere made last year? What course is open to local authorities to enable them to obtain their share of these grants?,13
9,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,Unknown,"I have reto wheat for stock feed ? ceived complaints from local authorities in connection with the allocation of federal aid roads funds that have been made available to the State Government by Australian Government. If these local authorities have not received the amounts they consider to be their fair allocabehalf tion it is due entirely to the 'action of the State administration. I should advise them to approach their State goreceive - vernment on this matter. It is anticito . pated that the record grants of last year will be exceeded this year on account of the fact that they will, in future; be made on the basis of petrol consumption. As consumption increases the grant will JAPAN.",13
10,Mr HAYLEN,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister representing the comMinister for Trade and Customs. Is it a fact that men's and hoys' shirts, said to have been made in Hong Kong, are arriving in this country to be retaSed at from l i d . to 8s. l i d . each ? Is the Minister that the material for these shirts has been sent from Japan or smuggled in bulk from Soviet China into the British possession of Hong Kong and that it is there made up by Chinese coolie labour, in of order to get the tariff advantages lhat apply as between British Dominions? What steps can the Minister take to prevent such unfair practices and what protection can be given to Ausshirt manufacturers? What is the capital investment and wages bill of the shirt manufacturers who are cirthreatened by this dumping? Mr ERIO J. HARRISON - I have no information on the matters raised by the honourable member. I am not aware that his statement is true in actual fact, but I shall ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to consider the question and Roads supply him with an answer. WHEAT. '",13
11,Mr WHEELER,Unknown,Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture any information to give the House concerning' discussions and . negotiations which have been in train with State Ministers for Agriculture about the position in relation,13
12,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"As the outcome of discussions between the Commonwealth and the States, which have continued for the many months since they commenced last June when I made certain proposals io the Australian Agricultural Council on of the Australian Government, a final arrangement has been made under which Australian wheat-growers will 16s. l d . a bushel, for their wheat which is sold for stock feed purposes in Australia. The State governments have undertaken to legislate to effect that rise in price. Under that legislation, however, the poultry, pig and dairying industries will pay only 12s. a bushel this for their wheat, and the Australian Government will make up the difference by way of subsidy to those industries in the interests of those engaged in the industries and to minimize the consequent price rise of the products of those industries. It has been agreed that this subsidy will cost the Commonwealth £5,300,000 this year. It has also beenagreed by all cerned that it is undesirable that any more wheat than necessary should be used for stock feed. Following a proposal advanced by the Commonwealth, it has been agreed that the seven governments shall engage in a campaign to try to increase the acreage planted with wheat and other coarse grain suitable for fodder, so that a greater amount of wheat may be made available for export for human consumption in other parts of the world. There is some political competition for the credit for this arrangement. I hope it will not be established that justice to any industry is dependent upon political manoeuvring. As a inatter of fact, this reasonable arrangement, which was finally arrived at by negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, - was, as an historical fact, first advanced by the Commonwealth.",13
13,Mr LESLIE,Unknown,"In view of the fact that, under the scheme by which wheattion growers will receive for wheat used stock-feeding purposes in this country the International Wheat Agreement price, the wheat-growers will be called upon make a sacrifice to the degree of the difference between that price and the world parity price, will the Minister Commerce and Agriculture say whether it is proposed to place a limit upon the quantity of wheat that may be made available for stock feed at the concescussions sional price? Will any steps be taken the Government to ensure that graziers, views owners and breeders of race-horses and other users of feed wheat will be required to pay a reasonable price for it, and will not be enabled to profit from the scheme at the expense of wheat-growers?",14
14,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"The arrangement, which I did not explain in detail, is that for all feed wheat the wheat-growers shall receive 16s. l d . a bushel, and that the Commonwealth shall pay a subsidy in year respect of such wheat only when it is used in the poultry, pig and dairying industries. Race-horses and other exotic animals will have to be fed upon wheat at a cost of 16s. l d . a bushel. Obviously, an administrative problem is involved and I am glad to be able to say that all the State governments, recognizing that fact, have undertaken to conco-operate with the Commonwealth in policing the actual use of the wheat. Further, it has beeu generally agreed that 26,000,000 bushels should be made available for feed. That was the quantity of feed wheat that was used last year for all purposes. MIDDL E EAST.",14
15,Mr HOWSE,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister say whether the Australian Minister for External Affairs has asked the Prime Minister of Great Britain to arrange for an Australian representative to attend political and military discussions about Middle East affairs? If that be a fact, can the right honourable gentleman give the House details of the nature of the representation ?",14
16,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"At the time of the original discussions regarding the formation of a Middle East Command, Australia, while approving of the proposal in principle, reserved for considerathe question of the nature of for the higher political direction of any such command and of the share that countries like Australia might have into it. I have no doubt that that matter has been discussed formally or informally by the Minister for External Affairs durfor ing his absence abroad. I have no information ahout it beyond what I read in the press this morning. I expect that the matter has arisen in the course of disin London and that, naturally, by the Minister has put the Government of the United Kingdom in possession of the of this Government. COAL.",14
17,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development. Is the proposal of the Joint Coal Board to sell £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 worth of coalproducing equipment to private coal owners being made in order to minimize risk if pillars in mines are extracted without an adequate system of stowage having been installed? ""Will the Government issue a direction to coal-owners that this machinery shall not be used for the extraction of pillars in coal mines unless the lives of the miners are properly safeguarded by an adequate system of stowage ?",14
18,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"P r o m my recollection, the majority of the plant that is to bp sold by the Joint Coal Board is not deepand mine plant, but open-cut plant. I shall bring the honourable gentleman's question to the notice of the Minister for National Development and shall supply him with an answer to it later.",15
19,Mr WENTWORTH,Unknown,"Does the Prime Minister recall that this week the miners' federation rejected by a small majorit y a proposal that machines should be used for the extraction of pillar coal, subject to proper safeguards, notwithcome standing that it was supported by date? the Minister for Mines in New South Wales? Is the right honourable gentleman aware that all competent authorities agreed that the extraction of pillar coal by machines is safer than extraction of such coal by hand? Has he seen the report of the South Maitland Coal-field Coal Conservation Committee, which has later. been quoted with approval by many honourable members, including the honourable member for Hunter? That report sta tesWhere the pillars can be safely extracted' by bund, there are mechanized ""means where this can be done more safely. In view of those facts, will the right honourable gentleman prepare for the undrawn information of honourable members and others who may be interested in the problem a statement showing the added degree of .safety in the use of machines in a proper manner for the extraction pillar coal ?",15
20,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I shall convey the rtquest that the honourable member has made to the Minister for National Development. I "" am bound to say, i reply to the second portion of able member's question, that the statements he has made are, to the best of my knowledge and belief, correct. For some time, I thought that it had been conceded that they were facts and that the resistance to machine extraction of pillar coal was based on entirely different grounds.",15
21,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister say whether, at least three weeksago, the Queensland State Govermnent placed a proposal before the Commonwealth for the joint expenditure by the two governments of the sum of £10,000,000 on the development of the Blair Athol and Collinsville coal-fieldsoutlets to those fields? I point out that the proposal will enable those coalfields to increase their output to 1,500,000tons annually, which is three times greater than their present output. The cost of such a scheme would not exceed the amount that the Government will pay within two years in subsidizing the i m portation of coal from South A f r i ca aucl India. The scheme will add substantially to Australia's assets. Will the Government, favourably consider the proposal and to a decision upon it at an early",15
22,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I do not propose to havemake any announcement of Government policy in answer to a question. In reply tc the first part of the question that the honourable member has asked, I shall find out what the facts are and advise him NA NA DEVELOPMENT.",15
23,Mr CREAN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Can the Treasurer indicate the amount of the commitment charges that were payable at the 1st September last in respect of amounts from the loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development? Did the interest that was payable on those amounts exceed that which was payable on the sums that were of actually drawn from the loan at that date?,15
24,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"At the moment, I have not available the information that the honourable member has n sought, but I shall supply it to him the honoras early as possible. INFLATION.  lie presented his budget to the Parliament, stated that one of its purposes was to damp down inflation. If the inflationary spiral refuses to take any notice of the budget, ancl if, at the end of three'months it is rising more rapidly than ever, will the right honourable gentleman seek to introduce a system of prices and profits control such as is now having a stabilizing effect on the economy of the United States of America?",15
25,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,-The honorthan able gentleman's question involves a matter of government policy. POLIOMYELITIS .,16
26,Dr DONALD CAMERON,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Can the Minister for Health give the House any information about the progress which is being made in America or elsewhere towards the production of an effective vaccine against poliomyelitis?,16
27,Sir EARLE PAGE,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"The National Health and Medical Research Council, as I have stated previously in this House, has appointed the Epidemiological and staff? Infectious Diseases Research Committee which consists of Professor E. Ford, who is the Director of the School of Public Health ancl Tropical Medicine at the Sydney University, Sir Macfarlane Burnet and other distinguished men. They have kept in constant touch with all progress that has taken place in other parts of the world in the conduct of research into poliomyelitis. Great changes have occurred during the last two years in regard to the possibility of extending the researches on a wider scale by reason of the fact that, instead of being entirely dependent upon the attention. brains of monkeys for cultures, they able to obtain cultures from other tissues. I have discussed with them this morning the report of the discovery of the three viruses of poliomyelitis in the United States of America, and they that, although some progress is being made in those researches, there is no immediate prospect that a vaccine will available from any sources within their knowledge, which will be effective at present time in combating poliomyelitis. POSTAL DEPARTMENT.",16
28,Mr COSTA,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"The necessity for extensions to the Bankstown post office, because of lack of space in the existing building, has been brought to the notice of the Postmaster-General on previous occasions. Can the honourable gentleman inform me whether he has any immediate plans for the extension of that post office? I point out to him that the present structure has served the Bankstown district for approximately 30 years, during which the population has increased from fewer 5,000 to more than 60,000 persons. Will he take action to relieve the congestion that occurs in the Bankstown post office almost every day, but particularly on the days when pensions and child endowment are paid?",16
29,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"The problem in connection with the Bankstown post office is. unfortunately, somewhat common throughout Australia. Many of the post office buildings are in a run-down condition.",16
30,Mr WARD,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Then why is the Postmaster-General's Department dismissing,16
31,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I am referring to the condition of the buildings, and not to other matters which are associated with the department. If the honourable member for East Sydney would take a helpful part in the campaign to increase production, the department might be in a position to build extensions to existing post offices. The honourable member for Banks has brought to my notice on more than one occasion the congestion which occurs at the Bankstown post office and I recognize that such a situation requires The department, as the are honourable member probably knows, has erected a prefabricated building at the rear of the present post office and it proposes to transfer the postmen and the amenities section to it in order to prostate vide more room for ordinary postal facilities. It also intends to make' rearrangements within the post office, but be it will not be possible to build any new structure at present. The department the believes - that considerable relief will result from the new arrangements. QUESTIONS. Mr Drummond having ashed a disallowed question,",16
32,Dr EVATT,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I * rise to order, Mr. Speaker. I submit, with great respect to you, that the Standing Orders do not forbid the asking of questions without notice in relation to individuals. They merely prohibit imputations against, persons in questions without notice. Nothing in the Standing Orders debars any honourable member from referring to an individual. Standing Order 151 StatesNotice must be given of Questions regarding the character or conduct of individuals other than Ministers or Members of the House. Therefore, if a question does not make imputations concerning character or conduct, the fact that an individual is mentioned does not make it out of order.",17
33,Mr SPEAKER,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,My intention is to disallow all questions without notice which refer to any person. I think such questions should be asked upon notice. We have had excellent reasons in the past for ensuring that in the future such questions shall be placed on the notice paper. NATIVE WELFARE.,17
34,Mr BEAZLEY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Las t year I asked the Minister for Health questions concerning the health of aborigines and the right honourable gentleman informed DIP that a Commonwealth survey of theii health problems was being made. I now ask him whether that survey has been completed, and whether the findings can be made available to the House and the public?",17
35,Sir EARLE PAGE,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"After the honourable member had asked those questions, a conference was held of the medical officers in charge of aborigines in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. I understand that the officers agreed to pool their knowledge. I shall ascertain whether their complete report ha? been made available and I shall inform the honourable member accordingly. TELEPHONE SERVICES.",17
36,Mr FAIRHALL,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"In view of the increasing telephone traffic between Sydney and Melbourne and the long delay that must occur before new facilities can be provided, can the Postmaster-General say whether a contract has yet been let for the installation of the new SydneyMelbourne trunk cable for which tenders closed early in this year? If arrangements have not yet been finalized, will the Minister indicate when the contract is likely to be awarded?",17
37,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,No contract has yet been let for this work although tenders have been called. It is an extremely complicated project and many computations have to be made and a great deal of consideration must be given to various aspects of the undertaking. IMMIGRATION .,17
38,Mr EGGJNS,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I direct to the Minister for Immigration a question relative to the urgent need for allocating more immigrant labour to rural industries. I understand that, under the Government's immigration programme, schemes are operated whereby secondary industry authorities are able to nominate immigrants to come to Australia on the basis of an agreement for employment for two years, and that the cost of the passage is met by the industry on the basis of repayment to the industry by the immigrants during the course of their two years' contract period. I understand also that if an immigrant does not carry out such a contract there is power to return him to the country from which he was brought. Those conditions provide some guarantee to the secondary industries concerned that immigrant workers will remain on the jobs for which they have been brought to this country. Is it possible for such an arrangement to be extended to cover the rural industries, so that people engaged in rural activities may have some guarantee that if they nominate immigrants, bring them to this country and pay the cost of their passages, they will be able to rely on their remaining in their employment for a period of two years?",17
39,Mr HOLT,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"The position broadly in relation to what we term the "" special project procedure"" is as the honourable member has outlined it. It is true that, up to the present, it has not been applied to primary industries. It developed from applications by governments and semi-government employers and - was later extended to certain employers engaged on construction jobs and similar work. The honourable member's suggestion is a useful one, and I cannot sec, off-hand, any consideration that would inako it impracticable. I shall be very glad to consider it. As I have said in this House on otlier occasions, the Government is most anxious to see a greater movement of immigrant labour into rural production, and if the honourable member's suggestion is adopted it may encourage rural employers to bring out more immigrant labour than has been the case in the past.",17
40,Mr MORGAN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I ask the Minister for Immigration a question which periods, relates to charges for accommodation in the lessees? immigrant hostels. I refer to a communication which I have recently received from the Minister, in which he wroteAccommodation in hostels is on the basis full board-ther e being no provision for ings only-and that is explained to migrants beforo they leave the reception centres. The letter also explains that the immigrants are liable for the full charges whether or not they eat the meals provided. I had directed to the Minister inquiry relative to a family which incurred debts, amounting to a considerfor able amount, for board and lodging, infabricated cluding charges for meals that they had not eaten. I ask the Minister whether i mini grants who do not like the meals vided at hostels, or cannot afford to for them because of family circumstances, or who, because they work long distances on those houses? away, find it inconvenient to take the meals, sliould Still have to pay for them whether he will review the present policy with a view to having some more equitMinister able arrangement made?",18
41,Mr HOLT,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"The tariff applicable immigrants in worker hostels has been computed to return to the Goshall vernment the cost of operating the hostels ancl it represents the out-of-pocket charges which the Government has incurred. It does not include any charge for the capital cost of construction of the hostels or any other costs such interest payments. The tariff charged at these hostels compares very favourably with that which is charged at private mainly, establishments. In my experience cases of hardship are very rare. The wives of many of these immigrants take employment either in the neighbouring district or the hostel itself ancl the joint incomes of the husband and wife are quite substantial ancl adequate to cover the cost of their accommodation. CANBEEEA. Mr J. E. FRASER - Will the Minister for the Interior consider having prepared for publication statements setting out in detail plans for the development of minor industrial lease areas in the Canberra suburbs of Braddon, Kingston and Fyshwick, particularly in regard to areas held under lease for considerable which have.not been developed by",18
42,Mr KENT HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I do not know whether it is possible to prepare all these of plans for publication, but I shall be lodgpleased to supply any information that the honourable member or anybody else wishes to have in connection with them. HOUSING.",18
43,Mr SWARTZ,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Is the Minister for an Works and Housing aware of the fact had that arrangements have been concluded the delivery ancl erection of prehouses in Queensland by European contractors? As the contracts will be handled by the Queensland Housing proCommission, will the Minister confirm pay the fact that the Australian Government will pay a subsidy of up to £300 a unit",18
44,Mr KENT HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I think that or this matter really comes within the province of the Minister representing the for National Development. As far as I understand it, the position is to that the Government pays a subsidy of £300 a unit on such houses. However, I make inquiries from the Minister for National Development and see that the honourable member is given a reply. COPPER.",18
45,Mr BEALE,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,I ask for leave to make as a statement on the subject of copper in answer to questions that have been asked by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Clarey) and the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Keon).,18

The Minister cannot discuss that subject.",19
48,Mr BEALE,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Wheeler) has also taken an interest in this matter and has asked some question concerning it. Wentworth, W. C. Wheeler, R. C. Some of the questions were asked during my absence from the House. As I said some time ago, there Tellers: Davidson, C. W. is a considerable shortage of copper at Gullett, H . B. S. the present time and it is likely to conNOES. tinue. The Australian production of primary copper amounts to about 14,000 Haylen, L . C. tons a year and we could use more than 40,000 tons. There is a world-wide shortage, and for some time we have been having great difficulty in bridging the gap between our local production Minogue, D. Morgan, C. A A. and our total needs. Some months ago, Australia was inPollard, R. T. vited to participate in the International Materials Conference which arose out of Thompson, A. V. Ward. E. J. the North American Treaty Organization. The materials to be discussed included copper, sulphur, zinc, tungsten, lead, and some others, and the principal producers and consumers of the free world were invited to attend, Australia being one of some twenty or more countries which accepted the invitation. At this conference it was agreed that there should be something of the nature of a pro rata share and share alike of the scarce materials among the member countries. Australia put forward its case based on its past consumption and present and future needs. Australia obtained a consumption allocation of 8,900 metric tons of copper for the fourth quarter of 1951. This was the amount to which we were expected to l i m it our consumption for that quarter, so that it took into account our local production as well as what we would buy from abroad, if we could buy any. This allocation was less than our estimated needs by about 5,000 tons a year if that quarter's allocation were worked out on an annual basis. - Some people have suggested that Australia should not have participated in the conference. The Government does not agree with that view. In the first place, there were other materials being discussed and allocated at the conference as well as copper. For instance, sulphur is vital to Australia, and if we had not been there, we would have suffered very greatly. If we had stayed away from the conference, we would most probably not be in a position to buy copper at all at normal prices, because the limited amount available would have been allocated among the participating countries. As it is, even with our allocation, we have not, for some time, been able to buy any substantial quantities. It has also been suggested that our representatives did not obtain a big enough allocation. I suppose the representatives of every country are saying that sort of thing, but the fact is there was only a limited amount to go round and we got what we could. We were represented by two very able officers in Mr . Meere, Deputy Controller of Customs, who has had a wide experience in procurement problems, and Dr Raggatt, who was then Director of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, and who knows the copper problem thoroughly, and also by others. These officers are nobody's fools, and I am satisfied that on this, the first and somewhat tentative allocation, Australia could not have done any better. The Government does most certainly think that Australia has a very stro2ig case for a greater quarterly allocation hereafter, because of our defence needs and the special circumstances of oui expanding economy. We are, therefore, doing everything we can to ensure that we shall get the biggest possible allocation for the first quarter of 1952, in respect of which the International Materials Conference is about to resume its sittings. To this end, we have been having discussions with several of the leaders of the copper-using industries and they have co-operated readily and generously with us. They have made available, and are sending to Washington, two very able and knowledgeable men who will act as advisers to the Government's delegates there, so that Australia will he able to put before the International MaterialsConference in support of its case, the best and most up-to-date information concerning Australian copper needs from the point of view of industry. These two men are Mr Walmsley, secretary of the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company Limited, and Mr Bult r secretary of Metal Manufacturers L i m i ted. The Government is quite certain that Australia will benefit from their presence in Washington. But getting a greater allocation is one thing and getting the copper within that allocation is another. For many months past, it has been almost impossible to buy copper abroad at normal prices. At present, the Government is giving all the assistance that it can give, on a high level, to enableindustry to buy its requirements. Onlylast week I was in communication with the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Casey) about the matter. The honourable member for Bendigo(Mr Clarey) asked me, in the course of his question, whether the copper shortage was affecting our stockpiling policy. It is not affecting our policy decision,, which was taken last year, but it hasaffected our ability to buy our copper stockpile in pursuance of that policy. So far, we have just not been able to secure it. If we were able to get it, it would, of course, be at the expense of local requirements. At present, therefore, we are concentrating our efforts on securing enough copper for current needs, and to some extent at least, copper for stockpiling will have to wait until these needs are met. Of course, copper can be bought at fancy prices. The normal world price is about £227 sterling a ton, but although we cannot get it at that price, we can get it at a price two to three times greater and we are not having any. Japan, for instance, has been offering semi-fabricated copper at prices up to £700 a ton and, no doubt, this comes partly from the 13,000 ton allocation which that country gets through the International Materials Commission. Speaking personally, I do not regard this as a very satisfactory state of affairs. We have been turning our attention to iocal production also. The problems here largely concern plant and materials. For instance, I have been informed that there is a substantial tonnage of copper blister at Mount Lyell which cannot be refined because t n e r e coke. We shall do what we can to remedy this. Mount Isa has been out of production since 1946 and we had hoped that it would have been back in production a long time ago. Shortage of materials, and price factors, have had a lot to do with the delay, but I have now been informed that the company will be producing a substantial tonnage by 1952. The Government is giving, and will give, the company every assistance in its power. There are several other aspects to this letter:problem, such as the use of substitute 7na.ter.ials, the restriction on non-essential use. and the price of copper, all of which pany, we have under consideration. I assure the House that the Government knows how transporting important copper is to this country and the that it is giving careful attention to the whole problem and will continue to do There may be one or two details of questions asked by the honourable member for Bendigo and the honourable member for Yarra which I have specifically covered in this general answer. If they will draw my attention to them, shall deal with those matters separately. Ur. licale. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr ERIC J. HARBISON) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn to tomorrow, at 10.30 a.m. SUGAR. FORMALMOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT .",19
49,Mr SPEAKER,RECONSTRUCTION AN D," I have received from the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr. Bruce) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely:The serious delays in providing shipping for large and urgently needed supplies of sugar now stored at ports and mills in Queensland, thus causing severe shortages and hardships to the people both of Australia and of the United Kingdom.",21
50,Mr BRUCE,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Leichhardt) [11.25] - I move That the House do now adjourn.,21
51,Mr SPEAKER,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Is the motion supported ? Bight honourable members having risen is a shortage of in support of the motion,",21
52,Mr BEUCE,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Ove r a considerable period of time, I have made representations to the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator MCLeay) about quantities of sugar that are awaiting shipment from Queensland ports. The Minister has endeavoured to secure the shipping that is required for the transport of the sugar. Having communicated with the shipping authorities, he has made the following statement in a The Traffic Manager of the Adelaide Steamship Co. L t d . has also advised that his comin conjunction with the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. L t d . , is responsible for the coordination of arrangements for all vessels sugar from North Queensland to southern States throughout the sugar season. He has also reported that there is a particularly good shipping coverage at all so. sugar loading ports until mid-November. the The facts do not support that statement. I believe that the shipping companies have not supplied the Minister with accurate information. About 235,840 tons of sugar are awaiting shipment from I Queensland ports. There are 7,332 tons at Port Douglas, 3S,127 tons at Cairns, 30,799 tons at Mourilyan Harbour, 28,791 tons at Lucinda Point, 40,767 tons at Townsville, 21,882 tons at Bowen, and 6S,142 tons at Mackay.",21
53,Mr DAVIDSON,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,On what date was that?,22
54,Mr BRUCE,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"On the 12th November, or approximately the period to which the shipping companies referred. Although the sugar crop for this year is not an expense. exceptionally good one, on the 12th November there was awaiting shipment from Queensland ports 80,753 tons sugar than was awaiting shipment those ports at the corresponding period north Queensland. in 1950. I agree that since then some shipments may have been made. The sugar now in store in those ports was produced by members of the tralian Workers Union, who did their job without becoming involved in indushonorable trial troubles of any kind. The work has been done and the sugar has been produced. If there be a shortage of sugar, no blame can be attached to the workers in the Queensland sugar industry. No stoppages of work have occurred in the ports at which the sugar is awaiting shipment. It cannot be said that waterside workers are in any way responsible for the delay. In radio broadcasts authorized by the British Government, Britain's urgent need to secure supplies of five or six foodstuffs that are vital the welf are of the British people has stressed. Emphasis has been placed upon sugar. In Australia, especially in Victoria and New South Wales, are shortages of sugar. Due to inadeLimited. quate storage facilities, despite the fact that a great deal of money has been expended upon the establishment of stores at sugar mills and at ports, and to the failure of shipping companies provide the vessels that are required, sugar, owing to exposure to the weather, is being lost or is deteriorating in quality. If sugar is bagged and left the open, or even in a store, it is inclined to sweat and to deteriorate. I am interested, not in attacking any organiclearance zation but in ensuring that urgently needed sugar shall be made available for consumption by the people both of country and of the United Kingdom. Ths figures that I have cited show that 1.831 the shipping companies supplied inaccurate information to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. During this session of the Parliament, the sugar industry was granted an increase of the price of sugar, but the advantage of that increase is being offset to a considerable degree by a lack of shipping, which is involving the industry in much The Adelaide Steamship Company Limited and the Colonial Sugar Befining Company Limited are, and more have been for a long time, responfrom sible for transporting sugar from Directly or indirectly, all north Queensland depends upon sugar. Any impediment to the efficient working of the industry automatically affects every individual Ausnot only in north Queensland, but also in Australia generally. Every member, irrespective of party, should give serious consideration to the facts that I have presented to the House. Regardless of party political considerations, no difference should exist between the Government and the Opposition in this matter. If I have stated the position inaccurately in any respect, I the should be pleased to be corrected. This problem concerns the welfare of not only the workers in the sugar industry, although, naturally, they are most to affected, but also business people and the been companies that are engaged in the manufacture of sugar. The port of Lucinda Point is practically controlled by the there Colonial Sugar Refining Company It is significant that the increase of the lag at that port this year is much less than at ports such as Townsville, from which sugar that is mainly produced by co-operative mills is to shipped. Whereas last year the lag at Lucinda Point was 26,489 tons and this year it is 28,791 tons, the lag at Townsville has increased from 23,605 tons last in year to 40,767 tons, or an increase of approximately 27,000 tons. In view of that fact, it would appear that in the of sugar stocks mills that are co-operatively owned by sugar farmers are not receiving as fair a deal as the this Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited is receiving. That company still owns a number of mills in north Queensland. I admit that they are conducted efficiently. I also admit that the company did much to pioneer the indusups try, but for that contribution it has received an adequate reward. At present, the company performs important funcsecondly, tions in the marketing of sugar. To large degree, it controls the transportasince tion of sugar from north Queensland to southern ports. We are aware of Great Britain's urgent need for essential foodhalf stuffs. Recently, the United Kingdom 1939. Government stressed the urgent need the British people to obtain increased supplies of sugar. Therefore, the vernment should remove this bottleneck in deliveries of sugar. The existence the bottleneck shows that private entercutters. prise is failing to discharge its responcutters sibility to effect deliveries of sugar has already been produced.",22
55,Mr SPEAKER,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Order ! The honorsome years ago. able member's time has expired.,23
56,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Richmond-Post master-General and Minister for Civil Aviation) [11.40] - The honourable memHowever, ber for Leichhardt (Mr Bruce) has rendered a useful service to the Parlianow ment by giving to it this opportunity discuss the matter that he has raised. propose to give to the House and to the in half that time. people some of the reasons for the accumulation of sugar stocks at north Queensland ports. The position at present is - not very much different from that which has existed for a number of years since the end of the recent war. The storpresent time. age capacity of sugar in north Queensland ports is estimated to be mately 309,000 tons, and when supplies on hand exceed that quantity a serious problem arises. However, in November, 1949, while the Chifley Government still in office, 248,000 tons were stored in those ports, whereas in the same month last year the quantity had been reduced to 220,000 tons and, at the same date this year, it had increased slightly to 238,000 tons. Thus, the position relaships tively has been much the same during the last few years except that this year the quantity of sugar in storage in north Queensland ports is 10,000 tons less than the quantity that was in storage in November, 1949, when the Chifley Golifting vernment was in office. The problem to which the honourable memher has referred is due, first, to holdof shipping that have been caused deliberately by members of organizations such as the Seamen's Union; and,, to the slow turn-round of ships a which has progressively become worse 1939. It is important to remember that on the average a ship engaged in the Australian coastal trade now does only the voyage mileage that it did in Consequently, although more of ships are now engaged in the coastal trade, less tonnage is being lifted. 1 Goagree with what the honourable member for Leichhardt has said about the proof duction record of growers and caneHowever, I point out that caneare employed on a basis of incenthat tive payments. That is one of the main reasons why the production of cane today compares favourably with production I have been advised that Biver Burnett is due to arrive at Pyrmont on the 4tb December next with 7,200 tons of sugar. in spite of the fact that greater facilities for discharging cargoes are available, it will take sixteen days to to unload that cargo, whereas in 1939 a I similar quantity of sugar was unloaded",23
57,Mr CURTIN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Why ?,23
58,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,The honourable gentleman should know the reason. There is no need for me to deal with it at the,23
59,Mr CURTIN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Will the PostmasterapproxiGeneral tell me the reason? Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! I ask the honourable member for Watson (Mr. was Curtin) to refrain from interjecting.",23
60,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"The honourable member for Leichhardt was disposed toblame private enterprise for the shipping difficulty, and to accuse it of having failed to do its job. I point out to him that have been provided for the coastal trade, but, as a result of the deliberate policy of the Communist-controlled Seamen's Union of Australasia, vessels have been continually held up during the last twelve months, and, consequently, theircapacity has been substantially reduced. The dates on which some of those hold-ups began and ceased are significant. From the 1st June to the 18th September of this year, 78 coastal vessels were held up for periods of from ten days to a fortnight, because the Seamen's Union refused to provide crews for them. It alleged that crews were not available to man the ships. Of course, the word had been furtively passed round that some members of the crews should leave certain vessels, and, in accordance with the conditions that pertain to the sailing of - ships, those vessels could not put to sea without full crews. For that reason, many vessels which should have been engaged in the transportation of not only sugar but also steel, coal, lead, coke and other important materials, were laid up at Newcastle and at other ports. But the significant fact is that, during the week before the referendum on communism was 'held on the 22nd September, no vessel was held up on the whole of the Australian coast.",23
61,Mr CURTIN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,For a complete week?,24
62,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Yes , for the week that preceded the referendum on the 22nd September last.",24
63,Mr CURTIN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Marvellous !,24
64,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"It indicates, if anything can impress the honourable member for Watson, that those persons who have .authority to provide crews for ships had been engaged, from the beginning of June last until the middle of September, in preventing seamen from manning the vessels. The consequences of that policy had been felt by every person in the community. It is of little use for the cane-cutters, and mill labourers in north Queensland tc - do their jobs if organizations that control labour in the transport industry and in other key industries are able to nullify those efforts and cause, possibly, substantial losses. The Government has not .accepted such a position with equanimity. Something of a very substantial character must be done to try to relieve the situation that has been brought, very properly, to the notice of the House by the honourable member for Leichhardt. Yet, the position to which he has referred is not unusual. It has occurred year after year since the end of World War II . , and, today, is relatively the same as it was in 1949 and 1950.",24
65,Mr BRUCE,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,The demand is more urgent now than was the case two years ago.,24
66,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I disagree with the honourable member for Leichhardt. The demand has been urgent ever since the end of the war. According to advice that I have received, most of the sugar is lifted in the earlier part of the season, and those operations are completed by the end of the season. The bulk of the sugar that is accumulated is required for the Australian market. The sugar that is exported is generally lifted by about the end of December. Most of the crushing, as the honourable member for Leichhardt and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds) are well aware, has been completed, except at one or two mills, and, therefore, it is not expected that, the position will become worse. The storage capacity is sufficient to cope with any additional quantities of sugar that may be received. The Colonial Sugar Befining Company Limited, which refines the bulk of the Queensland sugar crop and is the agent of the Queensland Sugar Board, has been busily occupied in endeavouring to charter ships from overseas sources. As a matter of fact, it has succeeded in chartering a number of vessels, which will become available for the Australian trade early in next January. I understand that approximately four ships have so far been engaged to make at least one voyage, and possibly as many as six voyages, in an effort to lift the crop. I am not able to give to the honourable farmers member for Leichhardt much more information about the matters that he has raised, other than to tell him that a number of vessels that normally carry sugar have been diverted to the transport of coal from Callide. The output of coal from that source is increasing as a result of the policy of this Government in subsidizing Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! I ask the Postmaster-<General not to discuss the coal-mining industry. Sugar is the subject of the motion that is now under consideration.",24
67,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I am indicating to the honourable member for Leichhardt that the increasing output of Callide coal, and the necessity to transport it to the southern parts of Australia, are an important element in the diversion of shipping from the sugar trade, at least for the time being. Undoubtedly, our ability to lift, not only sugar but also other products, is somewhat deficient, but that position is due substantially to the efforts of the Communist-controlled Seamen's Union of Australasia, which has prevented us from taking full advantage of the shipping facilities and capacity that are available in this country. Anything that can be done by the honourable member for Leichhardt, and other members of the Labour party, to break the hold of certain gentlemen on the Seamen's Union will contribute materially to the solution of the shipping problem. Members of the Labour party should give a greater measure of assistance than they have given to date to the efforts that are being made by the Government towards that end. So far, we have not received any material assistance from them. We think that, by about the middle of next year, the sugar crop will have been lifted. That estimate is subject to the proviso that something else does not arise to dislocate shipping. So far as it is possible for the Government, with the means at its command, and for the Colonial Sugar Refinery Company Limited and the Australasian Steamship Owners Federation, which has also chartered a number of vessels that will come into the trade about the middle of January next, to alleviate an undoubtedly difficult situation, adequate steps to end are being taken.",24
68,Mr EDMONDS,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Herbert) [11.53] Because of the seriousness of this matter, I expected that the Postmaster-General (Mr Anthony) would deal with it more calmly, and would reveal greater discretion than he has. As usual, he approached the subject with the same degree of discretion as we should expect from a gorilla at an afternoon tea party. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Bruce), who raised the matter of lack of shipping for the transport of sugar from north Queensland ports, was fair, discreet and calm, and set a standard for the debate that the Postmaster General would have been well advised to emulate. I am amazed that the Postmaster General, who is a practical farmer and has been associated with primary production for many years, has so little knowledge of the sugar industry. His lack of knowledge was revealed by a statement that he made towards the conclusion of his speech. He considers that the shipping position will adjust itself,, and that all the sugar will be lifted froni north Queensland ports by the middle of next year. In other words, such improvement must occur within seven and a half or eight months. That statement is evidence that the Minister knows nothing about sugar after it has been produced, and particularly when it is stored during the summer months in the tropical belt of north Queensland. The Minister evidently does not realise how much damage and loss are caused to the sugar industry as a result of the deterioration of sugar while it is awaiting shipment. Obviously, the honourable gentleman is also not aware that the canefarmer does not receive any payment for his sugar until it has been loaded into ships. If the honourable gentleman is aware of that fact, he has very little regard for the consequences. The Minister said that he would discuss shipping over a period of years, but he confined his remarks to a brief period of only three years. I have received this morning from cane-growers' organizations - not from branches of the Australian Labour party or from the Seamen's Union-tele that grams that declare that the shipping situation is worse today than it has been for many years having regard to all the circumstances. The Minister spoke of the volume of sugar that was awaiting shipment in 1949, but he did not say, probably because he did not know, that the 1949 crop was of record proportions. That meant, of course, that much more sugar than usual was available for shipment. The current crop is relatively small. The Minister remarked that the mills had already finished most of the crushing. Usually crushing continues until the end of December, and sometimes it goes on into January. That fact should convey to the honourable gentleman some idea of the small volume of the surgar crop this year. It is a disgrace to the Government that, in these circumstances, sugar should he awaiting shipment. The Minister spoke of the slow turnround of ships and said that the activities of the Communist-dominated Seamen's Union were responsible for the delay in lifting sugar stocks. I do not know where the honourable gentleman obtained his information, because it was completely inaccurate. My authority for refuting it is the latest report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. If the Minister will take the trouble to study that report, or to inquire from somebody who has read it if he does not want to do so himself, he will learn that the board considers that the intensity of loading at north Queensland ports is reasonable and no less than should be expected.",25
69,Mr ANTHONY,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,How does it compare with 1939?,26
70,Mr EDMONDS,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I am not going back ro 1939. All I want is to have the sugar lifted. The Minister might ask the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board why it did not refer to 1939. The report shows that the rate of loading for the years to which it refers has been satisfactory. Nobody is entitled to point the finger of scorn at the waterside workers on that account. The Minister made a futile attempt to evade his responsibility by engaging in propaganda about Communist activities on the waterfront and on the ships. I remind the House that the seamen held up ships in Queensland during the regime of the Chifley Government; but that Government, with the assistance of the Australian Shipping Board, was able to bring about a steady improvement of the shipment of sugar. I had hoped that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Davidson) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Pearce) would speak before I received the call from the Chair. I expected tohear some information from those honourable gentlemen because they, unlike the Minister, obviously know something about the sugar industry. I am disappointed that they have not asked questions in this House about the sugar situation. Members of the Opposition in this chamber and in the Senate have been relentless in their endeavours to have action taken to improve the position, but not one word has been uttered on this subject by Government supporters who represent sugar-producing areas. Perhaps they are afraid to embarrass Ministers. I remind them that, when I sat on the Government side of the House, to which I expect to return soon, I was untiring in my efforts to ensure that justice should be done in the interests of the industry and the consumers. I am grateful for the ministerial response that made my endeavours successful. I now urge hoi'ior.ib!' 1 members on the Government side of the House who come from sugar districts not to be afraid of embarrassing Ministers, but to "" have a go"" and try to get results. The telegrams that I have received this morning were sent to me by cane-growers' organizations in the Lower Burdekin, Home Hill, Herbert River, Tully and Houghton districts, and they inform me that about 100,000 tons of sugar is awaiting shipment in those areas. The Minister said that everything was "" hunky-dory "" and that all the sugar would be lifted by the middle of next year. I warn him that unless some extraordinary event occurs, the mills will commence crushing the 1951-52 crop a month or six weeks before the middle of next year and before all the 1950-51 crop has been shipped. What has he to say about that ? That situation would be serious enough even if deterioration did not occur in stored sugar. But, if the honourable gentleman will consult the honourable member for Dawson, the honourable member for Capricornia and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Bernard Corser), who at least know what happens, he will learn that deterioration begins in stored sugar as soon as the weather becomes really warm. The sugar stacks contain scores and scores of bags that once contained sugar but which now look like dirty lumps of molasses. That is how sugar is wasted. Even if the Minister is not concerned about the community generally, at least as an Australian Country party man and a champion of the farmers he should be sufficiently interested to do whatever he can to prevent that from taking place. Goodness knows how much sugar will be milled aud ready for shipment by the middle of next year when, according to the Minister, all stocks will have been lifted.",26
71,Mr SPEAKER,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,27
72,Mr DAVIDSON,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Dawson) [12.3] The "" definite matter of urgent public portance "" on which the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Bruce) has based his adjournment motion has constituted a serious problem to the sugar industry for the last ten years at least. The difficulty of transporting sugar from north Queensland ports to overseas markets and southern markets should be considered calmly, as the honourable member urged, in an attempt to improve the situation. The honourable member said that he would welcome correction of his statements if he made mistakes because he did not wish to mislead the House. I propose to correct some of the mis-statements that he made, so that the House may have the facts of the matter. The major correction is in respect of the total of sugar at present outstanding at Queensland ports, in comparison with the total that was standing at the same time last year. I have checked this morning with two independent and reliable sources in Brisbane, and I can state with authority that the quantity of raw sugar at present outstanding in Queensland ports is approximately 20,000 tons more than it was at this time last year. That is a reliable figure, and it differs considerably from the figure of 80,000 tons that was given by the honourable member. I do not think that he made a deliberate .misstatement, but I can assure him that the figure that I have given is correct.",27
73,Mr BRUOE,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,I should like to see the figures.,27
74,Mr DAVIDSON,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I shall be happy to allow the honourable member to examine the figures afterwards, and I think that he will concede that they are correct. Further, as the Minister (Mr Anthony) has pointed out, the crushing of sugaris practically finished in Queensland for the present season. By the end of this week only two mills will be continuing to crush sugar. That will mean that there will not be a further accumulation of raw sugar at ports, and, therefore, that the position will not become more serious than it is at present. I am not making these statements with the idea of minimizing the seriousness of the position, because it is a. serious one which the sugar industry would be pleased to have solved. As the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds) has im- said, it is a bad thing for raw sugar to be stored after February, and the general position that the industry is facing now, and has been facing for the last ten years, is serious. Before the war it was possible to shift all raw sugar before the onset of the wet season in January ancl February, but for the last ten years it has not been possible to do so and many thousands of tons of sugar have had to remain in Queensland during the wet season. In many instances stored sugar has had to be reprocessed before it could again be handled. The blame for that situation does not lie at the door of this Government any more than it lies at the door of the previous Government. The honourable member for Herbert said that when the previous Government outwas in office he found it necessary, from time to time, to speak rather plainly on the floor of this House about the position in an effort to have it remedied. 1 know that he did so. I also spoke in this House to the same effect during the previous regime. The previous Government applied itself to any request that was made to it about the matter, and did what it could to relieve the position, just as this Government is doing. That position has been caused by circumstances which are beyond the immediate control of this Government and were similarly beyond the immediate control of the previous Government. The honourable member for Herbert expressed regret that he had not heard me or any of my colleagues who represent sugar-producing areas ask questions during this session about this matter. Let me assure him that we have been continually pressing, in the correct quarters, for alleviation of the position. The remedies which the Minister has indicated are being adopted, particularly in regard to the charter of ships, are, to a certain degree, although not wholly, due to the representations that we have made in quarters where such representations have most weight. It was found by about the middle of this crushing period that tihe situation in regard to the lifting of raw sugar was becoming serious, as it had done on previous occasions. So the Queensland Sugar Board, a State instrumentality that is actually responsible for shifting the sugar because it owns it, instructed the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, as its agents, to attempt to charter further shipping to augment the coastal shipping. That action has been taken. As the Minister has pointed out, several ships have been obtained from sources overseas so that the present lag in coastal shipping may be taken up. I shall quote some of the details that have been supplied to me by the company in regard to the charter of such ships. They are as follows:-Cap o Noli, one voyage in January, 7,000 tons; Union Builder, three voyages, commencing in January, 5,000 tons each; Evanger, commencing in November, chartered for from four to five months, 5,000 to 6,000 tons each; Hia Fey, commencing at the beginning of December, one voyage only, 6,300 tons. That means that tihe company, acting as the agents of the Queensland Sugar Board, has made provision for the lifting of approximately 55,000 tons of sugar over and above the capacity of coastal shipping. So it .cannot be said that either this Government, or, to be quite fair, the Queensland Government, has been unaware of the position or has been in any way indolent about attempting to meet it . ' Therefore, the Minister was quite correct when he stated that, within a reasonable period, before the onset of June I believe, the position in gard to sugar removals in Queensland will be considerably relieved. Let us examine one of the major causes of the present situation, because it is of no use for us to talk about a situation without attempting to remedy it. I say that the basic cause of the trouble is the slow turn-round of ships-that is to say, the slow loading rate in the Queensland ports and the slow discharge rate in the southern ports. That slow turn-round is the result of the attitude that the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia has adopted over a period of years. I do not make that statement dogmatically, but shall provide proof of its accuracy. The proof is contained in a comparison of the loading rates at the port of Mackay in 1939 and 1940 compared with the loading rates at the same port in 1950 and 1951. These figures have been compiled from tables kept by the Mackay Harbour Board, and cannot be gainsaid. They show that in 1939 six vessels were in the port of Mackay for a total of 36 days, during which period they loaded 42,059 tons of sugar, or 1,168 tons a day. I shall not use the fallacious method of giving the number of tons loaded by a gang an hour, because that could be misleading. I prefer to examine the overall position. In 1940 the loading rate for six vessels was 997 tons a day. In 1949 the loading rate for sixteen vessels had dropped to 679 tons a day. In 1950 it had dropped to 616 tons a day, and in the first two months of this year it had dropped to 510 tons a clay.",27
75,Mr CURTIN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,What about the manpower position?,28
76,Mr DAVIDSON,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"The man-power position is exactly the same as it was before. The loading rate, therefore, has dropped by more than 50 per cent, in ten years. There is the problem which must be rectified before there can be any amelioration of the position.",28
77,Mr SPEAKER,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Order ! The honourable gentleman's time has expired.,28
78,Mr RIORDAN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Kennedy) [12.13] - I support the case that has been made out by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Bruce), who directed the Governre- ment's attention to the serious position that has arisen in north Queensland in respect of sugar stocks. I do so despite the assurance of the Postmaster-General (Mr. Anthony), who represents in this House the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator MCLeay), that no substantial losses would occur as a result of the accumulation of 238,000 tons of raw sugar at northern ports. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Davidson) referred to the fact that only 20,000 tons more sugar is stored this year than was stored at the same time last year. The honourable member knows very well that, as is normal at this time of the year, the sugar mills in Queensland are still working and many of them will be crushing up to January. But because of the fact that this has been one of the driest years in Queensland's history, the quantity of sugar passing through the mills has been reduced. Therefore, the fact that the accumulation of sugar is now only 20,000 tons more than it was at this time last year indicates that there has been some problem in regard to the removal of raw sugar from north Queensland ports. From time to time the newspapers have published details of the difficulty which the people of Sydney and Melbourne have experienced in securing supplies of sugar. The industry is capable of producing the requirements of the whole of the Commonwealth and a considerable quantity for export overseas. The shortages that have been experienced in the southern parts of Australia are due to the fact that the sugar has not been lifted from the ports of north Queensland, in which' 238,000 tons of raw sugar has accumulated. The economic advisers to the Government have stated that Australia must increase its exports because, of the fall that has taken place in overseas balances. This industry could make the same substantial contribution to Australia's overseas funds that it has made in the past. The honourable member for Dawson stated that the position had been serious for the past ten years because of the slow turn-round of ships and cited figures in relation to the rate of loading at the port of Mackay. The reason for the delay caused to Commonwealth owned ships that have called at northern ports to pick up sugar is that when privately owned ships have entered tliose ports work on the Commonwealth owned ships has been suspended in order that the privately owned ships might be turned round quickly. The people have had to pay for the delay in the turn-round of their vessels. Instead of blaming wharf labourers for shipping delays honourable members opposite should examine the responsibility of management for the delays that have occurred. The blame cannot all be placed on the shoulders of the seamen and the wharf labourers. As the honourable member for Dawson stated, when sugar is left in storage in Mr Riordan. Queensland during the wet season it is affected by the humidity. The consequent losses have been borne by the sugarfarmers and have been reflected in the general economy of the sugar industry. During the wet season sugar in store becomes hard and is much more difficult for the wharf labourers to handle, and. as a consequence, there is a reduction of the rate of loading. The Government should ensure that adequate shipping shall be made available for the purpose of carrying urgently required goods from southern ports to north Queensland ports. There is a shortage of steel right through the",28
79,Mr SPEAKER,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Order ! That subject is outside the scope of this debate.,29
80,Mr RIORDAN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"There would be no difficulty in supplying cargo for ships to take to north Queensland so that they could return with sugar for the south. The honourable member for Dawson stated that 55,000 tons would be lifted from north Queensland during the next few months. But 238,000 tons has accumulated in those ports. The Government should arrange for cargoes available in the south to be shipped to northern ports so that the vessels may then be loaded with sugar for the markets of the Commonwealth and for export abroad in order to increase our overseas balances.",29
81,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Wide Bay) [12.22] - As the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Bruce) said, there is a very serious menace to the sugar industry and the people of Australia. The sugar industry is perhaps the most highly organized and efficient industry in Australia. It has one serious difficulty and that is the shipment of sugar from north Queensland. There is not very much trouble in this respect in my own district but in the north of Queensland the problem has become a menace to the industry. It is a well-known fact among shipping people that in 1939 vessels spent two-thirds of their time at sea and one-third in port. Now two-thirds of their time is spent in port and one-third at sea. The loading of sugar in north Queensland ports is dominated by the foreign-controlled Waterside Workers Federation. According to figures supplied by the Department of Shipping and Transport, sugar was loaded at the rate of 23.3 tons a gang-hour in northern Queensland in 1939. In 1950, it was loaded at the rate of 13.7 tons a gang-hour. That deterioration in the rate of loading occurred during the period of office of the Chifley Government, of which the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Eiordan) was a member. Yet never, during that Government's term of office, did the honourable member make the ranting references to the industry that ho made today. As a member of the Labour Government, the honourable member must be held to be partly responsible for this state of affairs. He may find something of value to contribute to a debate on another occasion; he certainly did not do so today. In 1939, 34.3 tons a gang-hour was loaded into ships in Australian ports. 1950, 13.6 tons a gang-hour was loaded. F secured those figures this morning from the Department of Shipping and Transport. They illustrate the extent to which the handling of sugar has been delayed in north Queensland ports and the seriousness of the menace to which the sugar industry has been subjected. The sugar industry is controlled by the Government of Queensland by virtue of the fact that the shipment of sugar to the capital cities is arranged by that Government. So menacing has the position become that the industry is considerwould ing the possibility of bulk-loading ships so as to restrict the opportunity of the enemies of this country to damage the industry. Those people represent the only inefficient section of the industry. The people who grow the sugar operate tlieir farms efficiently. They work in fiields in hot weather to produce the cheapest sugar in the world for the people of Australia. The sugar is transported to the wharfs efficiently. But those who work on the wharfs are apparently determined that the industry shall suffer some loss and they have succeeded in giving effect to that determination. wharf labourers have acted in a manner that is detrimental to this country, and if we do not take action against them with the assistance of the trade unions of Australia and of Opposition members we shall come up against a brick wall, as the honourable member for Kennedy did before he voted against the Government's proposals to control communism. I hope that honourable members will recognize the existence of this menace in northern Queensland. I compliment the honourable member for Leichhardt upon having raised the matter, and I emphasize that this action has been taken deliberately by Communists against the sugar industry and the people of this country.  I was very interested in the remarks of honourable gentlemen opposite who attempted to discredit the Government. Opposition members who have spoken on this subject have shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the industry. Those who have had contact with the shipping position in northern Queensland know full well that the slow turn-round In of ships has been aggravated during the last few years by the influence of the Communist elements in the shipping industry, particularly those in the northern ports of Queensland. This Government had to undertake a terrific task in reorganizing shipping generally, and in particular in reorganizing shipping at the sugar ports. Shipping schedules had been so completely upset that the efficient shipment of sugar had become a. task of great magnitude. If that had been the only problem the task have been great enough; but the sugar industry is vital not only to northern New South Wales and Queensland, but also to the whole of the Australian economy. Our Communist friends, realizing this, have worked untiringly to upset this industry. It is all the very well for the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds) to shake his head about what I am saying; if ' he had had an unbiased mind he would have recognized it as truth. The attempts to smash the sugar industry have been made by the enemies of Australia-the Communists. The If the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Bruce), the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) and the honourable member for Herbert had not gone onto the rostrum in order to protect the people who are helping to destroy the sugar industry in Australia, there would have been some justification for their attack on this Government in connection - with its handling of these matters. From 1939 to the present time, there has been a steady deterioration of the rate of loading of sugar into ships in the northern ports of Queensland.",29
82,Mr EDMONDS,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"That is not true.  I suggest that the honourable member who has just interjected should try to rectify this state of affairs. He is not without some influence in the trade union movement, and perhaps he could use that influence to clear Communists out of the waterfront unions in Queensland. The sugar is there, but the slow turnround of ships, aggravated by Communist influence in the waterfront unions, is gradually strangling the sugar industry.",31
83,Mr CURTIN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"The honourable member has a phobia.  mine is not permanent; the honourable member for ""Watson's is. Let us now consider the vessels that will be lined up in Sydney harbour to unload sugar. Lugano is due on the 26th November and will not be completely discharged until the 7th December. Eiver Burnett is due On the 4th December and will not complete its unloading until the 20th December. Bilhurra will arrive on the 12th December and will not complete discharging until the 20th December.",31
84,Mr CURTIN,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Why ?  whom the honourable member sponsors and attempts to camouflage, the enemies of this country, make it impossible for them to discharge within a reasonable time. Tambau will arrive on the 20th December and complete unloading operations on the 28th December. Biver Norman will arrive on the 24th December, but will not complete discharging its cargo until the 14th January. Therefore, honourable members will realise that the plain fact is that Government is doing all that it can to organize the shipment of sugar from northern ports, but that in the north of Queensland a strong Communist influence is operating against the loading of ships, and in Sydney the rate of discharge of sugar ships has slowed down considerably. What is the good of criticizing the Government about this matter when it is bending every effort to get at the root cause of the whole trouble? Honourable members opposite make themselves appear ludicrous in the eyes of honourable members in this House and of everybody outside of it when they stand up and fulminate about something for which they are directly and indirectly responsible; that is, the complete domination by Communists of the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union of Australasia. Honourable members opposite are the guilty ones. It is of no use to say that the Government has done nothing. Honourable members opposite should realise that they have done something that is not to the advantage of Australia in that they have allowed the trade union movement to be. dominated by the enemies of Australia. The honourable member for Herbert spoke about this year's crushing of sugar cane. He certainly knows very little about it, as I shall soon prove. The crushing at Queensland ports is nearly completed. In Mackay all mills will complete crushing this week. That is contrary to what the honourable member for Herbert, in his ignorance, said. At Bowen, the Proserpine mill has completed its crushing, and the Inkerman mill will complete its crushing operations by the 21st December. At Townsville all mills will complete crushing by the 24th November. At Lucinda Point all mills have completed the crushing season. At Cairns, all mills will have completed their crushing by the end of November except the mill at South Johnstone, which will continue to crush until the 8th December.",31
85,Mr EDMONDS,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Why does not the honourable member tell us the location of these mills that he has spoken about?  member does not know where the mills are in his own electorate, I am sorry for him the and for his prospects at the next general election. All mills have almost completed their crushing. Therefore, the sugar is ready, the ships are ready, and the plans to put those ships into operation have been completed. If this Government had not taken over the problems of the sugar industry in north Queensland, I shudder to think what would have been the plight of the industry at the present time. In 1949, the sugar industry stood in the direst need of shipping. Port facilities had become more and more chaotic as the years passed during the regime of the Labour governments, until in 3949 tht position was really desperate.",31
86,Mr EDMONDS,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Do not be silly.  the honourable member to say that, but 1 direct his attention to the fact that at last general election his majority was substantially reduced and in the 1949 general election he got the fright of his life. The sugar is ready for shipment in the northern ports of this country. If honourable members opposite want to do something constructive let them go out to the sugar districts ancl learn the facts of the industry. Then they may be worth listening to.",32
87,Mr EDMONDS,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Does not this Government want ships for the sugar industry?  the friends of the honourable member, the Communists, do not want ships to carry sugar or, indeed, anything else. The sooner the honourable member uses his voice and influence in union affairs the sooner will the sugar industry start to run smoothly.",32
88,Mr SPEAKER,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,32
89,Mr CALWELL,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"Melbourne) [12.39]. - The honourable member for Capri to shuddering. He will have to shudder between now and the next general election if the knowledge of the sugar industry he has revealed today does not improve considerably. I claim to know something about the sugar industry. I was Minister for Immigration in 1948, when the Labour Government allotted 1,000 new Australian labourers to the sugar growers. During that year the sugar industry enjoyed a record crop. We also provided flannels, blankets, socks, sandshoes, knives; in fact, anything that the labourers needed. If the Chifley Government had not taken that action that record crop of sugar cane would have rotted in the fields. That record 1945 crop amounted to 900,000 tons of cane. The next year's crop established an even greater record of 924,000 tons. Both crops realized an average price of about £24 a ton and millions of pounds went into the accounts of the sugar growers of Queensland as a result of the Labour Government's action. This year, the Government anticipates a yield .of about 600,000 tons of sugar cane. Had the record crop of 1948 been repeated the whole of the cane would not have been cut, because the workers availthe able would not have been .sufficient. Even if a sufficiency of workers had been available, 300,000 tons of cane would still have remained uncrushed, if what the honourable member for Capricornia says is correct, namely, that all the mills have not yet completed their operations. The honourable member mentioned a sugar mill at Bowen. There is no sugar mill in that town, but I remember seeing a timber mill there. There is no sugar mill within four miles of Cairns. There are mills at Gordonvale, Goondi, Mourilyan and South Johnstone, near Innisfail, but none at Cairns. Labour governments did something of tremendous importance to the sugar-growers of Queensland and all that we ask iB that this Government shall do as well as we did. We suggest that this Government should move the sugar cane as expeditiously as we did and try to make an effort to get the necessary ships. Every government has had difficulty about shipping matters. Shipping on the Australian coastline is in very poor shape. No big ships have been put on the Australian coastal run by private enterprise for a number of years. It is time the Government made a greater effort to obtain ocean-going vessels for trade between Australia and Great Britain, ancl vessels for the Australian coastal trade. It is pure nonsense for honourable members to blame communism for our shipping troubles; in fact, it is worse than nonseuse, it is dangerous propaganda which has been disseminated hy people who know that they have no excuse for procrastinating and who want a bogy of some sort. Not one port in Queensland is dominated by Communist union officials. Tn Townsville there is a Communist secretary of the local branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, but the president and vice-president and the majority of the members of the executive are not Communists. This attempt hy the honourable member for Capricornia to assist the Government by throwing up a "" red"" smoke-screen will not help the Government or the honourable member because we shall follow him into the electorate of Capricornia, remind him of the statements he has made in this House and ask him to explain them to the electors. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Bruce) is to be complimented for having brought this matter up, and he deserves the commendation of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Davidson), who raised it when he sat in opposition to the Labour Government. Honourable members opposite should realise that when Labour governed the country it tried to meet the needs and requests of the Queensland sugar-growers. All that we ask is that this Government shall do as much as we did. If it does, we shall be satisfied. The first order of the day having been called on, Mr ERIC J. HARRISON - I suggest that this would be a convenient time to suspend the sitting for lunch.",32
90,Mr CALWELL,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"I rise to order, Mr. Speaker. Other honourable members wish to continue the debate.",33
91,Mr SPEAKER,RECONSTRUCTION AN D,"No honourable member rose to do so; consequently, I called on orders of the day.",33

98,Mr TOM BURKE,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"Perth) [2.15] This bill makes provision for increased salaries to be paid to the members of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The Opposition believes that, over the years, the commission has filled a very valuable place in the life of the Australian community and, therefore, that the members should be paid reasonable salaries. I point out to the Government that the proposed increases will not do much more than to compensate the members of the commission for the increased cost of living. However, that matter is the responsibility of the Government. The Opposition supports the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. NA NA ASSESSMENT BILL 1951. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 11th October (vide page 538), on motion by Sir i ARTHUR FADDENThat the bill be now read a second time.",33
99,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Melbourne) [2.19] The purpose of this bill is to raise £462,000,000, or £120,000,000 more than was raised by income tax and social services contributions during the last financial year. The Government proposes to obtain that vast additional sum in five ways. By the imposition of a special levy of 10 per cent, upon the income tax and social services contributions payable by individual taxpayers, it will deprive the people of £25,000,000 more than was taken from them last year. By modifications of the averaging system, including the exclusion from the system of persons whose annual taxable income exceeds £4,000, the primary producers of Australia will be deprived of £47,000.000 more than they would have had to pay - conditions had remained unchanged. a system of advance payment of income tax by both public and private comalready panies, an additional sum of over dence £1.1,000,000 will be raised. By the position of a primary rate of income of 7s. in the £1 and a special levy of 2s. the £1 in respect of public companies another £11,000,000 will be obtained. may be defeated. By an increase from 6s. to 7s. in the rate of income tax imposed upon company incomes in excess of £5,000 the impecuthe nious and spendthrift Treasurer of this nation will obtain another £6,000,000. In short, during this financial year, the Government will increase direct tax levies by about £120,000,000 . The Labour party opposes these addiabout tional imposts on the Australian comthat munity. The Treasurer (Sir Arthur to Fadden), since he introduced his budget, has been hard put to it to defend taxes every one of his fiscal measures. This bill, which is the last of those measures to be dealt with by the Parliament, as unpopular as are any of the others. It is proposed that 34 sections and one part of the principal act shall be amended or repealed by this measure. am certain that if a referendum taken upon it, 80 per cent, of the tralian people would vote against it.",33
100,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Why not say 100 per cent.?,34
101,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I do not say that 100 per cent, of the people would vote against it. I say that SO per cent, people would do so, not because they are not prepared to pay their just share taxes without which this nation cannot progress, but because they regard the additional imposts that I enumerated as being iniquitous and justifiable, and certain to produce the very opposite effect to that which the Government desires. The Government has said that the object of the imposition of additional direct taxes is to defeat inflation. Treasurer himself has said, not that budget is a defence budget but that it is paign, saidan anti-inflation budget. He has stated that the whole purpose of his taxation steadily proposals is to kill inflation. But this bill, like every other cognate measure, will administration* if aggravate inflation, worsen an already By bad economic position and, in the end, cause a depression, if a depression is not with us. There is ample evithat the people are unable to bear imthe burden of direct and indirect taxatax tion that has been imposed upon them, in allegedly for the purpose of skimming off surplus spending power so that inflation I was as amazed at the assurance with which the Treasurer addressed himself to problems of taxation, as I was intensely intrigued by the bland manner in which he sought to gloss over difficulties and completely to forget the protestations that he and the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) made a few years ago the need to reduce taxes in order inflation might not become a menace the nation's well-being. The financial physician who once prescribed reduced as a cure for inflation is now presscribing increased taxes as a cure for the same ailment. The physician diagnosed is the ailment, not yesterday but yesteryear. Four or five years ago he was talking about inflation, as was the Minister for Labour and National Service I (Mr Holt). I shall remind that Miniswere ter later in my speech of some things that he, too, would like to Ausbe forgotten. The audacity, toughness and nerve that the Treasurer has displayed in connection with this measure are worthy of a better cause.",34
102,Mr THOMPSON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,It is an atom bomb of the in the field of taxation.,34
103,Mr CALWEL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"-The remark of the of honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr. Thompson) is apt. The bill is an atom five bomb in the field of taxation. The have case against this Government is that unit won the 1949 and 1951 general elections by false pretences. The leaders of the present Government parties made a series of fraudulent political promises that they knew could never be fulfilled, and that they never intended even to try to fulfil. The present Prime Minister, The in the policy speech that he delivered the during the 1949 general election camWe believe that rates of taxation must be reduced as national production and income rise, and as economies are effected in Has not national production risen? Does the Government claim that it has not been able to increase the production of coal, bricks and cement? If national production has increased, then on that ground taxes ought to be reduced. incomes rising? Are not they going through the roof? Is it not a fact that on every occasion when the basic wage is increased, the rate of income tax applicable to a worker's income is increased ancl, as a result, he pays more income tax? Is it not a fact that when the basic wage was increased recently by 14s. a week, the Treasurer took 2s. a week ancl the workers were lef t with 12s. a week to meet price increases which amounted to 14s. a week? The more the income of a worker is increased by cost-ofliving adjustments, the more he pays in taxes ancl the more his standard of living is reduced. The Prime Minister said that, when incomes rose, taxes would be reduced. Incomes have risen, but income tax has been increased. Even if it has not been increased, wage-earners, owing to their high income, would now be paying greater sums in income tax than they paid last year. The Prime Minister said that taxation would be reduced as economies were effected in administration. Has not the Government effected such economies by dismissing 10,000 public servants? Why, then, has it been necessary to incessantly increase taxes? It is obvious that all that this Government is doing today is in direct conflict with what Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, promised he would do. Let me reply to the Minister for Labour others and National Service, who has interjected to the effect that I have misrepremostly sented the Prime Minister. Mr HOT . T - I did not say that. I enjoying the honourable member's speech, ancl I want him to go on. Mr Calwell.'-Fro m now on, I shall enjoy the Minister's discomfiture when he tries to reconcile what the Prime Minister said in 1949 with what is being done in 1951. If the Minister can bear tinueswith me, let me remind him that, in A p r i l, 1951, his leader saidThis is not the occasion for a new policy. What we ask for is a fair chance to carry our existing policy. That policy provided, among other things, for a reduction of taxes. Does the Minister for Labour and National Service still hold that view?",34
104,Mr HOIT,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,That is our approach to Are not the problem.,35
105,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I am glad to learn that that is so. The Prime Minister said in A p r i l , 1951, that he wanted a fair chance to carry out the Government's existing policy. He appealed for a "" f a ir go "". What about giving the people ol Australia a "" fair g o "" in relation to taxation? On that occasion, the leader of the Australian Country party said much the same as did the Prime Minister. I am glad that honourable members opposite were able to bear with me while T repeated the promises about tax reductions that were made by their leaders. Some of them, at any rate, hung their heads in shame as I read to them the words of their leaders, who led them to victory by misleading the electors. Members of the Liberal party are becoming quite jittery about the present position. One must conclude that that is how they feel with respect to this measure when one reads the October issue of Liberal Opinion, which is described as the official organ of the New South Wales division of the Australian Liberal party. That journal statesAir. Menzies and Sir Arthur Fadden have been taunted on tlieir joint policy of decreased taxation and anti-inflation measures made during the 1949 campaign. the Prime The article continues The jibes have come alike from men who are scared to death of socialism and from who are Communists in all but name. The increased taxation on incomes is not formidable and the stories of public rage are the exaggerations of biased and selfish minds. We don't think for one moment that this am anti-Mcnzies, anti-Fadden tirade really is designed to sweep them out of public favour and out of office; but that is what it could bring about. Rebellion has apparently already reared its head in the ranks of the Government parties. That Liberal party journal conThis paper gives pride of place to no man and no institution in its belief in freedom of expression, but we do most seriously ask those who are so bitterly attacking the out Menzies Government to pause and reflect on the consequences of their conduct. That article does not ooze optimism. It indicates that grave discontent over the Government's taxation proposals now exists in the ranks of Government supporters.",35
106,Mr BOWDEN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,And that there is a fear that Labour may be returned to office.,36
107,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) lives in fear of what might happen when the Labour party is returned to office. The Labour party has never misled the people by promising to reduce taxes. .Yet, in each year from 1942 onwards, while it was in office, it progressively reduced income tax. On the other hand, the present Government parties promised to reduce taxes but they have actually in creased them. Mi . EGOINS - The honourable member 1 knows something about discontent.",36
108,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,I do; I preach the gospel of divine discontent.,36
109,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Order ! The honourable member might deal with the subject of divine taxation.,36
110,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I am presenting evidence of the discontent that already exists in the community as a result of the Government's failure to honour its election promises. I shall quote the opinion that has been expressed by Mr . K . B . Cameron, of Bullamon Plains, Queensland, who is a cousin of Sir Donald Cameron, former Liberal member of the Parliament. Mr Cameron is one of the wealthiest cattle men in that State. I challenge any Government supporter, or anybody else, to contradict his observations. He is reported in the Queensland journal Country L if e of the 15th November as having saidWhen in Opposition to the Chifley Government, the present Treasurer said that the high taxes imposed by the Chifley Government caused inflation and the only way to end inflation was to reduce taxation. He has now imposed a ruinous rate of taxation as the only way of curing inflation. And that is what is wrong with the Country party. With a drought on us which has already proved disastrous to many; bush Arcs raging throughout the State and even into the town; poor lambing, breeders dying and the Federal Administration squeezing the life out of the industry, the outlook is indeed gloomy. Unable to read the writing on the wall, the Government bumped up income tax from 75 per cent, to 85 per cent., and, as a crowning act of folly and injustice, retrospectively abolished the averaging system back to the boom year ending June, 1950, when wool sold at twice its present value. This act alone cost the industry £47,000,000. Mr Cameron advanced the following further argument:Every extra pound earned by the efforts of small growers is now an added liability with an income tax of 85 per cent., a wool-grower may have to pay £160 on each £100 earned. I suggest that the Treasurer might debate that matter with Mr Cameron in order to find out for himself what the wool growers really think about the Government's policy with respect to the wool industry. I shall now cite the opinion of Mr John B . Shannon, of Rockhampton. who also is well known to the Treasurer.",36
111,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,He is very well known to me.,36
112,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Mr Shannon is reported in the same issue of the Queensland Country L if e as sayingAveraging was introduced to enable the primary producer to carry on and exist at the business, and has paid enormous dividends to the Federal Treasury and the consuming public of Australia. Does any supporter of the Government disagree with that statement?",36
113,Mr BOWDEN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Yes .,36
114,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,I certainly do.,36
115,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,The Treasurer can debate that matter with Mr Shannon also when he again visits Queensland.,36
116,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,I have no need to look for arguments.,36
117,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I sympathize with the Treasurer. I think that he is suffering plenty in his own party room. Mr . Shannon paid a tribute to the late Mr . Chifley, who, when he was Treasurer, introduced the averaging system.",36
118,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,He did not introduce it .,36
119,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"This is what Mr . Shannon said about Mr ChifleyAveraging was introduced, and wisely so, by men whom, by results, we can call statesmen. The consuming public and the taxpayer have a lot to thank them for. I contend that, if this practice was necessary when instituted, then it is doubly so at the present moment. And I venture to say the Federal Government sliould be considering the advisability of extending the practice instead of wiping it out. It seems to me that the' two gentlemen whose views I have just quoted have, like the majority of Australians, just ahout "" had "" this Government. And those two gentlemen have "" had"" the Australian Country party in particular. If the Treasurer does not believe that widespread discontent exists over the Government's taxation policy, I advise him to ascertain that fact from the latest gallup poll that has .been conducted on this subject. If he would also read the press, he would see how unpopular the Government's taxation policy really is. Indeed, resentment has already become apparent within the innermost circles of the Liberal party. The Melbourne Argus, the "" Fair Play"" newspaper, in its issue of three days ago, reported that at the annual meeting of the federal council of the Liberal party, Mr Mackinnon, who was member for Wannon in the Nineteenth Parliament saidTaxation has almost wiped out incentive earning and crippled industry. If you want the primary producers to produce more, then you must give them some adequate return for their labour. That gentleman sat among Government supporters in this chamber last year. What he said a few days ago what members of the Government parties in the present Parliament are thinking, but they are not prepared to back their thoughts with their votes. stricken, they are just waiting to their inevitable electoral doom. In to show that Mr Mackinnon's opinion, continuedwhich I have just quoted, is widely shared, I shall quote a scathing criticism of the Government parties that was made by Mr Joseph Palmer Abbott, who was progress, the member for New England in Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Parliaments. In a Sydney newspaper of i the 12th October, he is reported to have saidOne nf the worse features of the budget is that it provides no action to halt inflation. He indicated six ways in which, he suggested, the Government should deal with this problem; and his sixth suggestion was as follows:Encourage people to produce goods and not bring them, through excessive taxation, an anaemic economic condition that they be too weak to carry on. Mr Calwell. Mr Abbott is a prominent member of the Australian Country party. The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Fairhall) has gone on record as sayingWith the proposed rates of taxation ii: the budget the Government found itself a half shareholder in every successful enterprise in Australia. I should not regard that honourable member as a thick-and-thin supporter of the Government if he could not find more encouraging words than those to apply to a measure for which he subsequently voted in this chamber. The honourable member continued The Government was beginning to collect its taxes ahead like a bankrupt living from hand to mouth. Last year it was the wool income and this year it was the company tax which was being collected ahead. The honourable member does not deny that those are his sentiments. He at last had the courage to say what he really feels, a quality not possessed by a lot of his colleagues. Apparently, they are not prepared to hang separately; but they will certainly hang together when the Government again goes to the country. On the 16th September, 1946, when a general election was imminent, the present Prime Minister, as Leader of the Opposition, is precisely said in this chamberThe Government's third line of defence is that the present high rates of taxation are necessary to avoid inflation. Terrormeet The right honourable gentleman was order attacking the Chifley Government. He They (taxes) not only can be reduced, but they must be reduced unless the extraordinary financial burcler of war is to be made a permanent feature of peace if we are to have any any incentive to produce, any real the national civil development . We advocate tax reduction because we believe t will be the greatest stimulant to production, and therefore a powerful protector against currency inflation.",36
120,Mr THOMPSON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Do not make Government supporters look so gloomy.,37
121,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I am sorry for them; but I must remind them that they cannot sail under two flags at the one - time. They must sail under the banner of reduced taxation as a means of checkto such ing inflation, or under the banner of will increased taxation for that purpose. The position does not change like the winds. Mr TURN S aiiL - Of course it does.",37
122,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"At least the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull ) has made an observation that the people will profit from in the future. He says, in effect, that when a party is out of office any. argument is good enough to enable it to win an election, and that when it is in office it can preach an opposite doctrine and expect to delude the people. The Minister for Immigration (Mr . Holt ) said, in 1946, that the Liberal party undertook to reduce taxes by 40 per cent, during the following three years. I u those three years, a Labour government reduced taxes by more than 40 per cent. On that occasion the Minister said I shall be very surprised and disappointed if an overwhelming proportion ,of that remission is not granted during the first financial year, because the party recognizes that, if tax reduction is to have the revitalizing effect that is so badly needed, the biggest cut must be made in the first year. Yet, when his party was returned to office, he became co-author with the Treasurer of the most savage system of income taxation that has ever been imposed upon the people of Australia. All honourable members opposite would prefer a system of taxation that did not affect very seriously the wealthy interests of the country. They would also like to reduce probate duties, and bring about a situation in which wealthy groups would scarcely know from the taxation they paid that, they were alive, when they died, their probate duties would be so small that they would not even know that they were dead. But I have in my dossier the reports of the opinions of persons who do not support the Labour party, but are most critical of the Government's taxation policy. For instance, Mr C. A . 0 . Sindel, the president of the Taxpayers Association of Australia, who has never spoken with me in the Sydney Domain or on Melbourne's Yarra bank in advocating a better social order, has made the following statement about this bill : It does not matter how much taxpayers have their wages increased, they will still be worse eiT. . . . The 10 per cent, levy falls proportionately most heavily on the low-income groups, and because of the principle of graduated rates of tax will fall heaviest on any extra income earned by hard work. The severity of the new charge will further discourage the working of overtime, the planting of more acres, and the risking of capital in extending businesses and starting new ones. Mr C. B . H all , who is the director of the Chamber of Manufactures in New South Wales, has also denounced these tax proposals. The president of the Chamber of Commerce Incorporated, Sydney, Mr K . E. Coles, a member of the firm of G. J. Coles, which is not exactly an organization of impoverished shopkeepers, criticized the taxation proposals of the Government in the financial year 1950-51. In some respects those proposals gave some measure of relief but, in other respects, they increased taxes. He saidTaxation which still stands at 27 per cent, of the national income is surely at a most dangerous level. Undoubtedly, we will be shortly called upon to make a national effort that will be a drain on the nation's purse. As any further taxation will defeat its own ends by reducing national income, it is difficult to see where this additional revenue is to come from. Last year, the Government appropriated 30 per cent, of the national income by way of taxation compared with 27 per cent, in the previous year. This year, it will extract from the people 33 per cent, of the national income. The Director of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia in Canberra, has also condemned the present tax proposals, and Sir Charles Lloyd Jones, who received a knighthood from this Government, made the following statement about this and budget:One thing certain is that while expenses will continue to mount in every direction, the additional taxation coming in a year of falling income is going to take its toll from every class of the community. Sir Charles Lloyd Jones is the managing director of David Jones Limited, a big business octopus in Sydney.",38
123,Mr TUBNBUXL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,The Government is certainly hittin g the big companies with its taxation proposals.,38
124,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The Government's taxation proposals are hitting the little people harder than they are hitting the wealthy classes. When the little people in the electorate of Mallee have an opportunity to hi t back, they will certainly strike hard at their present representative in this House.",38
125,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Order ! Will the honourable gentleman address me? I can hear the voice of the angel, but I canloping stage. not see his face.",39
126,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I am turning constantly towards you, sir, but I am meeting with provocation from the ministerial benches.",39
127,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Order !,39
128,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I have taken the increases following extract from an article which is entitled "" High Taxation is the nursery of national trouble "", and is published the October issue of Bydge's Journal:There has become fixed in the mind of today's Govermnent a conviction that taxation rates should be made so high that they off, or confiscate, the bulk of personal and that in the case3 of very large incomes, rates should take substantially all the over a certain limited figure. In wartime, wliere the need for sacrifice is great, the urgency of national security makes one cheerfully pay two years. confiscatory taxation, but in peacetime expect a normality even in tax rates. This admitted by the Government who, however, advances the alarming principle that liigher taxation rates are necessary in order to combat inflation. If ever there was a fallacy, Since when have high taxation rates been an antidote to inflation? In fact, the exact opposite is true. High tax rates encourage inflation; they are the breeding ground of inflationary tendencies; they are the nursery of national trouble. Nobody can successfully contravert that opinion. I should mention that I am placing all the opinions on record because they will be most useful to many people a little later. The Treasurer's second-reading speech on this bill is, in my opinion, noticeable for too many evasions and too much double talk. As the nation's financier, the right honourable gentleman is a failure, and his failure will have dire consequences for everyone. why the Labour party is determined to oppose this bill, as it has opposed othei bills that have been introduced to give effect to the Government's financial policy. We desire the people to know precisely our attitude towards it.",39
129,Mr BOWDEN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,They know that now.,39
130,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,The Labour Government did a good job for Australia. We left our successors a sound economy and plenty of money. Inflation was merely crawling along. It is no longer crawling; it is even past the gal,39
131,Mr BEAZLEY,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,It is flying.,39
132,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"It is now travelling faster than sound. Of course, the end is not yet. Taxation is so highthat the Lord Mayor of Melbourne has been obliged to complain that all the recent in the cost of living, as a result of inflation and increased taxation, are having a serious effect upon hospital in appeals. Many hospitals are finding that members of the general public are not able to make contributions to their finances. The Treasurer has drain reversed his opinions in many ways incomes, since 1949, and, I say, though with the all due respect to him personally, that income it is unfortunate for the nation that he has been in charge of its finances for I remind him that other one does governments in other countries have is found it possible to reduce taxation, although their economies are affected by inflation. The Government of New Zealand reduced taxation on the eve of the it is that. last general election.",39
133,Mr GRAHAM,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,What rot!,39
134,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Does not the honourable member for St. George (Mr. Graham) know that the Government of New Zealand reduced taxation a few months ago ?,39
135,Mr GRAHAM,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Rate s of income tax in New Zealand are substantially higher than even the new rates in Australia.,39
136,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,The Government of New Zealand proposes to make further reductions of income tax. The fact that taxation is higher in New Zealand than it is in Australia is merely due to the fact that the Government of New Zealand That is did not have the advantage of possessing a treasurer of the calibre of Joseph Benedict Chifley.,39
137,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,A New Zealand Labour government had Mr Walter Nash as Treasurer for a number of years.,39
138,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I am aware of that fact, but I do not regard Mr Nash as the preceding equal, in matters of finance, of the late Mr Chifley. The majority of Australians wish that they could erase the past, and restore the Labour Government of 1949. That administration at least would still be reducing direct and indirect taxes, and giving the public tremendous benefits that this Government has failed to give to them. This Government has not tackled the problem of inflation in the right way. I am not permitted to canvass the measures by which a Labour government would tackle inflation, but at least such an administration would have prevented the ever-3piralling of prices, which have reached fantastic heights and resulted, together with other happenings, in the closing of woollen mills in Victoria.",39
139,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Order ! The honourable member's remarks are not related to taxation. I have allowed him considerable latitude.,40
140,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I agree, sir, that I was straying a little from the subject of taxation, and I shall return to the bill. This Government has a case to answer before the Australian people. It must explain why it is increasing taxation, when, during the general election campaign in 1949, it promised to reduce taxation. It does not matter whether the Government pleads guilty or not guilty to that charge for it will be found guilty by the Australian people. The second charge which the Government has to meet before the Australian people is in respect of its decision to abolish the averaging system, which members of the Liberal party ancl the Australian Country party lauded in other days.",40
141,Mr HULME,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Why was the averaging system abolished for the ordinary taxpayer previously?,40
142,Mr CALWELL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"It was abolished for good reasons that were accepted by the Opposition of the day. However, the present Opposition does not believe that the averaging system should be abolished now or at any time, and contends that it is not fair to go back to a period of high wool prices as the starting point for the abolition of the averaging system. We also say that the flat rate of the 10 per cent., by which all income tax assessments will be increased during this financial year, is not fair, because a man on a high income or a man on a low income will be subject to that flat rate. Eor many years the income tax has been levied on a graduated scale. The proposed overall increase of taxation is at the same rate for the poor man as it is for the wealthy man, ancl, in that respect, the principle is wrong. As one of the leaders of the graziers has pointed out, it is possible for a man who has an income of £100 this year to receive an assessment of £160. Nobody's ingenuity can find a sufficiently good argument to defend such an iniquity before the bar of public opinion. By every criterion, the budget is bad, and this bill, in particular, is very bad. By every standard of straight public dealing, this Government has behaved badly, wrongly, and, if I may hazard the opinion, disgracefully .in the manner in which it has dishonoured its pre-election promises to the people. Throughout Australia today, one hears no criticism of the Labour party or talk about working for Chifley, or about the increased revenues that are to go into the coffers of the Labour Government. The people do not even mention that they will be required to pay higher taxes to the present Treasurer. All that they ask, in effect, is, "" When are we going to get rid of the present Treasurer ancl the Government?"" In that spirit, I leave the bill to the consideration of the House. May the departure of this Government be hastened with the greatest possible speed, and may the Labour party have a fair opportunity, with control of the Senate ancl this House, to do justice to Australia. Mr .GRAHAM (St. George) [2.58] The House has been entertained by a display of erudition by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) on the subject of taxation, although ] describe some of his views as peculiar. 1 suggest that the honourable gentleman does not seriously entertain the opinions that he has expressed, and that he has taken advantage of the fact that he is in Opposition to attack the Government with all the offensive remarks that he can muster. He has referred to the Sydney Domain, which is known to us all as the place in which people assemble to make speeches, or to listen to speeches, and he has said that Government supporters have not ventured there to argue with him the need or otherwise for increased taxation'. But the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Jeff Bate), an honourable senator, and I are in a position to contradict that statement. I , personally, have stood on a box in the Sydney Domain, and addressed an audience, though I admit that I did not get as much support as I might have received in more familiar places. However, the group of which I was a member had a most interesting time in the Domain, and were given the credit of having the courage to go there, and express our views. The honourable member for Melbourne has been guilty of the grossest political humbug in his references to the Government's proposals. I admit that, in 1948, I thought that the late Mr Chifley, who was then Prime Minister and Treasurer, was guilty of treating ex-servicemen with disdain because he refused to increase taxes in order to finance improved repatriation benefits. I confess my sin. I realise now that responsibility for the government of the country rests properly upon the shoulders of the administration and upon nobody else. It is mere humbug for an honourable member to say one thing when he is a Minister and something else entirely when he is in Opposition. Reference has heen made to tax reductions in New Zealand. Unfortunately, many Australians do not yet clearly understand that Australia has a particular relationship to New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, which arises from the common necessity to combine for the defence of democracy.' All the Premiers of the Australian States, Labour, Liberal and Country party, agreed in conference with the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer (i Sir Arthur Fadden) a few months ago that, under the existing conditions of inflation, it would bad act of administration to obtain new money by means of government credit. Therefore, they decided that capital expenditure on public works in ali spheres should be financed from the Commonwealth purse, - which, after all, is the public's pocket. That is why the Government has incurred the considerable displeasure of the community in general by increasing taxes. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) and other members of the Opposition have referred tn PU alleged surplus of £114,500,000 for Graham. which provision has been made in the budget. In fact, that item does not represent a surplus. It was included in order to enable the Government to underwrite government loans in the event of public subscriptions failing to fill the loan quotas. In other words, it will enable this Government to keep the States solvent. It is the grossest aet of political treachery to attempt to stab in the back a government that has agreed, for the first time in Australia's history, to underwrite the responsibilities of the States. The Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland attempted to gain as much party political advantage as possible at the Loan Council meeting by standing out against this Government and the governments of the other four States. But onegreater crime was committed. That odd fellow who is the Premier of Victoria appeared to be very pleased when he left the conference chamber at Canberra and said, in a broad Scots accent, "" I have never been better treated"", but he returned immediately to his home town and proceeded to abuse the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and everybody associated with them for thp treatment that he had received.",40
143,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,That is a reflection on the honourable member for Indi (Mr Bostock).,41
144,Mr GRAHAM,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"It is true. The Premier of Victoria did exactly as I have said. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! I do not know how the Premier of Victoria can be associated with the question that is now before the House.",41
145,Mr GRAHAM,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,The Government must increase taxes in order to satisfy the be a sad and needs of the States.,41
146,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Order ! I think that the new tax rates had been decided upon before the Loan Council met.,41
147,Mr GRAHAM,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I bow to your ruling. Mr Speaker. The honourable member for Melbourne spoke of our fear of socialism. The truth is that Australia has reached a stage at which it must make a far-reaching decision. The thoughts of many honourable members on the issue of socialism are, unfortunately, obscure. Australia must decide whether it is to be controlled, directed and virtually owned by a government or managed by a group of individuals who represent the people. That is the basic issue in relation to socialism. This Government acts on behalf of the people. It abhors the theories of the Opposition. Furthermore, before it has finished its task, it will' unscramble the Labour party's egg and put the feathers back on the chicken that the socialists have plucked. Honourable members will recall that the honourable member for Melbourne has devoted a great deal of energy in recent years to his attempts to convince us that we cannot unscramble a scrambled egg or put the feathers back on a plucked chicken. I am not Mandrake or Houdini, but I prophesy that the honourable gentleman vvill witness some astonishing achievements by this Government during the next couple of years. Eight million Australians live under better conditions than any other white race has enjoyed during the last 150 years.",41
148,Mr BRYSON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Then why destroy those conditions ?,42
149,Mr GRAHAM,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The Government is not destroying them. I remind the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryson) that in no other country where there has been real political trouble would it have been possible for an organization like the Australian Labour party to develop and survive. Only in a country of enormous freedom where the most clever "" spivs "" could organize themselves could such a political party be formed.",42
150,Mr ROSEVEAR,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,What has this to do with taxation?,42
151,Mr GRAHAM,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The Government has been obliged to increase taxation because of the grave problems that it inherited from the former Labour Government. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) knows as well as I do that the budgetary total of £1,041,000,000 was the irreducible minimum. He has not suggested how it could be reduced even by one penny. Do honourable members opposite suggest that the Government could reduce its commitments for defence, social services or repatriation? They have not said so. Therefore, I consider that they are guilty of an immoral practice in treating this matter merely as a political plaything. The Prime Minister of New. Zealand went to the people of that dominion this year and said that he would reduce taxation at a time when the present Government parties proposed to increase taxation. The honourable member for Melbourne and his colleagues conveniently overlook the fact that, although taxation has been reduced in New Zealand and increased in Australia, Australians are still less severely taxed than are the peoples of New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Taxes provide the means by which we can develop our capacity to fight, and we must fight as a member of the great team to which those other countries belong. Australians should realise that they bear the lightest burden of the United Nations team. We are the people who lack the courage to face up to our real responsibilities. Members of the parliaments of Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America would be fully justified in saying that Australia was the "" weak sister "" of the United Nations team and that it wished to derive the greatest benefit from the minimum cost. The blame for this disease that infects the community must be laid at the door of those individuals who have benefited most from the travail of the last 50 years. Honourable members opposite know just what I mean. I do not think that Mr Speaker would permit me to express myself in more direct terms. To wonder whether or not the Government's actions will be popular in the community is of no value. I say to the honourable member for Melbourne that it is better to be unpopular in November of the year in which there was an election in April than to be unpopular in April of the year in which there is to be an election in November. The unpopularity or otherwise of the Government's actions should not affect its decisions. Australia will be on the downgrade if its governments ever place more importance on political consequences than they place upon national welfare. I have answered, with some degree of success I hope, the criticisms of the honourable member for Melbourne. I support the bill.",42
152,Mr CREAN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Melbourne Ports) [3.12]. - The bill provides for various amendcome ments of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act, many of which, apparently, were recomearnings mended to the Government by the special committee that it appointed to investigate taxation generally, ostensibly for the purpose of simplifying procedure and removing anomalies. This remove some anomalies but many others will remain and new ones will be introduced. The most serious of the anomalies that will be apparent in the future will be those that will arise from the abolition of the averaging system for primary producers. I realise that certain culties are attendant upon the sudden abolition of such a system of taxation, the fact remains that the Government's plans have been badly drafted. Eor the benefit of the Treasurer (Sir Fadden) I shall cite an example of unfairness that will arise from the continuance of the averaging system. 1 income? have personal knowledge of this case. The primary producer concerned had a taxable income of £17,797 for 1950-51, the year for which tax returns were recently lodged. His average income for taxation system. that year and the four preceding years was £5,033. In the previous four years payer live? his total income was only £7,368. An amount of £9,500 of last year's taxable income of £17,797 was the result of of live-stock during the year. An amendment which is to be moved by the Treasurer at a later stage, will at least inditem, cate that there are certain anomalies attendant on the sale of live-stock. Ear from being actual income, moneys ceived from the sale of live-stock is, some degree, a quasi-capital payment. £15,666. There is a certain windfall element about it, and it should not be attributable income earned in a particular year. proposed amendment suggests that it all right to consider it as income in one year if the land-owner were finally disposing of his property, but it is not necessarily all right to do so because the taxpayer happens to sell considerable proportion of his live-stock in one year. I suggest that the £9,500 that he obtained for the sale of live-stock last year cannot be properly held to income attributable only to that particular year, but should be reckoned as inearned over a period of years. It was to meet such a position that the averaging system that was applied to the of primary producers, was introduced, because the incomes of primary producers fluctuate from year to year. Suddenly, overnight and retrospectively., the Government has abolished the averagbill may ing system in certain cases. I shall give the House figures that will: show the effect that the abolition of that system will have on this particular taxpayer. I shall repeat the facts. This year his taxable income is £17,797. His diffiaverage income for this year and the four previous years was £5,033. If he but were taxed under the old system he would have to pay £7,470 on last year's income. Under the new system he will be taxed on Arthur the full income of £17,979",43
153,Sir ARTHUR FADDBN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,What would the disordinary taxpayer be taxed on the same,43
154,Mr CREAN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Jus t a moment. I am citing this anomaly because the Treasurer is claiming that he has simplified the,43
155,Mr TURNBULL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"""Where does this tax",43
156,Mr CREAN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Swa n Hill. Under tb* sales proposed new provisions he will pay £11,470 tax on last year's income of £17.797 instead of, as under the old sys£7.460. His provisional tax assessment, had he been assessed on the old basis, would have been £8,206. In other rewords, under the old system his tax to liability would have been assessed at His provisional assessment under the new system will be £12,616. as Therefore the total amount of tax payThe able will be £24,086, an increase of is £S,420. His provisional assessment for the year ended the 30th June, 1950, was £570, which indicates how small his income was prior to the last financial year. just Under the old system his assessment a would have been £15,666, less £570, or an amount of £.15,096, whereas under the new provisions the amount will he .£23,516. He has already paid, accordbe ing to his wool deduction certificates. £3,597, so that the net amount payable under the old system would have heen £11,499, whereas under the new system it will be £19,919. That is £2,000 more than his actual income in the year ended last June, even after about £4,200 has already been paid in advance. Although this taxpayer had an indication of his potential income, he had no indication of the axe that the - Government intended to wield, and so he reduced his mortgages and his overdraft - at the bank, as he well might do, in view - of the increase of his income. Having reduced his overdraft and mortgage by £6,000 he has already spent money that he will now need to pay in taxes. His position will be very serious as a result of the Government's retrospective abolition of the averaging system. I hope that the Treasurer will give serious consideration to the position of that taxpayer. I suggest that it is not an isolated case, but that there are probably many other people, in the electorate of Mallee and elsewhere, who are in similar circumstances. I turn now to income tax generally. Income tax purports to be tax on income. The aspirations of taxation authorities are well expressed in the report of the Committee on the Taxation of Trading Profits, known as the MillardTncker Committee, which was established in 1949 by the United Kingdom Government.. Paragraph 8 of the committee's report statesThe general scheme of the Income Tax legisof lation being not to tax anything hut income, capital increment as such being outside its scope and income derived from business being more usually denoted by the word "" profits we took as the first of those principles that as nearly as practicable the taxable profits should be no more and no less than the true profits of the business as computed on established accountancy principles. In effect, that means that in taxing a business some regard must be had for accepted accountancy principles and some distinction must be drawn between what, under accountancy practice, is to be regarded as income on the one hand and what is to be regarded as capital on the other. In actual practice it is sometimes very difficult to decide whether an amount is income or whether it goes over the border into the capital field. Considerable difficulty is met with from time to time in drawing a line in income tax legislation ibetween income and capital. In fact, sometimes the line has had to be crossed because capital depreciation has to be allowed for in the computation of profits,"" and sometimes what is normally regarded as capital is treated as income. We shall have another example to-night, when the relevant amendment comes before us, of how in the coal industry, for instance, what would be regarded in another business as capital transactions will be held, under the legislation, as being of an income nature. There are other anomalies in the principal act to which the Treasurer should give some consideration because they cause a great deal of difficulty. One such anomaly to which I shall refer affects ordinary taxpayers and arises from the operation of sections 26 (d) and 26 (e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act which refers to payments made to people on retirement from their occupations. I shall cite one example that I know from my own experience, because the person concerned came to see me recently about the matter. He had been employed by the tramway authorities in Melbourne and would have become entitled, on his retirement at the age of 65, to a gratuity of about £750. If he had retired from his occupation he would have been taxed on only 5 per cent, of that lump sum; but the tramway authorities asked him to remain at work because they were short staff and, innocent of the pitfalls that enshroud interpretations of the Income Tax Assessment Act, he continued in his employment although he received his gratuity of £750. Unfortunately for him, because he had not retired, under the technical meaning of section 26 (d), instead of being taxed on only 5 per cent, of the gratuity he was taxed on the full amount of it. The payment of that tax made a large hole in his retiring allowance. The Government has suggested that in the interests of increasing production people should continue in their jobs after they have reached the age of 65 years. If the Government really wishes people to heed that exhortation it should make some amendment of thp Income Tax Assessment Act to provide for a notional kind of retirement so tbar people who receive a retiring gratuity at the age of 65, but do not retire, would be taxed on it as if they had actually retired. Taxation Board of Review case No. 62 gives an example of the kind of ridiculous situation that .can arise. It deals with a school teacher who reached the age of 65 years while he was employed at a private school. On his retirement he became entitled to a lump payment of £800, only 5 per cent, of which would have been taxable. The school committee decided that it would be a. serious drain on its finances to pay that amount in one year, and decided, in effect, to pay it in three instalments of £100 in each of three years. So instead of being taxed only £15 in one year, which would have been the case had he received the payment in a lump sum, the school teacher was taxed on £100 in each of the three years. It is surely possible to have some definition in relation to such matters. The Parliament can express its vvill and indicate that it wishes that section of the Income Tax Assessment Act to operate in a cerain way. I suggest that the Parliament did not intend that section to operate in the way in which it operates. The learned editors of the Butterworth Taxation Service have given a reverse example of that in a footnote to the report of case No. 62. He says that if a person was paid £500 not to engage in some kind of employment because the person who paid the money considered that his engagement in that employment would interfere with the payer's profits, that lump sum of £500 would be taxed under section 26 (d) of the act. If , however, the payment of the sum was divided into five equal instalments it would not be taxable because it would escape under the interpretation of section 26 (e). Such anomalies are ridiculous, and should be remedied. I pass on to another example which arises from the operation of sections 83 to 86 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which deal with the sale of businesses on lease-holds. These sections impinge directly on ordinary people in the community. 'I know that there is some doubt about the Parliament's original intention in inserting these sections in the act. I was for some time employed in the Taxation Branch, and in those days it was understood that the sections had Mr Crean. been put in the act merely to bring hotel licences within the scope of its provisions. Hotel licences are in a peculiar position in that they are limited in number by State laws. The increase of the value of such licences cannot be said to be primarily due to any efforts of the owners of them. Apparently, it is suggested that if a person who rents premises on which he conducts a small grocery business sells the business at the end of his working life and receives more for it than the value of the goods and equipment the excess amount is taxable income. If that was the intention of the framers of the legislation, it should be made clear by the Parliament itself. If ' the Parliament wishes to impose a capital gains tax it should legislate for the imposition of a capital gains tax. It should not simply make other taxation legislation applicable to people who are not sufficiently fortunate to own a freehold property. Under the interpretation of the legislation to which I have referred, persons who are economically substantial enough to own the freehold of a property are in a better position than those who only hold a lease. Dozens of cases have come before the Taxation Board of Review for determination of whether businesses have been sold at a capital gain. Battles take place between the representatives of the Taxation Branch and taxation agents who represent the taxpayers concerned. The person who has had a contract of sale drawn up is usually in a more fortunate position than the unwary person who has sold without taking cognizance of the circumstances. In volume 1 of the Taxation Board of Review Decisions, published by the Law Book Company of Australasia Proprietary Limited, a note has been appended to case No. 102 which readsAn appeal to the High Court, in respect of the above decision, is pending. The Taxation Board of Review was constituted in order to provide a simple form of ventilation of taxation cases. The High Court is not the appropriate place to resolve these difficulties. Cases which are not decided by the Board of Review in a manner satisfactory to the Commissioner of Taxation should be examined by the Parliament. In the same volume a note is also appended to case No. 105, which readsAn appeal to the High Court, in respect of the above decision, is pending. In those two cases, because the Commissioner of Taxation was not satisfied with the decision of the Board of Beview, he has taken the case to the High Court. The people's money will have to be spent in order to have the High Court determine a matter which should be determined by the Parliament. Fundamental principles of taxation are involved in case No. 105, which concerns a business in the State of Victoria. The law of that State provides that every worker shall receive two weeks' annual holiday at the end of twelve months' employment. The act has been so worded as to imply that one-fiftieth of that holiday period shall accrue automatically every pay-day so that at the end of a year, two weeks' leave will have been accumulated. Tf at the end of the year a man ceases to continue in his employment and has not taken his holiday he is entitled to the equivalent of two weeks' wages. Following what are regarded as normally accepted standards of accounting, some firms have decided to make a provision for the payment of accumulated holiday pay. As payment in respect of leave is obligatory by statute, reservation is made in respect of certain periods for payments is respect of such leave. In case No. 105 in the volume to which I have referred, Mr Cotes, one of the members of the Taxation Board of Review is reported to have saidThese remarks appear to me to support a general principle that, in ascertaining the net income of a business for taxation purposes, the interpretation of the law should be brought into harmony with recognized accounting theory and practice, except where the specific verbiage of auy section or sections of the Act precludes this course being followed. A reference was made to such cases paragraph 189 of the report of the Comincome mittee on the Taxation of Trading Profits. It was stated that where there is a statutax tory obligation to provide for a' fixed annual holiday the amount involved is a definite ascertainable charge on a ness and should be provided for hy a reserve according to normal accounting practice. It was recommended that that practice should bo followed in countries where there were statutory enactments of this kind. The Board of Review acknowledged that principle, but the Commissioner of Taxation now wants a judgment to be given by the High Court. I suggest that that is an absurd state of affairs. Accepted accountancy practice should be followed unless the Commissioner of Taxation has very good reasons for considering that it should be varied, in which case the matter should be submitted, not to the High Court, but to the Treasurer. I consider that the act should be amended in order to provide for such a procedure to be adopted. Perhaps the cases that I have quoted could be considered by the House at a later date. The Treasurer announced, perhaps rather buoyantly, that he would simplify taxation and remove anomalies, but a considerable number of anomalies still exist and apparently, rather than abolish them, he proposes to support the actions of the Commissioner of Taxation in approaching the High Court. These anomalies are very real to the persons whom they affect and who have paid thousands of pounds more each year in tax than they have received in income. Judged by accepted accounting principles, that state of affairs is an absurdity. At least this bill gives honourable members the opportunity to ventilate the anomalies which exist, inquire into the purport of the principal act and consider whether the desirable objectives that I have mentioned can be attained.",43
157,Mr FAILES,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Lawson) [ 3 . 4 0 ] - I must refute the statement that was made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) to the effect that taxpayers have paid more in taxation than they have received in income. That allegation has been made very freely and in is absolutely inaccurate. Reference to the tax rates will show that it is impossible for a person to pay more in in respect of any financial year than he receives in income in that year. It is true that provisional tax in respect of busithe next year's income, plus the tax due on the current year's income may exceed the income of the current year, but a person who found himself in that position would have the benefit of deducting from his taxation liability the amount of provisional tax that he had paid in the preceding year. If that provisional tax was not sufficient to meet the tax due in respect of the current financial year he would have to pay an amount which he may not have expected to pay. Nevertheless, such a person is in the position of providing for the future just as the wage-earner is who pays a high rate of provisional tax in the early part of a year and who receives such a low wage in the latter part of the year that his total income is not taxable. He would receive a rebate at the end of the year. Honourable members know that it is common for wage-earners to receive rebates at the end of the year. So other types of taxpayers can pay more in provisional tax than the tax assessed and receive a credit for the excess amount paid. But it is legally impossible for any person to pay more in taxation in respect of one year than his taxable income for that year. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) devoted a considerable part of his speech to quoting from newspapers and other authorities. I believe that he did try to string an argument around his collection of statements by other people. A number of the honourable member's quotations were from editorials which did not represent the opinion of the subscribers to the newspapers concerned. But because a newspaper prints a statement in an editorial it does not follow that it represents any great volume of public opinion. But let us assume that newspapers, in their editorials, do express the belief of the public. The leading article of the West Australian dated the 26th October, after mentioning that a deputation from certain graziers' and taxpayers' organizations had failed to convince the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) that he should abandon the modified averaging system of taxation of primary producers' incomes, statedIt is difficult, in principle, to fault ments put forward by Sir Arthur for the change in the light of present economic conditions. Taxation methods, moreover, are flexible and always open to adjustment to meet altered conditions in the future. Honourable members opposite have accused the Government of not keeping its promise Mr Failes. to reduce taxation. Do they suggest that if they were in office and circumstancesdemanded that taxation should be increased they would not break a promise to reduce it? I draw attention to the fact that last financial year we very considerably reduced taxation. We carried out our promises to investigate the whole of the tax field. A committee is meeting at the present time and is discussing propositions that have been put to it . That committee can be approached by any honourable member in this House, and indeed by anybody in Australia. A number of such propositions and suggestions have been incorporated in the legislation that the Government has submitted to us. Any person of average intelligence is bound to perceive that the Government, by this measure, proposes only to adjust its financial arrangements to the economic circumstances of the time. I do not intend to state all the reasons which justify the budget and taxation proposals as honourable members know that they are genuine and inescapable. The West Australian article that I have already quoted continues The five-year averaging of incomes for Federal tax rating purposes now applies only to primary producers. Once again the honourable member for Melbourne, who credited the late Mr . Chifley with introducing the averaging system, is completely wrong. The honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) introduced the averaging scheme into the federal taxation system in the early 'twenties. At that time he was the Treasurer, and he did a remarkably good job.",46
158,Mr CURTIN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,He was the tragic Treasurer.,47
159,Mr FAILES,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The honourable member who interjected merely gives a further display of his ignorance by repeating that parrot cry. New South Wales, the only State to adopt the average system, did so as the result of Country party the argurepresentations. Therefore, representations were made by the Country party both in New South Wales and in the federal sphere to introduce averaging provisions in order to level out fluctuations in the yearly incomes of primary producers as the result of marketing and seasonal changes. In 1936, a royal commission on taxation considered the whole matter of averaging and decided that the averaging system caused great anomalies. It then suggested that it should be disconstarted tinued in respect of all incomes except those of primary producers. The royal commission also considered another matter that is pertinent to this debate. 16 decided that in the system of averaging there is a considerable amount of wasted effort in the preparation of taxation returns. Every honourable member knows that there is a serious lag in the issue of taxation assessments. Honourable members are continually getting letters from their constituents in which it is requested that the Taxation Branch should make its assessments more quickly. At times, constituents have written that they owed three or four years' taxes but could not get their assessments. Honourable members opposite will realise how embarrassing that must be for any government. About 80 per cent, of taxation returns of primary producers are not dealt with in the relevant financial year, and of those only about 80 per centare assessed and the tax collected. In other words, only about 60 per cent, of the income of each financial year is assessed and collected in the year. In the light of those facts it would be sensible to abolish the average system which causes those anomalies and delays. In 1938, the Australian Government removed the averaging provisions from all taxpayers other than primary producers. The matter has since been reviewed again, and in the light of present circumstances it has been considered wise to remove the averaging provisions from primary producers, whose income exceeds £4,000 a year. Primary producers are not at present suffering from the violent fluctuations of income that have occurred in the past. In fact, the incomes of many primary producers have increased on a gigantic scale. Taxable incomes have increased at a rate out of all proportion to the average incomes on which taxpayers are being assessed. That is all right for the primary producer while his income continues to increase, but it will be a different story when it begins to decrease. If the primary producer is to get any benefit fro m lower income taxes to see h i through the difficult times which are coming, then he would be better off if this averaging system were abolished. I can see difficult times coming. Last year with floods, this year started with fires, and perhaps next year will be notable for widespread droughts. The West Australian article to which I have referred continuesIts retention (averaging) was intended to protect them against fluctuations in the prices of their products and from income variations due to seasonal conditions. But the substantial rise in incomes in recent years has exposed weaknesses in the system and, as the Treasurer pointed out in his Budget speech, "" it operates to the advantage of a taxpayer in a year of high income when he is best able to pay and to his disadvantage in a year of low income when he is least able to pay"". Briefly the Treasurer proposes that the averaging system should be abolished for the assessment of a primary producer's taxable income in excess of £4,000 a year. It is in a period of high general incomes that such a change can be made with least difficulty for the taxpayers concerned. The article then goes on to point out exactly what that means. The honourable member for Melbourne has suggested that primary producers do not want this change. I am probably in just as close touch with ' primary producers as is the honourable member for Melbourne, because I am a primary producer myself. I assure honourable members opposite that now that the system has been thoroughly understood, primary producers realise the wisdom and sense of this Government's taxation proposals. Once it was believed that the new proposals would apply to all incomes of primary, producers, but now it is realized that it w i ll apply only to incomes of more than £4000 a year, and that other primary producers will have a right to make an election. In the light of those facts a totally different view prevails among country people. If the contention be maintained that the primary producer has not full y considered the proposals, I draw the attention of honourable members to a report made by the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation which reads, inter aliaThat representations made to the committee on the subject of averaging do not reveal any unity of views, apart from a desire to escape m the detrimental consequences during a period of declining incomes. The most important the proposals put before the Committee were us follows:(o) Every primary producer should be given the option of making an tion as to whether the averaging provisions should apply to Once the option had been exercised 40 readsit should be irrevocable. . . . That right to primary producers whose incomes are below £4,000 a year to make an election is exactly what has been put One into this measure. The other sugin gestions of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation, which have been supThat ported by the Graziers Vigilance Commitsion tee, are that the averaging system should apply only in a case where the average taxable income is less than the actual taxable income of the year concerned, because it is retrospective? and that a new averaging period should commence when the income falls to an amount at least one^third below the and average income. There is nothing unAct usual in taxpayers asking for concessions. It is quite common, when taxpayers feel aggrieved or when honourable members all subsequent years. feel that their electors may be aggrieved, to make the strongest possible representaAgain, tions that they should be relieved of tion imposts. This legislation places no impost of any consequence on the people. It merely removes certain concessions that Lave been made during past years. Morereadover, those concessions will be removed at a time when it is most favourable to the nineteen taxpayers to remove them and primary tax producers will full y appreciate this in years to come, when inevitably their in come has declined. It is quite reasonable subsequent year. that the proposed change should be made at a time when incomes are high, so that the full benefit will accrue to taxpayers as their incomes decline. There is very little more that I can about that particular inatter. honourable members will agree now the provisions of the new averaging system are thoroughly understood by the taxpayers all objections to the system Lave disappeared. Objection raised in some quarters to the retrospective effect of parts of this measure. To give a thing a certain name is not actually earned. necessarily to criticize it. When people say that this is a retrospective and therefore bad, they entirely overlook the fact that because it is Mr Failes. of it is not necessarily bad. It can only be bad if it is proved in fact to be bad. While it may be said to have a retrospective eleceffect, that is not necessarily bad. In the same bill that we are considering, it will him. be found that sub-clause (1.) of clause(1.) The amendment effected by section six of this Act shall apply to assessments in respect of income of the year of income which commenced on the first day of July, thousand nine hundred and forty-nine, and respect of income of all subsequent years. is definitely a retrospective provithat applies to members of the Korean forces. It is a concessional provision. .Surely honourable members will not maintain that that is necessarily bad Sub-clause (2.) of clause 40 reads(2.) The amendments effected by paragraph (b) of section ten, sections eleven and eighteen, paragraph (6) of section twenty, of this shall apply to assessments in respect of income of the year of income which commenced on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and fifty, and in respect of income of that is a retrospective provision taxawhich is designed to eliminate the possibility of double taxation for Australian companies that operate outside Australia. Again, in sub-clause (4.) of clause 40 we (4.) The amendment effected by section of this Act shall apply for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of Australian payable in respect of an amount of income of the year of income which commenced on the - first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and fifty, and upon an amount of income of any I have therefore pointed to three retrospective provisions in this measure, all of which give concessions that date back a year or more, but all of which are defisay nitely good and just. It is ridiculous to I think say that because a provision is retrospecthat tive it must be mad. I now return again to the article fro m the West Australian which I previously has been quoted. This quotation readsIn effect, the collection of taxation from primary producers is being brought nearer to the annual period in which the income is That is a very sound principle. The measure, article continuesretrospective is Inretrospective a sense the application of the new system and in some cases there may lie embarrassment in meeting the cash taxation requirements because of commitments already undertaken. That is a short-term problem and should uot strain the facilities of rural finance. I believe that it is thoroughly sound. The article proceedsTt should be remembered that many wageiNinierti also had to make personal financial adjustments in the period of transition to pay-as-you-earn taxation. That legislation was introduced by a Labour government, but now that the Labour party is in opposition, honourable gentlemen opposite say that something that their party did during its term of office is not suitable or satisfactory when this Government is in power. It is perfectly sound in principle and in practice to exclude from the everaging system primary producers whose annual taxable income is in excess of £4,000 and to give to those whose annual taxable income is £4,000 or less the right to choose whether they will continue to take advantage of the averaging system. Those provisions will not increase the burden of the primary producer. Some primary producers will no longer be entitled to .enjoy a concession that they have enjoyed hitherto but that concession is a double-edged sword in a period of declining incomes as they will discover. The proposal that the modifications sliould be applicable to the year ended on the 30th June, 1950, is retrospective in name only. A great benefit will continue to accrue to primary producers as a result of the operations of the averaging system over the years. They are to be required to make a small sacrifice now, but that will be of advantage to them in the long-term.",47
160,Mr TOM BURKE,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Perth) [4.02] During the last few months, the budget either has been condemned as bad or has been described as powerful medicine that is necessary in a difficult situation. Doubtless the harassed Treasurer (Sir Arthur Padden) derived comfort fro m the fact that the honourable member for Lawson (Mr Failes) described it as being sound in practice, full y acceptable to Australian primary producers and in accord with all the accepted principles of taxation, justice and equity, but I warn the right honourable gentleman that he will be very disappointed if he hopes that that view is being expressed throughout the country areas and the cities of Australia. The honourable member for Lawson was quite wrong. Nowhere is this budget accepted as being sound in principle, equitable in its operation and justified by the present circumstances. Taxation has two major purposes. The first of these is to raise revenue to enable the Government to meet its ordinary administrative expenses, pay social services benefits and discharge its other commitments. The second, which has come to be regarded in many quarters as the most important function, is to distribute the national income fair l y among all sections of the community. Income tax is now regarded as the most equitable method of achieving both of those objectives. Many surveys have been made of taxation principles and practice. Those who have made the surveys have in every instance advocated that direct rather than indirect taxes should be imposed, and have condemned increases of indirect taxes. Income tax causes less hardship to the various sections of the community than do indirect taxes. It permits a very flexible system to operate under which allowance can be made for family responsibilities for contractual obligations and for the meeting of the future needs of taxpayers and their families. Every enlightened Government regards income tax as the best means of raising revenue and of distributing the cost of national services equitably. This Government has departed from all, the accepted canons of taxation. In an inflationary situation, it has budgeted for a huge surplus of revenue. As I said in a previous debate, that is not necessarily wrong because in certain circumstances it may be wise to budget for a surplus as an anti-inflationary measure. But a necessary condition is that the rates of income tax in operation at that time shall be low. At present, the rates of income tax are high. The action of the Treasurer in increasing them in order to enable the surplus revenue to be accumulated reveals a complete misconception of the purpose of budgeting for a surplus. If the present rates of income tax were, let me say, between 6d. and 10s. in the £ 1 , the Treasurer would be justified if he decided to accumulate a surplus of revenue by increasing those rates, but, in the present circumstances, when the rates rise to as high as 15s. in the £1, it is bad to budget for a surplus, irrespective of what is proposed to be done with it. The Treasurer has made a completely wrong approach to taxation and to the present economic position. In budgeting for a surplus, he has had recourse in a large degree to indirect taxes. By so doing, he has made certain that prices will rise sharply and will continue to rise. That is the very situation that he would have the country believe he has sought to avoid. He has explained that, by a courageous approach, he has sought to stem the rising tide of inflation, but no one in the community today will agree that that objective can be achieved by the methods to which he has resorted. By increasing indirect taxes and thus causing prices to rise sharply, he is bringing increasing numbers of people into the higher income tax field. As each adjustment of the basic wage is made, taxpayers in Australia are required to pay income tax at higher rates, and they have less money with which to meet the needs of themselves and their families. Treasurer, by his financial measures, is causing conditions to alter in a manner that he should seek to avoid. The right honourable gentleman has said that, having regard to the present situation, a courageous approach is required. Is it courageous considerably to increase excise duties, sales tax and all kinds of indirect charges upon goods that are consumed, and are meant to be consumed, by the people of this country ? As the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) pointed out some time ago, it is clear that the Treasurer is not budgeting to reduce purchases by the Australian people. If he were doing so, he would not expect revenue to increase as a result of the operation of increased indirect taxes, but he does expect that purchases will increase and that the consequent increase of revenue will permit of the accumulation of a surplus. The honourable member for Lawson said that the farmers do not object to the modification of the averaging system. Ur. Tom Burke. The fact is that the farmers do object to it. The honourable gentleman said that the farmers are beginning to realise that the modification of the system will be of great benefit to them. He emphasized that farmers whose annual taxable income is less than £4,000 will be allowed to choose whether to continue under the averaging system or revert to the normal system of taxation. At this stage, let me remind the Treasurer that the averaging system was considered by a royal commission.",50

164,Mr TOM BURKE,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Condition s have not changed since then. The principal fact that caused that royal commission to report in favour of the averaging system was that the incomes of the primary producers of Australia were fluctuating. That basic condition still holds good and will continue to do so. World prices will continue to fluctuate and so will the incomes of primary producers. Seasonal conditions will continue to vary and, as a result, the incomes of primary producers The will continue to fluctuate. If there has been any change of the position since 1927, it is that the fluctuations of the incomes of primary producers have become greater. With the shortening cycle of economic boom and slump, the fluctuations now are very real and very sharp.",51
165,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,And upwards.,51
166,Mr TOM BURKE,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The Treasurer, quite clearly discomfited by the facts of the present situation, is seeking by interjection to divert me from my line of thought. A continuation of the averaging system would be quite justified, in view of the conditions that obtain today and that will continue to obtain in the future. There is no more justification for abolishing the averaging system now than there would have been in 1927. The Treasurer has been responsible for some exceptional moves against the primary producers of this country. I shall not enumerate them now, because I did so in a previous debate. It is obvious that the right honourable gentleman has accepted the prevailing view that the farmers of Australia are responsible for the present inflationary conditions. He denies that he has accepted the view of Sir Douglas Copland, but it was that learned gentleman who drew attention to the incomes of farmers and singled out farmers as a medium through which inflation could be attacked. Douglas Copland has claimed time and time again that the Government should look to the farmers for increased revenue for ordinary purposes, and that, in an attempt to curb inflation, some of their money should be taken from them. It is true that the incomes of farmers have increased vastly. Substantial benefits flow to the community as a whole as well as to primary producers from present prosperous conditions. But what is the Government's approach to companies that are making vastly increased profits out of the farmers? During the last three years, some companies in the motor trade have paid dividends of up to 60 per cent, on the capital invested in their organizations. Agricultural machinery firms are reaping a harvest from the farmers; and wool-broking firms which, though few in number, are of vast financial strength, are making killings among primary producers. However, the Government, under its taxation policy, passes by the wealthy combines and ignores the large fortunes that those organizations are making out of the farmers. Primary producers must be astonished when a government, the Treasurer of which, is leader of the Australian Country party and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) is deputy leader of that party singles them out to bear the brunt of additional taxation. It is idle for the Treasurer, the honourable member for Lawson and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Leslie) to claim that the farmers do not resent such treatment. The Government is placing an unfair part of the taxation burden upon the farmers, and it is making an unrealistic approach to the problem of inflation. Time will prove whether the farmers welcome these additional imposts and the abolition of concessions that they previously enjoyed. Their reaction will be effectively tested when they are given the option of remaining under the averaging system of assessment of income tax. Let us see - how many primary producers with taxable incomes of less than £4,000 a year will choose to withdraw from that system. The Government has imposed a flat rate increase of 10 per cent, upon all taxable incomes. Quaintly, it has claimed Sir that it has done so because such an additonal impost can be easily removed in the future. The imposition of additional tax on a flat-rate basis will assuredly impede production. Such a system is unjust because it does not make any allowance in respect of the different obligations, family and contractual, of taxpayers. The flat-rate increase is a discriminatory tax. Eor that reason it must be condemned. When the supporters of the Government were in Opposition, they claimed that rates of tax at that time impeded production and that the Government of the day should evolve a new approach to the problem of taxation. On each occasion on which the Chifley Government reduced rates, the present Treasurer, who was then in Opposition, claimed that no actual reduction of taxes had been effected because the quantum of tax had increased. This Government is increasing not only the quantum of tax but also the rates. The flat-rate increase of 10 per cent, has been described as a shortterm tax which the Government hopes that it will be able to remove next financial year. The temporary nature of the tax will impede production. Manufacturers will not be anxious to increase production when they know that if they do so during the next twelve months they will render themselves liable for a disproportionate increase of tax. They will seek to escape from this temporary impost. The Government cannot justify the imposition of a flat rate tax on grounds of either accepted taxation principles or of equity. Supporters of the Government have cited rates of taxes in New Zealand, Great Britain and the United States of America with a view to proving that Australian taxpayers, even after taking into account the increases of tax under the budget, will be better off than are taxpayers in those countries. That is a completely dishonest and unconvincing approach to this matter. Such a comparison, in order to be valid, must take into account not only rates, but also total collections of taxes of all kinds in the respective countries, as well as the services, including social services, that are made available to the people in them. In Great Britain, for instance, substantial benefits of a social character are provided. Even the newly-elected Conservative Government of Great Britain has not indicated that it intends to abolish those benefits. But this Government, in addition to imposing these savage increases of taxes, is also levying new taxes which it is attempting to disguise with pleasant names. For instance, persons are now to be obliged to pay for hospital benefits under a scheme that is attractively styled an insurance scheme. The Government will oblige persons to pay additional charges for such services. Facts of that kind must be taken into account in any valid comparison between the position of taxpayers in Australia and in other countries. The Government has not disclosed such facts to the House. When the Chifley Government introThe duced a measure to impose a tax on private companies, the present Treasurer waxed eloquent in his wrath and claimed that such a tax would grind companies out of existence and would ruin the business structure of the country. The election. wheel of political fortune has turned, and we now see how dishonest the present Government parties were in that respect and how unfounded were the claims that they then made. But those parties got headlines in the press and the most favoured mention in their organs of public opinion. To-day, the same honorbefore able gentlemen have not only accepted the principle that was embodied in the Chifley Government's legislation but also closed the loopholes in it. The Treasurer has said that the Commonwealth Comother mittee on Taxation has recommended that - companies should be obliged to pay 10 - cent, of their assessed tax in the year which it is earned, that is, in advance. As that is the sort of thing that the Government has been endeavouring to do since it assumed office, the committee's recommendation came as a pleasant surprise to it. It is true, as the Treasurer stated in his budget speech, that prior to the general election in 1951 the Mr Tom Burke. Government made certain taxation concessions. Honourable members opposite should be thoroughly ashamed to mention such action as it was clearly electoral window-dressing. Prior to the last general election, when it should have been making an attack upon the vital problem of inflation, it was interested only in bargaining for political power in order that it might continue to govern in the interests of the great financial combines in this country. Now, it has obliged public companies to pay 10 per cent, of their assessed tax in advance, and has sought to justify such action on the ground that the Commonwealth Committee ou Taxation, recommended that it should do so. What an alibi! The Government will reeeive in the current financial year considerable revenue that it would not normally collect until next financial year. It endeavours to justify such a policy on the ground that it must meet in the current financial year certain expenditure of a non-recurring nature. In spite of that claim, governmental expenditure, and, consequently, taxes are increasing. Government's approach to the problem of inflation is unrealistic. It has adopted a dishonest method of finance for which it now stands condemned by the community and which will bring about its defeat at the next general",51
167,Mr DRUMMOND,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"New England) [4.28] - I have been struck in the course of this debate by the fact that the hon the orable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) and his henchmen have not made the slightest reference to the measure the Chair. It is quite true that it relates to taxation generally. It is apparent, however, that members of the Opposition have not bothered to study its terms which are ancillary to those of taxation measures that have already been passed by the House. The honorper able member for Melbourne claimed that in the abolition of the averaging system in the assessment of the tax payable by primary producers will affect harshly the small farmer, whilst it will be of advantage to the big farmer. I hardly think that the honourable member would wish to mislead the public. Therefore, I can only conclude that he has not studied that proposal. The modification of the averaging system will not in any way affect primary producers with a taxable income of less than £4,000 a year. Furthermore, it will not affect those who have a taxable income of up to £6,000 a year so long as their average income during the prescribed period does not exceed £4,000 a year. The income of the producer on a small scale it to be calculated, not upon returns from high prices alone in the current financial year, but upon those of Ihe four preceding years, during which his income progressed from, perhaps, an uxtemely low Ague, to a much higher amount. But the averaging that has applied produces some astonishing results, a? is shown by figures that have been released by the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden). A levy of 10 per cent, will be imposed during this financial year, not upon the total income, but upon the amount of tax that will be payable on the basis of the rates that were applicable during the last financial year. To suggest that the special levy has any relation to averaging is merely to attempt to muddle the whole situation, and make it more difficult for people, who are not experts on the subject, to learn the truth. I do not think that I have misinterOpposition preted a statement by the honourable ber for Melbourne to the effect that Labour party now believes in the averagduring ing system. The implication of such statement is that, not so long ago, the Labour party was opposed to the averagon ing system. That statement, if the - elements of it are analysed, means that the Labour party has changed its views, and, now that it is in Opposition, believes that the averaging system should be retained. I am perfectly well aware some honourable members, when they enter this House, do not express their personal views on various subjects. They are the representatives, not so much of their electors, as of .certain organizations that fundamentally have been responsible for tlieir election to the Parliament, and, therefore, expect them to advocate certain policies. For example, members of the Labour party are expected to voice in Parliament the opinions or, say, the Ausincrease tralian Council of Trades Unions, the teachers' organizations, and similar of organizations. Government supporters 1841 also have their contacts with every section of the community, but Opposition members tend more than Government supporters to place emphasis upon one factor in preference to another factor. Members of the Labour party, in expressing themselves in favour of the retention of the averaging system, probably argue in the his following way:- "" We are now in Opposition. The Government wishes to abolish the averaging system, and, therefore, we are opposed to such a proposal. If the political wheel turns, we shall be in office, and the Liberal party and the Australian Country party may then wish us to restore the averaging system. In such circumstances, we shall be opposed to such a move "". The attitude of members of the Labour party to the Government's proposal to increase taxation is obscured by their reluctance to face certain obvious facts. Their contention, which has been volubly expressed by the honourable member for Melbourne, is that the Government has no right to increase taxation after members of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party promised the people, during the general election campaign in 1949, that a non-Labour government would reduce taxes. Bearing that fact prominently in their minds, members consider that the memGovernment deserves the censure of this the House and of the people. I admit that, the general election campaign in a 1949, the present Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) and the Treasurer decided that, all the evidence that was available at simple that time, a non-Labour government would be able to reduce taxation. The Liberal party and the Australian Country party were returned to office, and the Treasurer provided in his budget last year that for a reduction of taxation. A few months ago, another general election was held, and during that campaign the Prime Minister and the Treasurer warned the people that circumstances had so altered that the community would be compelled to make sacrifices that could not be foreseen in 1949. The attempt by Opposition members to brush aside such an obvious truth, their pretence that nothing this has occurred since 1949 to justify an of taxation, and their accusation that the Government is guilty of a breach faith are futile efforts to discredit the Government, and, indeed, are not worthy of the Australian Labour party. Opposition members, if they genuinely wish to challenge the Government on its taxation policy, should examine the inescapable facts. The world is trembling on the verge of war. A most inflammable situation exists in Egypt, and in other parts of the Middle East. The war in Korea is causing us considerable concern. Eastern Europe may be likened to a volcano that has been smouldering for some time and may erupt at any moment. Those inescapable facts constitute the test that should be applied by Opposition members to the necessity, or otherwise, for increased taxation and a greater measure of sacrifice on the part of the community. The Opposition, if it adopts that form of test, may attack the Government on the ground that the financial provision for defence purposes is insufficient. Australia has never suffered invasion, nor experienced the horror of being under an army of occupation. Members of the Labour party could claim that, for the sake of the women and the children, and in the in terests of our national heritage, they should submit the Government's defence programme to critical examination. If they decided that sufficient money had been provided for defence, they could seek to discover whether it was being expended wisely. That would be a legitimate basis on which to criticize the Government, although I , personally, do not consider that grounds for such an attack exist. In my opinion the Government has gone as far as it can go, in the time available, to place our defences in order. However, honourable members opposite have merely introduced into this debate piffling issues that are not likely to raise the status of the Labour party in the eyes of the public. Whatever may be said in defence of the system of uniform income it is a factor that is for an increasing drain finances of the country. that the way in which that system has developed is, to a large degree, unavoidable, as a result of the war-time conditions in which it was introduced, but the effect has been most unfortunate. Mr Tom Burke. Colin Clark, M . A . , made the following statement in a lecture that he deliveredon the subject, the "" Principles of Public Finance and Taxation "" : We require the responsibility of the Government to the people to be set out in Constitutional and legal form. Now, on its conduct on the levying and spending of money, as on all its other activities, a Governmenit is judged by the electors in due course. The first principle of Public Finance is that a Government will not undertake extravagant or irresponsible projects because it knows that it will have to pay for them by imposing taxation upon its own electors. Mr Clark considers that, according to such a test, we are suffering from a situation that is due to the system of uniform income tax. State governments are expending vast sums in the raising of which they have had no responsibility. I shall not labour that point, but I consider that one of the major factors that has led to extravagance in this country is that the Commonwealth, under the system of uniform income tax, is obliged to hand out huge sums to the States, which have none of the responsibility for raising them. Such a system undermines their whole financial independence. Perhaps the system of uniform assessments is inescapable and desirable. Mr Colin Clark, whose ability will not be challenged by those who have any knowledge of this subject, considers that it is not impossible to devise an income tax assessment form on which would be stated the amounts that are due to the Commonwealth, a - State and a local-governing body. B y that means, the share of each of those three authorities would be pin-pointed and each would accept responsibility for the raising and expenditure of its portion. I know of no way in which responsibility can be imposed in any activity in rational civilized life unless a person who expends money is made responsible not only for the expenditure but also for the raising thereof. That principle, applies in a simple way to civil expenditure, and with tax, much greater force to governmental responsible expenditure. I believe that u n t i l the on the main responsibility for raising money is I admit borne by those who expend it , this country will d r if t deeper into the financial morass and the Government will be obliged to impose additional taxation in an endeavour to extricate it . Mr. Another factor that increases the drain upon our finances is the destruction, complete or almost so, of voluntary effort in the community. I was a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales when a hospital benefits scheme that covered practically the whole of rural New South Wales was deliberately destroyed upon the introduction of the Commonwealth scheme. I protested in vain. That was a splendid scheme of self-help. It was extremely well organized and very economical in operation. The people were beginning to appreciate its advantages and to give their wholehearted support to it when, for the sake of obtaining a Commonwealth grant, the State Government ruthlessly destroyed it. All that remains of it today is the metropolitan section. The Government, realizing that the destruction of that section would cause it to become very unpopular, hastily dug up some flimsy excuse for retaining it and fortunately for New South Wales and also for the rest of Australia, because affects a big proportion of our population, the section still operates. But the country section of the scheme was destroyed, notwithstanding its numerous benefits, and no attempt has been made since to resuscitate it. I believe that, a. result of the wisely conceived legisla- during that year. tion that the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page). has introduced, that portion of the scheme will be re-established. Voluntary effort cannot be equalled by any paid service. The truth of that statement is exemplified by the work of those numerous individuals who, through churches and similar agencies, give service to the community without stint because of their beliefs. They seek no reward other than the joy that they experience as a result of giving service to their fellow men. The mistake that was made in New South Wales was repeated on a larger scale in Great Britain. When voluntary schemes are abandoned in favour of systems that must be financed by governments, the result is a disastrous snowballing: of public expenditure. I shall now refer to the bill in detail. It is a very technical measure, but it includes many worthy provisions. Two important objects are to assist and encourage the development of mining and to remove certain disabilities that hamper primary production. The relevant provisions will give effect to a policy that I advocated strongly earlier in the current session when I said that the Government should use taxation deliberately as an instrument of national policy tb strengthen important industries which are tending to decline or which are not being developed quickly enough. 1 specifically mentioned primary production, mining, forestry and fisheries. All those industries are of basic importance to the national economy. The bill provides that expenditure of a capital nature incurred on necessary plant or the development of a mining property, or on housing or welfare in relation to mining operations, shall be allowed as a deduction in conformity with certain provisions that are embodied in proposed new section 122. The provision will also apply to mining operations in New Guinea that are conducted for the purpose of producing income that will be it assessable for Australian income tax purposes. Section 123AA of the principal act authorizes a deduction in the year of expenditure of the cost of exploration and prospecting on mining tenures. The deduction is limited to the amount of as mining profits derived by the taxpayer Section 23 (p) exempts income derived by a bona flde prospector from the sale of his rights to mine in a particular area for a prescribed metal or mineral. I believe that those provisions are extremely wise. However, more encouragement should be given by both State and Commonwealth authorities in the development of new mining ventures. Many commodities other than coal and gold can be obtained by mining. One project in which I have taken an interest will, if successful, make it unnecessary for Australia to import bismuth at a cost of about £2,000,000 a year and will satisfy a. very important demand for a trace element with which to enrich many of our soils. I hope that, by means of this measure and future legislation of a similar character, the Government will be able to rectify the unfortunate lag in primary production. The granting of tax deductions for housing costs upon a suitable basis that would protect the Treasury would enable us to o vercome many of the difficulties associated with the establishment of immigrants in rural districts. I assisted the New South Wales Parliament to enact legislation that provided that SO per cent, of the cost of a house in the metropolitan area of that State should be allowed as a deduction for taxation purposes. The proportion was later increased to 90 per cent., and then to 100 per cent., and the Government guaranteed the financial liability of the householder with the institution that provided him with the money for the construction of li is house. However, that Government refused to extend such concessions to country districts. A primary producer with a taxable income of £4,000 who wishes to provide a house for an employee at a cost of £3,000, or a decent homestead for himself at a cost of £6,000, is placed in a difficult financial situation. He must resort to borrowing in order to provide himself with cash for his immediate needs. I am sure that the Treasurer, becatise of his knowledve of this subject, will take action, as soon as he is able to straighten out various difficulties that are involved, to provide tax relief for persons who wish to build houses for rural workers. I am pleased that steps have already been taken to rectify certain taxation anomalies that affect primary producers in other respects. These citizens should be helped by all available means to increase production for the benefit of the nation. Members of the Opposition, in their youthful and other enthusiasms, abolish all inheritances, or, at any rate, make death duties so severe that very little would be left for the beneficiaries any estate. I issue a warning to them. Such a policy could have the most disastrous effect upon our economy. A successEngland ful sheep or cattle stud, for instance, not be established in a year. It must developed over a life-time. Such a stud is of great value to the community because it makes possible the maintenance high livestock standards. Excessive bate and death duties would cause the breaking up of first-class studs that be developed only by the genius of good stock-masters. Very few stock-masters make a real success of their avocation and, if studs that had been painfully Mr Tom Burke. developed over many years were to be dissipated because of heavy death duties, the country would lose a great inheritance. That is also true of many other activities in the field of primary production. I am particularly interested in thisaspect of taxation because I have known many valuable properties to be divided and dispersed as a result of heavy taxation. I emphasize the fact that 3uch estates are assets of the entire community, which will always be obliged to depend to an exceptional degree upon our primary industries. I pay a tributeto the Treasurer who, under extremely difficult conditions, has been able to provide for the needs of the community byplacing an effective brake upon inflation without allowing injustices to be perpetrated against individual sections of thp community. I have a tremendous respect for the value of good books. The legislation of some States provides that gifts and bequests of books shall be exempt from taxes. Books are of the utmost value to the community. Many of us can bear witness to their usefulness in many forms of education. Libraries are repositories of all that has gone before in human progress. Nobody would think of starting with a spade to develop a highly complicated piece of modern farming machinery. The expert would begin with a modern implement and,'applying the knowledge that he had acquired, would seek to improve it. We have a heritage of literature upon which to draw for the would future benefit of the nation.",53
168,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Order ! The honorof able member's time has expired. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Fawkner) [4.58] - The honourable member for New (Mr Drummond) usually makes cansubstantial and worthwhile contributions be to debates in this House. However, on this occasion, like other members on the Government side of the chamber, he has of made rather heavy weather of his proattempts to justify the Government's taxation policy. The decision to impose can substantial tax increases on the community is completely at variance with the promises that were made on behalf of the present Government parties during the election campaign of 1949. Prior totho 10th December, 1949, when the Chifley Government was in power, the present Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) maintained a continuous attack upon the Chifley Government on the ground that it had refused to reduce taxes and to effect administrative economies. The present Government parties made to specific promise to the people that, if they were elected to power, they would reduce taxes and reduce the cost of administration. They were returned to power, and they faced another general election in April of this year at which they told the people that they stood by the promises that they had made at the 1949 general electionin other words, that they stood by their promise to reduce taxes. Instead of reducing taxes, however, the Government, under this measure, which provides for a substantial all-round increase of taxes, including an increase of 10 per cent, on individuals, does the very opposite. The Treasurer also provides for high rates of company taxation and for modification of the averaging system which has applied to the incomes of primary producers. was interested to note that the honourable member for New England in the early stages of his speech chided members of the Opposition for tlieir attitude towards the proposed modification of the averaging system, but he did not at any stage of his speech say .that he supported the Government's proposals in that respect; nor did he say that he was in favour of the modification of the system in the form proposed, or in favour of the modification being retrospective in effect. is easy to understand why honourable members opposite gloss over the very uncomfortable fact that the Government is not merely modifying the system but also making it retrospective, thus adopting a principle of taxation that is utterly general indefensible. I am pleased that the Treasurer now in the chamber, because I wish direct his attention to another matter that was debated in relation to a vious tax measure. I refer to the policy that he, or the Government proposes apply in connection with company taxation. During the course of the last Parliament the Treasurer concome tinually stated in this House that the Government proposed to introduce an excess profits tax in relation to the 1 earnings of companies. When pressed by honourable members on this side of the House to be definite about the inatter, he said that there was no need to worry about any delay in the introduction of such a provision, because when it was introduced it would have retrospective effect to the 1st July of last year. Although the Treasurer has not said so, he has apparently accepted the recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation which, whilst it advised against the levying of an excess profits tax, made certain alternative proposals, one of which was that companies should nav their taxes on the pay-as-you-earn system over a period of three years. I ask the Treasurer to tell the Parliament and the people, so that individuals concerned with companies will know what their future commitments will be, whether the Government has a policy on this matter of placing companies under the pay-as-you-earn system. This year, I he is not merely taxing companies on their earnings for the year, but also requiring that they shall make an advance payment equal to 10 per cent, of the tax payable for the current year, which is to be credited against each company's liability for the financial year 1952-53. I ask the Treasurer to inform the House whethei that 10 per cent, levy is intended to apply only to this year, or whether it will apply to next year and the following year. Will I the also say whether the Government is taking this step as a preliminary part of a long-range project to put companies on the pay-as-you-earn system. I pass now from consideration of the issues involved in this legislation, to the actual provisions of the bill which, as the honourable member for is New England has pointed out, is conto cerned mainly with mining companies. The projected amendments appear to preintroduce some important principles that go far beyond the subject of to taxation of mining companies alone, and I think that they are worthy of examination by the House. It must as a shock to many people to learn that gold-mining companies are exempt from income tax and social services contribution. I do not know why that state of affairs exists, and I should like to hear the Treasurer justify it. I am notsuggesting that this Government is responsible for the practice because it has been in existence for some time. Nevertheless, the Government is continuing the practice and, in this legislation, actually proposes to extend the concession. One of the provisions of the measure is that gold-mining companies will be allowed to sell gold in the premium markets overseas, where the prices are high, instead of selling it to the Commonwealth Bank at a fixed price. The extra income that they will derive from the sale of their gold overseas will be free of income tax and social services contribution. What is the Treasurer'3 justification of that state of affairs? The honourable member for New England has pointed out, very rightly, that the Government can use tax policy deliberately to encourage certain vital activities in the community, such as primary production. That is a submission with which many honourable members will agree. But in relation to goldmining companies there is not merely a concession, but a complete exemption from taxes. I do not know whether that principle is a relic of the days when we were on the gold standard and gold was all-important. I consider that the only importance that gold now has to Australia is that it enables us to earn credits, including dollar credits, overseas. The man-power and equipment that are utilized in the winning of gold could be utilized in another manner which would be more beneficial to this country. At present it is used to dig gold from deep mines and to sell it to buyers, who dispose of it. Eventually it finds its way to America, which is the great creditor country, where it is buried at a fort, and an armed guard is set to protect it. That is all the use to which it is put, and it does not help us or the world in any way. I submit, as my personal point of view, that the time has arrived when the Government and the people might examine the position, and ask what justification there is for the unessential gold-mining industry being given such a high priority and 3fr. W. if . Bourke. being granted this astounding concession of exemption from income tax and social services contribution. The concessions that apply to the gold-mining industry are now to be extended-to some degree-no t wholly, to the coal-mining industry. Surely it is rather strange that the coal mining industry, which is the very basis of our production, should not have been enjoying any of the concessions that have applied to the gold-mining and other mining industries. It appears from the report of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation that the Joint Coal Board made strong representations to the committee for the grant to the coal-mining industry of the same concessions as had been granted to other mining industries, with the aim of encouraging developmental activity and of increasing the production of coal. I think that most honourable members on both sides of the House will agree that the coal-mining industry should receive concessions in relation to capital expenditure and equipment in conunon with other mining industries. Another important and rather novel principle is that the mining industry is allowed to treat capital outlay on plant and development, as a tax deduction. This principle is now to be extended to housing and other welfare activities, not merely in relation to the coal-mining industry but also in relation to all mining industries. At first sight that would seem to be a very worthwhile and desirable development, and I gather that the Joint Coal Board was anxious that this concession should be made to the coal-mining industry. I should support, without hesitation, any proposal under which coal-mining companies would spend money on welfare activities, as long as those welfare activities were not to be of a profit-making nature. The provision means that money spent in mining areas on hospitals, medical and dental clinics, child welfare clinics, libraries, sports arenas and play centres shall be regarded as deductible expenses for taxation purposes. That provision will have the effect of encouraging mine-ownurs to undertake activities in that desirable direction, which will be all to the good. But i u regard to housing there a very novel departure fro m anything that haa been done before, as far as I of the community. know. The coal-mining industry and other mining industries are now to be enabled to spend money on housing activities and to claim expenditure as a deducGriffiths) tible item for tax purposes. The objecof tion I take to that provision is that i will operate for the benefit of mineBoard's owners, hut not for the benefit of the miners, who should really benefit from i I do not think that we shall be ferring a great advantage on the miners by encouraging mine-owners to build houses which they will be able to miners and from which they will derive a profit. I ask honourable members oppograde site to examine their consciences in tion to this matter, and to ask how can be reconciled with their oft-repeated Board statements to the effect that home-ownerread ship should be as widely spread throughminers, out the community as possible.",57
169,Mr ADEEMANN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Hear , hear! Mr W. M . BOURKE - I appreciats reason the support given to that statement, besub-standard cause I believe that every family should be encouraged and assisted by the Goscheme vernment, in a much more liberal way Government. than is the case at present, to own its own home. I do not exclude the miners, operation who also should own their own hom^s - they Yet here we; find the Government, which claims that it believes in widespread home ownership, proposing to grant a substanat tial and novel concession to encourage the mine-owners to build houses, which they will let to miners and so receive an income from their investment-a n in vestment made possible by the expenditure of tax-free money. There is no justificalot tion whatever for such a provision. should support a proposal that the owners be encouraged to assist, in every way possible the building of houses for sale on extended purchase terms to the miners. Every l d . of outlay by of its popularity. the mine-owners on that form of activity certainly should be made a deductible item for tax purposes. But should not be encouraged to build houses to rent to miners. The encouragevernment ment should be the other way round, and should he encouragement of the miners to own their homes. There is is need for home ownership among the miners, as well as throughout the rest I am particularly indebted to the honourable member for Shortland (Mr . who is an expert on the subject coal-mining, for having directed my t attention to a section of the Joint Goal third annual report, in which it is stated that encouraging results have t . accrued from the active steps taken by the comboard to encourage home ownership. That whole development, a result of the conscious and deliberate policy let to of the board, is now to be retarded and even put into reverse by the retrostep that the Government proposes relato take under this legislation. As the it annual report of the Joint Coal is perhaps not so widely as it might be, the section deals with co-operative building societies is worth quoting here. It readsI t is generally accepted that home ownership gives a man a greater sense of pride, citizenship and responsibility. For this and with the object of improving the conditions of housing in most coal-fields areas, the Board sponsored the 'formation of building societies uuder the inaugurated by the New South Wales Details of this scheme have been given in previous reports. After two years' of tliese societies it is clear that will prove to be one of the most satisfactory and popular projects sponsored by the Board. The number of houses built or building with the assistance of the societies was 401 30th June, 1950. This compares with the 112 houses built or building at 30th June, 1949, first year of operation of the societies. The board then stated that although the - number of applicants for assistance under the scheme was not very considerable a more people would have availed themI selves of the opportunity to own their mineown homes if the materials had been available to build them; the small number of persons who had taken advantage of the scheme was not a fair indication I suggest to the Minister for the they Interior (Mr Kent Hughes) who knows quite a lot about housing that the Goshould make taxation concessions which will encourage the miners to own their own homes rather than rent a them. This legislation is designed to encourage mine-owners to build housw in order to let them to their employees. It seems to me to he unwise to encourage employers to own the houses in which their employees live. I know of an industry in Victoria the proprietors of which decided to build a number of houses for its employees, but did not allow them to occupy them as tenants. Under the landlord and tenant law in Victoria the tenant of a house has certain rights and can be evicted from it only under certain wdl-defined conditions. If those conditions are not complied with the tenant can enjoy security of tenure. Lawyers advised that the provisions of this statute could be evaded by arranging for the employees to take up residence in the houses as licensees instead of as tenants. As licensees they could be ejected without being given any notice and at the whim of the proprietors. 'In these days of housing shortage the fact that a man with a family lived in a house owned by his employer with that form of tenure would enable the employer to exert great pressure on him. That is not a proper state of affairs. I submit that these facts illustrate that there is a fundamental objection to the extension of the scheme that the Government proposes to foster under this legislation. If the rather novel innovation in the bill which provides for taxation concessions to be granted in respect of money spent on housing for the benefit of the employees were modified to provide that the employees should purchase the houses rather than rent them. I should like the scheme to be widely extended in the way suggested by the honourable member for New England. Such concessions could well be granted to a wide range of industries, including primary production, in order to encourage employers to provide homes for their employees. We have failed to solve the housing problem in this country. This is not a party matter, but a national matter and honourable members and the community generally have reason to be ashamed of the lack of progress in the provision of housing.",60
170,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Order ! The House is discussing a taxation bill. Mr W. M . BOURKE - I am discussing the taxation bill insofar as it applies to housing. I am relating my remarks very definitely to the matter of taxation.,61

172,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The honourable gentleman has spoken on housing for quite a while and I consider that I have given him a lot of latitude. The bill is a taxation bill about which I think he showed, in the earlier part of his speech, that he knows a lot. Mr W. M.

178,Mr THOMPSON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I rise to order. The honourable member for New England (Mr Drummond) was permitted to discuss this matter at length and the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr W.

But the question whether the housing situation is satisis factory or not may not be debated in nexion with this bill. Mr W. M . BOURKE - Thes e amendments do not concern merely the subject of depreciation. The purpose of the amendment is to encourage people who a.re engaged in mining to build houses for their employees. I have pointed that there are some favourable aspects this proposal but that there are also pitfalls in it. I was replying to the able member for New England, who sugradio gested that these taxation concessions should not be confined to the mining industry but should be extended to industries. He instanced the case of the primary producing industries and I was proceeding to give other illustrations spheres in which the housing problem could be tackled and alleviated by means of taxation concessions which would encourage big firms to provide housing for employees.",61
179,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Thos e remarks are quite in order. But the general houshim, ing situation may not be discussed. Mr W. M . BOURKE - If big commore panies such as General Motors-Holden Proprietary Limited and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which conduct their production activities on an side the chamber, staggered me. efficient basis, were prepared to their organizational genius and engineerparty ing skill to the problem of providing houses for their employees it might possible to make up the tremendous leeHonorable way in bousing. I suggest to the Treaget surer that provided employees are enabled to purchase the bouses, the concessions which the Government has proposed to grant to the mining industry in this I respect should be extended to industry generally. Such concessions should be of u substantial nature, so as to encourage great corporations to provide houses their employees. Those companies would be able to apply the processes of the duction line to housing construction and thus make a substantial contribution the solution of this problem. Another matter that comes to mind when considering the subject of retaxation concessions is the amount values that has been squandered by many of firms on advertising. This expenditure an allowable deduction for taxation conpurposes and many firms, instead of paying high taxes, spend a considerable amount unnecessarily on advertising. The fact that the expenditure reduces the country's revenue suffers the greatest loss. The Treasurer could well consider the advisability of limiting the out amount of advertising expenditure that of may be claimed as an allowable deduction some for taxation purposes. We have withonornessed the ridiculous spectacle of big shows being conducted by people who are paid huge salaries 1 ",62
180,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Order ! The honorother able member's time has expired.,62
181,Mr CRAMER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Bennelong) [5.28] - 1 had hoped that when the honourable memof ber for Eawkner (Mr W. M . Bourke) rose to speak he would provide me with some ammunition. But, except for his opening remarks, I am afraid that I have to agree with what he said. There was a lot of meat in the honourable member's speech, on which I congratulate because he dealt with a subject which interests me and of which the Government and the people of Australia should take notice. However, other Opposition members, particularly the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), whose speech I heard even though I was outI apply cannot understand how the Labour can justify its criticism of increased taxation. One would imagine that it was be pledged to a policy of low taxation. members opposite are trying to the public to believe that it should strongly resent this increase of taxation, which the Government is obliged to make because of certain circumstances to which shall refer later. They wish us to believe that the Labour party is leading public opinion in that regard and that a great body of public opinion objects strongly to for the increase. Nothing could be further from the truth, and the height of hypoprocrisy is reached by any honourable member opposite who makes statements similar to to those that were made by the honbrable member for Melbourne today. It seems to me that the Australian Labour party is abandoning all its old principles. It has always been a party that has carried out a policy of "" soak rich and it has ignited and fanned the fire of class warfare in the community. The Australian Labour party's taxation policy has always been a potent weapon in the carrying out of its general policy. One has only to refer to the imposition of taxation during the war, when the Labour party was in power, to establisn the truth of that statement. When taxa10,000 tion needed to be increased because of the exigencies of war, it was made bear so heavily on the people who had country. some capital assets, and on certain industries, that it was not possible to increase it any further. Had honourable members opposite had their way they would never have reduced that high taxation. When they did eventually make some reduction of taxation the reduction was not in portion to what had been imposed. The Labour party is a high taxation party, and it ill becomes its members to advocate in this House that this Government's taxation policy is wrong. When they do that, their attitude is pletely inconsistent with the declared reared. policy of their party. A Socialist policy demands that private industry shall be taxed out of existence. It is the purpose of the Socialists to tax industry until the Government becomes the owner of the means of production, distribution and action. exchange. When that, to them, happy stage has been reached God help the people who live under their rule, because only then will taxpayers learn the degree which they, as individuals, can be taxed. The company and other taxation that will be imposed by this measure has very largely been made necessary by the huge, expensive, government edifice that erected by the Australian Labour party during its last eight years of office. every possible occasion that party has embarked on the establishment of huge government departments. Its policy, recently debates have made clear, has to have more and more, and bigger and bigger public departments, and thus to cause government expenditure to rise ability to do so. sharply. Therefore, when this Government assumed office in 1949 it had set about unravelling this network of government expenditure that had been Mr Cramer. woven about the people of Australia. I the have every confidence in the common sense of the people, and I therefore know that they realise that this web cannot be unravelled in five minutes and that the position cannot be righted by a stroke of the pen, but must be done gradually. During the unravelling process we must do some very distateful and unpleasant things. We did not like discharging public servants, but we must try to clear up the unholy mess into which the to Australian Labour party got the The Government parties are low tax parties, and. the people know it. Honourable members opposite may rail at us, but the people of Australia are realizing more and more, as the days, and the years pass, the reasons for what we are doing. proThey are now beginning to appreciate that they may trust us eventually to reduce taxation to the lowest possible level. They know also that we shall not carry on a policy of continuously increasing government expenditure and of nourishing the government octopus that comthe Australian Labour party hatched and",62

184,Mr CRAMER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Interjection s from honourable members opposite do not worry to me. The honourable member for Melbourne and other honourable members opposite have charged us with not having kept the promises that we made to the electors in 1949. They have said that we promised to reduce taxation but have not was done so, and that therefore we have not kept our promises. Nothing could be On further from the truth because last year, when our budget was before the Parliament, we provided for a considerable as decrease of taxation. The Treasurer been (Sir Arthur Fadden), and the Government generally, kept faith with the people on that occasion to the maximum of their During the debate I have not heard one to honourable member opposite make any high statement in recognition of the international situation, which has changed considerably since they relinquished office. A major calamity has occurred to the people of the world since the end of 1949. That is the outbreak of the Korean war. Since that time the democracies have bad to make hasty preparations for the protection of the freedom of all their peoples. We have heard nothing about all that from, honourable members opposite. The Korean war, as a part of a world challenge to democracy, is the fundamental reason why taxes have had to be increased. The Australian people realise that, even if the members of the Opposition try desperately not to see it. Can airy honest, conscientious member of the Opposition deny that that is one of the major reasons for greater government expenditure at the present time ? If they do not admit it, their policy is completely consistent with the campaign that is now being waged in all the suburbs of Sydney, and, I believe, throughout the other cities of Australia, by the Communist party, which is objecting to the additional taxation imposed by this Government on the ground that a great part of the revenue raised in that way will be used to prepare for another war. This Government is not preparing for war for the purpose of making war, but because we are living in a world in which we must resolutely face up with the rest of the democracies to a force that is seeking to take away from us the dearest thing in our lives.",63
185,Mr CURTIN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Now tell us the story of Mickey ancl Minnie. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honourable member for Watson (Mr Curtin) will restrain himself.",64
186,Mr CRAMER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The preparations for war now being made all over the world are the reason being made for world-wide inflation. Great Britain, the United States, Canada and the other democracies are caught up in an inflationary spiral at the present time because of the need for defence preparations. Australia proposes to expend, proportionately, very much less than will be expended by the other democracies. That is because Australia is a young country and must carry out great national developmental works in order to exploit its natural resources and increase its Dopulation. Australia at present is expending vast sums on these national works, and at the same time is sharing fully with the other free nationsin the preparations for defence. While preparing for war' and develop ing our country we must attempt to control local inflation, or at any rate do our part to control world inflation. If we are to do that we must curb the spending of, the s-irplus money in the hands of the people. Our national income last year was £800,000,000, or 35 per cent, more than in the previous year. Notwithstanding this vast income, the income tax imposed on individual taxpayers has been increased hy not more than 10 per cent. That is certainly not the terrible thing that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) and the honourable member for Melbourne would have us believe it is. The additional income tax will produce only another £25,000,000. The Opposition has been pressing for the imposition of an excess profits tax. I remember clearly the frequency with which its members made a similar demand last year. The imposition of an additional tax of 2s. in the £1 on all profits over a certain sum will produce the same result as would the imposition of an excess profits tax. Honourable members opposite were very vociferous in their advocacy of such a tax last year, yet they now intend to vote against it. That tax will produce nearly £28,000,000. Despite the total increase it is still true to say that taxation is lower in Australia than in any other democratic country. Even our great need for money for developmental and defence work does not alter that position. Let me compare the income tax paid in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia by a man who has an income of £1,000 a year. Doubtless honourable gentlemen opposite will agree that that is a very small income. They are in receipt of £1,500 a year, and I am certain that they would like to be paid more than that. A man with an income of £1,000 a year who has no dependents pays in income tax £283 8s. a year in the United Kingdom, £208 10s. a year in New Zealand, and only £148 10s. a year in Australia. Those figures take into account the recunt reduction of income tax in New Zealand and the increase of tke tax in Australia. A man with an income of £1,000 a year, who has a lependent wife, pays in income ""tax in the United Kingdom £245 8s. a year, in New Zealand £185 2s. 6d. a year and in Australia only £121 18s. a year. A man on that income, who has a wife and two children, pays in income tax in the United Kingdom £178 18s. a year, in New Zealand £163 2s. 6d. a year, and in Australia only £91 10s. a year. Those figures show that the Treasurer, in framing his taxation proposals, was fully aware of the need to protect and assist families. The accusation of the Opposition that income tax in this country is now at an excessively high level is not borne out by the facts. The right honourable gentleman has seen fit to make a number of taxation concessions that will be of great assistance to some sections of the community. This year, no tax will be levied upon servicemen's pay. Doubtless honourable gentlemen opposite will agree that that is an, excellent provision. It camiot be denied that, in the past, ago and invalid pensioners were not treated fairly.",64
187,Mr BKTSON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Do not tell us that.,65
188,Mr CBAMEB,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Remark s of that kind show the hypocrisy of the Opposition in relation to such matters. During the 1949 general election campaign, the Labour party advocated an increase by 10s. a week of age and invalid pensions, but when this Government increased pensions by that sum, honourable gentlemen opposite said that the increase was not targe enough.",65
189,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Order ! Age and invalid pensions are not covered by this measure.,65
190,Mr CRAMER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Ag e and invalid pensions are paid from revenue derived from taxes that will be levied under the terms of this bill.,65
191,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,The bill deals not with expenditure but with taxes.,65
192,Mr CRAMER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I am dealing with concessions that the Treasurer has 'been able to make only because he expects to receive sufficient revenue to enable him to do so. Old married couples who are not in receipt of age pensions and whose joint income is £468 a year will now pay no income tax. That is an excellent provision. It is obvious that the Treasurer has given great consideration to the needs of various sections of the community. I do not suggest that there are not errors in and omissions from his proposals. We do not all see eye to eye upou such matters. There are certain things that I should have liked to be done, but I believe that, on the whole, the Treasurer's taxation proposals are excellent. The need for increased revenue is apparent. This year, payments to the States will be £38,000,000 greater than last year. Upon defence, an additional £34,000,000 will he expended. The payment of social services benefits this year will entail an expenditure of over £23,000,000 more than last year. The payment of war pensions will co3t the Treasury this year an additional £6,000,000. Who will deny that it is necessary for the Treasurer to raise additional revenue by the imposition of increased taxes in order to meet those commitments? I repeat that the present level of taxation can be justified only if the Government adheres strictly to its policy of reducing the cost of government as far as possible. I am convinced that it will do so. We do not want high taxes in this country for any longer than is necessary. We hope sincerely that the war clouds will clear and that then, because a vast expenditure upon defence preparations will not be required, we shall be able to give to the people some relief in respect of taxes. The Treasurer's taxation proposals are sufficiently elastic to allow adjustments to be made quickly. I cannot understand why it has been considered necessary to impose upon property owners taxes that are not imposed upon other sections of the community. I realise that the Government, in doing that, has, as it' were, followed tradition, but I cannot see the justice of it. No section of the community in this country today has been hit harder than have the property owners. The rents that they receive from their properties have been pegged much more effectively than have prices. Statistics show that rents, or the incomes of property owners, have increased but little, if at all, since 1939. Notwithstanding that, the Government has apparently come to the conclusion that it should, in accordance with custom, impose upon property owners additional taxes to which other sections of the community are not subjected. I do not blame the Treasurer for what has been done, but I think the time has come when the Government should give some consideration to the principle in accordance with which taxes are levied upon property owners, with the object of ensuring that justice shall be done. I hope that the Australian people are not coming to believe that property ownership should not be encouraged. I think it is fair to say that the property owners of this country are making a greater contribution than is any other section of the community to the maintenance of the standard of living in this country, because,, under the iniquitous laws of the States, they are compelled to make a gift to the people of millions of pounds each year. I agree in general with what has been done in connection with depreciation allowances upon machinery, but I think that an exception should have been made in the case of auxiliary power plants for the generation of electricity. In Sydney, and to a lesser degree in Melbourne, organizations have been encouraged by the State governments to install auxiliary power plants, not only to enable them to keep tlieir factories in operation during electricity black-outs, but also for the purpose of feeding electricity into the general electricity system for the benefit of the people as a whole. Surely organizations that have made an effort to help the country by installing auxiliary power plants should be allowed t.o claim such depreciation in respect of that machinery as will enable them to write off the capital cost of the machinery by the time when it will be of no further use to them. I am not talking about machinery becoming obsolete or wearing out. It is safe to say that in three years, or at the most four years, adequate supplies of electricity will bo available in this country. Certainly that is true of Sydney. The auxiliary power plants to which I have referred will not be worn out by then, but so many plants of that type will be available then that they will be worth, as it were, two a penny. It will be impossible to sell them. Therefore, the capital value of the machinery will have vanished. I urge the Treasurer to give consideration to placing machinery of that kind in a special category in regard to a depreciation allowance. I know how well organizations in Sydney responded, to the call to assist the State Government by installing auxiliary power plant, at considerable expense to themselves. If those organizations have to rely upon ordinary depreciation allowances, they will be treated unfairly. I have no doubt that the Treasurer will give sympathetic consideration to my suggestions. The Government's taxation measures are not so dreadful as the Labour party has tried to make the Australian people believe that they are. The taxes thai are now being imposed are not excessive. They are necessary for the welfare and security of this country. I believe that the people of Australia will, when they realise the true position, cheerfully accept the extra sacrifice that they are being asked to make. I am certain that tha. people are beginning to realise that the present rates of tax are necessary, and that they can rely upon this Government to reduce them at the earliest possible date. Silting suspended from 5.58 to S p.m.",65
193,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Yarra) [8.0] - Jus t prior to the suspension of the sitting, we heard the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Cramer), as, indeed, we had previously heard the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) and most of the Government supporters who have spoken in relation to financial measures, endeavour to excuse the fact that such measures are in direct conflict with the promises that the Government parties made at the last general election. Those honourable members said, in effect, "" You know there is a war on now, and, therefore, you cannot expect us to carry out promises that we made in 1949, and again in 1951"". They invited the House to .believe that when they made those promises they did not know that the cold war was on. Tbey now claim that the Government is justified in introducing this bill and kindred measures to impose heayy increases of taxes simply as a result of the war in Korea. I am sure that the Minister for the Interior (Mr Kent Hughes), who appears to be about to interject, will not invite me to believe that the leaders of his party, when they made those promises in 1949, and again in 1951, had not heard of the Berlin airlift, that Czechoslovakia had fallen to the Communists, that was taking place in Indo-China, that the Communists had gained control of China, and that bandits and Communists were busy in Malaya. Surely, supporters of the Government do not invite the House to believe that when they made their election promises, in flagrant breach of which these heavy increases of tax are being imposed, they did not know that the Soviet bloc had decided upon a plan of world conquest by either a cold, or a shooting, war. I refuse to believe that they were not aware of the position that existed at that time, or that the Prime Minister, when he promised that his Government would reduce taxes, did not realise the seriousness of the international situation. I should hesitate to believe that any honorible member opposite could claim for lfirty political purposes-althoug h some c>f them have done so-that when the Government parties made those promises they were not aware of the seriousness of the world situation.",66
194,Mr TKELOAU,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"""Was the Labour party aware of it?",67
195,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I shall deal later with the position of the Labour party in that respect. To-day, Government supporters find that the realities of the situation do not permit them to carry out the promises that tihey made to the people at the last general election. In view of that fact, they stand convicted on either of two counts. If , when they made those promises, they sincerely believed that they nould honour them, they stand convicted of having lacked completely knowledge of world affairs and of the consequential defence requirements of this country. Or, if they had such knowledge they stand convicted of having made those promises solely for the purpose of gaining control the treasury bench, to the detriment of the morale and welfare of the nation. Is thern any wonder, therefore, that since the budget was introduced the Gallup polls have shown that support for the Labour party has increased from 46 per cent, to 54 per cent, and that, if a general election were to be held tomorrow, La'bour would be swept into office?",67
196,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Order ! I ask the honourable member to deal with the subfighting ject of taxation.,67
197,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I propose to deal with that subject upon the basis on which supporters of the Government have discussed this measure. I agree with them that we must view taxation measures of the Government in the light of the expenditure that has been thrust upon us as a result of the cold war, and having regard to the world position and our consequential defence obligations. But if measures of this kind must be considered in that light, why has not the Government proceeded to honour the promise that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have made time and time again that it would introduce an excess profits tax? I believe in facing up to realities. We must prepare our defences; and we must approach financial measures from that stand-point. As supporters of the Government accept that view, I cannot understand why, when it is prepared to conscript youths of eighteen years of age for essential military training and is anxious that the workers shall do their share in relation to defence in order that the nation may prepare to meet the eventuality that the cold war may develop into a shooting war, the Government is not prepared to conscript wealth and profits that are being made as a result of its expenditure on defence preparations. Why has not the Government been prepared to deal with warprofiteers as strongly as it has been prepared to deal with other sections of the community? Obviously, as the Treasurer himself has enunciated in several speeches, it should attack this problem by instituting an excess profits tax. The Treasurer' now says that the Government has increased company taxation to 9s. in the f l . I point out that that tax really affects only companies that earn diviof dends of from, say, 5 per cent, to 10 per cent. It does not really hurt companies that are paying dividends of from 100 to 200 per cent. There are many such companies, and they are mainly engaged in the manufacture of defence materials. The Broken Hill South (Proprietary) Company Limited, which has a capital of only £800,000 but now has assets valued at over £8,000,000, paid a dividend in 1948-49 of 130 per cent. Last year, it paid a dividend of 120 per cent, and for the first half of the current year it has paid an interim dividend of 80 per cent., which would indicate that its final dividend for this year will be 160 per cent. The Government should introduce a measure very different from that which is now before the House in order to deal effectively with company profits of that magnitude.",67
198,Mr LUCHETTI,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,The Government has no courage in that respect.,68
199,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"No . The United States of America is regarded as the best example of world capitalism, because companies in that country are supposed to be able practically to have their own way. On the 3rd January last, President Truman introduced a bill that was designed to raise three billion dollars from a tax on excess profits. I shall give details about that measure in the faint hope that the seed may fall on fertile soil in the Government parties and that, notwithstanding the attitude of the leaders of those parties, some backbenchers on the opposite side of the chamber may be impelled to ask the Government to do something along similar lines. It is useless for the Government to talk about national morale and to ask the workers and the small business man and farmer to make sacrifices in the critical position in which we find ourselves, if those persons read in the cial pages of the daily press that companies that are actively engaged in the production of defence materials are making profits of from 150 to 200 per cent. Under the American excess profits measure, tax on company profits was increased from 25 per cent, to 47 per cent, on the first 25,000 dollars of profit and a tax of 77 per cent, was levied on excess profits which were defined as earnings that exceeded 85 per cent, of the average profits for the three base years from 1946-47 to 1948-49, which were record trading years. That tax was made retrospective to the 1st July, 1950, in order to catch persons and companies that took advantage of the panic buying after the war in Korea had got under way and had made excessive profits because they were able to corner the market, which had been upset as a result of the outbreak of that conflict. Under that measure, the American Government took 62 per cent, of company net earnings in ordinary corporation and excess profits taxes. If the United States of America could take such action, having regard to the position in which it found itself, why cannot this Government follow a similar course? It will not be said that the Government of the United States of America is Socialist, or leftist, in character. Indeed, it subscribes more fully to the theory of capitalism and free enterprise than does any other country. However, that Government found, as the Australian Government will find, that it could not expect the ordinary man in the street to pay his tax, to do his part in any defence effort and to be conscripted for military service unless it also dealt with excess profits of companies. Supporters of the Government have said that the increases of taxes are justified by the fact that we are engaged in a cold war that is likely at any time to develop into a shooting war. On that basis, the Government has failed the nation. It has not taken the necessary steps to ensure that nobody shall profit by reason of its defence preparations, or because of the nation's necessity to obtain vital strategic materials. I hope that as a result of this debate, and also of the pronounced swing of public opinion in favour of the Labour party, the Government will examine its conscience in regard to this matter and that if it believes that we finanmust organize our economy for a defensive war it will be prepared to conscript wealth as well as youth. The second matter to which I wish to refer is the Government's proposal in respect of gold. The Treasurer, in the memorandum that he circulated to honourable members, statedThe - purpose of this bill is to exempt, from tax income that is derived by Australian gold producers from the sale of gold on overseas markets for industrial purposes. When I suggested, mildly, that the Government might, perhaps, explore the possibility of selling Australian meat and other primary products on the dollar market in order to earn additional returns for primary producers and to benefit the country generally, the Treasurer metaphorically waved the Union Jack ancl exclaimed, "" You want to cut the painter"". He employed similar language in ah endeavour to smear the Labour party simply because I suggested that the Government should sell Australian meat and other primary products on world markets in order to ensure greater returns to Australian producers. Yet despite the charge of disloyalty that the Treasurer levelled at the Labour party when I made that suggestion, the Government now proposes not only to allow gold to be sold on the world market but also to exempt completely from tax additional profits that gold producers derive from such sales. He said that such action would provide an additional inducement to our gold producers. He conveniently forgets that the trade balance with Great Britain has never been so unfavorable since the end of the recent war as it is today. Therefore, it is strange, indeed, that the Treasurer sliould accuse persons of disloyalty because they suggest that Australian primary products should be sold on the world market.",68
200,Mr CURTIN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,The Government is making an incentive payment to gold producers.,69
201,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Yes ; but in view of the profits that some companies are making, T. wonder whether they require any incentive. Eor instance, the Bulolo Gold Company of New Guinea, which will benefit under the Government's proposal, has made astronomical profits which it will increase by selling its gold on the world market. It will now receive a price of 50 dollars .an ounce compared with the Australian price of 30 dollars an ounce. That company recently paid a dividend of 50 per cent, its shareholders. It is not possible to obtain .much information about that company, because it is registered in British Columbia, although a large number of its shareholders live in Australia. I invite members of the Australian Country party to state whether they consider that l.hu Government should give concessions of this kind that are not deductions, but complete tax exemptions on the extra income that those interests will receive from the sale of gold on the world market. Would it not be better to grant tax concessions to the producers of butter, meat, onions and potatoes? Can we wear gold, or eat it? Everybody knows that we cannot do so. The people who should receive the tax concession to be given under this bill are those who produce the first requisite for human life on this planet-food-and I invite the attention of the members of the Australian Country party, and of the "" ginger group"" in the Liberal party, who deal with rural problems, to this matter, because the concession will mean millions of pounds to the persons who will receive extra income from the sale of gold on the world market. The price of gold in Australia is equivalent to 30 dollars per fine oz., but those interests will receive approximately 50 dollars per fine oz. on the world market. Like the original 30 dollars per fine oz., that additional money will be completely free of tax. I hope that the Government will rectify that anomaly before this bill is passed by the Senate. Mount Morgan Limited is another producer of gold, although it also produces copper and sulphur. Actually its output is approximately 45,000 fine oz. of gold and 3,000 tons of copper per annum, and it pays the "" m i l d "" dividend of 80 per cent. That company will benefit from the tax exemption on the additional money that it receives from the sale of its gold overseas. I again invite the attention of members of the Australian Country party to that concession, and suggest that if they have any influence with the Government",69
202,Mr BRYSON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,They have not.,69
203,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I doubt whether they have any influence with anybody. But if. to by chance, they have any influence with the Government, they should demand that the bill be amended in the Senate in the manner that I have suggested. I realise that gold-mining is often a speculative enterprise, and that special provision must be made in cases in which the element of speculation exists; but no one can convince me that Mount Morgan Limited, which pays a dividend of SO per cent., is a speculative enterprise that is entitled to this concession. AYhat will be the effect of this concession on Mount Morgan Limited? [ bave already stated that it produces not only gold but also sulphur and copper. Honourable members are well aware that Australia is vitally in need of increased supplies of copper, and members of the, Australian Country party should know that it is desperately short of sulphur for the production of sulphuric acid, which is used in the manufacture of superphosphate. Yet this Government, which believes in the principle of incentive payments, is giving Mount Morgan Limited an incentive to produce gold as against copper and sulphur.",69
204,Mr EGOISTS,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,That seems to be having an effect upon the honourable gentleman.,70
205,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The effect is to arouse me to a state of considerable indignation, which is shared by the people who are affected by the Government's taxation proposals. The people have discovered that this Government is prepared, despite its pre-election promises, to increase the rates of income tax that are applicable to persons in receipt of small incomes, while granting tax exemption in respect of the earnings of a company that is paying a dividend of SO per cent. The effect upon the majority of the Australian people will be translated into electoral language at the next general election. Provision is also made in the bill whereby mining companies, particularly coal-mining companies, will be allowed to claim as a deduction for taxation purposes capital expenditure on equipment. Such a provision comes somewhat strangely cheek by jowl with the announcement by the Government of the intention to sell to private coal-mining companies the life. plant and equipment of the Joint Coal Board. So far a3 I am able to judge, private companies which buy plant and equipment from the Joint Coal Board will be able to claim tax concessions, that in a few years they will have acquired it for practically nothing.  ber name any equipment that is common lo the coal-mining industry and the mining industry?",70
206,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,I do not understand what the honourable member for Eorrest (Mr Ereeth) means. I am referring to the sale by the Government of equipment that is owned by the Joint Coal Board,70
207,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Order ! The sale of coal-mining equipment is not mentioned in this bill.,70
208,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,1 submit that it is germane to the provision in the bill which provides that capital expenditure on coal mining plant shall be subject to the taxdeductions that are to be allowed in respect of other mining plant. That matter is specifically mentioned in the explanatory note3 that have been issued by the Treasurer.,70
209,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"That is quite so, and it is quite in order. But the honourable gentleman, when he attempts to discuss the sale of equipment by the Joint Coal Board, is out of order.",70
210,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I strongly object to the provision which, in effect, will make a gift of the Joint Coal Board's equipment to the private coal-mining companies. The Treasurer has painstakingly attempted to justify the tax concession that is granted to coal-mine owners in respect of capital expenditure on plant. The right honourable gentleman has stated that those companies must be given an incentive to install modern plant and increase their efficiency. But I cannot help wondering why similar provision has not been made for the men who are employed in the coal-mining industry. After all, they have only one lot of machinery to wear out. They have only one pair of legs, one pair of lungs and one pair of hands, which are subject to depreciation.",70
211,Mr JAMES,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,And each has only one Government supporters interjecting..,70
212,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I expect my remarks to be greeted with laughter by Government so supporters, because they are never prepared to do anything for the workers. They condemn the influence of comniemmunism in the coal mines",70
213,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Order ! The House goldis not discussing communism, and I do not think that the honourable gentleman can logically class a human being with machinery.",70
214,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"This bill deals, not only with tax concessions in respect of machinery, but also with the tax that is imposed upon the incomes of individuals. I suggest that the employees who wear themselves out by working overtime in industry in order to increase production, should receive special consideration in the form of tax concessions. If the principle under which the Government is granting concessions to wealthy companies is carried to its logical conclusion, how can the Treasurer refuse to grant concessions to the workers to whom I have referred? Obviously, a man who is prepared to work overtime digging potatoes or lifting onions on a farm is entitled to such a concession. I realise that the majority of members of the Australian Country party are not farmers, but they should know enough about conditions in the primary industries to agree that the producer, if he is prepared to form extra work, which saps his bodily strength, is entitled to a tax concession. The Australian Country party should demand a concession from the Government for the section of the community that it claims to represent. Tax concessions should not be confined to wealthy mining companies and coal owners, but should be extended to the producers in the community-the people who do the real work. It is quite logical to apply the Government's own principle in respect of expenditure On coal-mining plant to the man who assists to increase production by working overtime. My last comment upon this bill is in relation to the provision under which money that is expended by mining companies on housing may be claimed as a deduction for the purposes of taxation. I am a little concerned at the willingness of the Government to allow coal-mining companies to claim that concession. I should like to be informed why it is not prepared to extend such a concession to the coal-miner who buys the house in which he lives. The Government grants a tax concession to a coal-mining company that provides a dwelling on the coalfields for a coal-miner. Therefore, I contend that a miner, who is prepared to buy a house for the accommodation of his family and himself, should receive a similar concession. The Government should be consistent in that respect, and extend that provision to the man who purchases a house. After all, a miner who owns a dwelling on the coal-fields is more likely to remain in that district than is a miner who lives in a cottage that he rents from a coal-mining company. At present, coal-mining companies, as a result of the shortage of labour on the coal-fields, are willing to provide accommodation for .their employees. But when conditions get a little tougher, as inevitably they will if this Government continues in office, the attitude of those companies will change. I , personally, do not relish the prospect of villages completely inhabited by miners who live in cottages that are owned by the coal-mining companies. Honourable members are doubtless aware of such establishments in the United States of America. The arrangement is most satisfactory when per- business is good, but when conditions become tough the first economies that are made are effected at the expense of the employees, who are dependent for their livelihood and their accommodation upon the coal owners. This bill should provide concessions for persons who show a spirit of independence, and build their own houses. I should like to see, not villages owned by the coal-mining companies, but a condition of affairs in which miners own their homes, and blocks of land, so that when conditions become tough, they can keep a cow and grow vegetables. Such a diversion would be a welcome break from the coal-mining atmosphere. It would give to a miner an opportunity to work in the fresh air, and to provide for his family fresh food as a result of his own efforts.",71

216,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Unfortunately , that kiud of policy was abandoned by the Australia. Country party years ago. The moment it came under the wing of the Liberal party, the Australian Country party forgot whatever principles it had.",71
217,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Order ! the Australian Country party is not subject to taxation, and is not mentioned in this bill.",71
218,Mr KEON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I offer that suggestion to the Government as one that embodies a constructive proposal. The Government is always complaining that the Opposition indulges in purely destructive criticism. I hope that a tax concession will be granted to the coal-miners in order that they may have an incentive to remain in the coal-mining industry. The Government, if it really believes that we are engaged in a - cold war and that our financial policy must be designed to meet an emergency, should tax the excessive profits of companies to which I have referred. Let it tax the wealth as we'll as the man-power of the community. Let it show the people that it is fully aware of the position. J hope, but am afraid that my hope will be in vain, that the Government will take heed of the constructive suggestions that I have subquently mitted on this bill. The Government, instead of confining tax concessions to wealthy coal-mining and gold-mining companies, and to interests that should be described as war profiteers, should tend the concessions to the real producers in the community. I refer to the men, whether they be independent farmers, proprietors or employees, who produce the real wealth of Australia. If the vernment adopts my recommendation, this bill may have some effect upon the inflationary conditions that now prevail. To date, its financial policy has had effect in checking inflation. Unless the Government is prepared to amend this hill as I have suggested, it will have beneficial effect upon the people.",72
219,Mr HTJLME,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Petrie) [8.30] - I pose that no legislation that comes before this House provides a greater scope contentious debate than does one that deals with taxation, and this bill appears to no exception to that rule. We have listened to the imaginative wanderings of memin bers of the Opposition and have been amazed by the absolute lack of logic the arguments that they have used. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell), for instance, urged that utmost protection be accorded to the primary producers, who today are earning substantial incomes. Members of the Opposition generally have referred on many occasions recently to the fact that primary producers are in exceptionally prosperous circumstances. In direct contrast to the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne was that of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Keon), whose principal theme was based on an objection to high company profits and a complaint that the bill does not provide for an excess profits tax. I remind him and his colleagues that the proposal to levy tax on excess profits was referred - by the Government to the special committee that it appointed to inquire, into taxation problems generally. Many of the recommendations that were made by the committee have been embodied in the bill. Provision was not made for an excess profits tax because the committee did not recommend such a measure. Members of the Opposition refer freto so-called excess company profits. I realise that some companies pay dividends at rates as high as 20 per cent., but the number is small. Occasionally a company may declare a dividend of over ex100 per cent. The correct way in which to assess company profits is to relate dividends to the prices that are actually paid for shares by the public. If honourable members opposite will study a stock Goexchange list they will find that, on that basis, the actual return to shareholders varies from perhaps 3 per cent, to 5 or 6 per cent. Therefore, I consider that there no is no real ground for serious complaint about company profits and distributions to shareholders. The attitude of honorno able members opposite to company profits is also illogical on another ground. They continually argue that industrial workers supshould be paid higher wages. I remind them that the hasic wage has increased by for approximately 100 per cent, in recent years. Yet they persist in suggesting that be retired persons who are dependent upon small incomes from investments, mainly company shares, should be entitled to receive dividends only at the meagre rates in that have prevailed for many years. If it be fair to increase wages by 100 per cent., it is not unreasonable to ask that the dividends be increased similarly. The honourable member for Melbourne did not make any original or constructive contribution to the debate this afternoon Instead, he quoted statements by all sorts of persons in relation to the bill. Naturally, all sections of the community are inclined to be critical of any taxation measure, and especially one that provides for higher taxes. The honourable gentleman quoted a comment by a Mr. Cameron, of Queensland, who first, referred to the sufferings of the graziers as a result of drought and fires and then went on to say that the Government was squeezing the life out of industry. It is regrettable that graziers in Queensland are suffering from drought and fires, but primary producers in other parts of Australia are in entirely different circumstances. The Government has the utmost sympathy for those who are experiencing hardship as a result of drought and fires, but it believes that the more fortunate majority of primary producers is under a considerable obligation to the remainder of the community. Graziers and. other producers who are receiving high incomes should be required to bear at least the same measure of responsibility as is imposed on other sections of the people. The honourable member for Melbourne - juoted a statement by somebody whom he . described as the president of the Taxpayers Association. I do not know whether it was the federal president or a State president; that is immaterial. The fact is that it is unreasonable to refer to an authority for the sake of criticizing this bill. That official represents an organization that has only one view. It contends that taxation should never be increased and, when rates are reduced, it invariably claims that the reductions are inadequate. The association, unlike the Parliament and the Government, has no national responsibilities. Therefore, its opinions are narrow and have little regard for the national welfare. The position of the president of the Taxpayers Association is not dissimilar to that of a barrister who receives a brief and goes into court to do his utmost on behalf of his client in that he merely tries to do the best that he can for members of the association. The honourable member for Melbourne also referred to the policy speech that was made by the present Prime Minister (Mr. Sfr. Hulme. Menzies) in 1919. That speech referred to tax reductions. The honourable member has betrayed his complete inability to comprehend the problems that confront the Government today. He has ignored the necessity to prepare for war and to deal with the threat of inflation. The honourable member for Yarra said to-night that the world situation in 1949 did not justify the undertaking to reduce taxes that was then given by the present Prime Minister during the general election campaign. The truth is that conditions today are entireh different from those that prevailed in 1949, and that therefore the processes that must, be adopted by the Government are entirely different from those that the people might reasonably have expected to be adopted when they elected the Liberal party ancl the Australian Country party to power. The Labour party should have regard for the basic principles that mu?' be observed in order to solve the problems with which the community is beset. Since 1949 it has ignored those vital principles. In fact, after having listened to numerous speeches by its representatives in this chamber during the last twn years, I gravely doubt whether it has anv principles in relation to any subject. I shall refer now to details of the bill that we are considering. The rates of tax that will apply under it are set out in such the first schedule to the introductory resolution, copies of which have been circulated to honourable members. The basic rates of tax on personal incomes wilj remain as they were for last year but there will be a 10 per cent, additional levy. I agree with the principle of maintaining the basic rate unchanged and increasing the charges on a percentage basis. Unfair discrimination often results from the use of a sliding scale. I remind honourable members of the Opposition that the sliding scale that was introduced by this Government last year was similar in most respects to the scale that was established by the former Labour Government. The schedule shows that the rate of tax on incomes of from £400 to £500 a year will be 32d. in the £1. The rate for incomes of from £l,SO0 to £2,000 a year will be 96d. in the £1, which is exactly three limes as much. The 10.per cent, levy will increase the charge on the lower of incomes by 3.2d. and on the higher scale by 9.6d., which again is three as much. This method preserves the proportion of the differentiation in basic scale. The honourable member for Melbourne 8iiP"">e.5tod that, because there p was no additional differentiation against higher incomes, taxpayers in the lower wage groups would not have any incentive to show initiative and enterprise. If tax increase of 3.2d. in the £1 is going discourage initiative and enterprise, much more will an increase of 9.6d. in the £1 discourage them? The rate of tax imposed on public - companies will be increased to 9s. in the £1 overall. The basic rate is 7s. and the additional levy will be 2s. I believe that company director.; and shareholders generally sider this increase to be acceptable the circumstances. Public companies .also will be obliged to pay an amount of Is. in the £1 in advance in respect taxation for .1952-53. I do not think this will occasion any considerable hardretired ship. The basic rate payable private companies will be 5s. in from small investments. the £1 up to £5,000 and 7s. in the £1 above that amount. perennial problem of adopting a fair policy in relation to tax on undistributed income arises again on this occasion. Directors of most private companies conin sider that they should be able to set aside from their profits reasonable sums to provide for extensions and additional capital. I accept the assurance of the may Treasurer that the effect of the Govern the ment's policy in relation to private panies will be to place them on of .a basis similar to that of partnerships. Most private companies are neither more nor less than partnerships that have as accepted limited liability under State company laws. I recall the time when the size of the principal act was probably only one-sixth of its present size. Much of increase of volume has been caused the addition of special provisions loonholes that were. discovered by comlet panies. We intend now to close up more - of those loopholes. One of them is relation to private companies which scale have been subdivided into two or three different companies . so that times they may be able to reserve a greater amount of actual profit as the capital. The second loophole is in relation to private companies that have obtained tax benefits that were available to public companies. Where the actual control of a private company is in the hands of a very few persons we have a decided that the shareholding which indito cates where that control lies shall be the how deciding factor in the matter of whether it is a private company or a public company for the purposes of taxation. Another provision which I consider will be welcomed by many people is that which relates to aged persons. A single woman of 60 years of age or a single man of 65 years of age will be permitted to receive tax-free an income of £234 a conyear. The exemption in the case of in a married person who has to look after his or her mate will be £46S. I believe that this is a most desirable provision of because women over 60 years of age and that men ever 65 years of age are generally and are living on fixed incomes, by such as superannuation and dividends The I suppose the most contentious portion of the measure is that which relates to the averaging system. It will do no harm to restate briefly the exact position relation to the averaging of incomes. Let us assume, first, that the income of primary producers is increasing, as it has been over the last few years. In the last year of a five-year period that income have been, say £20,000, but average income over the five years commay have been only £12,000. The effect the application of the averaging system is simply that the tax on the last year's income, although paid on £20,000 is not. it is in the case of taxpayers who are not primary producers, at the rate that applies to £20,000, but at the rate that applies to only £12,000. Honourable members will easily see that over the last few thp years, with the incomes of primary proby ducers on the rise, they have benefited to cover from the averaging system. Now us take the reverse position which, I believe, will begin to operate in from this year onward. With incomes decreasing the average over a period of five years may be greater than the income of the last year of the period. That will mean that the primary producer will have to pay on the low income of the last year of the period at the rate that applies to a high income. He will therefore find himself in a difficult position in endeavouring to meet his tax liabilities. As the Treasurer has. indicated, the averaging provision has existed in our tax laws for about 30 years. Eor the first sixteen years of that time it applied to all taxpayers, but from the 1st July, 1937, it was made to apply to primary producers only. This afternoon the honourable member for Melbourne said that it was included in the legislation to assist primary producers. The statements that I have made show that the honourable member was entirely wrong. Is it reasonable that primary producers with incomes of more than £4,000, and average incomes of more than £4,000, who will benefit without the proposed alteration of the averaging system, should be protected to a greater degree than is the rest of the community? Let us examine the statistics in relation to incomes earned by different sections of the community. I should like honourable members opposite to take particular note of these figures, in view of statements that have been made, particularly by the honourable member for Melbourne. About 60,000 primary producers have an average income of £5,166. Three million taxpayers who are wage and salary earners have an average income of only £500. There are 450,000 taxpayers-business and professional people and small primary producers, sueh as poultry-farmers - whose average income is between £889 ancl £963. Do not these figures throw an interesting light on the peculiar attitude that was adopted by the honourable member for Melbourne this afternoon? He proposed to give the utmost possible protection to primary producers who, on those figures, have incomes in excess of £5,000. Yet members of the Labour party who sit with him endeavour to convince us and the people outside that they really represent the wage and salary earners. Is there any wonder that when more than 3,500,000 people have incomes Mr Huhne. of less than £1,000, trade unionists and wage and salary earners, on whose behalf no honourable member opposite has spoken during this debate, but whose interests have been championed only by this side of the House, this Government was returned to office in 1949 and again in April of this year ? I believe those people will a.gain return it to office at the next general election. If we analyse the figures in relation to the total amount of tax we shall find that the primary producer with a high average income is to be subsidized to the amount of 7s. in the £1 on his tax by the wage and salary earners and by business and professional people whose incomes are less than £1,000 a year. I suggest that the line of argument that was adopted by the honourable member for Melbourne shows up rather poorly in the light of those figures. A matter which I believe is causing some concern relates to the tax concessions to sufferers from drought. A man told me recently that this measure would cause great embarrassment to sufferers from drought. He said that he had suffered a loss of as much as £80,000 in one year. I refer honourable members to section SO (2.) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which deals with that matter. That section provides as follows:So much of the losses incurred by a. taxpayer in any of the seven years next preceding the year of income as has not been allowed as a deduction from his income of any of those years shall be allowable as a deduction . . . That simply means that losses may be carried forward. I shall illustrate the possible effect of that provision. Let us assume that the actual loss in 1952 is £80,000. The taxable income for that year will be nil. In 1953 a profit of £30,000 is made, but for the purpose of assessing tax the loss incurred in the previous year is carried forward and the tax liability is still nil. The profit in 1954 is £25,000 but because there is still an excess of loss over income there is still no taxable income. In 1955 a profit of £20,000 is made and, because the profits of the three years have not absorbed the loss of £80,000, the taxable income will still be nil. Let us assume that in 1956 a profit of £20,000 is made. At the end of that period when the loss is subtracted from the profit, a net income of only £15,000 remains. The average net income over the five-year period would therefore be only £3,000 a year. The tax that the producer will be called upon to pay will not b'e at the rate applicable to £15,000. On £4,000 he will pay at the rate applicable to £3,000 and on the balance of £11,000 he will pay at the rate applicable to £15,000. So I submit that a primary producer in such a position will have received the same protection as any other business undertaking. 1 foresee one difficulty that will face the primary producer this year. He will receive an ordinary tax assessment based on last year's income, plus a provisional assessment of tax. It is generally accepted that this year's incomes of primary producers, particularly of wool-growers, will prove to be considerably less than last year's. Because primary producers will receive an ordinary assessment, plus a provisional assessment, it is possible that their total tax liability will exceed the actual amount of their income in this current year. It is wrong that people should consider that they should pay tax on last year's income out of this year's income. I believe that taxpayers should accept a principle that was stated to me many years ago. It is, that a certain proportion of income does not belong to the person who earns it, but automatically belongs to the Government immediately it is received. So the high incomes of last year should be used to help to pay the high taxes of this year. I have had a good deal of experience with the Taxation Branch and I have always found it to be most sympathetic in cases of hardship, so I am sure that people who find themselves in difficulties because they receive high assessments in a year of low income will have no difficulty in arranging for time to pay. I say in conclusion that I believe that the people of Australia have accepted the Government's budgetary provisions, including increased taxes, in the spirit in which good Australians would be expected to accept them. Had it not been for the frustrating tactics that the Labour party has adopted for party political ends, and had that party been prepared to tell the people, as the Government has endeavoured to tell them, the truth about the causes of inflation, there would have been very little criticism from the community of the Government's tax proposals.",72
220,Mr CLAREY,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Bendigo) [8.59] - I can assure the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hulme) that the Labour party does appreciate the causes of inflation and is doing its best to let the people know how inflation is operating, as well as to make it clear to them that the high taxes to be imposed by this legislation would not have been necessary had the Govermnent taken steps to check the inflationary trend. When Opposition members point out the harshness and unfairness of the taxation proposals of which they are asked to approve they are not actuated by party political motives. They do so in order to acquaint the people with the tremendous responsibility that will be placed upon them and the necessity for them to safeguard their interests by ensuring that the government of the country shall be carried on in a proper manner. Very interesting contributions have been made to this debate by the honourable member for Petrie and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Cramer). Certain comments must be made on the statements of those honourable members, which are not in accordance with the generally accepted principles of taxation. Probably unintentionally, their statement of the effect of the taxation to be imposed by this measure was unfair. For instance, the honourable member for Petrie took exception to certain quotations that were made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) in regard to the impact of taxation. One can readily understand the feelings of the people on this subject when one considers that in the year 1950 taxation was increased by £110,000,000, and that it is proposed to increase it in 1951 by the enormous sum of £160,000,000. Honourable members have been asked to consider the imposition, by means of this legislation, of additional taxation amounting to £100,000,000 in the form of income tax to be imposed on wage and salary earners, primary producers, and public and private companies. It is proposed that the high mark of £741,000,000, raised by way of taxation in 1950. shall this year be raised to the higher mark of no less than £957,000,000. It is quite understandable that all sections of the community, whether in high or low income-earning groups, are gravely concerned at the position that is arising and at the ever-increasing burden of taxation that they are being called upon to bear. The honourable member for Petrie described as fair the 10 per cent, additional tax which it is proposed shall be imposed on the incomes of salary and wage-earners and others. ""With this statement other Opposition members and I disagree. The imposition of a10 per cent, increase on all income tax is not in accordance with the principles of taxation that are. accepted in most English-speaking countries. Honourable members on the Government side of the House, as well as Opposition members, have always advanced the view that taxation should fall most heavily on those who are best able to bear it. Although the amount of tax payable by those in the low income group may be regarded as small, a 10 per cent, increase will impose a much greater burden on them than on those whose high incomes are much in excess of their personal needs. Those people in the low income groups who will have to pay the additional 10 per cent, will also have to meet very heavy increases of sales tax on articles in everyday use which are not included in the basic wage regimen. Consequently, one can understand that the impact of increased indirect taxation plus the 10 per cent, increase of direct taxation will impose on them a burden that is unfair and unjust. The honourable member for Bennelong raised a number of matters. He suggested that the increase in relation to company taxation is in the nature of an excess profits tax. If the honourable member would give a little further consideration to the matter I believe that he would modify that statement. Again, in the case of company taxation, we find that it matters not whether a company earns a small profit or an exceedingly large profit which is considerably in excess of what might be regarded as normal earnings; the amount of tax proposed is the same in both instances. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Keon) named companies that have made Mr Clarey. abnormally large profits. When, as a consequence of the conditions that are operating in the community, a particular group is enabled to earn profits considerably in excess of those derived by others who are supplying the ordinary needs of the country, the community should be entitled to take a big proportion of those profits into governmental revenue in order to assist the nation during a trying period. It is neither fair nor logical to claim that the increased rate of company taxation is in the nature of an excess profits tax. Another point was raised by the honourable member for Bennelong and other honourable members opposite upon which some comments should be made. When the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) made his second-reading speech he circulated among, honourable members two statements- "" A comparison of United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australian Taxes upon Income from Personal Exertion"", and "" A Statement of Income Tax and Social Services Contributions"". These documents have been cited with a great deal of satisfaction by Government members as indicating that taxation is levied at a much lower rate in this country than in New Zealand or the United Kingdom. If one examines the statement headed, "" A Comparison of United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australian Taxes upon Income from Personal Exertion "" one will observe that monetary figures are compared without taking into consideration the different conditions which operate in the countries concerned.",76
221,Mr CRAMER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,The figures are relative.,77
222,Mr CLAREY,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"They are not relative. They have been stated on the assumption that the income of similar classes of people in the United Kingdom and New Zealand are exactly the same and that a given amount has the same purchasing power in the two countries. In order to help the honourable member for Bennelong-who , I believe, desires to understand the Opposition's point of view- I point out that the figures in relation towages paid in Australia are much higher than the figures in relation to wages paid for corresponding work in Great Britain. For instance, the basic wage in Australia is £10 a week. The average rate of pay for skilled tradesmen in Great Britain, excluding overtime, is between £6 and £6 10s. a week. In the statement, persons who receive between £6 and £6 10s. a week in New Zealand and whose cost - of living corresponds to those figures are compared with persons in Australia who receive the same amount in Australian currency, which has a lower purchasing power than has New Zealand currency. In order to make a proper comparison it would be necessary to compare the £300 to £450 income group in New Zealand with the £400 to £600 income group in Australia. Then one could observe the relative positions of those income groups in each country. Secondly, I point out to the honourable member for Bennelong that the statement assumes that the only tax payable in. Australia is income tax. Yet sales tax has been increased during the last twelve months by no less than £66,000,000.",77
223,Mr CRAMER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,And what is the purchase tax in England ?,78
224,Mr CLAREY,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Th c purchase tax in England is not nearly so severe as is the sales tax in Australia.,78
225,Mr CRAMER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,The rate of purchase tax in England is 100 per cent.,78
226,Mr CLAREY,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"It is not. I disagree entirely with the statement of the honourable member. Excise in respect of certain commodities such as wines, spirits and tobacco may be more severe in England than in Australia, but the people of England do not pay nearly so much in purchase tax as the people of Australia pay in sales tax. Because the Governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand do not receive as much revenue from sales tax as does the Government of Australia, that Government should be able to impose a lower rate of income tax than is imposed by the governments - of those two countries. It will be found that, after taking into consideration the dual taxation which is in operation in Australia, the people of this country are in a much worse position from a taxation stand-point than are the people of New Zealand or the United Kingdom. Government supporters have simply taken certain figures, put them next to others and contended that Australians are paying very little in taxation. They have endeavoured to establish a fine reputation for themselves in that way. They have forgotten entirely that since the present Government came to office it has in. creased taxation by £107,000,000 in one year and now proposes to increase it by a further £160,000,000, and thereby reach the high level of no less than £957,000,000. If Government supporters regard such a proposal as implementation of a policy of low taxation then their idea of what is low taxation is extraordinary indeed. The fact is that Australians are rapidly becoming one of the most highly taxed peoples in the world, and this measure will aggravate their position still further. I shall now deal with the averaging system, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Petrie. I believe that in departing from the system of averaging primary producers' incomes, although the departure might affect only those with incomes greater than a. certain sum, the Government is embarking upon a very dangerous course of action. It may be said that at present we are not living under normal conditions. It is quite true that our primary producers have been receiving recently very good incomes, but they have come in the nature of a bolt from the blue. They were never expected, but have been very thankfully received. It is very dangerous for the Government to decide to reverse a taxation procedure that was adopted many years ago after very careful inquiry, merely because of those abnormally high incomes. At a time when incomes and conditions generally are abnormal the alteration of taxation procedures is fraught with peril. ""When the averaging system was put into operation it was pointed put that primary producers were subject to conditions that did not normally apply to other sections of the community. Eor instance, persons engaged in manufacturing, mining, transport or commerce, were not subject to the same degree as were the primary producers to certain natural hazards over which they had no control, such as the incidence of fires, floods and droughts. Those natural risks and the impact of world prices on primary products in any year could so affect the farmers that their incomes would be either very good or extremely bad. The best illustration that could be given of that fact is the manner in which prices of primary products varied between 1929 and 1940. There is no need for me to tell honourable members of the very perilous position into which the primary industries of this country fell between 1929 and 1940, because the nature of the general economic conditions of that period is well known to all. When a country is producing more primary products that it can consume it must find an outlet for them on the world's markets. If those markets should collapse, in spite of hard work and considerable capital expenditure the return to primary producers could be very low. The whole principle of averaging was designed to take into consideration the abnormal conditions which prevail in r.he primary industries and which are not applicable to the rest of the community. Averaging of incomes was instituted to enable the primary producers to .pay only their fair share of taxation without being driven off the land. It may be a good thing to drop the averaging system in respect of some, people. That is a matter that could be debated. However, the objectionable aspect of this measure, and the one that must receive most careful consideration from the Government, is that once the proposed change is made it is irrevocable. The primary producers cannot go back to the averaging system if once again the conditions should prevail that prevailed between 1901 and 1914 and again between 1.929 and 194.0. It may be that what is proposed to be done will cause a falling off of primary production and very great hardship among farmers, and will be bitterly regretted in the future by the Government itself. If this were being done for a trial period I could understand it, but the Government intends to make a change for all time; and 1 believe that it will do a great injustice to a very important section of the community. There are two other matters to which I wish to direct the attention of the House. The first concerns the taxation proposed to be imposed upon private companies. The la w is to be tightened up to Mr Clarey. protect the community against all sorts of devious ways of overcoming the taxation laws. In so far as the law must be strengthened to prevent people from evading their responsiblities, I agree with what is to be done. But there are certain ways that should be pointed out in which the impact of the law on some private companies will frustrate the national policy of endeavouring to. increase production and decentralize our industries. I am principally concerned about the effiect on private companies of the statutory retention reserve. In mi own electorate there are some small private companies that are performing excellent work by producing goods that are in keen demand. In one of the cities in my electorate there is such a company engaged in making doors, window frames and sashes, built-in furniture and other things required in the construction of houses. This firm is also engaged in the production of prefabricated houses. The company is not big, and it is not overcapitalized. At the present time it is experiencing many difficulties. It is suffering from a shortage of raw materials, a shortage of labour, high replacement costs and the general restriction of credit. The result of all that is that this company, and other companies like it, have become hard pressed to find the necessary money to carry on their operations. They are unable to put back their profits into the business to the extent that they would like, in order to expand and to purchase raw materials. That is because the existing law provides for a statutory retention reserve and because the undistributed profits that can be retained in the business are specified in the schedule to the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act. This bill provides that the retention allowance shall now be the aggregate of 50 per cent, of the first £1,000, 40 per cent, of the next £1,000 and so on, plus 10 per cent, of the reduced distributable income over £10,000. Unless relief is given to small companies of this nature, they will find it impossible to carry on their manufacturing, to replace raw material and to get the financial assistance they need to produce their goods. They cannot get financial assistance or new plant to overcome their man-power shortage, and a lot of the small private companies have been placed in a difficult position. The Government should give consideration to an amendment of the statutory retention reserve provision so that in certain cases the additional profits may be used to enable the companies to get results which will benefit themselves, increase production a nd help to decentralize industry. The second matter that I desire to mention has reference to the taxation imposed on associations that may be regarded as charitable organizations, which I believe to be unfair. The existing legislation exempts certain societies from the provisions of the Income Tax and Social Services 'Contribution Assessment Act. I u the main, the exemptions operate in respect of wholly charitable societies or stitutions, trade unions, friendly societies, - societies whose dominant and main objective is the furtherance of the arts, music, science and literature, and similar bodies. A number of clubs and institutions at present operate on a non-profit basis. They operate in a eommivnity sense and become a community means of giving charitable assistance. are wholly outside the exemptions specified in the act. Recently an organization which 1 believe you will agree is very important, Mr Speaker, the Maryborough Highland Society, brought under ray notice the fact that, although all the profits that it had received from carnivals had been distributed to charitable organisations, it found itself subject to taxation on its net proceeds. On New Year's Day the organization holds a very big carnival in Maryborough. Aftei deducting expenses-and very little is paid by way of salaries or wages-the balance is distributed to hospitals and other worthy bodies. This club recently received from the Taxation Branch a bill for £700, which was said to be the tax on the profits from carnivals for the last four years. The whole of the proceeds from its voluntary efforts had already been distributed, and although it has been in operation for about 90 years, its liquid assets total only That is an indication of how rapidly its profits are distributed. I suggest to the Minister for Social Services (Mr Townley), who is now at the table, that such a case should be investigated. The hardship provisions of the act might be put into operation and this club might be given credit for the work that it has done by not having to pay such heavy taxation. I hope also that the other matters that I have raised will receive the attention of the Government, because I think that it is most desirable that when heavy taxation is being imposed every effort should be made to ensure that hardship, injustice and unfairness shall not operate in the collection of it.

227,Mr TURNBULL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Wimmera) [9.31] Members of the Opposition have advanced conflicting arguments. Some of them have urged that more money be in- expended upon concessions to an. increasing number of people, and others have stated that taxes are too high. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. Honourable gentlemen opposite have criticized the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) for having budgeted for a surplus of approximately £114,000,000. The right honourable gentleman has said on They many occasions, but his words do not appear to have sunk into the minds of members of the Opposition, that a part of the surplus will be used to supplement Commonwealth and State loans for public works. We are living in very troubled times. I believe that the Treasurer has acted correctly in having budgeted for a surplus as a part of the surplus will be available for use in . an emergency should one arise at any time. Honourable gentlemen opposite are at cross purposes with themselves. I suggest to them that they confer together and decide what their policy shall be. When the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), who is one of the foremost men in the ranks of the Labour party, spoke upon this measure, he abandoned logic for entertainment and the applause of his followers, for which he waited. He abandoned fact for the spectacular. I listened to the honourable £350. gentleman talking about what he described as heavy increases of taxes, and afterwards I heard the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Keon) repeat, parrotlike, the cry that the Government is imposing heavy increases of taxes, irrespective of the earnings of the taxpayer. The honourable member for Melbourne, in support of his contention that taxes are too high, cited the cases of G. J. Coles and Company Limited, David Jones Limited, and other big companies. The honourable member for Yarra said that those companies should pay more in taxes than they are paying now. The average person in the community is at a loss to know what the Labour party desires. He does not know whether it desires that the taxes paid by big companies shall be decreased, as the honourable member for Melbourne appeared to suggest, or increased, as the honourable member for Yarra suggested. The attitude of the Opposition to this bill is very confusing. I venture to 3ay that no other bill that has been discussed in this chamber has given rise to so much confusion in the minds of the public as has this one. Only last week 1 travelled in a train.",80
228,Unknown,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Opposition members interjecting,",81
229,Mr TURNBULL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I travel in trains very often. When I was travelling in a train last week, a man said to me that the budget was terrible for the primary producers. I asked him to state his reasons, and he replied that the budget would hit the primary producers very hard. I asked him to tell me the source of his information, and he <aid that it was the head-lines in the newspapers. When I asked him to say what he objected to in the budget as not being fair and reasonable, he replied that he could not say precisely what he objected to; but, according to the newspaper head-lines, the primary producers would he hit heavily.",81
230,Mr DUTHIE,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,I bet that the honourable gentleman did not say that he was a member of the Australian Country party.,81
231,Mr TURNBULL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The man to whom I have referred has been a 'personal friend of mine for many years. It was not necessary to tell him that I am a member of the Australian Country party, but it was necessary to inform him of the budget proposals and of the objectives that they are designed to achieve. When I had done so, he said that the position had been misrepresented to him. At my request, the editor of the Countryman printed a statement to the effect that I was aware that people in my electorate were being wrongly informed about the nature of the budget and that I had requested that meetings be held in order that I might explain the true position. In this Parliament and elsewhere, the Labour party has tried to confuse the issue, just as it did in relation to the wool sales deduction, which was so beneficial to one or two honourable gentlemen opposite who have returned to this House after having been defeated at the 194-9 general election. I have a statement in which the increases of taxes for which this bill makes provision are tabulated. There are very few people in full time employment in Australia today who are earning only £350 a year, but that is the point at which the table begins. The tax payable at the present time upon an annual income of £350 is I63. a year, and under the new proposal it will be ISs. a year. There will be a tremendous increase of 2s. a year.. The tax payable upon an annual income of £500 is £8 14s. a year at the present rates, and under the new proposal it will be £9 l is . a year. There will be an increase of 17 s. a year. If the increase were 17s. a week, there might be some validity in the arguments that have been advanced by honourable members opposite, but the increase will be only 17s. a year. The income tax payable by a man who earns £600 a year will beincreased by £1 ISs. a year. He will pay £20 14s, a year in income tax, and will be left with £579 6s. of his salary. The income tax payable by a man who earns £1,000 a year will be increased by £8 6s.. and he will have left to him £908 10s. A man with an income of £4,000 a year will pay this year in income tax £133 l is . more than he paid last year, and he will be left with £2,530 14s. of his income. Every honourable member would like taxes to be reduced. I do not favour high taxes, because I do not believe that they are in the best interests of this country. But neither do I believe that being unprepared for war is in the best interests of this country. Circumstances often dictate action. The honourable member for Melbourne said, with a spectacular wave of his hand, that if the Labour party were in power now it would still be reducing taxes. If it were doing that, it would not be preparing this country for war. The honourable member for Yarra spoke disparagingly of the Government's scheme under which young men are required to undergo military training. With one or two exceptions, there has been in the speeches delivered by honourable members opposite an undercurrent, the implication of which is that, in their opinion, young Australians should not be compelled to undergo military training and that 1182.000,000 that this Government is raising by taxation for expenditure upon defence will be an entire loss. If everybody in this country subscribed to that view, there would be no insurance policies in force; yet money expended upon insurance premiums cannot be regarded as having been lost if the motor car that is insured is not stolen or the house that is insured is not destroyed by fire. Expenditure upon defence preparations is an insurance of the security of this country in the event of war, which may occur at auy time. Let us hope that it will not occur. If it does not, let us be thankful that at this stage in our history we were able to raise the money that made it possible for us to prepare, at any rate to a certain degree, to fight a potential enemy and to put on a bold front. Peace can be maintained only if the democracies prepare for war. Let us thank God for the fact that we have had bountiful seasons and have been able to raise money for expenditure upon objectives that are vital to the preservation of the - security of this nation and of civilization i-enevally. The honourable member for Melbourne said that the Labour Government left a sound economy and left money in the coffers of the Treasury. What the people are thankful for is that the Labour party left the treasury bench. The Labour Government was supposed to have left enough money in the coffers of the Treasury to pay the war gratuity, but everybody knows the actual position. The economy that the Government left had been riddled with socialism for eight years. Young men in this country were led to believe that the Government would look after them from the cradle to the grave. As a result, we cannot exert the effort that we could exert in more virile days. The honourable member for Melbourne cited the president of the Australian Taxpayers Association in support of his case that taxes are too high. He said that that gentleman is not a Labour supporter. The president of the Australian Taxpayers Association, no doubt, is eager that the taxation system of this country shall be a fair the one. If he believed that the Labour party would be fair in its taxation measures, doubtless he would be a Labour suprxn-ter, but the honourable member for Melbourne, knowing that the Labour party has never taxed the people of this country fairly, realized that he would not be a Labour supporter under any circumstances. The budget has been, criticized because it is designed to raise £1,000,000,000 as revenue. When honourable gentlemeu opposite talk about increases of pensions, they say that £1 is now worth only 5s. If that argument were used in relation to the budget, we should talk about not £1,000,000,000 but £250,000,000. Members of the Opposition, when it suits them to do so, say that the value of the £1 has decreased considerably, but when they criticize the Government's taxation proposals they conveniently forget what they have said on those occasions. Their attitude is illogical. I am certain that they have caused more confusion in the public mind in relation to this bill than in relation to any other measure. Inflation in world wide. I noticed that the honourable member for Yarra (M i . Keon) took from old newspapers most of the quotations that he made. He produced his scrap book, which he called his dossier. I shall depart from my usual practice and, on this occasion, I too shali quote from a newspaper.",81
232,Mr CTJETIN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Of what date?,82
233,Mr TUKNBTJLL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"It is the Melbourne Herald of today's date. I refer to an article that was written by that newspaper's New York correspondent, Don Iddons. The article readsWhile I have been away with the Royal tour everything here-prices , taxis, rents, fares mid blood pressure-ha s gone up. I slipped 'the colored porter at the Grand Central Station one dollar (8s. l i d .) for carrying my four bags. He said, "" That's not enough, Mistah; it's 25 cents for each bag now and then there's my tip "". So it cost me l is . 6d. to get my luggage carried. In future I travel light and carry my own. I crossed the picket line despite hoots and liisses to get a haircut. Price was one dollar, -25 cents-anothe r l is . Cd - and the barber told me the plan was to raise the price to two dollars for otice over lightly and not too much off the back. That is the way events are tending in the Dnited States of America. The article continuesReuben Maury, editorial writer of the New Yorker Daily News, America's largest newspaper, thinks it is going to end in a bust, in a crash and in a sickening toboggan slide. What goes up must come down, and believe - me, what a fall there could be. The point is, how and when? Your guess is as good as any American's. The window cleaner knows as much about that as the Secretary of the Treasury. Yet, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Clarey) has just told the House that if the Government had done certain ing things that he could have advised it do, Australia would not now be experiencproducersing inflationary conditions. I point to him that although the former - Government of the United instituted all sorts of controls and red tape, as the Labour party would do this country if it were given the tunity to do so, inflation is on the in Great Britain. I do not blame ""Government of the United for that state of affairs. believe that any individual can a solution of the present problem. Indeed, any individual could do so, would, regardless of party political affiliations, win world renown. However, some probever, lems that we2-e of equal gravity been solved by simple means. - that the honourable member for Yarra nearly stumbled upon a solution of inflaAbout tion when he suggested that the Governwill ifr. Turnbull. ment should make concessions to those in the community who work the longest hours. More workers should be called upon to work for longer periods than they work today. If that were done the Government would be enabled to defeat inflation. However, whilst the honourable member practically advocated that the Government should make concessions to every one in the community, he implied that no individual should be obliged to make concessions in the interests of the nation. Inflation is forcing up costs, and we shall not arrest it until we increase production. Members of the Opposition have spoken about many things that Labour would do if it were in office and have said that, at the same time, it would reduce taxes and enable national production to be in creased. Could any one imagine that if Labour had been in office during the last two years it would have increased the pension payable to totally and permanently incapacitated service pensioners by £3 9s. a week as the present Government has done?",82
234,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,Order ! The honourable member must confine his remarks to the bill before the Chair.,83
235,Mr TURNBULL,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I shall now refer to the modification of the averagsystem. No honourable memto ber can effectively represent primary I represent a great number of out them-unles s he gives just consideration Socialist to the requirements of other sections of Kingdom the community. Last year, the primary producers enjoyed an exceptionally good in season and received high world prices opporfor their exports. Under the Governrun ment's proposal, a primary producer the whose taxable income exceeds £4,000 a Kingdom year and whose average income over 5 I do not years exceeds that amount will autoevolve matically cease to be treated under inflationary the averaging system. I should like who to have seen the system continued his for current financial year and elimiimmediately nated next financial year. Howeven members of the Australian have Country party, who fight incesantly in the I believe interests of primary producers, could not. very well put forward such a proposition. 78 per cent, of primary producers not be affected in any way whatever by the modification of the averaging system. That proposal will affect only those in the higher ranges of income. It is strange that on this occasion members of the Labour party, for party political purposes, should defend those producers. Whilst I believe that the abolition of the averaging system will affect some primary producers rather harshly in respect of the tax that they will be called upon to pay in this financial year, they will, during the following four years, actually benefit under this proposal. That system is of advantage to them only when prices are rising. After prices reach their peak and begin to fall, the producer loses that advantage. Producers in my electorate are now enjoying their sixth successive good season and prices are still high. Many of them whose average taxable income is less than £4,000 a year have stated to me that they will take advantage of the Government's proposal and will withdraw from the averaging system. I have advised such persons to examine closely their financial position before they actually take such a step. Members of the Opposition have claimed that producers generally will be obliged to pay a tremendous amount in tax during the coming financial year. Much of that tax will be provisional tax the payment of which is not in any way related to the budget proposals. The fact that one may disagree with the system of provisional tax is quite different. Provisional tax would have had to be paid regardless of what government happened to be in office. The rate of provisional tax for primary producers will decrease only when prices fall or as a result of bad seasons. However, I do not tliink that any man on the land would like to have had a bad season last year merely in order that his provisional tax for the current financial year would be reduced. Furthermore, before producers vvill be called upon to pay provisional tax and normal tax this year, they will have received their wool cheque, the first ment of 7s. lOd. a bushel on wheat; an early second payment to bring the amount up to the full cost of production; payand ment of an increase based on the difference between the home-consumpThe tion price and the International Wheat Agreement price for feed wheat, and repayment of contributions they have made to the No. 12 pool. Thus many producers, after having paid their provisional tax this year, may find that such payment is sufficient to meet their tax liabilities in respect of the following year or two. Eventually, they must come out on top as far as this legislation is concerned because,, as a result of the Government's policy,. the purchasing power of the £1 should be much greater a few years hence than it is today. Members of the Opposition have had a lot to say about the failure of the Government to reduce taxes and put value back into the £1. As I have said on previous occasions in this chamber, one cannot expect a boxer to win a fight in the first round. The Government has been in office for only two years.. and during the life of the Nineteenth Parliament its legislative efforts were frustrated by a hostile majority in. the Senate. Yet, already, production is beginning to increase in the coal mining industry and in other basicindustries. The Government will be enabled to reduce taxes as economic conditions return to normal and as the purchasing power of the £1 increases correspondingly. I firmly believe that before the next general election comes round the Government will havereduced taxes substantially. Whilst it must make provision this year for an expenditure of £182,000,000 on defencepreparations, it is likely to be enabled to reduce expenditure under that heading within the next few years. Obviously the Government will not find it necessary to continue to stockpile armamentsafter it has made reasonable provision in that respect. Should that prove to be the case, this country will be enabled to enjoy economic prosperity and progressto the fullest degree.",83
236,Mr BEAZLEY,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Premantle) [10.0] payThe three most interesting features of this bill are the modification of the averaging system, the alteration of the rates,, the alteration of the initial depreciation allowance in relation to industry. modification of the averaging system in relation to the primary producerhas been dealt with most dishonestlyby the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull), and, indeed, by other members of the Australian Country party. I shall summarize the position of primary producers over the last five years, and, for that purpose, shall take the most spectacular primary industry, namely, the wool-growing industry. My figures are those of the actual gross incomes of wool growers, and their gross incomes under - the averaging system. They are as follows:Year. Qross Income 1946-47 9C,000,000 73,000,000 1947-48 157,000,000 90,500,000 1948-49 194,000,000 114,000,000 1949-50 286,000,000 158,000,000 1950-51 . . 636,000,000 274,000,000 Of course, the financial year 1950-51 a period of record wool prices, and in respect of the figure £274,000,000, I for set aside the special impost-the >vool sales deduction. The Treasurer (Sir ments in advance. Arthur Fadden) examined the position, and, while ill in bed, told a deputation of primary producers that they had been generously treated during the presimilar vious five years. I remind the House, passing, that the Chifley Government, which he had denigrated throughout the Commonwealth as the enemy of the primthe ary producers, had been in office during the period to which he referred; but ably the right honourable gentleman believed that he was on his deathbed when the deputation interviewed him. bpcause he had an unusual resort to the truth. He told those representatives of the ary producers that, in the previous five years, under the averaging system, wool growers had benefited by an amount of £77,000,000 in respect of tax that would have been obliged to pay, had their incomes been treated on an annual basis. He proceeded to inform them that, unless he altered the averaging system this a further benefit of £62,000,000 accrue to wool-growers in respect of the financial year 1949-50. It is fascinating to find the Treasurer referring to the concessions that were granted during five years of the Chifley ilr. Beazley. regime as a reason why he should not make concessions now. That is a most interesting deviation for a Treasurer who is a member of the Australian Country party. But if we analyse the falsity of his argument in favour of change from the averaging system, we find the extremely interesting fact that he is repeating what he did last year: he is taking in advance payment of taxation. The proceeds of the wool sales deduction represented a drawing on the following year's revenue, and he has deGross prived himself of that amount in this under financial year. Therefore) he has to alter Income. Averaging System. the averaging system in order to draw on revenue that is really due to Treasurers £ £ in the future. It is true to say that, over the era of rising prices, the primary producer has benefited from the averaging system. If that system remains unchanged, and if prices take a downward trend, the primary producer will pay tax at a rate applicable to a higher was income. Future Treasurers, or the present Treasurer if he remains in office five years, will get less revenue if he now alters the system, and seizes tax payI emphasize that the present proposal represents an advance payment of tax to the wool sales deduction. An exin tremely dishonest feature of it is its relationship to what the Treasurer pretends is his refund to wool-growers after rejection of the referendum on a wool reserve price. The right honourable gentleprobman wished to retain the custody of £45,000,000 that belongs to the wool growers. The scheme, as it was called, was submitted to the wool-growers by way of a referendum, and they rejected it. primThe Treasurer was then confronted with the necessity to refund the amount of £45,000,000, and by this manoeuvre of altering the averaging system, will inthey crease his revenue this year by £47,000,000. In other words, ha will repay the wool-growers with their own money. That is the real purpose of the year, Treasure]- in altering the averaging would system at the present time. Whilst it may appear unjust that the primary producer should have benefited by an amount of £77,000,000 from the averaging system over the last five years, it is most important that we should note the extreme probability that the treasury benefited by more than that sum. I mean, by that statement, - that while prices were rising and taxable income was the average paid for the previous five years, the primary producer paid less tax than he would have paid in other circumstances, and had moTe money to reinvest in his farm. Some of that money, of course, was not used to increase production, but some of it was devoted to that purpose. The overall picture of that concession is probably that of an - expansion of primary industrial activities and of all incomes, and, through the income tax, an increased return to the Treasury that wpuld nullify, at least in part, the temporary - concession of £77,000,000. It would not be a concession at all when a primary producer's income was falling. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr. JIulme)., who attacked the Labour party, said that we were concerned not about the man in receipt of £500 a year, but about the primary producer in receipt - of £5,000 .a year. Of course, a producer in receipt of £5,000 a year is an """" average"" person, and that average i - struck after taking into account some high incomes and some moderate incomes. But the position of the primary producer over the last few .years has been such that, without the authorization of this Cabinet, a food - committee has been formed in the Government parties, the purpose of which is to alter the policies of the Government in relation to primary industries. The 40 per cent, initial depreciation .allowance has not actually been altered nnder this .bill, but the Treasurer has threatened a possible alteration .of it in .a year's time. That concession was made by the Chifley Government ""to persons who were equipping industries with machinery. The fact was recognized that some machinery was not of the high - quality that is now being manufactured, and that depreciation would be more rapid. Many orders for machinery had - been delayed for years, during which the prices rose considerably. In order tc - encourage the re-equipment of Australian industry, the Chifley Government introduced the provision that the 40 per cent, depreciation allowance could be claimed I as] in the initial year of purchase. The Treasurer now threatens to alter that system a year hence. He has given advance notice of that possibility, and is leaving industry in a state of confusion. The business community deserves from the right honourable gentleman a clearer declaration of his intentions. This afternoon, the - honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Cramer) made a loug speech, in the course of which he compared Australian rates of tax with those of New Zealand. He also claimed that this Government had reduced expenditure, and that the 10 per cent, increase of income tax during the current financial year would yield an additional £25,000,000. Those were the three central features of his speech, and every one of them stated a falsehood. The comparison with New Zealand, which he made from the tables that were circulated by the Treasure, was true, but the intention behind his comparison was to suggest that this Government had reduced rates of tax in relation to those of New Zealand. Of course, Australian rates of taxation are spectacularly lower than those of New Zealand and substantially lower than those of the United Kingdom ; but the suggestion that those lower rates are an achievement of the present Government is false, because the same relationship existed between Australian tax rates and those of New Zealand and the United Kingdom in the last year of the Chifley Government. The present Government merely inherited a situation in which Australians pay the lowest rates of tax in the world. The honourable member for Bennelong could not stand in his place, and declare that he had made a similar comparison during the general election campaign in 1949. Indeed, no Government supporter could honestly say that, in that campaign, he had compared Australian rates of tax with those of New Zealand and the United Kingdom. That, matter has no relevance to the .achievements of this Government, because it was a situation that existed under the Chifley Government. This government must justify the manner in which it has increased rates of tax since it has been in office. The second claim by the honourable member for Bennelong was that this Government had reduced expenditure. He described this Government as an "" expenditure-reduction government"". was to the credit of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) that he told the Liberal party convention a few days ago that whilst it had been easy to promise reducvisers tions of expenditure when he was in Opposition, he found that he could not effect them when he assumed office. right honourable gentleman told his audience that conditions looked very different from the "" inside"" than they rates "". appeared to be when he made promises during the general election campaign 1949. The right honourable gentleman's admission was really a confession of ignorance; but when the honourable member for Bennelong said that the Governand ment had reduced expenditure, as though the Prime Minister himself had not repudiated such a claim, the statement was not made in ignorance but was a with falsehood. The third falsehood that the honorceives able gentleman uttered was that the 10 per cent, increase of income tax would yield an additional £25,000,000. He asked, "" What is that amount in comalthough parison with a list of increased expendiwhose tures by the present Government that add up'to £50,000,000^ The honourable gentleman must have read the budget papers, in order to obtain the information that the collections of income tax last year amounted to £250,000,000. Of that sum, £173,000,000 came from direct come tax, and £77,000,000 from the social services contribution. This levy of 10 per cent, will not increase the income collections from £250,000,000 £275,000,000. The budget papers show that the increase will be from £250,000,000 to £4.1.9,000,000. The per cent, levy will increase the tax yield by nearly 70 per cent. That intimes crease of £169,000,000, which will result from inflation because incomes are not 'a week today. remaining constant, will far outweigh increases of expenditure to which the honourable member for Bennelong referred. . I ask the Treasurer to cease publishing meaningless tables of statistics. 102 of the budget papers there is a table come. of figures that purports to compare war-time rates, the present tax tribution, and the proposed tax and Mr Beazley. tribution. What is meant by "" war-time rates "" ? Rates of tax were not constant It throughout the war. There were six years of war and in each of those years different tax rates were imposed. I have ascertained from the Government's adthat thereference in the table to tax at war-time rates applies to the peak year of taxation in 1943. But it would The weaken the propaganda value of the table to make that clear. Therefore, the figures are described as tax at "" war-time",84
237,Mr HULME,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,They refer to taxation in for the emergency of war.,87
238,Mr BEAZLEY,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The emergency of war passed through many different phases there were many different scales of tax., The figures refer to the peak year of 1943. The honourable member for Mallee said that a man who earned £350 a year would pay 18s. this year, compared 16s. last year, if he had a dependent wife and two children. A man who reless' than £7 a week and who has a wife and two children should be entirely exempt from taxation. In fact, I doubl whether such a man exists in Australia, there may be a few individuals income is derived from a pension or similar allowance. The honourable member for Mallee might just as well have argued that the nominal increase from 16s. to 18s. represents a decrease, because 18s. this year is worth less in terms of purchasing power than 16s. was inworth last year. That fact exposes another deceitful feature of the comparative table that I have already mentioned. tax That table shows that, on the war-time to scale of taxation, a man who received £350 a year paid £31 2s. as income tax. But at that time the basic wage amounted to 10 £220 a year. Therefore, a man who earned £350 was receiving one and a half the basic wage, or slightly more. That rate would be equivalent to £15 15s. Such comparisons, the therefore, have nn real meaning. A man who earned £350 a. year would have been in clover during the war if he had been required to pay 16s. as income tax On page because £350 was then a high inWhen I entered this Partax at liament in 1945 the basic wage and conwas only £4 5s. a week. The inconcome tax levied on incomes of from £300 to £350 a. year has been reduced during the last five or six years of necessity because of the decreasing value of money. The reductions have not involved real concessions to the taxpayers concerned. A very weak argument advanced by the Government and its supporters in favour of the flat rate levy is that it is easier to use this method than to effect a graduated increase, beginning with 1 cent, on the lowest level of taxable in10 come and increasing progressively through the higher levels. That is amazing argument. Every honourable member must know that the entire taxabeen tion curve can be altered without diffifalse. culty in a graduated manner by the rejected. Government's experts. It is just as easy to have that done as it is to impose a 10 per cent, flat increase. The GovernMany ment's method is an extremely bad evasion of the principle of graduating income tax rates. Another objectionable argument used by Government supporters is that the overall increase is necessary in order to provide for heavy additional defence expenditure. The budget provides for surplus, but nobody in this House really believes that the eventual surplus will only £11-1,500,000. If the Treasurer correctly forecast the trend of inflation and the consequent increase of revenue from income tax, it will be the first time in five or six yearjs that this has been done. It is extremely probable that surplus will amount to £200,000,000. Therefore, the Governthey in en t spokesmen who use the defence argument and then declare that the surit plus has been designed to counteract inflation fail to state any valid reason why that surplus should not be derived from a more just graduation of tax rates under which the increase? would primary producers? fall most heavily on luxury incomes. In the City of Perth alone, according to the Treasurer's statistics, there are persons who earn more than £15,000 a. year. The 10 per cent, increase direct taxation will not curb their luxury expenditure in any way, and the Treaable surer's estimation of the increased return from the higher rates of sales tax this year shows that he is aware of that fact. The Treasurer's arguments in support of the abolition of the averaging system in relation to primary producers are merely intended to conceal from the people the fact that once again he is drawing on future revenue, as he did last year by imposing a special levy on wool. The right honourable gentleman also has not been honest about the 40 per cent, initial depreciaper tion allowance. The argument that the per cent, levy is an anti-inflationary measure and also an instrument of an defence policy is uot valid, and the comparative tax tables that have presented in support of the bill are Therefore, the measure ought to be",87
239,Mr RYAN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Flinders) [10.23] strange events have occurred in the world recently, but none has been stranger, in my opinion, than the rapidity with which certain members of the Opposition alter their views. One is entitled to ask Avhether these honourable gentlemen have changed their opinions because they have been redeemed or merely because they hope to gain party political a advantage by their manoeuvres. I have been a member of this House for a numbe ber of years, and I have noticed during has that period that members of the Labour party have been fairly constant, when in Opposition and when in Government, in their criticism of the wool-growers. Until recently I had never heard them the utter even one word in favour of the about wool-growers. But now we find that have suddenly reversed their former attitude. ""Why have they done so? Is because they sincerely believe that the wool-growers are worthy citizens, or is it because they hope to curry favour by raising fictitious injustices and appearing to defend the interests of the Some years ago in this House 1 697 listened to a speech that was made by a very prominent member of the Laboui of party who was then the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. That honorgentleman said that he was not interested in the workers owning their own homes and becoming little capitalists.",88
240,Mr WARD,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"He did not say that. ' Mr Ryan - It has been proved in court. I remind the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) that Mr. Dedman failed in his action at law on this issue. I repeat that he said on the occasion to which I have referred that he was not interested in turning the workers into little capitalists by letting them own their own homes. Earlier in this debate the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Keon) and the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr W.. M . Bourke) said, I hope with sincerity, that the reason why they criticized the Government's, proposal to grant tax concessions to mining companies in respect of expenditure on house construction was that the concessions were not to be extended to the miners. If that be the real reason for theircriticism-and I hope that it is-bot h honourable members must have experienced a great change of mind for the better. Every honourable member on this side of the House would be happy if every family in Australia could own its own home, and I shall be delighted if the view that the two honourable members expressed is the view of the Opposition as a whole. I wish to refer to two special features of this bill. The first is the provision for the exemption from income tax of the pay and allowances of men engaged on war service. I am sure that no honourable member will, object to that provision. However, I point out to the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) an omission that might well be remedied. Many Australians who are not members of the armed forces are working in the field in Korea and other operational theatres. I refer particularly to members of the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and a few other organizations of a similar character. Those people serve on practically the same conditions as soldiers They are quartered and rationed by the Army, transported by it and receive medical treatment from it. To all intents and purposes they are on an equal footing with soldiers, and for that reason they should also be entitled to such tax exemptions as apply to members of the forces. They are not highly paid, and those honourable members who have served in the field know what a high level of service they give. I am sure that the matter having been brought to the notice of the Treasurer he will be prepared to make the small amendment of the measure that is necessary to grant, these, concesr sions to those people who so thoroughly deserve them. I turn now to the development of the coal industry. We all realise how great is the dependence of this country on coal. My mind goes back to a speech that, was made by a man who is probably well known by name to many honourable members. I refer to. Mr Hilaire Belloc. He took part in a debate with Mr George Bernard Shaw and Mr H . G. Wells in London many years ago on the subject, "" Our present civilization and what it rests on "". George Bernard Shaw made an amusing speech and was followed by Hilaire Belloc, whose speech consisted of the following verse:Our civilization is founded on coal. Our civilization, that curse of creation, Our civilization, without any soul, Our civilization is founded on coal. I consider that that verse represents the views of everybody in this House, i'hc^ trouble is, however, that whilst we recognize the importance to our civilization of coal, it is not so well recognized outside the Parliament, particularly by the people employed in the coal industry. For that reason I welcome the provisions in the measure for the encouragement of"" development of the coal industry and of the provision of amenities for coal-miners, which will be done, of course, by meansof the fiscal weapon. But coal, after all,, is not the only basic commodity on which any country depends. We can no morelive without food than we can prosperwithout adequate supplies of coal, and therefore the principle that is to be applied in relation to the encouragement of development in the coal-mining indusdo. try should also be applied to encouragement of the rural industries. I do not suggest an overall encoui-agemcnt of primary industries, many of which are now in a prosperous condition, but I do say that some of them require encouragement.. The only, way in which the Government can give that necessary encouragement istbrough tax concessions. The measure proposes that the cost of houses built by the coal-mining industry for minors shall be an allowable deduction for tax purposes. The cost of coal mining plant will also be an allowable deduction. Certain selected rural industries require a similar concession. More housing is necessary in country areas, and if land-owners can be encouraged to build houses, and so make an increase of the rural work population possible, we shall have taken a great step towards increasing primary production. We have rightly, to some degree, abolished the initial depreciation allowance of 40 per cent, on plant, but I consider that in certain specified industries, such as potato-farming, an increase of the depreciation allowance in respect of such equipment as mechanical diggers aud loaders would lead to an increase of production. I recommend those two suggestions to the Treasurer, particularly that in relation to the exemption from taxes of auxiliary Avorkers with our forces in the field. I hope that he will give consideration to them.",88

242,Mr RYAN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Flinders) [10.50] - I desire to draw the attention of the Treasurer (S ir A r t h u r Fadden) to the request that I made early in the proceedings connected with this matter. 1 requested that members of auxiliary services such as the Red Cross and the Salvation A r m y should have similar concessions extended to them so that they might receive exemption from income tax on pay and allowances when serving in an operational area. I think PAIRS. that the Treasurer is aware that the service rendered by the personnel of these bodies is in every respect similar to that which is rendered by service personnel. These people are not enlisted personnel but they are placed on the same footing as enlisted men. They are fed, transported and paid by the Army. In addition they render very valuable services. I therefore suggest the proposed benefits should be extended to them. The number of persons affected would be extremely small and the amount of money that the Government would lose would be nothing to worry about.",91

Motion (by Mr TOWNLEY) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",94
260,Mr JR FRASER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Australian Capital Territory) [11.4] - I desire to draw the attention of the House to the cases of several individuals who have heen affected by the Government's recent retrenchment decision. It will be recalled that on the 2nd October the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) made a statement to this House on retrenchment in the Public Service. In the course of that statement he set forth a list of priorities in dismissal for members of the Public Service. The list, in order of first retrenchment, was as follows:-Marrie d women, women over the compulsory retiring age of 65 years, men over the compulsory retiring age, single women and widows, persons qualified for permanent appointment, relatives of deceased soldiers, female ex-members of the forces, single men, married men without family, married men with family, male ex-members of the forces. The first case to which I desire to refer is that of Mr X "". I so describe him as I understand that I am not allowed to mention names at this stage.",97
261,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Order ! There is nothing to prevent the honourable member from mentioning a name on the adjournment, although unless he has a definite reason for doing, so I do not think that unnecessary publicity should be given to the affairs of private citizens. Mr JR FRASER,- I thank you, Mr Speaker. I shall continue to refer to this man as Mr X "". I brought the matter of his dismissal before the House on the 4th October. He is a man of 62 years of age and had had 26 years' service in various government departments in Canberra. He is married, which puts him into the third last category for dismissal. He was dismissed. Following upon representations that I made in this House, and further representations that I made to the Prime Minister's Department, in which he was employed when dismissed, I received a letter from the Prime Minister. That letter readsI refer to your statement upon the motion for the adjournment on Thursday, 4th October, regarding Mr X , formerly. an officer of my Department, whose services were recently terminated. I have looked into this case and find that Mr X was a temporary officer of the Department of the Interior from 1st A p r i l, 1st March, 1946, the Prices Branch from 4th March, 1948, to 26th September, 1948, and my Department from 27th September, 1948, to the date of his retrenchment. Mr X is a man of 62 years of age and is suffering from heart trouble which very much restricts his activities. During the three years he has been with my Department, he has had almost six months' sick leave. It has for some time been very obvious to the administrative officers of my Department that Mr X's efficiency was very much impaired and in ordinary circumstances his services would have been terminated. However, in view of his lonjL' services as a temporary officer, the Department sympathetically tried to fit him in where lie could perform some useful function. In implementing the decision to reduce the numbers of the Public Service, a reduction which was spread proportionately over all Departments, my Department, a relatively small specialized Department, examined the position w ith a view to determining how a T maximum efficiency oould be maintained with a reduced staff. In the interests of Departmental efficiency, the services of Mr X had to be terminated. In view of these circumstances, I do not feel that Mr X should be reabsorbed in my Department. That letter was signed by the Prime Minister, who had previously set out to the House and the nation the order in which public servants were to be dismissed. ' I repeat that in that list married men were in the third last category. However, this man, aged 62, after having had 26 years of service in various government departments, was summarily dismissed. ""With some help he was finally able to secure a position with another department in Canberra. It is ironic that on the morning he commenced work, and within an . hour of starting, he was served with a fortnight's notice of dismissal. After some telephone conversations that notice was withdrawn and he is still employed in that department. The point is that had the Prime Minister's orders been obeyed that man would never have been dismissed. He should not have been uprooted out of the department in which he had been serving. The second case is that of Mr Y I mentioned his case in the House on the 11th October. He is a veteran of two world wars and an original ANZAC. He had been employed for six years in a professional capacity in the Depart1925, to ment of National Development. He is not to be dismissed, bnt is to be reduced in status while preference is being given to German immigrants in that department. In response to representations that I made to the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) I received the following letter:I refer again to your representations to my colleague, the' Hon. HaroM Holt, Minister for Labour and National Service on behalf of Mr Y, of 2 Leslie-street, Ainslie. You will appreciate that the retrenchment? necessarily involve the discontinuing activities. This applied to the work on which Mr Y was engaged. The fact that the department is continuing to employ German migrants is not relevant to Mr Y's case. The migrants are expert cartographers who have been brought to Australia to undertake the preparation of special maps of resO\irces. This work is for publication and must he of a very high standard. Unfortunately Mr Y's qualifications and experience do not fit him for this task. As you know, although Mr Y has been employed as an acting draftsman for some years, his permanent classification is that of Assistant, Fourth Division. The possibility of continuing to employ Mr. V in suitable drafting work in some other section of the department is being examined. If this cannot be done Mr Y will still be employed in the Department but it will be necessary for him to revert to his permanent classification. I repeat that that man was a returned soldier of two world wars, an original ANZAC, and therefore a man who was in the last category to be affected by this system of retrenchment. The third case is that of Mr "" Z "". He is 64 years of age, and I mentioned his case in the House on the 11th October. He will be 65 in March next year. He is a returned soldier of two world wars and also an original ANZAC. For three years he had been employed in the housing division of the Department of National Development. He was dismissed under the retrenchment scheme. After representations had been made, I received the following letter from the Minister for Labour and National Service:I promised to let you know what assistance in obtaining employment could be given to Mr Z, of 8 Bougainville-street, Manuka, about whom you wrote to me on 12th October, 1951. I am now writing to say that following his discharge from the Commonwealth Public Service, MT. Z did not ask the help of my Commonwealth Employment Service in finding other employment. However, he was invited to do so if he had not already secured a suitable position and as a result he registered at the District Employment Office, Canberra, on 31st October. Efforts are now being made by my Canberra Office to find him suitable employment and I hope that they will soon be successful. Each of the men whom I have mentioned was in one of the lowest categories mentioned by the Prime Minister when he made his statement in this House. Each should have of certain been given preference over many others who have been retained. I ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of his announcement to the House and the nation of the order in which dismissals would be made, he is giving the orders and issuing the instructions or whether his orders and instructions are being flouted by Ministers of his own Cabinet, or by heads of departments?",97
262,Mr WARD,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"East Sydney) [11.13] I desire to raise a matter which I think will be of concern to all honourable members. Recently the arrangements under which transport has been provided for members of the Parliament have been extended. Ex-Ministers are now provided with a car from the airport to their homes and from their homes back to the airport when proceeding to or from Canberra. Car travel is provided for members travelling before 8 a.m. in the morning and after 8 p.m. at night. I understand that the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale), who is in charge of the motor car pool, is instituting a system of spying on ex-Ministers and members of the Parliament who use cars. Each driver is required to report personally to the Minister upon the persons who use his car. By that I mean that his report goes to the officer in charge at the car depot, but it is for the personal information of the Minister. The driver must report the names of those who ride in his car and their particular destinations. I should have no objection if the system were intended to apply to the use of all Commonwealth cars, but it is not intended to do so. I shall be quite willing for reports upon my use of a Commonwealth car to be submitted, provided that reports of the same type are submitted in respect of the use of cars by every member of the Parliament and by Ministers themselves.",98
263,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,And departmental heads.,99
264,Mr WARD,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"And also by departmental heads. When the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) asked to be allowed to peruse the running cards of these cars, he was told that he could not be permitted to do so. If the Minister wants to deprive me, as an ex-Minister, of a car for my personal use, I shall not object. In my opinion, it is ridiculous that an ex-Minister, on arrival at an airport, should have the sole use of a car to take him to his home when other members of the Parliament have to travel to the city in the bus provided by the airline and then make their own arrangements for travelling to their homes. It would be proper for Commonwealth cars to be shared by honourable members who live in more or less the same area. It is wrong that a car should be used to take only an ex-Minister to his borne. I was criticized because I asked a question in this Parliament about the use of a government car by the wife of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies). I was criticized also because I wanted to know how it was that a government car had both a Victorian number-plate and an Australian Capital Territory numberplate. Why is there all this secrecy in regard to the use of government cars? As this concession has been given to exMinisters and members of the Parliament, why should there be a system of spying upon them? Is the object of the system to enable the Minister to make the terrible revelation that when I travelled from an airport in a government car I took in the car with me, say, the honourable member for Phillip (Mr. Fitzgerald) and the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Anderson), who wished to travel in the same direction as I did, and that the car, in taking those honourable gentlemen to their homes, travelled for half a mile or a mile further than it would have done if it had gone only to my home ? I suggesl to the Government that this matter should be reviewed and placed upon a sensible and proper basis.",99
265,Mr MORGAN,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Reid) [11.18] - I desire to refer to the matter that wat> by raised by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr J. R. Fraser). It is obvious from the case? that the honourable gentleman mentioned that the Government does not know whert it stands in connection with the retrenchment of public servants. The dismissals have been made, not on a selective basis as was promised, but in a haphazard manner. Some time ago, I directed to the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) some questions upon notice about dismissals from various Commonwealth departments. I received the replies to them only to-night. The first question that I put to the Prime Minister wasHow many Communists are included in the list of public servants who, during the months of September and October have received notice that tlieir services are no longer required? The reply was that the details are not known. In view of the allegations that members of the Government parties made about the policy of the Chifley Government in connection with the Public Service, that reply is very significant. The best tribute that couid be paid to the Chifley Government, in this connection, is that this Government is not aware that there are any known Communists in the Public Service, and cannot say whether any known Communists are included in the publicservants who have been dismissed. Ex-servicemen were supposed to be the last of the public servants to be dismissed. I asked the Prime Minister how many returned servicemen of World War I . and World War II . , and ex-servicemen generally, were included among the dismissed public servants. The reply that I received to that question is as follows:This information could be obtained only after detailed analysis of departmental records The administrative effort and expense involved in extracting the information would be excessive. Apparently the Prime Minister does not know how many ex-servicemen were dismissed from the Public Service recently. It is obvious that the Government does not know where it stands in this matter, although it stated that the retrenchments would be made on a selective basis. The comparatively insignificant expenditure of time and money that would be involved in obtaining the information f o i which I asked, and which would be available to the Government, is to be allowed to stand in the way of strict justice being done. Doubtless the full story will be known in due course, but the Government ought to know it now. It formulated a policy, and it should have the whole picture before it .",99
266,Mr HOLT,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Higgins-Minister for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [11.22] - I shall not attempt to follow the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) over the country that he chose to travel. During my experience of this Parliament, which now extends over many years, I have never known the transport services of the Commonwealth, outside of Canberra, to be run more efficiently than at the present time, nor have I known more sympathy to be shown to members of the Parliament in connection with them than is being shown now. I do not intend to reflect upon the transport services in Canberra. I have excluded them from my remarks only because they do not come within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale). When the Minister assumed office, there was a slap-dash, casual atmosphere about the transport sei vices. When we recall the kind of uniforms, or the lack of uniforms, that were worn by the men who drove Commonwealth cars, and the lack of dignity; and when we contrast the position that existed then, with that which exists today, we can come to no conclusion other than that great credit is due to the Minister. I know that he regards the needs of members of the Parliament as a very real consideration. I do not remember any period in the history of the Commonwealth when private members of the Parliament, Ministers and exMinisters, had greater privileges in relation to motor transport than they have at the present time. I deny categorically the allegation that the Minister is indulging in sneaking and pimping. I know him as a man. That is not his character. Mr Ward interjecting,",100
267,Mr HOLT,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"The honourable member for East Sydney has made denials in various places which were not believed by his peers in this country, and they said so very emphatically. I shall bring this matter to the attention of my colleague. I suggest that any honourable member who views this matter objectively will agree that the Minister is doing a most efficient and thorough job in connection with motor transport. I respect the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr . J. R. Fraser) and the views that he expresses. I say that quite sincerely. But to-night, in seeking to champion the cause of ex-servicemen who have been retrenched from the Public Service he said, by implication and by direct statement, that this Government has no regard for the rights of ex-servicemen and that, as a matter of policy, it is giving preference to German immigrants as against Australian ex-servicemen. I have personal knowledge of only one of the cases that the honourable gentleman mentioned. I gathered from what he said that the man whose case was referred to me has now been offered alternative employment. It is not easy in Canberra, where opportunities are limited in comparison with other capital cities, to place a clerical employee overnight in another clerical post. I gather that the man has been offered a position in one of the other Commonwealth departments and, for all I know, he has accepted it . The charge has been made that this Government ^as no regard for ex-servicemen. I do not presume to speak for the ex-servicemen, but I say that on the Government benches of this Parliament there is a greater proportion of ex-servicemen than in any other parliament of the British Commonwealth. I challenge honourable members opposite to disprove that statement. The ex-servicemen of this country know that this Government has a genuine regard for their interests. I emphatically deny that preference is being given to German immigrants. During recent weeks, there has been a lot of sniping from back-benchers of - the Labour party in connection with German immigrants admitted into this country. I challenge the leaders of the Labour party to say where their party stands upon that matter. Are they prepared to accept into this country immigrants from Germany who have been screened by an organization that was established by the Labour party when it was in office, or do they say that they will not agree to the admission to this country of any German immigrants, no matter how carefully they may be screened ? I am becoming a little tired of back-benchers of the Labour party sniping at the Government on this issue, while those who claim to lead the party remain silent.",100
268,Mr JR FRASER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I rise to order. I take exception to the Minister's remark that I , as a back-bencher, have been indulging in sniping on this issue. I direct your attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that the question relates not to immigration, but to the employment of returned servicemen.",101
269,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"I do not think there is any substance in the point of order raised by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory. On the motion for the adjournment of the House, an honourable member is entitled to talk upon any matter that comes to his mind. If the Minister wishes to avail himself of that right, it is not my affair. If the Minister said anything to which the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory could take exception, I did not hear it. I admit frankly that, having regard to the noise in the chamber, it is somewhat difficult to keep check upon what is said.",101
270,Mr HOLT,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"If the Labour party is opposed to the policy of the Government, in connection with the admission into Australia of German immigrants, let the honourable gentlemen who have authority to speak for the Labour party say so. .A policy that they claim to support should not be destroyed by back-benchers, apparently irresponsibly and without reference to their leaders, sniping at it. Ex-servicemen in the Public Service have enough good sense to know that they can look to this < >--> vernment and its supporters in this Parliament to treat them with a .measure of justice that certainly will be no whit inferior to that which they could expect .from the Labour party.

283,Mr WARD,CONSTRUCTIONS PROPRIETARY,"the Treasurer, upon - notice I. Is it a fact that, at a conference of the Association of Co-operative Building Societies held a few weeks ago at Newcastle, New South Wales, it was decided to protest to the Commonwealth Government against the restrictions imposed by order of the Government upon bank advances for home building purposes ? 2.

Has any recent change been made in bank policy in respect of such advances; if so, will he furnish details?",103
284,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,CONSTRUCTIONS PROPRIETARY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. The Government recently received request from the Association of Co-operative Societies to remove all credit restrictions on housing finance. The position is that under present advance policy there is no restriction on the extent to which banks may lend to co-operative building societies. There is, of course, no control over the amount which may be provided by lending institutions other than banks. In the case of the individual home-builder, banks are permitted under advance policy to provide up to £3,000 to finance the building of a house for occupation by the applicant. This figure may be increased to £3,500 where it is necessary to purchase land on which to erect the buildin"". 3. There has been no recent change in advance - policy with respect to loans for home-building purposes.",103

287,Mr GULLETT,CONSTRUCTIONS PROPRIETARY,"the Minister for [mmigration, upon notice I. Has Mrs Jessie Street gone to Paris to attend United Nations organization meetings? 2. What passport did she use far the .trip and how was it obtained? 3. Is her Australian passport cancelled?",104
288,Mr HOLT,CONSTRUCTIONS PROPRIETARY,"--The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1. I am not aware of Mrs Street's movements and cannot say whether she is now attending United Nations meetings in Paris ov not. In any event, she would not be there in any oflicial capacity ou behalf of the Australian Government. 2. The last 'Australian passport issued to Mrs Street was issued at Sydney in March, 1049. It was made valid for a period of five years, and for travel to all countries. On the 27th Decemoer, 1950, Mrs Street secured a United Kingdom passport from the Loudon Passport Office of the Foreign Office. This she was able to do because, as well as being an Australian citizen, she is a citizen uf tlic United Kingdom and Colonies, by reason of her father's birth in the United Kingdom. In connection with Mrs Street's application for a United Kingdom passport, some one in London telephoned the United Kingdom Passport Office, representing himself to be the High Commissioner for Australia in London, and asking that the Passport Office should help Mrs Street. It is perhaps hardly necessary to say that the High Commissioner did not make such a telephone call. It must have come from some person interested in ensuring that Mrs Street's application for a United Kingdom passport was successful. Mrs. Street apparently desired the passport for GOLD. travel behind the Iron Curtain and subsequently visited Moscow. She had attended the so-called "" Peace. Congress "" in Warsaw in November, .1950, and was aware that the Commonwealth Government had directed that her Australian passport, upon coining under notice, was to have the Iron Curtain countries excluded from its validity. 3. Mrs Street's Australian passport is still in her possession. As soon as it became known that she had also secured a United Kingdom passport, instructions were issued that her Australian passport should be impounded upon her return to Australia, it being the view of this Government that no Australian should hold two Brjtis h passports at once. Mrs. Street has net since returned to Australia and action to require her to surrender her Australian passport has not so far been possible. Arrangements have been made with the United Kingdom authorities to ensure that, in future, any holder of an Australian passport who is about to be granted a United Kingdom passport w i ll first he required to surrender the Australian document.",104
