3,Mr ABBOTT,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"Ha a the Treasurer seen the cabled report, published in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 20th September, regarding the currency conference attended by representatives of Great Britain and the United States of America, at which, it was reported, sufficient agreement in respect of an international currency plan was reached to justify the holding of a conference of Empire, American .and Allied representatives at an early date? If so, was Australia represented at the conference, either as a participant or as an observer? Is the honourable gentleman able to state what agreement was reached, and whether or not Australia is committed to any degree ?",14
4,Mr CHIFLEY,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"I have not seen the report referred to, but I am familiar with the discussions in regard to currency problems that have taken place overseas. The Australian Government was represented at some prior discussions in relation to this matter. The Government has been closely watching the situation, and has been kept fully informed of what has been done, but it has not so far committed Australia in any way. WOOL - APPRAISEMENT CENTRE AT GERALDTON.",14
5,Mr JOHNSON,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture why the definite undertaking given by the Government, that a wool appraisement centre would be established at Geraldton, has not been given effect?",14
6,Mr SCULLY,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"I am aware that the Government gave a definite undertaking that a wool appraisement centre would he established at Geraldton. Only recently, to my great surprise, was I apprised of the delay that had occurred in the. establishment of this centre. I assure the honourable member that I am as anxious as he is to have the establishment completed, and that I shall take every step that is open to me in that connection. TOMATOES. SUPPLIES FOR VICTORIA.",14
7,Mr HOLT,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,".Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture explain why differential rates of 30s. a case and 22s. a case have been, fixed in respect of tomatoes marketed in New South Wales and Victoria, respectively? Are tomatoes, as the result of this differentiation in price, now being sent from .South Australia to New South Wales, avoiding the Melbourne market? If so, what action is proposed by the Government to ensure that Victoria will receive adequate supplies of tomatoes, or at least its quota of those that are grown in other States?",14
8,Mr SCULLY,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"I am not fully aware of the details of movements of tomatoes, or of differential price rates, but I shall institute inquiries and, when informed of the facts, shall acquaint the honourable gentleman of them. If these inquiries disclose anomalies, I shall have them rectified immediately. FOOD PROGRAMME. RELEASE OF MAN-POWER.",14
9,Mr CLARK,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"Can the Deputy Prime Minister state what action is proposed for the release of man-power, with a view to giving effect to the food programme laid down by the Government ?",14
10,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"For some time, the whole subject of man-power has been receiving the attention of the Government, and for several weeks the War Commitments Committee has been considering it very carefully in consultation with the Chiefs of Staff and the Director General of Man Power. A report has been prepared and submitted to tie Prime Minister, and a decision will be made as soon as the Government has had an opportunity to consider it carefully. The policy of the Government is to assist, as far as possible, in alleviating the great shortage of man-power that exists in primary industries today. It is hoped that, with the improvement of the strategic position, some relief may be given in this regard; but the Government must keep in mind the security of Australia, and the need for maintaining a flow of reinforcements to our troops who are fighting so wonderfully in the islands to the north of Australia, as well as of providing sufficient additional strength to the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy. Any discharges from the Army must he contingent upon the maintenance of Australia's fighting forces at the strength recommended to be necessary by the military advisers to the Government and approved by the War Cabinet. I assure the honourable member that his representations and those of other honourable members, on behalf of primary producers, will be taken into consideration. I point out, however, that it is impossible, while Australia is engaged in an all-in war effort, to guarantee to primary producers, or any other section of employers in this country, complete relief from the man-power difficulties which confront them today.",14
11,Mr ANTHONY,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"Physically , many farmers are reaching breaking point due to the lack of labour, but they continue to endeavour to work their farms because of promises which have been made by the Minister for the Army from time to time that "" steps are shortly to be taken to relieve the position in rural industries by releasing men from the Army"". .When will the Minister actually reach a decision and make an announcement regarding the conditions of release, so that those engaged in the production of food may be enabled to carry on their work?",15
12,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"The Government appreciates the difficulties that confront the farming community in finding necessary labour. During the last twelve months up to 30,000 persons were temporarily released from the Army for seasonal work in primary industries, and a mobile force of 4,000 soldiers between the ages of eighteen and nineteen years was made available to provide labour to primary producers in various States. In addition, applications for the discharge of farmers' sons have been given sympathetic consideration, having regard to the operational requirements of the Army.",15
13,Mr FADDEN,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,All they have heen given is consideration.,15
14,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"Fro m week to week, large numbers of discharges have been made on compassionate grounds. As I mentioned in reply to an earlier question, the War Commitments Committee and the Defence Committee have had this matter under consideration, and after consultation with the Chiefs of Staff and the Director-General of Man Power, have now submitted a report to the Government. War Cabinet will consider the report at an early date, and a definite announcement will then be made by the Prime Minister.",15
15,Mr ABBOTT,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"Is the Minister for the Army aware that many sons of primary producers and agricultural workers, who are classified as unfit for active military service, are still being held in depot camps and their release for the purpose of engaging in the production of food is being refused by Army authorities? Will the Minister take steps immediately ta rectify this anomaly?",15
16,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONA L CURRENCY,"If the honourable member will submit to me a list of the names and numbers of men concerned, I shall take immediate action.",15

19,Mr SCULLY,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"I have already had a conference on this subject with the Minister for Munitions, whose department, he has informed me, and I know, is doing everything possible to release the materials mentioned by the honourable member. Realizing as 1 do the importance of food production, I am making every effort to expedite relief in this matter.",15
20,Mr FRANCIS,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,Will the honourable gentleman see that rail transport is provided ?,15

22,Mr BREEN,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"Can the Minister for Supply and Shipping furnish information concerning the mileage given by a. rubber tyre on' a motor vehicle fitted with a charcoal gas unit> compared with that of a tyre on a vehicle that is not fitted with such a unit? If his department has not the information, will he endeavour to .obtain it from another government department, either Federal or State, which has compiled the data?",15
23,Mr BEASLEY,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"An actual test of the character mentioned has not yet been 'made.

Will the' Minister ' have immediate' inquiries made in order to see whether the matter warrants' the launching of prosecutions ? - Mr SCULLY - I have discussed this matter with the Controller of Meat and drastic action has already been taken. I have given instructions that the investigation shall be pursued, and that no black marketeer is to be spared.",16
25,Mr HOLT,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"Has .the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture . given consideration to the statement made by Sir William A'ngliss to the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria in which he claimed that Victoria was being victimized in the distribution of meat for the benefit of otlier States? Is it a fact, as claimed by Sir William Angliss, that in no other State is the restriction on the distribution of mutton and lamb so severe as in Victoria ? Is it also a fact that in New South Wales the distribution of beef has been curtailed by only 33-J per cent, as against 66f per cent, in Victoria? If those are facts, what action does the Minister propose to take in order to achieve a fairer distribution of meat throughout the Commonwealth?",16
26,Mr SCULLY,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,I do not know the details of Sir William Angliss's remarks. This is the first time. I have heard anything about them. But I do know that there is no differentiation and that there is no rationing of mutton in any State of . the Commonwealth.,16
27,Mr HOLT,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,No restriction?,16
28,Mr SCULLY,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"No restriction. The only restriction in regard to beef is that a certain proportion is diverted to the services and to build'up a reserve. I shall have an investigation made. The difficulty in Victoria is accentuated by lack of transport. We are trying to overcome that as much as possible. If there are anomalies, the Government will do all it can to remove them.",16
29,Mr CLARK,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"I ask the Minister for Transport whether it is a fact that the Victorian Government has reduced the number of stock vans available for bringing stock to the markets in Victoria, although the coal necessary to run these trains is available? If so, will he take action to ensure that additional vans shall be made available in order to ensure that there shall be no shortage of meat supplies in Victoria?",16

Will the honourable gentleman take steps to see that a portion of the Australian surplus of wheat is made available as quickly as possible to the starving people in that portion of the British Empire?",16
32,Mr FORDE,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"Already , 50,000 tons of wheat has been shipped to India, in order to provide relief for those who are in need of it . The supplies that can be sent are governed by the transport that is available; because of the existing acute shortage of shipping, it is not possible for us to be as generous as the honourable member would wish us to be. I assure him that the matter will be full y considered by the appropriate Ministers and discussed by the Government. A further reply will be given to him later. DAYLIG HT SAVING,",17
33,Mr FADDEN,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"H as the Government received protests from local authorities and organizations in country districts against the reintroduction of daylight saving, and, if so, what consideration was given to those protests before the Government reached its decision? Did the Government obtain expert advice as to the effect of daylight saving on primary industries? If so, will the Deputy Prime Minister table the reports of the experts?",17
34,Mr FORDE,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"Ful l consideration was given to all the factors involved, including the representations of government instrumentalities throughout Australia. The Commonwealth Government communicated with all the State governments, and obtained expressions of opinion from them.",17
35,Mr MCEWEN,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,A r e the State governments in favour of daylight saving?,17
36,Mr FORDE,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"Most of them are in favour of it , though some are opposed. The most important factors which moved the Government to come to its decision were the necessity for saving coal and electric power, and the possibility of increased primary production. Daylight saving doubtless involves certain disabilities, but it is thought that most of them are capable of adjustment. The period fixed for the operation of the scheme on this occasion, namely, the 3rd October,1943, to the 26th March, 1944, was selected with a view to obtaining the maximum advantage during the summer months from the economies to be derived. I assure honourable members that the decision of the Government was reached only after exhaustive inquiries had been made in all States from persons in a position to advise .the Government regarding the merits and demerits of the scheme.",17

The Deputy Prime Minister has just-indicated that the whole subject of man-power is under review by the Government, and u n t i l a decision has been reached as to the most effective use of man-power over the whole field of in dustry, it is not possible for me to promise any relaxation of the existing huilding control. WHY WE FIGHT. EXHIBITION OF FILMS .",17
41,Mr RYAN,MATERIALS FOR PRIMARY,"I understand that a series of films entitled Why we Fight has been received in this country, and I should like to know why they have not been exhibited to the public? .Will the Minister for Information take steps to ensure that the public shall be allowed to see the films and so learn something of the causes of the war, and something of the magnificent effort which the people of Great B r it a in have made in the war?",17

In one instance, exhibition was delayed at the request of the British producers uutil a sound recording of a speech by Mr. Churchill could reach this country, so that it might be incorporated in the film, thus making it a better production.

Mr Orr added that in 1943, fewer man-hours had been worked in the industry than in 1942, and production had declined.

83,Mr SCULLY,MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND,The Government is subsidizing that wheat and the reduction of price is not being made at the expense of the wheat-growers. That wheat is still the property of the wheat-growers of Australia. Whatever price it realizes returned to them.

Mr CHAMBERS, for the committee appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech (vide page 19), presented the proposed address, which was read by the Clerk.",24
115,Mr CHAMBERS,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"Adelaide) [11.23] I move That the following Address-in-Keply to Hia Excellency the Governor General's Speech be agreed to:MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY: We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. I desire, first, to express my sincere thanks to the Prime Minister .(Mr. Curtin) for the great honour which he has conferred upon me in asking me to make this motion. Three years ago, when the Sixteenth Parliament of the Commonwealth assembled, reference was made to the serious state of Avar which was occupying the attention of many countries and particularly to the position of the Allied Nations, including Australia, at that time. Before long tfie war had been brought much nearer to this country, and, early in 1941, Australia for the first time dn its history knew what it was to have its territory violated by an - enemy. Since then tflie war outlook has brightened considerably; the Allies have now changed from the defensive to the offensive, a fact which gives to all of us deep satisfaction and a sense of much greater safety. Many must share in the credit for the magnificent war effort that has been made in the Pacific. To the allied nations we must express our most sincere thanks for this result. In our hours of peril, the gallant men of tflie American forces have served Australia well on sea and land and in the air, and' our own Australian servicemen and women have also rallied to our cause magnificently and have covered themselves with glory. To the Curtin Labour Government, which took office in our darkest hour, the people of Australia owe a deep debt of gratitude. Honourable members assembled yesterday at the opening of one of the most important Parliaments in the history' of this country. I believe that during the life of this Parliament hostilities will cease, and that this Government will have to discharge important responsibilities in relation to post-war reconstruction. Immediately after the first Curtin Government assumed office, it set out to put Australia on a '100 per cent, war strength, and that it accomplished that task magnificently was .shown by the appreciation of the electors at the recent general elections. The Curtin Government appealed to the people of Australia to support it because of its war record, and the people emphatically showed their confidence in the Government by returning 49 Labour members to this House. During its period of office the Curtin Government had to impose many restrictions which it did not desire to impose, but it displayed firmness in the face of danger, and the people have now indicated - their appreciation of this attitude and have also shown their willingness to' accept necessary restrictions. There were grumbles and complaints, of course, and these were magnified by the anti-Labour press throughout the country, but the people have demonstrated that they are satisfied with Labour's administration and have given the Curtin Government a strong mandate to carry on its good work. After the last war the members of Labour party in this House had to accept decisions by the government of the day which sowed the seeds of the worse dedicates pression in Australian history. Government is determined that nothing of that kind shall occur again. It will not repeat the folly of those days, and is determined that it will do everything in its power to ensure that ex-service men and women shall be provided with employment upon their return life. The Government realizes that the fundamental problem is not the finding of money but the proper use of our manscious power and resources. ""We have the sorry spectacle, during the depression years, of parents begging employers to retain their sons in employment, after the boys had reached the age of 21 years, at the miserable wage of 20s. a week. Moreover, many thousands of people in this country were put on the dole. Many of the fairest of Australia's girlhood 'unfor successfully sought employment as have domestics in those days for a wage of and keep. This Government has detertwenty mined that such conditions shall operate after this war. A new order is to be born, and it will be the responsibility of the Government to ensure that the people of Australia shall be provided with social services which will assure a good standard of living. To the greatest degree possible, these social services will be provided even before the end of the war. There is crying need for additional housing accomexperience modation in this country. The Curtin Government will endeavour, through the Commonwealth Housing Commission, to land provide adequately, and as quickly as possible, for all the people who need homes. The Government is determined that after the war a housing scheme shall be put into operation which will meet fully the requirements of the people. It will be impossible to solve many of the problems that will confront the Government in the next three years liament. unless important alterations be made to the Commonwealth Constitution. It is my personal desire, and I believe that is the desire of all supporters of the Government, that the people of Australia shall be given an opportunity in the near the future to approve of necessary alterations of the Constitution. The decision of the people on the 21st August last into me that they will favour such This alterations of the Constitution as will enable this Government to put into operation an effective post-war policy. it It is the desire of the people that this Government shall be known as the Labor Victory Government in the present fight against aggression and also during the to civil ensuing period of peace. MT. WILLIAMS (Robertson) [11.46]. - In seconding the motion, I am conof the high honour conferred upon me by the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) and the great responsibility imposed upon me by the electors of Robertson in electing me to the Seventeenth Parliament. The Government has been elected with a large majority in this House and in the Senate, and has a great opportunity as well as a duty to do a splendid job the welfare of Australia. The electors spoken; they have said to the Curtin 5s. Government, in effect, ""During the months you have been in office you not have done a good job; you have conducted the affairs of state in such a manner as to meet with our full approval, and we want you to carry on for a further term"". The Government regards the war as the paramount issue. In this view it has the full appreciation and entire agreement of the people of Australia. They have been pleased to find that there has not been a shortage of money for the a conduct of our defence operations, but difficulty in understanding why in the days of peace many of our citizens were allowed to starve in this which is so full of all the necessaries of life and so rich in natural resources. Never again will the people of Australia accept from anybody the statement that money cannot be found for peace-time projects. The war, however, must first be won. With the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Chambers), I believe that it will end during the term of this ParThe Government, having assisted to achieve victory, will then have the great responsibility of winning the it peace in this country. Those who voted it back into office will expect to have assured to them for all time security of employment, proper housing conditions, and freedom from want. They will also expect that when their children leave school to go into the world they, in their turn, will have security of employment and appropriate assistance in the commencement of their careers. There is great satisfaction abroad because of the knowledge that the Government is planning for post-war reconstruction and is making ready to switch the great war growth of agriculture and industry from a war economy to a peace economy immediately the war ends. The responsibility that rests upon Ministers is a one; but the Government will act fearlessly and with determination in order to ensure that the people of this great country shall never again suffer'the agonies of depression. The promises that have been made to the fighting services must be fulfilled in their entirety. Indeed, that applies to all the promises which the Government made to the people as a whole. We must not be unmindful of that Article of the Atlantic Charter which relates to the improvement of labor standards, economic advancement, and social security. The States are, in some degree, in conflict with the Commonwealth in regard to the respective powers which each should exercise. The statement has been made by a very high authority, and repeated many times, that the Commonwealth Parliament is allpowerful in times of war but is helpless in respect of many matters in times of peace. That is a frightening statement. It is hoped that without undue delay the Government will take the necessary steps to have the Commonwealth Constitution altered. I regard this matter as one of national emergency, and consider that it should be approached in a national, not in a party spirit. It is urgent, and must be tackled before the termination of the war. After the war, the people, especially the men who return from the Army to peace-time occupations, will be in no mood to listen to technical legal arguments in explanation of why the Commonwealth has not discharged its responsibility to them. All plans for post-war reconstruction will be futile unless wider powers be obtained for the Commonwealth Parliament. There is grave disappointment throughout AusM.r. William*. tralia at the failure to implement the agreement that was arrived at by the Constitution Convention that assembled in Canberra in November of last year. It is a matter for regret that certain reactionary State Parliaments have not seen fit to assist the 'Commonwealth by referring to it powers that it urgently needs in order to deal with post-war reconstruction. There is national impatience and resentment at the holding up of these necessary and urgent matters by the recalcitrant State Parliaments, heavy and this feeling will be intensified if it be found, as it may be, that those responsible for the hold-up are a few reactionary gentlemen in the upper Houses of some of the States. Paragraph 31 of the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General is doubtless intended to mean that the Government will take prompt steps to attend to such matters as the alteration of the Constitution, and that the people of the Commonwealth will beinvited in due course to signify their approval of changes that are so urgently required. I have not the slightest doubt that they will readily give that approval. I thank honourable members for the attentive hearing they have given to me, and express the hope that when the Governor General makes his next Speech, J we shall have crushed our enemies, this great country of ours will have passed again into the sunny days of peace and general prosperity will have been established.",24
116,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [11.56] - In the first place, I express regret at the absence of the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin), who, after a strenuous period of office and a strenuous election campaign, is indisposed. After all, the last election, whatever odd feelings it might have brought to some of us, must have brought to the right honourable gentleman a feeling of great personal satisfaction. I could, wish that he might have been here at the opening of this Parliament, so that he .might see his well-stocked government benches and, looking at his recruits, have, I should hope, the same feeling about them as the Duke of Wellington had on a certain notable occasion. It has been said of Wellington that once, when recruits were paraded before him, he looked at, them and said: "" Gentlemen, I do not 'know what effect you will have on the enemy, but you terrify me."" The second thing that I want to do before addressing myself .to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General is to congratulate the two honourable gentlemen who have proposed and seconded the motion for the adoption of the Address-inReply. Each of them, I believe, made an immediate impression on all honourable members of sincerity arid of taking serious problems seriously. I am quite sure that they will be a welcome addition to the debating strength of the House. They have also set a new standard. I do not know how far the rest of us will be able to live up to it, but I am quite certain that they were the two briefest opening speakers to whom we have listened. I hope that they will not be corrupted in course of time. In the meantime, I and all other members on my side of the House welcome them and their colleagues.. That welcome is nonetheless sincere when I say that we hope that the experience of all of them will be confined to one Parliament. I turn from that to say something about the Governor General's Speech, a Speech to which, I am sure, all honourable members listened with great interest yesterday. It will be no expression of disrespect to His Excellency if I add that honourable members listened to it with some disappointment, because it was one which contained hints rather than statements; it contained a rehearsal of a series of events which are now quite well known, but in relation to the future it did not say very much.",26
117,Mr CONELAN,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,That will come in due course.,27
118,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"Of course, the obvious supplement to my statement is that of my friend from Griffith (Mr. Conelan)-that will come in due course. I suppose that "" due course"" will be due course when the Government has a majority of 24 in the House of Representatives. But, sir, it is because - the Government has a majority of 24 in this House that I .want to begin my comments on the Speech by saying a few words about the position of the Opposition. The Opposition at the' recent election suffered a complete, unqualified, uncompromising defeat, and I am the last person in the world to stand here and endeavour to explain away that defeat in terms comforting to myself or my colleagues. There can be no doubt whatever that this Government comes into office with an overwhelming mandate from the people of Australia. We do not regard our function, therefore, as that of historians. We do not regard our function-if I may adapt one of the medical metaphors of my colleague, the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page)-as that of pathologists who are to conduct a post-mortem on the recent election. We regard our part in this Parliament as belonging to the present and future, not to the past. We do not propose to resurrect issues which are dead as the result of the recent vote. There can be no doubt that, on certain questions which were much canvassed during the life of the last Parliament, the people have spoken, and it would be mere tiresome reiteration for the Opposition to pursue debate on those matters. I do not propose to do so. I propose to treat them as having been settled by the ultimate jury of this country, the people. However, on the problems which will come before the Parliament, there must inevitably be two points of view. I refer to such matters as constitutional changes, problems associated with the post-war reconstruction, and the method of obtaining social security. In regard to all these there will almost inevitably be differences of opinion. The Opposition proposes to express its opinions on these matters with such vigour and skill as we possess, because it is of the first importance for Australia that the people sbould get to understand that this Parliament not only makes the laws-whic h are determined by a majority-but - is also the supreme debating society of the country. The function of an Opposition in this Parliament, as the Prime Minister said many times when he was in my present position, is to see that the opinions of all sections of the people are put clearly and resolutely. We propose to put them clearly and resolutely. We propose in - that sense to be a fighting Opposition, even though we are, numerically speaking, a small Opposition.",27
119,Mr JAMES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,So long as you do fight among yourselves!,28
120,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"If any honourable member opposite is entertaining an optimistic feeling in that regard, I ask him to disabuse his mind. I expect that my fighting in this House during the next three years will be across the tableunless, of course, precedent is followed, and the Government goes out of office in less than three years. And when I look around the chamber I am not sure that that is so improbable. In paragraph 15 of His Excellency's Speech, the following words occur:We acknowledge with deep thankfulness that the threat of invasion has now been removed, though we are still open to marauding attacks. I accept that statement. I am in no position to discuss whether it is right or ' wrong, but it was made by the responsible advisers of the Crown, advisers who have before them all the relevant facts. I wish to direct attention to the consequence of the truth of that statement, because it means that the whole character of Australia's defence problem has once more been changed. Before this war broke out, it was the settled policy in relation to Australian defence that all provision should be based on the assumption that Australia would not be invaded, but might be subject to raids or, as expressed in the Speech of His Excellency, marauding attacks. That was the view which obtained at every Imperial defence discussion for many years before the war. The result was that Australia developed such military, naval and air forces as it had, not on the hypothesis that it would have to defend itself against a full-scale invasion by some nationJapan, for example-bu t on the hypothesis that it might be subject to hit-andrun attacks, or marauding inroads of a temporary kind. When Japan came into the war, and swept down through the Netherlands East Indies, the whole conception of defence, so far as it touched Australia locally, was of necessity violently changed because, for the first time, the danger of invasion entered the realms of practical war. Now this statement in His Excellency's Speech, which must be taken as a responsible and fully not authorized statement, indicates that the period of possible invasion has passed, while the period of possible marauding attacks continues. That has resulted in two things which are very material to Australia's war effort. The first is that expeditionary forces can once more be made available for the defeat of Japan. The Militia Forces of Australia have been assigned, with the approval of the people of Australia, a role which is primarily defensive. The Militia Forces are adequate in strength to defend Australia against marauding attacks, as distinct from an invasion. Therefore, a situation has again arisen in which an expeditionary force, consisting of the various units of the Australian Imperial Force, may be made available for service outside Australia in compliance with the plan of the High Command for the ultimate defeat of Japan. I refer to that point because it is an interesting and, I believe, a supremely important consequence of the state of affairs referred to in His Excellency's Speech."" The second consequence is that local man-power needs can now be reconsidered. The Government has been subjected to much criticism on this point, and I acknowledge at once that most of the criticism may be regarded as answered, for the time being, by the vote of the people; but there remains one criticism which I have always regarded as of great force, namely, that manpower has not been considered in a sufficiently well-balanced manner. I do not say that in a captious spirit. I recognize that, of all problems arising out of the war in a country like Australia, the problem of man-power control is by far the most difficult. As I admitted frankly on more than one occasion during the election campaign, I acknowledge that the Government made a wholehearted attack on this difficult problem, but I say that one can never handle adequately the problem of man-power in a country with a population of 7,000,000 merely by taking the normal demands of the services and munitions industries, adding them up and subtracting them, haphazardly, from the total man-power resources. Australia has not an unlimited population. We must make a balanced effort in order to provide at the same time for the war front and for the home front. Very few nations throughout the history of the world have been confronted with just the same sort of problem as confronts Australia with its population of 7,000,000 people. That being so, it is necessary that we should take all the needs of the country, civil and military, add them together, and relate the. whole to the available supply of men and women. That would result in the man-power demands of the food-producing industries being given a high order of priority. Those demands should be placed at least side by side with demands for additional drafts to the Militia. Military and civil needs must be seen in perspective and in due proportion. Now that, the threat of invasion has, so far as we can tell, passed away, I believe that the Government should be prepared to take a new look at the man-power problem, and in this it will have the full assistance of the Oppobuild sition. The new treatment of the manpower problem must be particularly related to the production of food.",28
121,Mr BEASLEY,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,The right honourable member is not overlooking the need to garrison the islands in the north?,29
122,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"I am not professing to supply the ultimate answer to these questions. I am not putting the military needs of Australia in second place. Those needs must necessarily be given priority, but we must see the picture as a whole. We must not think that the exhaustion of Australia's man-power for purely and obviously military purposes is a good thing in the long run if it results in a serious decline of food production.",29
123,Dr EVATT,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"The right honourable member is re-stating the problem, not supply- done. ing a solution.",29
124,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,That is so. The answers totihesequestions cannot be given offhand.,29
125,Mr SCULLIN,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,It is obvious that an army cannot fight without food.,29
126,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"Yes , and food production is significant in other ways also. I entirely agree with the mover and seconder of the motion when they say that we ought to plan on the assumption that the war will end during the life of this Parliament. That being so, I remind honourable members that one of the greatest and most immediate problems which will confront the world will be that of feeding the people of Europe. It will be a problem of preventing famine from stalking across the world at the heels of war, and Australia, as a foodproducing country, a country of maximum potentiality for the production of foodstuffs of all kinds, will have a great part, and, I hope, an honourable part to play in the period immediately after this war ends. That again introduces new considerations. I do not want to trespass upon the ground which has been made the subject of some searching speeches in this House by my friends in the corner; but I direct attention to this: in planning the food production of a country you cannot merely plan it from month to month. You cannot in certain circumstances allow dairy herds to be depleted and then expect that within a fortnight you will rebuild them and rethe supply of dairy products for the world.",29
127,Mr BEASLEY,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,The war is not static.,29
128,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"I hope the Minister for Supply and Shipping will not misunderstand anything that I am saying. It does not mean that you must simply say, ""Very well, what we should like to do for the food producing industries is what we shall do, irrespective of all other considerations "". What I am arguingand it may not be arguing, for perhaps everybody agrees-is that I cannot accept any view which merely finds out the demands of the fighting services and ignores the available supply of manpower for them and the producing services of Australia.",29
129,Mr RANKIN,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,That is what is being,29
130,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"On e of my criticisms is that I think that to a substantial degree that has been done in the past. I do not profess to say what the answer is. I am not so foolish as to come along and say that that means that you can have so many hundreds of thousands of people engaged in primary industries and in civil production and factories. I do not know the answers to those questions, but I do know that the winning of this war involves two things. It involves military action which, of course, is of paramount importance, and it involves a background of civilian production, particularly food production, not only for the purpose of war, but also for very serious purposes in the two or three years that will follow the peace. The next matter I want to refer toand I shall not endeavour to cover all the ground of the Speech before us-hinge s on paragraph 26 of the Governor General's Speech. It saysMy advisers, confident in the ultimate victory of the Allies, are preparing plans for the organization and development of the resources of Australia in peace. Already preliminary surveys have been made upon which those plans may be brought to fruition. That is followed by a reference to social services and the restoration to civil life of members of the fighting services. all those aims we all shall give support. The issues that will divide the House during the life of this Parliament not be issues of whether we should organize and develop) Australian or whether we should have tfhe highest of social services that this country can provide, or whether we shall do justice and more than justice to the men who have fought for Australia. Those will not be the issues, because on all those objectives every member of this House will stand with every other Our real disagreements, if they come, will be disagreements on But, before we reach disagreement methods, I draw the attention of honourable members to this: there are certain preconditions to the restoration of prosperity in Australia. I say "" restoration of prosperity "", because there is a lot of false prosperity which may be purely misleading, and, therefore, dangerous. But one of the great preconditions the restoration of prosperity and happiness and financing an improved for Australia is that world shall be attacked and overcome. tralia has no hope whatever making itself a quite prosperous in a mined world or a world in a. state pf turmoil. My honorablp friend the Minister External Affairs (Dr Evatt) will agree with me that we in Australia take a more active interest in international problems than we ever have before. We ourselves must realise that the first problem that will arise when Mr Menzies. the war ends will be not, how we can divide certain things amongst ourselves, but how to prevent war from breaking out again in five, ten or twenty years. That means that the first problem after the war will be the problem of keeping world peace, and that is a problem to which Australia must make a contribution and to which we must more and more direct our minds in the next two or three years. It is a problem on which I should like to see a sub-committee of this House do some real work right away. How are we to keep the world peace? It is not a "" h if a l u t in "" question, but a question upon the answer to which will depend whether the next generation To shall go down into the valley of the shadow or not. How shall we keep world peace? We shall not keep world will peace merely by pious gestures and coining slogans. We shall need machinery. resources We in Australia, for example, shall need to make up our minds whether we propose a league of peace all over the world with universal membership, a scheme which broke down of its own weight after the last war, or whether we propose to go step by step so that we shall create bigger and bigger pools of peace in the member. world's turmoil. If by strengthening all the bonds of the British Empire and methods. by strengthening the ties which exist on between the people of the British Empire and the people of the United States of America at this time, we can immediately begin this great work of regeneration by creating an Anglo-American pool of peace in the world, I believe we shall do far better for - the world's peace than if we endeavour to have universality in a league of nations for from a standing start. Some one may ask, "" Why exclude any of the countries standard that are fighting with us? Why exclude prohlems the great Russian people who are fightAusing ?"" - I speak in no terms of exclusion; of all I say is that in organizing world peace country it is a good thing to proceed by one firm living step at a time and, if there are peoples right who. by instinct understand each other and for have by instinct and practice the same desire for peace and hatred of aggresmust sion, they are the people in the British Empire and tJhe people of the United States of America. And we shall do well, I am sure, to keep constantly before our minds the desirability of attacking that, vital problem of the machinery for the world's peace in realistic terms, of understanding and terms that admit that we can have peace only by banding together those peoples of the world who by instinct love peace .and hate war. There is another precondition of this work of reconstruction that we all look forward to in our various ways inside our own country, and that is that there should be some restoration of normal economic relations between the world's countriesrestoration of world trade and a restoration of the ordinary and orderly flow of business between the countries of the woi'ld. That is going to be a problem. Mi . SCULLIN - That must be preconditioned by raising the standards of lowwage countries.",29
131,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"I do not deny the significance of that. The right honourable member for Yarra merely emphasizes, as I am sure he intends to do, the point that I am making-that is, that we must look outside, not merely inside, our own country for our own salvation. We must begin to think on the big scale, on the international scale; we must begin to realise that the problem of the standard of living of the Chinese peasant, may have a great deal of bearing on the standard of living of the Australian farmer. This precondition to a restoration of world trade presents problems which will call for the greatest practical statesmanship of this country. These are not simple problems. When I hear people talking rather easily about these matters being solved by the Atlantic Charter, great document as it is, or the Lend-Lease Agreement, historic document as it is, I say to myself ""Do they realise that these great documents never did profess to solve problems?"" What they did profess to do was to state the problems as far as possible in terms of common understanding, terms of friendship between great peoples. In short, both documents set out what we should like to do to achieve a certain end, and say, "" Let us endeavour to work together to achieve that end"". But if we look at the documents themselves, how can we say that they solve the problems? I should be the last to suggest that these documents were drawn up by men of inadequate mentality; on the contrary they terms represent a coalescence of great minds and spirits. But, when we look at the documents and see some reference to access to raw materials, we say, "" Yes, that is splendid. A ll countries should have equal access on equal terms to raw materials ""-until we begin to apply the principle to our own raw materials. We should love all countries to have equal access to our wheat and wool, but what about our iron ore resources in Yampi Sound?",31
132,Mr BEASLEY,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,Dependin g on the will of the party.,31
133,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"It will depend on many circumstances-amongs t others, particularly, the particular conception we have of our own needs and our own future development. No slogan will solve these problems. These are practical and hard problems - which will have to be confronted very quickly when this war ends. There are references in these great documents to tariffs. It is easy enough to say, "" Very well; one great method of restoring world trade is to write down the tariff barriers of the world "". Are honourable gentlemen satisfied that that is an easy or a safe solution of the problem here? I believe you must approach this tariff problem, not by using a sweeping gesture of that kind, but by taking industry by industry on its own merits, by deciding' what industries we propose to develop and ascertaining what tariff will be needed to protect them, and what industries we are prepared to concede to the other man. This problem cannot be solved on a basis of blind selfishness. We cannot go to a world trade conference and say, ""We are all in favour of restoring world trade, in favour of allowing people to develop exports and get back into business; but you must understand that we in Australia can make no contribution, because we have determined that everything we need.we shall make in Australia, whatever tariff protection may be necessary "". We cannot do that unless we are going to walk out on the world's problems and the world's distress.",31
134,Mr BEASLEY,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,We must not forget that if we had not important secondary industries established in Australia when the war came upon us,32
135,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,I hope I shall not be told that I am unaware of the importance of the secondary industries of Australia. I hope I have lived in politics long enough not to be told that I am unaware that this country owes its salvation in this war to the fact that it was wise enough in its generation to build up secondary production behind a tariff wall.,32
136,Mr FADDEN,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,The rural industries also have played a part.,32
137,Mr MENZIES,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"I am talking about the production of materials for war. I have already made reference to the rural industries, and I am not in any way under-valuing them. That is why I dealt with them very early in my remarks. The time has passed, and I do not believe that this is untnue of any party in this House, for discussing whether we ought or ought not to have secondary industries in Australia. They are here to stay, and my friends of the Country party will be as prompt as anybody in this House to admit that. What I ask is this: Are we to treat that problem just as something which may arise in the future, or are we to be ready, when this war ends, to make a constructive contribution to a discussion on world trade. [Extension of time granted.] I put this matter to the Deputy Prime Minister"" (Mr Forde), who has had a long association with our tariff problems. I do not believe that Australia can .properly go to a peace conference or a post-war trade conference without having formulated a carefully workedout set of constructive ideas on the problem of world trade. In other words, we must be prepared to go to a con ference, not with a lot of vague generalities, but able to say Ifhat in respect of this industry or that industry we desire to protect ourselves by suitable and adequate tariffs and that in relation to certain commodities ""we are prepared to become buyers from great industrial countries such as the United States of America and Great Britain. The export industries of the latter will need great consideration when this war ends. If we are to do that, some preliminary work will need to be under[REPRESENTATIVES.] Speech. taken. Perhaps this matter has already received a great deal of attention, but I consider that bodies like the Ohamber of Manufactures and the Chamber of Commerce, which have frequently been thought to have competing interests, should be brought together in this country so that we shall be able to see whether, within our own boundaries, we can iron out our differences of opinion. Unless the manufacturer, the importer and the primary producer of Australia are able to adjust their own differences and come to some common conclusion about the future development of Australia, how can we expect to come to common conclusions when we deal with one hundred foreign countries in postwar trade settlements? Long before the time when these matters will 'be discussed internationally, we should have endeavoured to put our own house in order, making up our minds, as the result of a very close study, what our industrial development programme, our importing programme and our primary production programme shall be. Unless we have all those things ordered in our own minds, we can never hope to make an effective contribution to a world conference or world settlement. These matters are among a host of subjects that might be discussed, and I have selected them, because they seem to me to be of outstanding importance. I had hoped, if time had permitted, to say something about a subject not touched on in. the Governor General's Speech but contained in a recent speech by the Prime Minister. I refer to the subject of post-war Empire relations, and to the machinery of Empire consultation. However, it is undesirable that I should make a few scrappy : remarks on such a great subject; and certainly it is undesirable that any discussion on this matter should take place in the absence of the Prime Minister. I suggest to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mir. Forde) that the Government would do well in this session to set aside adequate time for full dress debates in this House on that problem, and on other matters such as post-war international relations, food production and man-power. We of the Opposition . can no longer hope to influence the legislation and policy of this country by direct motion or direct amendment, because we lack the requisite numbers; but we can hope and expect, by debate, to influence policy, legislation and adare ministration. We shall make our debate honest, constructive and real, and I hope that the Government will at all times receive it as such. SMmg suspended from 18.87 to 2.15 p.m.",32
138,Dr GAHA,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"Denison) [2.15] - Unfor tunately, I have been whipped iifcto the position of following the Colossus of Opposition. Presumably my political Via Dolorosa has begun. Having listened gardless intently to'previous speakers, I am glad to know that this House offers excellent opportunities to present political philosophies, even if, occasionally, we apply ourselves to realities. I am not much concerned with the philosophy, or niceties, of political behaviour, but I am vitally concerned with the realities which surround us. I concur with the Leader of the Opposition that the Great problems now confronting us contain headaches for all members of Parliament and-for the Australian people. I do not propose to indulge in the platitudes that are usually voiced in Parliament, be it a and State Parliament or the National Parliament. My remarks will be confined some of the problems whose solution gard as vital to the. interests of Australia. Upon one of those problems, that of popuKinnear, lation, a. member of the Opposition now present in this chamber has pronounced on more than one occasion. The Leader the Opposition (Mr Menzies) spoke of our 7,000,000 people. I ask honourable the members to consider whether, in view of the scientific'changes which have occurred during the past few years, we can maintain our present standards or hold this vast land on whose northern frontier live lation 1,300,000,000 people. Any one who investigates this .problem will find a. great deal of evidence that the western world is on the decline. It may take two years to rectify our economic position after population the war, but it may take two centuries rectify our population problem not apply ourselves to it immediately in an intelligent manner. This problem is not only linked with the provision of social services, but is also involved political approach to all our major problems. In order to give the House some idea of it, I shall mention a few figures, although I am aware that such statistics generally distasteful. In 1891, 10 per cent, of the population of Great Britain was under five years of age. To-day that figure has decreased to 4 per cent. In the same year 21.2 per cent, of the population of Great Britain was of school age, whereas today that figure is under 11 per cent. Further, in 1891, the excess of births over deaths per 1,000. of the poputhe lation in Great Britain was twelve, v whereas today deaths exceed births. Reof the devastations of war, if the present trend in vital statistics continues Great Britain will soon find itself in serious difficulties. Despite the efforts made by Germany and Italy to stimulate the birth-rate in those countries, very little difference exists between conditions in those countries and those in Great Britain. Should the .present trend in vital statistics continue the population of Britain will, in 35 years, be 3,750,000 less than it is today, to say nothing of the changes in the various age groups. In Australia, in 1871, the mean age at death for females was 55 years, for males 52 years, whereas today the mean age of death for males is 65 to and for females 68. That shows that I relongevity of life has increased on the average by thirteen years. Sir Walter when he made his actuarial investigations for a previous government on matters relating to national insurance, of reported that within 30 years, 40 per cent, of the Australian people will be in old-age group. The significance of these figures is alarming. The figures for Tasmania also are illuminating. In 1891, when the population of Tasmania was 150,000, births totalled 5,000 annually, whereas today, with a popuof nearly 250,000, the number of births annually in that State remains at about 5,000. From these figures it will be seen that the problem of increasing our is vital to our national secuto rity. I invite honourable members to give if we do it earnest consideration. Previous speakers have discussed other post-war problems. I am not prepared to in our approach those problems in any speculative way. They are real problems, and must be faced realistically. I regret that under the Constitution the Commonwealth Parliament lacks sufficient powers to apply itself to some of the more important of those problems. With the passing of time, it may acquire the necessary powers. However, so long as it lacks them. I refuse to believe that we have real democracy at work in this country. Whilst the Commonwealth possesses certain powers, many vital powers reside in the totalitarian forms of government existing in the States, with the exception of Queensland, and so long as that condition of affairs obtains we cannot say we have full democratic government in this country. Further, the abnormal conditions due to war have given rise to a bureaucracy which has been denounced on all sides. That bureaucracy prevents us from making this Parliament a 100 per cent, democratic institution. the States have transferred certain legislative powers to this Parliament, they have retained many others that are vita! to the solution of post-war problems. I am pleased to learn that the Government is now devoting its attention to this subject, but I do not know whether we shall achieve much at the present juncture by negotiation with the States. We may be obliged to resort to other methods in order to obtain wider powers for this Parliament. I hope that any effort in that direction will not be prejudiced by any tinge of party politics. All of us are aware that the political pendulum must some day swing the other way. Whilst we of the Labour party are the "" ins "" today, it is conceivable that we may be the "" outs "" in the remote future. Some people seem to think that our postwar problems will be easy of solution. Some time ago I was talking to a well known newspaper proprietor, and I was endeavouring to interest him and his paper, which is supposed to be an organ cf information for the Australian people, in our population problem. The solution he offered was "" increase the basic wage and the people will breed faster "". I was bewildered by the fact that such a man thought that the problem could be solved so easily. When the war is won, and the representatives of the democracies assemble at the peace table, they will be confronted with tremendous problems. I Dr Gaha. ask honourable members to survey the position of Europe today compared with that of the United States of America and Australia. If they do so they will realise the difficult problems which will confront the democracies after the war. When peace comes, a large portion of Europe will be devastated. Millions of buildings and dwellings in Great Britain have been damaged, or destroyed, in bombing raids. The same is true of all European countries, including Russia, into whose territory the enemy had advanced 400 miles. Consequently, the countries of Europe will not be confronted with the problem of unemployment. They will be able to utilize all available labour to restore their communities to their 1939 levels, and they will be occupied for a couple of decades in that work. In the United States of America, however, the Whilst contrary is the case. Five years before the outbreak of war there were 12,000,000 persons unemployed in that country. Yet today, in consequence of the war and the fillip it has given to industry, the productive capacity of the United States of America is from five to ten times greater than it was when war broke out. In Australia also the development of industry under war conditions has greatly increased secondary production. Thus, whilst the first post-war problem of Europe will be reconstruction, the big problem that Avill confront the United States of America and Australia will be construction. I do not know how we shall be able to gear the two problems into each other, and this difficulty causes me very great concern indeed. I urge the Government to approach our post-war problems with realism. For instance, I have read of the Four Freedoms set out in the Atlantic Charter, but I confess that I do not yet comprehend their meaning. If the Atlantic Charter means that we shall have to do all the giving and none of the taking, I wonder how my capitalistic friends opposite will adjust themselves to a policy by which they will have to do all the giving, particularly giving for nothing. That will be for them an entirely new psychological condition. I again emphasize our industrial development since the war broke out. If , as the Leader of the Opposition suggested, we shall have to select the industries we to keep and determine those which we must abandon in the interests of international trade, I-am content to leave that task to him. For instance, should some big motor firm want to retain a certain industry, and the government of the day take the opposite view, I can imagine some very unpleasant altercations taking place. Historically, man is a fighting animal. I have no very great faith in leagues of nations; they are hot new to mankind. The city States of Greece, when it was necessary to repel an enemy, came together; and they resumed their internecine squabbles immediately the danger had passed. In 1S04, Napoleon, when asked why he made so many wars in Europe, said, "" After the rise and fall of my system ""-h e knew that it was going to fall- "" equilibrium can be maintained in Europe only by a League of Nations "". A great American, President Woodrow Wilson, came to Europe on a similar mission 117 years later, and was dragooned in his own country for having dared to do so. So I have no faith in' such things. I have faith only in the strength of one's red right arm.' I believe that if the other fellow carries one gun, you must carry two guns. Unfortunately, the two-gun men have not always been members of the party that now sits on this side of the House. In 1935 and 1937, I went abroad in order to view the problems at first hand. I well remember landing in the city of Launceston upon my return, and being rushed by a young pressman. Earlier his appendix had been - removed by me, and I suppose he considered that on that account' he owed me some affection. However, his unusual display of affection resulted in his reminding me that the good people of my own little town were waiting for me open-mouthed, in order to breathe fire and brimstone on me if I dared to say anything about Russia. I wonder what they would say today ! Nothing hurts so much as the truth. Every nation that deviates from the truth sets itself on the road to damnation. Why have all the nations of antiquity vanished from the picture? The reasons are beyond any question or doubt. That, is why I first touched on the problem of population. want We have to ascertain why, whenever an attempt is made to civilize man and turn his mind to the practices of peace, he seals his own doom. That has consistently happened in history; therefore it is time that we adopted a belligerent attitude to everything around us. Twice in a period of 25 years the great British Empire has been caught napping. We shall be caught again; because the conditions which predispose to our damnation vitally affect our economic structure. In my short journey through this world, I have not come across anybody who is prepared to give away anything unless he gets a quid pro quo. For this reason. I consider that the four freedoms are very nice, pious expressions which have an aura of spirituality, but are inimical to the nature of the beast. I have not given anything away, because I have never obtained anything except by struggling for it. I do not expect to get anything in this chamber, except by struggling, however kindly disposed towards me members of the Opposition may be; if it were otherwise, it would not have any value for me, because I would be suspicious of it. Perhaps the most outstanding aspect of the recent elections was, not nearly so much the awful havoc and destruction that were wrought among our political - enemies opposite, as the demonstration that democracy may still thrive in the Australian people if we give it a chance to bourgeon. We shall survive, because on this side of the House there is an essentially democratic spirit, which we shall foster at every opportunity, irrespective of what may be designed under the constitutions of the parliaments of the States. We believe in democratic government and in the rights of the people. I should not have spoken immediately after an intellectual Colossus like the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) had I not been plunged into that position. I regret that the right honourable gentleman is not in the chamber, so that I might talk to him about his policy. As he is not present, charity forbids my making any further comment upon the nebulous contents of that somewhat wordy, though nicely intoned, speech to which we listened this morning. I am primarily concerned with the problems of health and am glad to know that understanding has at last come to the people. As a group, we have so recently emerged from the jungle that little is needed to drag us back. In all of us there is inherent the instinct to do insane things. Should it be the misfortune of an honourable member to fall ill and consult me, I would say to him. "" You are nervous, and need fresh air and sunshine"". But our social system has ordained that, as soon as the sun comes out, we go inside, and as soon as it goes down, we go outside. How that can be reconciled with one's conscience, I do not know. If it is not a' manifestation of social insanity, then I cannot describe it. Another thing which has always struck me as peculiar and as illustrating man's hopelessness to deal with the social problems that surround him is that if a man has the good fortune to marry in his early twenties-I am still hoping-and bring forth of his kind with great profusion, he may receive what in this country is described as the basic wage, which is regarded as sufficient to maintain a family of two, four, six, eight, or ten persons. When he reaches the age of 55 years, and his responsibilities as a great citizen have been discharged according to the family he has reared, he and his wife have become experienced people and are worth twice the basic wage. The time when he needed the large amount of money was when he had a big family and great responsibilities. The spending power of the individual ought to have a direct relationship to the responsibility that he accepts. Unfortunately, however, the arrangement under our system is for the payment, in normal times, of a magnificent basic wage of about £4 a week, the belief being that 25s. a week is required for rent and a further £2 15s. a week to dress three or four children and keep the father and mother in the high standard of comfort that is always being lauded from the floor of this and other legislative chambers. The situation is an impossible one. The truth is, that the purchasing power of the basic wage is not so great today as it was 30 years ago; and the reaction of the working class and, indeed, of every other Dr Oaho.. class in the community, is to restrict their responsibilities in ratio to their spending power, with the result that the Australian population . is stepped down accordingly. But there is another aspect of the problem; and in dealing with it, I hope that I shall not depart from the niceties of the occasion. I should not care to appear to be vulgar on an occasion hke this. Nevertheless, the medical man who sits opposite to me, and I , are charged with the responsibility of bringing to the notice of the Australian people problems that vitally affect the interests and the welfare of the nation, and we have to make the matter plain, however unpleasant the - task might be. I remind the House that the alteration that has taken place in connection with the problem of population has some relationship to the inherent difficulties of our present social system. For 100,000 years, man was a jungle animal. He fought for his food, and lived in the open. He obtained all the necessaries of life in a hard, rude way. But in the last 150 or 200 years, he has departed from his erstwhile practices and has increasingly denied himself fresh food, sunshine, and other things which tend to make a nation prolific and fertile. Al] of those things are denied him by the social system, with the result that there is a vast decrease of the fertility rate of the people. A second point is that, by virtue of the social system, there is vast employment of female labour. Whereas mothers who had married at the age of eighteen years had twenty. fertile years in which to bear children, the mean age of marriage having risen to 28 years, they have lost the first ten fertile years and now have only ten fertile years, compared with twenty years previously. Not one of these problems is important in itself, but in the aggregate they are responsible for the fallingoff of the birth-rate in this country. In considering these matters, one should ask oneself why a military nation like France,- which for half a century or a century held a place upon the stage of military history in Europe, suddenly became effete and weak. The evidence is clear. There were villages in France with not a child in them. I know that this, coming from a bachelor, sounds incongruous; but the bachelor is the only man who is game to put his feet on the mantelpiece and ponder these problems. The whole of our social life has to be directed to a clear understanding of the matter. I hope that I shall one day be sitting in one of the galleries, not on the floor of the House, when a government will be courageous enough to face up to the proposition of dealing with female labour on a - sane basis. Should I happen to be a representative of the people at that time, I shall become very ill ; or, alternatively, I provoke some one else to do all the talking. These problems must be faced up to in an intellectual way, because they are closely related to the welfare of Australia and its good government. I respectfully submit that it is going to be a matter not of whether we can grow food two years after the war, but of whether we can hold this country against the extra-territorial races, of whom there are 1,300,000,000 people to the north of us. Only 30 years ago Australia was an island continent in the south Pacific, away from everybody. If the war lasts for another three years, and space is annihilated at the rate of its annihilation during the last three years, those people who live to the north of Australia will be only a matter of hours, instead of days, away from us. Prior to this war, we held the view that everything that came out of Japan was shoddy. If we are conscientious we shall confess that on the first occasion on which we met Japan in combat, we and not the Japanese were the shoddy ones; we pitted Wirraways against Zeros, with results that are well known. ""We must get down to realities. Every member of this chamber knows the history of Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, and all the other great conquerors. Eor some years I have mentioned publicly what I call the periodicity of population. Every nation in antiquity, with the exception of the Roman Empire-whic h rose three times, only to be annihilated on each occasion-passe d from the picture, and' if Ave do not apply ourselves to these propositions, we may meet a similar fate. Nations that have suffered decline can rise again. They can [3] learn Western ideas. There are such nations right on our frontiers. With a high fertility rate and an enormous capacity, they look with land-hungry gaze at our vast undeveloped spaces. Does one blame them? Inevitably, we shall have to devote ourselves to a migration policy, because we cannot breed our own population at a rate that Avill be sufficient for the good government and the adequate defence of this country. Do we propose to open the doo.r wide and. admit everybody indiscriminately, irrespective of age or physical condition ? shall If Ave do Ave are likely to bring upon ourselves the racial troubles which the United States of America had, and probably still have for all I know. This is a problem which Ave must ponder carefully. As I have shown, it takes from 25 to 40 years to build up a population, so now is the time for us to start. Although I am a bachelor, this population question is a ""baby"" of mine, which is one reason Avhy I draAv special attention to it at this my earliest opportunity. There are many aspects of this Australian proposition which require very deep consideration on our part. Short cuts, even if devised, will be found to be useless. We must have an historical concept of all that has gone before, if Ave propose to apply ourselves seriously to holding 3,000,000 square miles with 7,000,000 people. I have very little time for those Avho say that this country is not capable of expansion. Almost anything is capable of at least scientific investigation, with a view to ascertaining what the country is capable of. Returning to the matter of Australia's productivity, hoAv is it proposed to trade in the post-Avar period ? By what methods do the peoples of the world propose to trade? With Avhom are Ave going to trade? I understand that Great Britain has developed its producing power enormously, particularly in reference to primary commodities. What then are we going to do Will our surplus? Are we to give it aAvay?",33
139,Mr LEMMON,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,We have been doing so for years.,37
140,Dr GAHA,COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER,"I am glad to discover a humanist on the Government side of the chamber. If we did give our surplus away, we should, of course, earn the approbation of the rest of the world, but I should like to hear what the farmers of Australia would have to say. We shall have ample opportunity on the budget to discuss in detail many of lihe subjects to be dealt with by this Parliament. In the meantime I invite honourable members to apply themselves to the extremely acute problem 'which Australia faces in regard to population, and the great danger in which our lack of it involves us; they must disregard all the contumely and ridicule which can be levelled at the subject. This problem has not originated with me. There is an honourable member on the benches opposite who has been responsible for drawing public attention to it, but his wise words have not been hearkened to. I trust that the Government will take cognizance now of the post-war problems of housing and reconstruction, instead of waiting t ill the post-war period. Later, we shall have to face all the difficulties of rehabilitating over 1,000,000 of our people. The period between now and the cessation of hostilities will be the time to take many other important problems into our serious consideration, and among t/hem, I submit, the vital one is population.
