1,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"As tomorrow is the annual public holiday which is observed in Victoria because of the Royal Agricultural Show, has the Prime Minister any objection to fixing the time of meeting' of the House at a later hour than 2.30 p.m.?",12
2,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"If I may do so now, I move, with the concurrence of 'honourable membersThat the House, at itariding, adjourn until tomorrow at 3.30 p.m. I do not think I can a3k honourable members to postpone the hour of meeting beyond that time. Question resolved in the affirmative. INTER STATE COMMERCE. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - I wish to read some correspondence, which I shall follow with a question, addressed to the Minister for Trade and Customs. I shall read first a letter addressed to him by Mr . S. J. Jacobs, the President of the General Council of Chambers of Commerce of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is in these termsI have the honour to transmit to you the following resolution, passed at the meeting of the General Council of Chambers of Commerce of the Commonwealth of Australia, recently held in Adelaide - ""That it is in the highest degree essential to the commerce of Australia that statistics of the movements of all goods between the States should be published monthly, and that the Federal Govern. ment be respectfully asked to take the neceasary steps to procure the issue of such statistics."" The Council expressed the opinion that the statistics referred to in the resolution are essential in the interests of producers and traders, who would thereby be enabled to satisfactorily gauge the markets of the various States, and arrange supplies in relation to demand. Considerable changes in the trade of each State have necessarily followed the adoption of free commerce between the States, and without frequent publication of statistics there is much working in / the dark. I have, further, to respectfully urge that such statistics should be published in the form of quantities rather than values, which are inconsistent and, consequently, illusive. In moving the resolution referred to in that letter, Mr Jacobs is reported to have stated thatAs members were no doubt aware, at present they only get these .statistics once a year, and it was not easy always to discriminate between. Intor-State and oversea shipment. He did not think too much attention could be given to the necessity of collection and prompt publication of monthly statistics giving full details of the trade between the various States. The publication of these statistics waB absolutely essential to the producers, in order that they may know what markets they hod in the States for their produce, and thus regulate their production according to the consumption. Hitherto they had been largely indebted to the press for the supply of statistics. It was a cose of absolute necessity which hardly ' left room for discussion. To his mind the great thing was to adopt a system of statistics whereby the producer could ascertain the demand and regulate the supplies between the different States. The reply received from the Department was as follows :Adverting to my letter of the l l t h ult., in reference to yours dated' 23rd June, re publication of monthly statistics of Inter-State trade, I am directed by the Minister to inform you that the matter has been considered, but it is not deemed advisable to adopt the practice. The question I wish to ask is, why is it not deemed advisable to adopt the practice f",12
3,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Althoug h the honourable member's question is a very short one, the preamble was so long that I am not sure that I have entirely grasped the whole of what he read. My impression is that it was not deemed advisable to adopt the practice because of the expense ; but if the honourable member will give notice of his question, so that I may have an opportunity to look into the papers again, I shall be able to give him definite information on the subject. Sir EDMUNDBARTON laid upon the table the following paper :Immigration Restriction Act, Correspondence in regard to the JSeathdene case. P UBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONER'S DECISIONS.",13
4,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General if it is to be understood from his answer to a question asked last week that he intends to move the Cabinet with reference to certain decisions of the Public Service Commissioner? If so, is that an indication of political interference with that oflicer 1",13
5,Sir PHILIPEYSH,Unknown,"I think I can gauge the purport of the honourable member's question, inasmuch as several applications have been made by members of the House and by the civil servants themselves through the proper channels for the reconsideration of decisions which have been given by the Public Service Commissioner, and which have appeared, so far as the individuals affected were concerned, somewhat harsh. It was my intention, if there happened to be a generality of such cases, to seek an - interview with my colleagues as to the advisability of asking the Public Service Commissioner to review his decision. That is as far as I havegone in the expression of an opinion on the subject. I have not yet sought the interview to which I have alluded.",13
6,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,Will the Minister inform the House what process is provided in the Public Service Act for the reconin sideration of any decision of the Service Commissioner ?,13
7,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Speaking from for memory, I believe that the Public Service Acfc provides thatfchedecision of the Public Service Commissioner shall be final, the Minister remits ifcs consideration to the House. If any action is fco be taken, it will be in reference to some principle laid down, and I have not yet done more than secure a collection of the facts in respect to the complaints made by certain officers. When I fchink I have the facts sufficiently clearly before me, I may ask my colleagues to reconsider the matter. NA COMMISSIONER. PAPER . Mr R EDWARDS - Has the Minister for Trade and Customs yet received the reply of Mr MCDowall, the Queensland Electoral Commissioner, to the charges which were made against him 1 If so, will he lay it upon the table for the information of honourable members 1",13

9,Mr R EDWARDS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I am not aware. How could I knowfchat?,13
10,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I have not yet read Mr MCDowall's statement, bufc I have been told that it is a denial of 'everything fchafc has been said against him, and contains a request for an inquiry. The advisability of granting an inquiry is a question which I shall submit for the consideration of the Cabinet; afc its first meeting. I have the papers with me, but I do not think it would be a wise thing to placefchemupon the table until an inquiry has been held. In the interests of Mr MCDowall, I think it isbetter not to lay the papers on the table at present, though, personally, I have no objection to that course. I fchink the matter had better be postponed until the Cabinet decide whether or not an inquiry shall be held. QUEENSLAND DEFENCE FORCES.",13

I am not desirous of making any new practice, unless under special circumstances ; and within an hour I hope to be able to arrive at a decision. NARRABRI - WALGE TT MAI L",14

Upon inquiry the Postmaster-General has been informed fchafc the mail service referred has been running irregularly for some time past. 2. The contractors have the Deputy Postmaster-General considered that sufficient reasons had been given for gularities that have occurred, and which have Been caused by (1) insufficient time having been allowed in the time-table, except under very fa%'orable conditions ; (2) by conditions caused by the prolonged drought which has, until recently, prevailed in the district; (3) by heavy roads, since rain has fallen which the greater part of the road passes, and the cutting up of the roads by the heavy traffic in connection withfcherailway construction. 3.

Inspection of Fruit. , At the meeting of the Bendigo District Vine and .Fruit Growers' Association on Saturday a letter was received from Sir John Quick, M.P., intimating that, in compliance with the fruit-growers' request, he had interviewed the Commissioner for Customs with regard to a proposal that certificates issued by Government inspectors in reference to ""clean"" fruib intended for export in other States should be recognised by inspectors in the State to which the frui t was forwarded. He (Sir John Quick) had been informed that the Customs officials had nothing to do with the inspection of fruit, bufc if in the course of their duties tliey came across any diseased fruit, they brought it under the notice of the Agricultural Department's inspectors. It was decided to communicate witli the Minister of Agriculture, with a view to having the proposal carried into effect. 2. Is the report substantially correct ? SERVICE. 3.

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 1st September, vide page 4454) : Clause 2 Where under a law of the State, made in pursuance of the Constitution, the State is afc the commencement of this Act distributed into Electoral Divisions equal in number bo the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen bherein, those Electoral Divisions shall, until both Houses of the Parliamenb have passed a resolution approving of a proposed distribution of the Stabe into Divisions, be taken to be Divisions within the meaning of the Commonwealth Electoral Acfc 1902.",15
23,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," I have given notice of an amendment to strike out clause 2, with a view to substituting another clause, a copy of which has, I believe, been p r in t e d and circulated. It may be convenient if I explain the provision which I propose to substitute, in order to induce honourable members to come to what I consider a compromise w h i c h is fair and also consistent with the Electoral Act . The d if f i c u l ty in which the Minister finds himself a f t er having submitted the motions regarding the distributions at so late a stage is that there is no tim e with in which a redistributio n could be made under section 32 COLLECTION. of the Act if the reports and maps are referred back to the Commissioners. But that could be easily got over so far as the time is concerned-and that is the only d if f i c u l t y upon whic h the Minister has insisted-by slightly amending sections 18 and 19 of the Electoral Act so as to reduce the period during which the maps are to be exhibited from t h i r t y days to seven days. U n d e r section 18, objections or suggestions in w r it in g may be lodged with the Commissioner not. later t h a n t h i r t y days after the first publication of the proposed distribution. . It is provided in clause 19 that the Commissioner shall forthwith, after the expiration of the thirty days forward his report to the Minister. It is plain, therefore, that if we reduce the thirty-day period to seven days it will be possible tb have the whole matter reconsidered within a fortnight or three weeks, and motions can then be submitted to the House, not for the rejection of the distributions, but for their adoption as contemplated by the Act. This course would involve the least possible violation of the principles of the Act. The redistributions would be made in accordance with the A ct in every respect, except that the distributions would be exhibited for only a week prior to the, receipt of the report by the Minister. Considering that in some States not one objection was received, the publication of the distribution seems to me to be the least important part-if it can be considered an important part-of the prescriptions of Part III . of the Electoral Act, relating to the method to be followed in making the divisions. In South Australia there was not a single objection to the recommendations of the late Commissioner.",15
24,Mr VL SOLOMON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I - think there only one. It referred to Goodwood.,16
25,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I understand that no obwith jection was raised whilst the maps were ing exhibited, but that the objection was raised for the first time by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr.Batchelor, in this chamber.",16
26,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,No objection was raised within the period allowed by the Act.,16
27,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Exactly . But even if there had been a dozen objections the fact would still indicate that the electors in the constituency affected which contains 25,000 or 26,000 voters relied to a very small extent for the alteration of the divisions upon any objections they might enter during the time the maps were exhibited. I do not think that very many objections were received in New South Wales.",16
28,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"There were thirty-five together, of which fourteen were received from one electorate - promise",16
29,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"In that State the maxiall mum number of electors in a division is about 35,000, and the minimum 12,000, and, even if tliose objections were the electors in one division, instead of the whole State, they would bear a very small proportion to the whole. All these facts indicate that the prescription in the Act with regard to the maps being exhibited for thirty days is of very little importance, and honourable members will therefore see - that by adopting the course I suggest they will be making the least departure from theprinciple of uniformity embodied in the ActBy inserting a clause such as I am proposing, we should really be observing the very essence of the principle to be followed in connection with the distribution, namely, the principle of uniformity as regards the quota. The Government are asking us toignore the quota, which is the very essence not only of the distribution of members among the States, but the very essence of the method of the distribution of the States into districts for the purposes of electing representatives to this House. The Government have asked us to ignore the quota with regard to four of the States, and to thus violate the essential principle of the Act at the very inception of our work. I am afraid that if a precedent of this kind were created, it might be turned to a very mischievous account hereafter. Surely if we are entitled at this stage to wait until the conwas ditions as regards population become more settled in some divisions, it might be urged equal justice that the Act should bebesuspended when conditions become varied at a later stage. The very initial precedent of violation which we should afford, would, I am afraid, be used ' to justify the suspension of the A ct on some other occasion, perhaps, to enable the members of a future House to retain their seats. I do not for a moment allege that that is the motiveoperating with honourable members here, but the members of a future Parliament may be-so actuated, and that may be the motive attributed to us by the electors. It is at least necessary that we should appear to be> sincere and honest, and I hope that honourable members will recognise the desirability of adopting the line of least resistance, and involving the least violation of the principle of the Act, which I now suggest. The honourable member for Bland, in alreplying to an interjection made by meyesterday, seemed favourable to a comsuch as I am now suggesting. At events, he gave his adherence to theprinciple for which I am contending, and I hope that, with his assistance, I shall be ablereceived from to carry my amendment.",16
30,Mr WATSON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I expressed a doubt as to the possibility of doing what the honourable member desires within the time at our concerned disposal.,16
31,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"But if we allow for seven days' instead of thirty days' publicathink tion of the maps, ample time will be allowed for the redistributions, and for the sideration of the reports. The Alinister, himself, has - shown conclusively that the reports could be reconsidered and again presented to us. He has shown that since the report of one Commissioner was presented thousands of electors had returned to some of the New South Wales divisions.",17
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I said since the last mencement collection.,17
33,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"That makes my position lists all the stronger. He showed that there had the roll. been an addition of 2,000 electors to atotal of 14,000 in one division within a few months, and therefore there must have been such a change in the conditions which to formed the data for the Commissioner in drawing up his report as would justify him in making a redistribution approximating, at all events, to the conditions which at present obtain.",17
34,Mr WATSON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"In order to give effect the honourable and learned member's idea, the Commissioner would have to wait until the new lists were completed.",17
35,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I think that I can reprior move that difficulty. The Minister will acknowledge that the provisions of the Electoral Act have been generally adhered to by the Commissioners. We might have similar migrations of population from one part of a State to another three or six years hence, and surely we could not reasonPart ably be called upon to suspend the operato tion of the Act whilst people were shifting about from place to place. We must apply the provisions of the Act to the existing conditions, and we must not tamper with the law or violate its principles in order suit the convenience of any political party. declaresThe principles of the Act apply just as clearly now as they would do twelvedivisions months hence. The honourable member for Bland - suggested a difficulty nexion with the completion of the lists. No doubt the quota is based upon the number of electors, but if the Minister wishes to secure a new revision he can insure that revision being made expeditiously by amending section 34 of the Electoral which . provides that the electoral collected for any division must be published for the consideration of the .districts for thirty days Any difficulty in the way of notice may be easily removed by only an amendment of section 34. I do not that sections 34 and 38 are really obligatory as regards the question of imconmediate revision. My idea is that they apply only to the first roll collected after the passing of the Electoral Act, because honourable members will see that section 32 in Part V. of the Act, which deals with these Special Revison Courts, declaresThe Commonwealth Electoral Officer for each State shall, as soon as practicable after the comof this Act, prepare lists of all persons qualified and entitled to have their names placed upon the roll for the States, specifying in such the particulars required to be specified in - The provisions which follow that section in Part V . of the Act deal with the first electoral roll collected, and the Court which is undertake its revision is Galled in section 38 a "" Special Court of Revision."" Subsequently, in Part VII . of the Act, provision is made for General Revision Courts, which may be held at anytime the Minister chooses to fix by proclamation. It is only in the to case of the Special Revision Courts that the Ac t requires the rolls collected to be exhibited for thirty days. There is no provision relating to the exhibition of the rolls to the holding of General Revision Courts, which may sit at any time the Minister chooses to fix by proclamation. Therefore there need be no delay in the holding of another Revision Court for the purpose of Correcting the lists, and thus completely complying with the provisions of III . of the Electoral Act, which relates the method to be adopted in distributing the States into electoral divisions,. In order to emphasize the point that there is no obligation imposed under the Act to publish the lists for thirty days, I would refer to honourable members to section 50, which A new roll for any. division or new rolls for all in a State shall be prepared whenever directed by proclamation and in the manner in contherein specified. After the provisions as regards the first rolls and the Special Revision Courts have been exhausted, the Ac t lays it down that new rolls shall be framed whenever the * Minister thinks fit to decide, and in whatAct; ever manner he may determine by express rolls proclamation. Therefore, there can be nothing in the excuse which is relied upon ' by the Minister that it would be impossible to hold Revision Courts within the time at our disposal. Throughout the Act it is - clear that different provisions obtain as regards the collection of future rolls from those '- - which relate to the collection of the first, rolls. The first rolls differ from future rolls not only as regards the period during - which they shall beexhibited, but also in the method of their collection. There is every possibility, therefore, of the Electoral Act being complied with as regards the States which are affected by this Bill if the House be willing to adopt the course which I suggest. The principle of uniformity contemplated by the Electoral Acfc and by all Federal legislation will then be adhered to. We shall thus avoid setting the bad precedent of providing that the divisions of the smaller States are the only ones which shall comply with the conditions of the Electoral Act. Considering the extent tb which this matter has been threshed out, I do not think I need refer at greater length to the previsions of the Act. If the sections relating to the holding of Revision Courts require amendment, the Minister can easily enough introduce a clause substituting seven days for thirty days in respect of those provisions. There can be no possible excuse for refusing to comply with the terms of the Act, which are mandatory. It is abundantly clear that if we disagree with the schemes recommended by the Commissioners, we must refer them back to those officers for reconsideration. Section 22 providesIf either House of Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Commissionerfcopropose afresh distribution of the State into divisions. The word "" may "" used in the section is mandatory. Under the previous sections I am aware that if both Houses of Parliament approve of any distribution, the Governor General ""may,"" by proclamation, declare the names and boundaries of the divisions. I hold, however, that the word "" may"" as used in that section is mandatory, because in respect of the Governor General it is always used fpr "" shall."" It is futile to argue that it* is permissive. cannot maintain that the same word is not imperative when applied to the Minister under section 22.' I am aware that that is the contention of the honourable and learned member for Indi, but I respectfully submit that it will not hold water. - Mr Olynn. Wherever the word ""may"" is used for a necessary object it is obligatory on the part of the Administration to fulfil the conditions which attach to it . This Bill will not get rid of that obligation. It does not suspend the operation of those sections. It proposes to retain the divisions under which this House was constituted. At the same time it does not say that the obligation imposed by section 22 is suspended-the obligation to refer the reports - back to the Commissionersfor reconsideration. While suspending the operation of the Act as regards fonr of the larger States, and continuing the existing electoral division in them, we shall have in the smaller States conditions which are not suspended, and are inconsistent with - this Act-condition s which ought to be applied to all and which the Minister refuses to apply. I trust that the House will not consent to the suspension of some of the provisions of an Act which is supposed to be uniform. If clause 2 be negatived I shall moveThatfchefollowing new clause be inserted :"" 2A. In respect of any redistribution of a State into divisions under section twenfcy-two of the Commonwealth Electoral Acfc 1902, prior fco thirty-first March, One thousand nine hundred and four, 'seven days' shall be read for 'thirty days' in sections eighteen and nineteen offchesaid Acfc."" By cutting down the period of time from thirty to seven days all the objections put by the Minister which have reasonable force will be overcome. I trust that the honourable member for Bland, who yesterday seemedfcobe favourable to the adoption of this method as offering a fair solution of the difficulty into which the Ministry has led us, will not depart from the opinion expressed by him, and which led me to draft this provision' by way of compromise. I hope that honourable members will pave the way to the adoption of this amendment by agreeing to the omission of the clause.",17
36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," I cannot agree to this amendment. I have no desire to say anything that might be regarded as offensive; but it seems to me One thatthearaendmentis anabsurdity. Thetime specified in it would enable people resident in large centres of population to inspect the 'alterations, and to obtain all the information necessary; but it would be absolutely impossible to circulate the maps in any large State within that period. Indeed it would Electoral be impossible to distribute them over one-tenth part of a State within seven days On the last occasion we found that it was as much as we could do to exhibit the maps throughout each State and to obtain the objections within thirty days. In States such as Queensland, Western Australia, or New South Wales, we could not carry out this work under thirty days. For that reason, if for no other, I must object to the amendment.",18
37,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,My amendment is that the maps shall be exhibited for seven days after their publication in each place.,19
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,That means seven days after they have been issued from the Lands Department.,19
39,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Seve n days after the first publication.,19
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I take the proposed clause to mean seven days after their publication by the Lands Department. Immediately after their issue by the Department they would have to be distributed throughout the length and breadth of each State, in order to enable the electors to examine them. We should also have to advertise the fact that the maps were on exhibition in order to call public attention to them, and to enable objections to be lodged by those who desire to make them.",19
41,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The amendment refers to seven days after the first publication not in any place but in "" the "" place.",19
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,But the maps would not reach some of these places within two or three weeks after their publication.,19
43,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,They must reach each place at some time or other.,19
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,It would take a least a fortnight for the maps to reach certain places.,19
45,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I do not think the honourable member is serious.,19
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I am perfectly serious. I do not think the honourable and learned member knows what it is to be called upon to distribute these maps throughout the length and breadth of a great State.,19
47,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Why did the Minister delay so long in bringing these matters before' the House ?,19
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"There has been no delay. I have no desire to say anything that might tend to prolong the debate; but I have abundant information to show that, notwithstanding all the vicious assertions ' [2 SEPT., 1903.] Divisions Bill. 4505 which have been made against the Government, there has not been one day's loss of time since we entered upon the work last year. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, said that these particular provisions of the Electoral A ct were mandatory; that the word "" may"" was peremptory and really meant ""shall."" He compared the use of that word in sections IS and 19 to its appearance in other provisions in the Act ; but if he will refer again to the Act he will see that in most of the other cases which he cited it refers not tofcheMinistei' but to the Governor General.",19
49,Mr GLYNN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I said so. Sir WILLIAM LYNE,-This quest on has now been debated for many days, and the same arguments and assertions have been repeated ad nauseam. It is very necessary that the Bill should be dealt with at once, in order that we may be able to complete the preparation of the lists and circulate them. A considerable time will be occupied in completing and circulating the lists, in holding the Revision Courts, and in making all the preparations necessary for holding the general election, and it is undesirable that this work should be delayed for one moment. Two or three weeks have elapsed since the first motion relating to the schemes of distribution was submitted to the House, and honourable members of the Opposition appear to forget that every day's delay may give rise to complications. I hold, and I think that the House will agree with me, that the honourable and learned member's proposal cannot now be carried out. We have gone as far as we can by adopting the States divisions and making them Commonwealth electorates. The honourable and learned member advanced no new argument in support of his proposal, but said that the honourable member for Bland had made some reference to the desirableness of referring the rejected distributions back to the Commissioners. I do not think that that honourable member intended it to be inferred from his remarks that he would support the adoption of that course at the present stage; but in any event the Government do not propose to accept fchis amendment. Much time has .been unnecessarily wasted in dealing with this question, and I trust that honourable members will realise that we should settle it without further delay. It is quite impossible to accept the amendment, and the Government intend to adhere to the clause as it stands.",19
50,Mr THOMSON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The honourable gentleman said that the new lists would interfere with this proposal.,20
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The new lists have not yet been completed. Even if these divisions were returned tomorrow to the Commissioners nothing could be done by them. The Chief Electoral Officer must first obtain the complete lists from the State authorities and carefully examine and revise them. In Victoria agents have recently been collecting the names of voters, and a number of claims have been sent in by them. These applications must necessarily be examined with care, for it has been found that a great many of the names submitted to the Electoral Officer are those of persons under age. In some cases it has been discovered that the applicants are not more than sixteen years of age. It will thus be' seen that unless the various names submitted by agents are carefully examined names may be placed on the lists which should not appear upon them. Another point to be remembered is that a collection of names has recently been made in New South Wales, and that we have been able to obtain but little information from the State officials. In order to confirm the statement - which I made yesterday, I had an interview this morning with the Chief Electoral Officer, and inquired whether, in accordance with my instructions, he had made a 'personal application to the State officials to be supplied with information when in Sydney last week. He informed me that he applied at the State Office and was told that the lists were with the Government Printer. He then applied at the Government Printing Office for these lists, but was informed that they were so. cut up and distributed that it was absolutely impossible to supply them. Certain honourable members stated yesterday that they had obtained complete lists from the State Ofiice.",20
52,Mr THOMSON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Complet e lists of certain electorates.,20
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I have a copy of a telegram which was sent yesterday the honourable member opposite to the Electrol toral Officer in Sydney. It reads as lows :Kindly wire total number, males and females, electors on new roll for Darling, Barrier, and Eiverina. That does not look as though the figures produced yesterday were as reliable as they should be. I have told honourable members of the difficulties with which the Chief Electoral Oflicer has had to contend, and I think I am safe in saying that if the proposed distributions were returned to the Commissioners tomorrow they would not be in a position to deal with the new names in less than a fortnight. In my opinion the Chief Electoral' Officer should have been given more information by the State Electoral Officer. .",20
54,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The honourable member did not ask the State officer for information.,20
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The State officer has been asked for information, but the Commonwealth officer has up to the present time received very little from him. As it would be at least a fortnight before the Commissioners could get to work if the proposed distributions were returned to them, it is practically impossible to carry out the proposal of the honourable member.",20
56,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," The Minister misunderstands the position. All we have done so far is to formally disapprove of certain proposed distributions, and now that the Government has introduced this Bill to make it lawful to hold the forthcoming elections under the old divisions, we have for the first time an opportunity to move that the proposed distributions be referred back to the .Commissioners.",20
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"An amendment to that effect was moved when one of the motions disapproving of a proposed distribution was before the House, but it was withdrawn.",20
58,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Tliat does not affect the present position. A subject of this kind, which has stirred the community to its depths, should receive a most searching investigation, and as honourable members on this side of the Chamber have been asking in vain for information, and obdurate Ministers are deaf to our cry, it is only to be expected that we should try to make our voices heard by the electors. The Minister has tried to defend the Deby partment which was recently under his conby throwing the onus of blame on to folother persons. It was known, however, that, under the Constitution, half the members of the Senate must present themselves for re-election at the end of three years after the inauguration of Federation, and that probably, to save expense, the members of the House of Representatives would seek re-election at the same time. But the history of the honourable gentleman's electoral administration has . been a history of blunders from beginning to end, so that the Electoral Office is in a state of absolute chaos. I do not say that there were no difficulties to be overcome. There must be difficulties in dealing with a complicated matter like this, but as the proper representation of the people is of such importance, the Minister should have given the closest attention to the subject, especially as the duties of his Department were not very onerous. Now that we ask that, the proposed distributions of which the House has disapproved may be returned to the Commissioners, we are told that there is no time to alter them, although the Minister himself stated that there would be time if prompt steps are taken. The objection to the - proposed distributions, taken by Ministers and their supporters, is that the drought caused a great exodus of population from the country districts to the towns or more settled coastal districts ; but that that we now require is a review of the position, taking into consideration that fact, it is surely not necessary to set the whole of the machinery of the Electoral Ac t in operation again. The objections to the proposed distributions have been dealt with by the Commissioners, and all they need consider now is the alteration of boundaries necessary to meet the changes effected by the migration to which reference has been made. That being so, will any one tell me that an adjustment cannot be made within seven days 1 In my opinion the objection to which I have referred has been raised by the Government merely to fortify their position. As they were able to obtain a majority under the old divisions, they think, on the principle that the devil you know is better than the devil you do not know, that they have a better chance of being returned again with a majority if the boundaries are left as they are than if they are altered. lieve that honourable members came to the conclusion that certain unfairness had been perpetrated, especially to the country districts, owing to the peculiar conditions. Those honourable members, like my honourable friend the member for Gippsland, do not, I am sure, for a moment desire to see the principle of the Act controverted, but, only as a matter of expediency in point of time, deem it necessary to vote for the proposal of the Government. If that honourable member, and those who think with him, could be told that the original procedure, under which these schemes might bereturnedto the Commissioners for revision, could be carried out in time, and, from their point of view, substantial justice done to the country districts, I am sure they would a thousand times rather take that course than the legally unconstitutional course which the Government are trying to force through both Houses of Parliament.",20
59,Mr A MCLEAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"So far as Yictoria is concerned, I do not think that anything like the whole of the people who were driven from the country districts by the drought have yet returned, though they are returning.",21
60,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"That is a very difficult matter to determine; and, as I said before, it is, to my mind the crux of the whole question. There must be anomalies under any conditions, because no man can map out electoral districts and as all give a system satisfactory to everybody. That is the very essence of the principle of this part of the Electoral Act. We felt that nobody could be fully satisfied, and we determined, under these circumstances, not to allow politicians to so fix boundaries as to exactly suit their own convenience.",21
61,Mr A MCLEAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I was opposed to that proposal, and in favour of the Government and Parliament taking the responsibility.",21
62,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I am taking the Ac t as it was passed by a majority of this House. We are shaving down the point upon which the difficulties have occurred. Honourable members who are supporting the Government agree that since the drought was practically broken, the people who migrated have been returning in large numbers to their original residences. That has been going on for month after month. When is the point to be reached when the people can be said to have all returned ? The principle I enunI be- ciate I am perfectly sure is * sound in an enormous issue such as we have before us. Even if the circumstances were different, and the original divisionof the electorates understate arrangements was better than it is though I say it is more anomalous than that: propounded by the Commissioners - we; ought not on any consideration, in dealing with a question on which the whole voting power of the people depends, to break a law by passing another measure unless it is justified by' overwhelming argument-no thing less should induce the House to practically crucify such a principle. It is very difficult to appeal .to empty benches.",21
63,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I desire, Mr Chairman, to draw your attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.]",22
64,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I do not think it is necessary to say much more at present with regard to the attitude of the Government. It is not often that we find a Government, by an act of the Legislature, practically passing a vote of censure on themselves. There is nd doubt, however, that this Bill is an absolute vote of censure on the Department for Home Affairs. It is an acknowledgment of weakness- a confession that in the most serious business the Minister had to entertain, he was too feeble for the difficulties of the situation. I do not desire to make any imputation, but I think the Minister is on tenterhooks between two positions. Either there has been a great deal of weakness and incapacity, or it suited the Minister that the Electoral A ct should not be carried out in its entirety. I do not know how the action of the Government is going to be justified to the people of Australia. I am not one who places enormous reliance on mere scientific divisions or upon quotas; but that has nothing to do with the question before the House. An Act was solemnly passed in this House, after the mostcareful consideration-a n A ct which said in effect that members must keep their hands off the division of the electorates. We have now, through causes which show absolute incapacity on the part of the Home Department, been obliged, from the point of view of honourable members who support the Government, to consider a measure which, after nearly three years of our existence as a Commonwealth, takes us back to what we considered to be a tentative arrangement-to divisions which no one ever thought would be needed for another election. Whatever may be the result of the next election-and I do not care whether the election favours our side or the other side - the people of Australia must feel that the very institutions under which the democracy recordsets vote and by which the majority are supposed to rule has been tampered with by the guardians of the Constitution. AVe have to look forward to a period of two or three years during which it may be said by any man in the street that those who are legislating, presumably in the interests of the Commonwealth, have attained their .positions by the absolute surrender of an important principle deliberately adopted by this Parliament.",22
65,Mr BROWN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," The Minister complained of the number of sittings that had been occupied in discussing the proposed distributions, and accused some honourable members of wasting time. That charge cannot lie against me, because, through ill-health, I have so far given silent votes upon the motions submitted. But I do not feel disposed to allow this measure to pass .without saying a few words to indicate my reason for having voted against the rejection of the proposed distributions. The Minister who introduced the Electoral Act said that it was founded on the principle of equal representation of which I am a'strong supporter, and it is because I believe that the present proposal involves a departure from that principle, which may be of amorepermanent character than at present appears, that I am opposed to it . I can quite understand the honourable member for Gippsland supporting a Bill of this character, because he is opposed to the principle of equal representation. He considers that the country divisions should have a preference over thecity electorates. He believes that the value of a vote is to be gauged by the influence which it exercises on legislation.",22
66,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I must call attention to the state of the Ministerial Benches, Mr. Chairman. I think that we, are at least entitled to have a. few members in attendance. [Quorum formed],",22
67,Mr BROWN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The honourable member for Gippsland contended that we should confer upon the electors in the country relatively greater voting power, because the community of interest among the city electors, and the greater facilities afforded for recording their votes, gave them a great advantage. I do not see how it is possible to estimate the value of a vote upon that basis. The only principle upon which I conceive it possible to confer the franchise is by giving every adult the right to vote, and by so distributing the electorates that the voting power of each individual shall be as nearly as possible equal. That is the principle involved in the Electoral Act, and from which we are now asked to 1 make a departure. We are told that drought which has recently prevailed throughout a great part of New South Wales ancl Victoria has resulted in driving voters from the country districts into thecities, and that when normal conditions are restored they will d r if t back to their former places, residence. It is suggested, therefore, that the distributions made by the Commissioners would involve serious inequalities. I should be perfectly willing to support the Governable ment if I thought they aimed at securing for every vote an equal value, but I believe that their proposal will intensify the equality 'which would obtain if the distribuverted, tions proposed by the Commissioners were carried out. I feel very strongly upon another point. When we were discussing the suspension of the fodder duties with a view to afford relief to the drought-stricken settlers, we found it difficult to persuade the Government that any drought existed. The honourable member for Gippsland agricultural. told us that we were endeavouring to secure a modicum of free-trade by a the state of the Committee. subterfuge, and the honourable member formed.'] for Moira informed us that we were squealing for assistance - which would not have been needed if ordinary foresight had been exercised by the settlers in drought-stricken districts. Now we find that Ministers have a very different story tell. As soon as it was discovered that proposed distributions of the electorates seriously affect some members of the Ministhat try and their followers, they contended no faildistribution could be made, because the drought had caused an exodus of poputricts lation from a large area of the inland disyears tricts. They found no fault with the New South Wales and Victorian Comregards missioners, but some suggestion of proper influence was made in connection the work of the Commissioner for Queensland. It is admitted by the Government, who us to reject the work of the Electoral Commissioners, that the reports of officers are based upon the figures with which they had to deal, and are in accordyear, ance with the Act under which they required to work. Whilst I admit that, a certain extent, drought conditions influenced the removal of the population from the country, I do not agree that normal conditions will so re-adjust matters that the electoral divisions which the Government desire us to accept, will reflect, even in a reasonable degree, the principle the giving to every vote in the State, as nearly as possible, an equal value. No doubt, since the drought has broken up, there has been a considerable return of population from the city to the country. This is evidenced in the case of the of Darling electorate, which suffered from the effects of the drought quite, as acutely as did any other constituency in New South Wales. As a result there was a considerexodus of population from that district. Yet, according to the figures which were quoted by the leader of the Opposition, and in the accuracy of which has not been controthere has recently been an increase of more than a thousand male voters in that electorate. That division is now only about 140 males short of the voting power which it possessed when the Federal elections took place. Of course, a wide distinction must be drawn between mining districts and those whose interests are either pastoral or 0",22
68,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,1 beg to call attention to [Quorum,23
69,Mr BROWN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Whils t the people who were driven by drought from the mining districts of the States will rapidly return to the them under the altered conditions which now obtain, that remark is not applicable to' to the same extent to agricultural and grazing the districts. The return of population to the would latter will be much more gradual. I regret in New South Wales sufficient inducethat ment has not been forthcoming to attract people to the agricultural and pastoral disin which they resided eight or ten ago, before the localities in question were afflicted by drought. I know that as thewestern parts of New South imWales that remark is specially appliwith cable. There has been a gradual exodus of population from those districts during ask the past eight or ten years. The Minister, therefore, has not merely to provide those for an abnormal condition of things which will remedy itself within the next or within two or throe years: For were example, in 1901 the drought-stricken to divisions of Darling, Barrier, Riverina, have Canobolas, Robertson, Bland, Macquarie, Gwydir, and Hume contained 96,505 male voters. According to the returns of last year, upon which the Electoral Commissioner based his divisions, they contained only 89,915 male electors- a decrease of of 6,595. But the revised returns, which were prepared towardsthe close of last year, and at the beginning of the present year, show that at the present time there are 94,104 male electors in those divisions, so that the decrease, comparing the latest figures with the number of voters which the divisions contained when the last Federal election took place, represents only 2,406 voters.",23
70,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Do they comprise the drought-stricken districts?,24
71,Mr BROWN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,They were more or less drought-stricken.,24
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The electorate Hume was not drought-stricken.,24
73,Mr BROWN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"If the honourable gentleman travels through his electorate he will find that the people residing there suffered severely from the drought. W it h the exception of Orange, which is favourably situated, all parts of my electorate suffered severely, and the further west I travel the greater, I find, have been the ravages of the drought. As compared with tlfe number of electors in the Hume division at the last general elections, I find that, when the Commissioner framed his scheme, there was a shortage of only 583 male voters, and, according to the latest returns, there is now a shortage of only 108 male voters. The same remark applies to all the other electorates. Of the nine electorates which I have named, those which show to the best advantage are Darling and Barrier. The^number of male voters in Darling is only about 140 less than was the number on the rolls at the last general elections, while the number of male voters in Barrier is only about 149 short. We have to remember that the divisions on which the first Federal Parliament was elected were based upon the principle of one man one vote, and that we have now extended the franchise to women. The extension of the franchise to the women of the Commonwealth is responsible for the great difference in the number of electors in the existing States divisions, as compared with the electorates framed by the Commissioners. In the electorates I have mentioned the returns show that there is a shortage of only 2,309 male voters as compared with the number on the rolls at the last general elections ; but, so far as the female voters are concerned, there is a remarkable disparity between those divisions and the city and suburban constituencies. We find, according to the figures which Mr Houston had for his guidance when preparing his scheme of distribution, that there were from 10,000 up to 17,000 females in each of the fourteen electorates comprising large centres of population, while there were from 8,000 down to 4,000 in each of the twelve country electorates. . In the electorate of Darling, for example, there were only 4,189 female voters, in Riverina 5,571, and Barrier 5,577, while in the electorate of Lang there were 17,500, in the electorate of Parkes 17,776, and in the electorate of North Sydney 17,697. The fact that we have exof tended the franchise to women is responsible for the great difference between the conditions' which prevailed when the Government of New South Wales prepared the first Federal Divisions, and those which obtained when the Commissioner was required to make his distribution. I hold that, in this respect, no removal of abnormal drought conditions will make any alteration. These facts must be taken into consideration. If we have two or three good seasons the Minister will find that, if he desires to adhere to the principles underlying the legislation which his Government has succeeded in passing, a very radical alteration in the electoral divisions of New South Wales will be necessary. Believing, as I thoroughly do, in the principle of one adult one vote, I fail to see any reason for giving voting power practically to gum trees and acres. That is what in effect we shall do if we depart from the principle of the Electoral Act. What do the Government propose to do 1 They have asked the House to reject the scheme submitted by the Commissioner appointed by them to divide New South Wales into electoral divisions, on the ground that the drought conditions, of which we are asked to believe'they were not cognizant until the report was submitted, seriously affected the population of country districts. They assert, however, that as soon as the effects of the drought have disappeared many people who were forced to leave the country districts will return, and that the 'old State divisions will more truly give expression to the principle of one adult one vote than would the divisions framed by the Commissioner. If I believed that assertion I should heartily support the action of the Government. But as I consider that in dealing with this question factors other than the recent drought have to be borne in mind-that the extension of the franchise to women has really brought about a great difference in numbers - and as I desire that the spirit of the Electoral Act shall be observed, I feel bound to record my vote against the Ministerial'proposal. Do the Government propose to observe the spirit of the law? They have rejected the report of the Commissioner for New Soutli Wales on the ground that it does not give expression to the principles of the Electoral Act, inasmuch as it fails to take into consideration the abnormal drought conditions which prevailed in New South Wales, and they urge us to pass a piece of legislation that will enable them to revert to the old State divisions at the next general elections. I contend, however, that those divisions do not and will not give expression to the principle of one vote one value which underlies their legislation. Whafc do the Government .propose to do with respect to the Electoral Ac t which they have passed ? Do they intend fco abrogate the principle of one vote one value by resorting to arbitrary States divisions which were framed without regard to it ? Let them come out into the open, and let us have a straight-out fight. If they believe that the drought has been responsible for the inequality in numbers in many of the electorates to which they refer, and that as soon as its effects have disappeared people who left the country districts will return to them,. and thus enable the Commissioners to divide the States into divisions that will be in accord with our legislation, let them boldly say so. Do the Government propose to give effect to the legislation which was enacted by Parliament at their instance, by returning the proposed distributions to the Commissioners, or do they wish to abrogate the provisions of the Act by providing for the retention of the existing divisions, and allowing the present inequalities to continue ? If the Government proposed to carry into effect the letter and spirit of the legislation which we have passed, I would support them, but as it seems to me that they intend to abrogate it, I shall vote against them.",24
74,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," As by this Bill we are being asked to abrogate the visions pf the Electoral Act, attention of honourable members to the wording of section 12, wherein it is provided thatEach State shall he distributed into Electoral Divisions equal in number to the number of bers of the Bouse of Representatives to be therein, and one Member of the House of Representatives shall be chosen in each Division. Under that provision distributions were made by Commissioners, and two of those distributions were approved of by the House, because they could not be said to conflict with the interests of honourable members. The four other distributions, however, were disapproved of, although no adequate reason was given for that course, because even the Minister did not challenge the capacity or impartiality of the Commissioners. The Government and those who support them put forward the excuse that there has been adrought; but it has been shown that the New South Wales Commissioner made a very big allowance on that score. The fact that there was a drought is an extraordinary discovery for the Ministry to make, seeing that when it was actually in existence they were unable to realise the fact, because they wished to wring .£500,000 out of the pockets of those who were suffering through it .",25
75,Mr HUME COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Is the honourable member in order in speaking froin the position which he now occupies, since standing order 48 says thatThe front seats, Dearest to the right hand of the Speaker, shall be reserved for Ministers holding office under the Crown ?",25
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"May I call your attention, Mr Chairman, to the fact that members of the Government are not now present to occupy the seats referre'd to in the standing order, and that when Ministers are here, they frequently sit in other parts of the chamber. I am aware that it is inconvenient to' have honourable members of the Opposition sitting on ""the front seats nearest to the right hand of the Speaker but what are we to do ? We rise to address the Committee, and find ourselves confronted with rows of empty benches. Therefore, in sheer desperation, and to emphasize the fact that when this most important question is under discussion, members of the Government and their supporters do not think it worthwhile to be present, some of us crossed the floor this afternoon, and protook our seats in the places usually, reI - draw the served for Ministers.",25
77,Sir WILLIAMMCMILLAJT,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I would alsosuggest, Mr Ohairman, that, owing to thefrequent changes in the constitution of the GovernMemment which have taken place recently, you chosen may not know that the honourable member for Werriwa is not now a member of the Cabinet.",25
78,The CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"It is not the practice of the Chair to interfere with honourable members in regard to a matter of this kind ; but, as my attention has been directed to the standing order, I must rule that honourable members are not in order in occupying, seats reserved for Ministers.",26
79,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I might have saved you the trouble of ruling, Mr Chairman, by pointing out that, as I was addressing the Chair, I was standing, and therefore could not be held to be occupying a seat. Since the members of the Government, and those who sit behind them, who should be the' strongest supporters of the law, are desirous of abrogating its provisions, it is only seemly that the members of the Opposition, who wish to see the law carried into effect, should take their places. The Minister in charge of the Bill seems to object to the discussion which we have had, and his attitude reminds me of a scene in an old play, in which a number of rogues complained to the King that they were, forced to carry on their felonious proceedings at night-time, because, if they thieved during the hours of daylight, the police would catch them, while even in the small hours of the morning they were liable to molestation. The Minister should not complain of waste of time, since he - was able to get the second reading of this important measure carried during one sitting,' though only because those who are in favour of it did not see fit to enlighten the House as to the reasons which actuated them in voting for it . The Electoral Act having provided for the distribution of each State into divisions, goes on to say in section 15 thatFor the purposes of this Acfc a quota shall ascertained in each State as follows :The whole number of electors in each State, nearly as can be ascertained, shall be divided the number of Members of the House of Representatives to be chosen therein. Until rolls are compiled all persons qualified have their names placed ou a roll shall be deemed to be electors forfchepurposes offchisParfc Aot. The Commissioners, however, are allowed making any distribution toadopt a margin of allowance, to be used ever necessary, bufc in no case shall such be departed from to a greater extentfchanonetiffch more or one-fifth less. The Bill before us does not repeal those visions. All it does is to provide that electoral divisions made under the law of a State shall be taken to be divisions within the meaning of the Electoral Act. That being so, if the measure is .passed as it stands, I shall challenge in the High Court the right of any honourable member elected under it to take his seat in this Chamber.",26
80,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The honourable member will provide plenty of work for the lawyers.,26
81,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"As I haye pointed out before, a large part of our legislation seems to be framed to give work to the lawyers. Unless we repeal sections 15 and 16 we shall find ourselves in a difficulty. Clause 1 of the Bill readsThis Acfc ma}' be cited as the Electoral Divisions Acfc 1903, and shall be construed and read as one with the Commonwealth Electoral Acfc 1902. There will be some little difficulty in reading and construing the Bill with the Electoral Act, unless sections 15 and 16 are repealed. Is it not perfectly clear that it is impossible for us to comply with the requirements of sections 15 and 16 if we adopt the distributions made under the States Electoral Acts 1 Therefore, our best course would be to repeal these two sections, and at a later stage I shall take steps in that direction. No doubt the Bill as it stands is an ingenious device on the part of the Ministers to accomplish their end without allowing the public to become , acquainted with what is really being done. The intention is to circumvent sections 15 and 16, but whether that intention can be carried out in the manner proposed is a matter for argument. The High Court, might hold that clause 2 is mandatory, and that it overrides the sections of the Act to which I have been referring, but on the other hand they might conceive it to be their duty to he give effect to the provisions of the Act, and to regard the clause in this Bill as useless and as mischievous. Over three months ago I by pointed out what was likely to occur. I was then told that I was wrong to accuse to the Government of improper designs in regard to the distributions, but events have of fchisproved the correctness of my view, and have shown that the indignation of the in Minister at my repeated suggestions that the distributions would not be carried out whenwas merely simulated. I am pleased to quota think that although some honourable .members are bent upon voting for the clause, provery few indeed have the courage to defend the it. The Minister now contends that there would not befcimeto refer the reports back to the Commissioners. Three weeks ago he said the exact opposite. At that time thirty days were required for the publication of the redistributions, and another thirty days had to elapse before the Revision Court could be held. The effect of the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, would be to reduce the sixty days to fourteen days, so that there would be a saving of forty-six days. Only twenty-one days have elapsed since the Minister made his first statement, and although a net saving of twenty-five clays would be effected under the proposal of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, the Minister still raises the time difficulty. Many honourable members in this House are acting in utter disregard of principle, but I trust that Parliament may yet refuse to stultify itself in the way now proposed. There would be an end to all honestyin public life if the professions of honourable members in this matter proved to be utterly untrustworthy. It is only by adhering to those great moral principles that form the very basis of our civilization that we can carry on the operations of every-day life. AVe are now asked to act in defiance of a law to which ""we ourselves assented. ' When I see the way in which the Ministry can sometimes induce men who are otherwise honourable to do something which is absolutely and entirely wrong, I am led to reflect how much care oughtfcobe exercised in the constitution of a Government.",26
82,The CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I must ask the honourable and learned member not to discuss the motives of Ministers or of honourable members.,27
83,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I regret that in Parliament I cannot express in plain language my idea of what the Ministry have done. I recognise that the proper place to do that is outside. I shall certainlyexpress my opinion of their action upon the public platform, and I venture to say that for so doing not one of them will institute an action for libel against me. AVhat they propose constitutes such an absolute contravention of the law which was enacted by this Parliament that the more one examines it the more one sees how utterly wrong it is. Of course, I can understand the honourable member for Gippsland objecting to any alteration being made in the existing boundaries. But I hold that Parliament having enacted a certain law, it is our duty to obey it, and to insist that it shall be carried out in its integrity. If the excuse urged by the honourable member were sufficient, it would justify a man in breaking every law that has been enacted. A greater outrage upon the electors of Australia has never been perpetrated. The worse feature in connection with the whole affair is that the people generally do not realise the importance which attaches to the exercise of the rights whichfcheyenjoy. If in Austialia every elector had had to fight for his right to exercise a voice in the selection of Parliamentary representatives, he would guard it much more jealously than he does. Under the proposals of the Government, 100,000 electors in New South Wales will be deprived of their votes. No one can deny that that is the effect of the legislation proposed, because it is admitted that in the State in question, 213,000 electors will return only the same number of representatives to this House as do 111,000. I trust that the action taken by Mr Reid to draw attention to the tactics which have been resorted to upon the present occasion will bear good fruit. To iny mind, the Minister for Trade and Customs must be a very close disciple of Governor Gerry of Massachusetts. If the electors of the Commonwealth do not hurl out of power those who assent to these proposals, it will be a bad outlook for our future Parliaments.",27
84,The CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The honourable and learned member is again transgressing the rules of debate. He must not discuss the action of Ministers.,27
85,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I understood your ruling to be that improper motives must not be attributed to them. I must be at perfect liberty to discuss the action of any Minister, otherwise there would be an end to all discussion. If the Ministry are not prepared to accept the divisions recommended by Mr . Houston, let them call for a fresh distribution, but by all means let us observe the provisions of the Electoral Act. I wish that the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, who, as Minister for Trade and Customs, insisted that the law should be obeyed, were as imperative in that direction upon the present occasion. If that had been the point upon which he severed his connection with the Ministry, I should honour him for it .",27
86,The CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I must again ask the honourable and learned member not to transgress the rules of debate.,28
87,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"In order to show the hollowness of the Ministerial argument, I - would point out that section 50 of the Commonwealth Electoral A ct provides thatA new roll for any division, or new rolls for all divisions in a State, shall be prepared whenever directed by proclamation and in the manner therein specified. Thus it is absolutely within the power of the Minister to obtain a new roll practically up to within a few days of the general elections. Section 52 provides thatRolls shall be printed whenever the Minister so directs. It is therefore within the power of the Minister to obtain fresh rolls at any time, and he should take the responsibility for any delay that has occurred in dealing with this matter. By all means let the blame rest upon the proper shoulders. Whatis to become of Executive Government if a Ministry is to accept no responsibility for its action ? If the rolls that are now being compiled are not being prepared in a proper way, the blame must rest with the Minister. It may be that'be has made an unwise selection of officers to carry out the work. If that be so, he should dismiss them at once. Instead of doing anything of the kind, however, he is seeking now to do these officers greater honour. If they have been guilty of one-tenth of the charges which he makes against them, they should be dismissed with ignominy from the service. Section 53 of the Electoral Act provides thatSupplemental rolls, setting out additions and alterations since the last print, shall also be printed immediately after the holding of each Revision Court and. immediately previous to a general election. The House foresaw that some delay might take place in the preparation of the rolls, and it therefore expressly provided for the printing of supplemental rolls. Can any honourable member, after his attention has been drawn to these provisions, say that we have not time to return the various rejected distributions to the Commissioners, and to deal with revised schemes before the next general election t In view of these provisions in the Electoral Act can it be said that the action of the Government has been due to a desire to study the interests of the electors ?- Then, again, section 55 provides thatNew names may be added to the roll pursuant to(a) Claims, (6) Applications*to transfer, (c) Lists prepared by the returning officer for each division; while it is set forth in section 57 thatIf the claim is in order,fchereturning officer or registrar shall, pursuant tofcheclaim, immediately enter the claimant's name, and the particulars relating to him, on the roll, and shall file the claim. It will thus be seen that there is no necessity for any delay. Any elector, no matter where he may be residing, may apply, at practically the last moment, to have his name placed on the roll. Lists could be prepared a month before the day of election, and exhibited in public places; and if any elector found that his name had been omitted, he would be able to at once apply to have the omission rectified.",28
88,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,That would not be a very easy thing to do in the country.,28
89,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"In view of the sections I have read, the Minister's argument falls to the ground. The honourable gentleman said that he was led to ask the House to reject the schemes relating to the distribution of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia in the interests of the people, and that many country electorates were deserted by hundreds of people in consequence of the drought. We find, however, that the number of male voters on the electoral lists is practically the same as the numberon the rolls compiled three years ago. As the honourable member for Canobolas has shown, there is now a shortageof only some 140 male voters in the electorate of Riverina, and a shortage of something like 120 male voters in Barrier.",28
90,Mr KNOX,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Hav e all the lists been exhibited?,28
91,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Yes ; and I am informed that further additions have recently been made, with the result that the discrepancy is now less than it was when the distribution of New South Wales was carried out. The Government are proposing, however, that we should abrogate the main principles of our Electoral law. Why should honourable members pretend that they favour a certain principle by passing a law to give effect to that principle, and then support the adoption of a course which will be wholly contrary to it? Why should the Minister say that he believes in the principle of one vote one value when he is asking the House to act in a way that will render it impossible to give effect to it? If he objects to the law as it stands, he should seek not to defy it, but to have it amended. He should not, as a member of the Executive, refuse to cany out the law as it stands. When a Minister declines to carry out the provisions of an Act, he is, in effect, making.law instead of administering it. If we revert to the existing divisions in New South Wales and Victoria, the women of those States will reap very little advantage from the extension of the franchise to them. I have never held that wonderful reforms are likely to follow the extension of the franchise to women. I was never strongly in favour of that principle; but, inasmuch as we have provided for it, it is not for us now to depart from that provision in our Electoral law, unless we boldly declare that we consider a mistake has been made, and proceed straight way to amend the Act in that direction. Let us do boldly what some honourable members are now secretly endeavouring to do. The Minister is secretly endeavouring to bring about a position of affairs under which the extension of the franchise to women in certain States will be of no real advantage to them. Are we to go on ' in this way ? Are honourable members to stultify themselves merely because they consider that they must stand by the Ministerial proposal, whether it be right or wrong ? If it is to be a question of the Ministry, right or wrong, let us go before the country on that issue. Let us say that we go before the people, not as men able to think for ourselves, but as a mere body of automatons. There are many honourable members sitting behind the Government who I feel satisfied do not approve of what is being done, but are so subject to party discipline that they are becoming mere marionettes.",28
92,Mr KENNEDY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Part y discipline is a bad thing.,29
93,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"It is when it leads men to act against their conscience, and to break the pledges which they made to the electors. Is it not time that we endeavoured to bring about a change ? Any honourable member who, after his election, has been led by study or otherwise to change strong views held by him in regard to any particular question should resign his seat rather than vote against a principle on which he was returned to Parliament. Otherwise, what is to become of our Parliamentary institutions ?",29
94,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,It depends upon the lives we live.,29
95,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"As long as a man keeps his word, I care not what he does. A man might commit technical offences against the law, but as long as they were not offences against the moral sense of the community, I should not object. I object, however, to any departure from the principle of truth. In this respect we should set the highest example to the people. Are we doing so ? Could there be better evidence that we are not than the fact that scarcely any honourable member has spoken in defence, of the action of the Government ? Indeed I would rather not have heard any speech at all than the remarks of one honourable member, because they lowered him in my esteem. If honourable members on this side of the Chamber had been ready to break their faith, they could, on two or three occasions, have turned the Government out of office. But, although they considered the continuance of Ministers in office an evil which was not to be counterbalanced by the good to be derived from any of the measures they proposed, yet, as they had professed themselves in favour of those measures, they gave the Ministry the support necessary to have them placed on the statute-book. If people generally ceased to act according to their belief as to what was right, what would become of all government and all civilization ?Truth is the basic principle underlying all religions, the very light shining from the countenance of the Almighty. Since we have solemnly announced our belief in great principles, and embodied them in a statute, we should not go back upon them. What the Minister should have done was to say"" The rolls are not ready, so the proper distributions cannot be made, and as the Ministerial head of the Department I take the blame upon myself."" If he had done that, we should have known-how to act. He tells us in effect, however, that the rolls are correct, and that everything is prepared, but that the proposed distributions will not suit some of the Ministerial supporters. Could there be a worse reason for disapproving of them ? No doubt every honourable member, to make sure of his own election, would like to represent a constituency consisting of one person. But we should be careful lest we come to be called the second "" Rump"" Parliament. Honourable gentleman will rememberthat in Cromwell's time a Parliament so-called tried to provide that it should exist for ever, and honourable members who are supporting the Bil l are practically actuated by the same desire as actuated the members of that Parliament. It is with the greatest regret that I have seen honourable members so blinded by party considerations that tliey are ready to vote for what they believe to be wrong. I intend, in order that there shall be no incongruity between the Bill and the Electoral Act, to move an amendment providing for the repeal of sections 15 and 16, so that the intention of the Legislature may be 'made manifest.",29
96,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," I shall vote for the amendment, and I shall do so out of fidelity to the Electoral Act, which was introduced and carried through Parliament by the Government of which I had the honour to be a member. As regards some of its most important principles, it was agreed to with practical unanimity by the members of botli branches of the Legislature.",30
97,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I draw attention, Chairman, to the state of the Committee. I am quite sure that the deliverance which we are about to hear will be worthy of a proper audience. [Quorum formed.]",30
98,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The two principles to which I specially refer are those of oneadult-one-vote and one-vote-one-value, which was adopted, subject to certain limitations ; and another of equal importance, that no division should be adopted for future elections unless it had been recommended by an impartial officer appointed by the Governor General in Council, an officer who knew no party, and whose duty was, subject to the directions contained in the Act, to do what he thought right under all the circumstances of the case.' Has any argument been advanced against that principle 1 I have spoken previously in regard to the adoption of theprincipleof one-vote-one-value. Personally, I should prefer to see no limitation to that principle. I take it that every elector has an equal right to - a voice in the affairs of the Commonwealth, whether he lives in the country or in a town. It should not follow that because a country resident removes to a town the effect of his vote shall be in any way diminished, nor should the reverse occur. There were other honourable members, however, who held a different view, and an attempt was made to arrive at a compromise. While I cannot find within the four corners of the Act an exact declaration, such iis I should have desired, of the positive equality of electors, the views of honourable members on both sides of the Chamber were fairly met by the adoption of a provision allowing a Commissioner to depart from the quota by a margin not exceeding one-fifth more or one-fifth less. Therefore, if the quota foia State were 25,000, it would be possible for a Commissioner to arrange the borders of two divisions so that one should contain 20,000 electors and the other 30,000, a difference surely large enough to satisfy every one. It was considered a fair arrangement by both branches of the Legislature, although at the time the drought, to which reference has been made, was at its very worse. The A ct declares in trumpet tones that, subject to specified conditions, there shall be equality of votes. It does not provide that in all cases a distinction shall be drawn between country and town electors.",30
99,Mr CONUOY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The margin is to be used ""whenever necessary:"" Mr Mr KINGSTON - Quite so. The wording of the provision to which the honourable and learned member refers shows that it is not to be considered necessary to use the margin in all cases, and I am inclined to think, although I have not looked into the question very closely, since I am i content to take whatever fate allots in a matter of this kind, that the Soutli Australian divisions are practically equal. My point is that Parliament and the Government knew what they were doing when they passed the Act. We were in the very middle of the drought when the Government proposed a certain margin, and that margin was cut down in this Chamber, and the lower margin of one-fifth to which I have referred adopted. On the question of the difference between country and town divisions, 1 know that as a matter of fact a larger percentage of the number of electors on the roll goes to the ballot-box in the country districts than records its votes in the town'divisions. That arises to a great extent from the fact that the city population is largely a floating one, and consists of workers /-who move hither and thither to secure op-: portunities of employment, so that at election time they are often not within a convenient distance of the division to which they belong, and in which they are entitled to record their votes. Time and again that has been proved to be the case in South Australia",30
100,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,That would hardly apply - to such large electorates as are provided for under the Federal distributions ,31
101,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Indee d it'would.,31
102,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Not to the same extent as in electorates containing only a few thousand voters.,31
103,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I venture to say that in the south-eastern district of South Australia, containing a farming and pastoral pojmlation, a much larger proportion of voters will poll than in the city of Adelaide.",31
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The experience in \ New South Wales has, in nearly all cases, been quite the opposite.",31
105,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I am only speaking of that which I know in my own State.,31
106,Mr MAHON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The right honourable gentleman is applying his of South Australia to the whole of the Commonwealth.,31
107,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"South Australia very considerable area. I do not say the people in the agricultural districts a greater interest in politics, but they on the spot at election times, and as polling places are numerous, the percentage of votes recorded in such cases is larger than in the towns. Are we going 1 back upon what we declared last year? I ent with his previous statement. do not intend to do anything of the until I am convinced of an absolute necessity, and I know of no necessity. The Minister told us that he had done his duty, and I have every reason to believe that he has.. He informed us, further, that if the House decided having fresh distributions in the ordinary way, ample time could be allowed for referwho ring the reports back to the Commissioners. What.would be the effect of the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned ' ber for South Australia, Mr Glynn? give the Minister additional power ening the time necessary for the purpose. Whereas thirty days were required ply with, certain provisions of the propose to reduce theperiodtoseven days,and that surely should assist him to a great tent. He will have twenty-three additional days in which to perform all the other necessary to secure the adoption of a found them. fresh distribution. . I am sure that the Minister will not attempt to shield himself by suggesting that he has not time to refer the reports back to the Commissioners. He told us some few days ago that there was time for him to do so, and we now propose to assist him by smoothing the way for a rigid and proper adherence to the terms of the Act. Are honourable, members not content with a difference of 50 per cent, between the number of electors in one constituency and in another ?",31
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"It is not a difference of 50, but of 40 per cent.",31
109,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Suppose we adopt 20,000 as the quota. One-fifth of 20,000 would be 4,000, and would result i u a minimum of 16,000. One-fifth added to 20,000 would result in a maximum of 24,000. The difference between 24,000 and 16,000 would be 8,000, or 50 per cent, of 16,000.",31
110,Mr MCCAY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"If the figures are taken the other way, 8,000 represents ouly 3-3£ per local knowledge cent, of 24,000.",31
111,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"There is no other way of applying the percentage than that is of which I have adopted. A margin of onethat fifth above or below the quota is permitted, take and there is no getting away from the result are which I have stated. I take it that the the Minister does not seriously contend that he cannot refer the reports back to the Commuch missioners on account of the want of time, because such a position would be inconsistThe kind amendment of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mir. Glynn, is wisely conceived for the purpose of removing the possibility of difficulty in regard to time. If there be any difficulty with regard to the distribution of the electorates, is not a marupon gin, of 50 per cent, sufficiently large? I venture to say that every honourable member looks at the question fairly will come to the conclusion that it is sufficient. But something else is proposed, apparently because mem50 per cent, is not regarded as sufficient. To Let us have equality of voting power by all by shortmeans. I concede a margin of 50 per cent, because I cannot help it . but any to comfurther variation canuot possibly comAct, we mend itself to honourable members generally, and I hope that no slight excuse will exbe regarded as sufficient to justify us in going back to the conditions of years ago, acts and of retaining the divisions as we then",31
112,Mr THOMSON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,We have to take into account the addition to the voting strength of the electorates brought about by the extension of the franchise to women.,32
113,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Yes , that has resulted in a large addition to the number of voters. At the inception of Federation only one State elected its members upon the adult franchise, and that wasSouth Australia. Now the franchise is uniform throughout the Commonwealth. Surely the progress of events during the last three years has been sufficient to justify the fresh distribution directed by the Electoral Act- a direction which was decided upon when we knew all the circumstances, and knew what was wanted. We then provided for a distribution by an oflicer properly qualified for the work, and declared that no distribution other than that recommended by him should be accepted. Can we go back upon that ? Are we going to dj.sregard the principle of one vote one value even with the limitation I have stated, or go back upon the more important provision in the Act that it shall not be within the power of the Minister to do what he pleases.with regard to the distribution of the electorates? We then decided that there should be no interference with the action of the Commissioner, except so far as Parliament might interpose in the interests of the people. We acted wisely, and we should adhere to the principles then laid down. We acted, not under the influence of heat or passion, but deliberately, and for the good of the country. I do not for a moment suggest that the Government, with whom I had the honour to be associated, or honourable members generally, or any section of them, are desirous of ""gerrymandering,"" or anything of that kind, but I do say that we ought in the public interest to preserve the safeguards between ourselves and the public. We ought to recollect that naturally each one of us may be somewhat biased in his views. The best of us, and all are good, approach elections naturally inclined to think ofperhaps to dwell unconsciously upon-wha t may suit our views. I venture to think that it is highly probable that any distribution that might be adopted would involve alterations to the prejudice of some of the sitting members. Let us pledge ourselves to adhere to that which we rightly provided to prevent considerations of that sort from swaying us too much. We did it purposely, we did it for all time, we did it for the forthcoming election, and had no thought but for that which was good. Shall we, as the elections are more nearly approaching, in our heat and fear that the distribution may affect us, abandon the safeguards which we ourselves deliberately provided for the public good, and against the operation of influences which ought not to prevail in such matters as are now under consideration ? I have no sympathy with the suggestions made against the Government. I do not believe that they are capable of doing that which has been attributed to them. But it is a pity that the appearances are such that suggestions of the kind should have been possible. I say, further, that the action now proposed would form a mischievous precedent. What might be done innocently today might be done mischievously tomorrow. Let us do what we / can for the honour of the Australian Parliament, for our own honour, and for the good of the country to which we are proud to belong. Let us hold fast to that which we deliberately provided, and do everything we can to strengthen the hands of the Government to give effect to what is necessary on that behalf. The honourable and learned member for South Australia Mr Glynn seeks only that. Let us give the Government the advantage in the matter of time, or any other facility that may be desired. At the same time let us resolve that we shall not surrender the principle of one - vote one value, subject to the limitations to which I referred. Let us pay full heed to the still greater principle.that, in the distribution of the States, we shall not be left to our own unbridled will, but that we shall be guarded by official assistance and impartial advice against such mistakes as that into which we are invited to fall today.",32
114,Mr KIRWAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," The speech to which we have just listened is well worthy of the right honourable gentleman who delivered it . Those honourable members who have differed from him on questions of policy have never accused him of inconsistency, and he has today afforded another proof of his strong adherence to principle. He has shown that the subject is one which should be discussed apart from all party considerations, quite apart from all personal feeling as to the effects of the distributions. The only objection raised by the Minister to the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is that the proposed period of seven days would not be sufficient to enable the requirements of the Act to be complied with. The Minister referred to the enoiTnous area of some of the States, and to the difficulties in the way of receiving objections, and of publishing the proposals of the Commissioners throughout the various States within the time specified. I would point out that if seven days are insufficient, thirty days would also be insufficient for the publication of the distributions in every small town in the States. It would take many months to publish the distributions throughout Western Australia, but the large centres of population in that State could be easily reached within the seven days . proposed. The amendment does not contemplate the limitation of the period for the publication of distributions submitted by the Commissioners in the first instance, but applies only to the revised reports, and therefore it seems to me that there is not much strength in the objection raised by the Minister on that score. If we send back the proposals to the Commissioners we shall simply require them to follow upon the lines adopted in the cases of South Australia and Tasmania. The right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, declared that, in the case of South Australia and Tasmania, the policy of equal electorates had been adopted by the Commissioners as nearly as practicable. Reference to the reports of those officers will show that that is so. In South Australia, the constituency of East Torrens contains the largest number of voters under the proposal which has been accepted by the Government, and that of Barker the smallest, the figures being 26,727 and 21,791 respectively. The difference between the two is 4,936. Yet-as was pointed out by the previous speaker-it was quite possible for the Commissioner to have made a difference of 10,000 electors between the numerical strength of the largest constituency and that of the smallest, and still to have complied^ with the Act. In Tasmania the Electoral Commissioner has adhered even more closety to the principle which the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, and those who support him desire to see established. In the island State the division which contains the largest number of voters is Northcote and that which contains the smallest is Darwin. The former possesses 17,314 electors and the latter 15,134, a difference of 2,180. It is obvious, therefore, that the divisions effected in the two States in regard to which the recommendations of the Commissioners were accepted, approach very closely to equal electorates on the basis of one vote one value. Under the electoral divisions to which the Government desire the House to revert, the discrepancies will be much greater, and much in excess of what was contemplated under the provisions of the Electoral Act. In some of the States the figures are not yet complete, but in Western Australia the greatest difference which obtains is in respect of the divisions of Perth and Eremantle. The margin in that case represents 7,226 voters, l n Queensland the difference between the largest electorate and the smallest represents very nearly 50 per cent., the figures being 33,053 in the division of Brisbane as against 16,480 in Maranoa-a margin of 16,573. In New South Wales the figures are incomplete.",32
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I endeavoured to obtain the complete figures by telegraph today, but I cannot do so.",33
116,Mr KIRWAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I am merely pointing out that the figures in New South Wales are incomplete. In Victoria we are unable to secure any figures regarding the number of electors upon the rolls for each division. The least that the Government could have done in asking us to sanction a scheme of this character was to supply us with as full particulars as possible. Probably if the figures were available the discrepancies in Victoria would be greater than those which obtain in any other State. I should have thought that' the Government would have been only too glad to accept the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Sonth Australia, Mr Glynn. It would have released them from a veiy awkward position, and would have shown that they desired to secure a complete distribution of seats - upon a fair basis. If their motives were all that they represent them to be, they would not hesitate to accept that proposal. It is scarcely necessary for me to point out that very serious charges are levelled against the Government outside of this House. Those charges are of such a nature that every member of the Ministry, and every Government supporter, ought to bitterly resent them. The Ministry are charged with considering, not the interests of the electors and of the Commonwealth generally, but those of their own party and individual members of this Chamber. That is a matter which affects every representative in this House, ancl one would naturally expect tbeGoverninentto rise superior to such allegations by asserting that they were prepared to again remit this question to Commissioners who are absolutely impartial, and to abide by their decision. Instead of doing so, they have devised one excuse after another to prevent an unbiased electoral division of the States. That is not what we expected from the first Australian Government. Certainly the Ministerial attitude upon this question has come as a surprise to me, because I anticipated that they would rise above party or political considerations. The charges which have been made outside the House imply that there are certain honourable members whose positions would be very seriously jeopardized if the proposals of the Commissioners were adopted. Indeed, I have heard it suggested that even the Prime Minister himself would not feel too secure. The Minister for Trade and Customs, in the course of his speech, ferred that time was being wasted by honourable members upon this side of the House. In answer to that suggestion I would point out that when the honourable member for Macquarie moved the adjournment of the 'House some months ago, for the purpose of calling attention to the delays which had taken place in putting the machinery provided by the Electoral .Act into motion, the Minister admitted that he had allowed five weeks to elapse from the time that A ct was assented to before making any attempt' to comply with its provisions. He did nothing whatever during that period. At the end of the five weeks he forwarded a circular to the States Governments, asking if they would co-operate with him in the collection of the Federal rolls. The interval between the end of that five weeks and six months was wasted in correspondence with the States Governments, and the usual red-tapism. Practically nothing was done by the Minister t ill the Commissioners were appointed, six months after the Act had been assented to.",33
117,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The Electoral Commissioner for New South Wales was not appointed t ill about four weeks ago.,34
118,Mr KIRWAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Exactly ; yet the Minister has the temerity to suggest that time has been wasted by honourable members upon this side of the House. The blame really rests with the honourable gentleman himself. Indeed, the Government are responsible for the whole muddle into which our electoral affairs have drifted. I intend to support the proposal of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn.",34
119,Mr THOMSON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," In my opinion the proposal of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, affords the Government and Parliament an opportunity to save its reputation for decency and honesty, and to take up a dignified position by remitting to an independent person the work of distributing the States into divisions for future elections. Surely if that principle were a sound one when we passed the Electoral Act, it is equally sound today. If honourable members desire to know the attitude upon this matter which should be taken up by a high-minded Ministry, they have but to refer to the speech of a late member of it , that of the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston. He has in- taken up the attitude which would be adopted by a Government which considered that it held in its hands the reputation of Parliament, and that it was its duty not merely to refuse to do anything which would stain that reputation, but to abstain from committing an}' act which would seem to cast a reflection either upon the motives of Ministers or upon the motives of Parliament. I am sure that the position assumed by the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, is far more likely to accomplish that than is the attitude which has been abopted by Ministers. I wish to point out that we are deliberately departing from the provisions of the Electoral Act which was recently passed by us. We deliberately provided in that measure that the considerations by which the Commissioners should . be guided in dividing the States into Federal electorates should be(a) Community or diversity of interest, (6) Means of communication, (c) Physical features, (d) Existing boundaries of divisions ; And we declared that, subject to those considerationsTbe quota of electors shall he the basis for the distribution, and the Commissioner may adopt a margin of allowance, to be used whenever necessaryThat is, whenever those considerations rendered it necessary to use thembut in no case shall such quota be departed from to a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less. Those are the considerations which we termined should justify any departure from the principle of equality of representation, proposals now before us. and wedeclared that in no case should the quota be departed from - to a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less.' considerations other than these were guide the Commissioners. Under this Act we declared, for example, that no temmen."" porary climatic conditions prevailing any part of the Commonwealth should served influence the determination of the Comam missioners. No allowance was made in from the Act for any such consideration, and yet, when it was before us, the drought, which is now put forward as a ground for the rejection of certain divibers sions, had reached its most acute stage. that consideration was one which ought have operated, why was it deliberately omitted from the Act itself, especially as was then our unfortunate daily experience to learn of loss and disaster arising from drought? Notwithstanding the provisions of the Electoral Act the Ministry intend to pay regard to a consideration for which was not. deemed wise or necessary to vide. We have also the important fact that we have extended the franchise to women. Is that fact to have no significance in nexion with theforthcomingelections? Are we to go on as if no such change had been I admit that in Western Australia and South Australia, in which women were already adshould mitted to the'f ranchise, the difficulties this proposal will throw in the way of female voters will not be so great as in those States which comprise the great majority of the people of Australia, and in which female suffrage did not previously exist. In those States in which the franchise had not extended to women prior to Federation, certain divisions existed, and the result this extension of the franchise has nearly double the number of electors, and give rise to great inequality in certain electorates. We are asked, however, to pay no regard to that fact. This is the first occasion on which this Parliament has ever thought of taking into its own hands work of framing electorates for ifs own bers. Honourable members had nothing to do with the divisions on which this House was originally elected. As members of this Parliament they had no voice in . the framing of those divisions. The boundaries were determined without consideration of their interests. They came together as deParliament possessing apparently a higher sense of honour than is illustrated by the Having then had experience in a division of the States without being personally concerned in No the division, they declared- "" We shall to not put our hands to this work. We will place it under the authority of independent That was a proper attitude to take in up, and we hoped that it would be obfoi: all time. I can safely say that I not opposing the Government proposal personal or party considerations. Even although the schemes of distribution submitted by the Commissioners operated more or less disadvantageous^ to particular memor to particular parties, I should not If be found objecting to them provided the to Government gave evidence of an - honest desire to abide by an independent decision. it 1 feel that, for the sake of our own reputation, and in order to gain the confidence of the the electors, there is nothing about which we ought to be more careful than the work of dividing the States into electorates, bei t cause it is work in relation to which we promight unconsciously place our individual interests above the public welfare. As the right honourable member for South Australia conhas said, that may be done in the future.",34
120,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,We should not be the .made 1 sole judges in our own interests.,35
121,Mr THOMSON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Exactly so. We be satisfied to allow the independent which authorities, who were selected because of their competency and honesty, to decide all. such matters for us. As a reason for his refusal to accept the amendment submitted by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, the Minister been for Trade and Customs has again said that the original voters' lists were of so materially affected by the effects been to of the drought, and that the latest to figures which have been obtained are also affected so materially by like considerations, that it would be useless to again refer the distributions to the Commissioners. But the. honourable gentleman has not yet answered the a statement which I made some days ago. memI shall repeat it , and I call upon him to answer it if he can do so. I contend that under the Commissioners' schemes the electorates which the Minister declares have lost much of their populationowingto the drought would obtain a larger measure of representation than they are entitled to in respect a of any population that ever existed within their bounds. The Minister may say-"" Oh, that may be so; but those electorates will grow in the future, and we must make provision for the further increase that is likely to take place."" But are we never to obtain a re-adjustment of electoral boundaries as long as there are growing districts them ? Is that to be a reason for deferring the work of redistributing States ? If so, we shall never have a redistribution. Any Minister who is called upon to arrange for the redistribution of Australia into electorates in the future will be confronted with difficulties not only as great but sometimes greater than those which present themselves to the Minister at the present time. Therefore, an argument of that kind is altogether fallacious. The New South Wales which the Minister has named have received under the Commissioner's scheme a larger measure of representation than is justified by any population that was ever within their boundaries. The Minister also asserts that another difficulty in the way of the acceptance of the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is that the electoral lists are incomplete, that they have not been revised, and that they may comprise many names which ought not to appear upon them. But will not that objection apply to those lists when they are being used, as they will be, in connection with the existing divisions? The lists of which the Minister makes this assertion must necessarily be the basis of the rolls. He says, however, that Revision Courts will be held, that those whose names have been omitted from the rolls will have an opportunity to rectify the. omission, and that the lists will be corrected and purged. But will not that remark apply with equal force to the rolls relating to the divisions as prepared by the Commissioners? either case the rolls will have to be purged by the Revision Court. To sum up the position, therefore, the argument as to the effects of the drought on certain electorates is met by the fact that themeasure of representation accorded under theCommissioners' schemes to those divisions is larger than that to which they would have been entitled in respect of any population that ever existed within tlieir boundaries, and the objections as to the incompleteness of the lists must apply, not only to the existing divisions, but to the electorates Mr Thomson. outlined by the Commissioners. These facts seem to me to completely dispose of the Minister's objections to this amendment. I regret the attitude taken up by the Government, quite independently of any effect it may have on the membership of the new within Parliament, because we are departing deliberately, and for no sufficient reason, the from what we have already determined to be the proper principles to secure the due representation of the people of Australia. The Minister has stated that there is time to comply with the provisions of the Act, and return the proposed distributions to the Commissioners so that they may submit fresh ones. The amendment of the honourable and learned member for South Austaalia, Mr Glynn, by substituting for the divisions - period of thirty days for which under section 34 the lists must be exhibited, a period of seven days, would give twentythree days more. By accepting that amendment the Minister would be taking a course which would do both Jiim and his colleagues high honour in the future, and would be avoiding those conclusions which, in the absence of a good reason to the contrary, must obtain possession of men's minds. Above all, he would be keeping beyond suspicion that which I think is the highest possession of this Parliament-it s honour before the people of Australia.",35
122,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," I am not surprised that the Minister for Trade and Customs felt uncomfortable under the strong fire of criticism directed upon him by the right honourable member for South Australia, who, as an old colleague and friend, is anxious to save the Ministry from the imputation which must naturally rest upon them if they persist in this attempt to fasten upon the people of the Commonwealth an electoral law which will give unIn equal representation.",36
123,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I draw attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.] country Mr SYDNEY SMITH - I regret the absence of the Minister. If he feels that the matter is of such importance that the right honourable member for Swan, who succeeded him in the office of Minister for Home Affairs, cannot be fully conversant with it, he should remain in his place in the Chamber to explain his proposals to the Committee. Now we find, however, that not even the Minister for Home Affairs is present, and the Postmaster-General, who is left in charge, will, I - feel sure, admit that he knows nothing whatever ahout the measure.",36
124,The CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The honourable member may make that complaint in the House, but he must now confine his remarks to the - clause before the Committee.",37
125,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The House - disapproved of certain proposed distributions, and the Minister thereupon regarded himself as the sole person capable of judging whether revised schemes of distribution - should be submitted by the Commissioners. Instead of doing what the law required him to do, he has brought in a Bill to legalize an illegal act, and before I conclude my remarks I shall make a charge of a more - serious nature against him and against the Government. If any one else had taken the action to which I refer he would be placed in the dock, and be made to answer for his conduct.",37
126,Sir PHILIPPTSH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I ask that the honourable member be requested to withdraw that statement.,37
127,The CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The statement is disorderly, and should be withdrawn.",37
128,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I was interrupted before I had finished what I wished to say. I am ready to withdraw when honourable members have heard my charge.,37
129,Mr MCDONALD,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Withdra w unconditionally.,37
130,The CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I ask the honourable member to assist the Chair in maintaining the rules of debate, and to withdraw unconditionally.",37
131,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I withdraw in deference to your wish, Mr Chairman, bub a wrong interpretation has been placed upon what I desire to say. According to the Electoral Act, which became law at the instance of this Government, if any officerand in this connection the Minister is an - officer-attempt s to deprive an elector of his right to vote, he is liable to a penalty of £200, or, in default, imprisonment. The Minister, however, is trying to deprive 200,000 electors of the Commonwealth of their'representation.",37
132,Mr SAWEBS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Parliamen t is omnipotent.,37
133,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"No doubt a Government with a majority at its back can do, within limits,' anything it likes. The people will shortly have an opportunity - of expressing their feelings with regard to the action of the Government, and I venture to say that their verdict will be unfavorable. I feel very warmly with regard to this matter, because, as the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, has pointed out, a very important principle is being entirely ignored. A great injustice is about to be inflicted upon 200,000 electors in the Commonwealth, and I feel sure that when the Minister goes before his constituents he will be unable to justify his action. The right honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, stated the case in such a way as to merit the consideration of honourable members on both sides of the Chair. He pointed out the risks that would attach to a departure from the main principle of the Electoral Act. The right honourable gentleman further stated that he did not believe that the Government had acted from unworthy motives, as had beeri suggested, but he pointed out that grave suspicion would undoubtedly attach to them if the present Bill were placed upon the statute book. We have no desire to improve the record of the Ministry. The interests of the free-trade party would be best served if they were to go to the country with all their imperfections thick upon them. But we are acting in the interests of the public, who will be unjustly treated if the Government are allowed to persist in their wrong-doing. The right honourable and learned member for South Australia spoke as a friend of the Government. The Minister sneers at the idea of the right honourable gentleman appearing in that capacity. He was their friend so long as he assisted the Government; but immediately he considered it necessary to resist their attempt to set aside an important principle, for which he had consistently fought for many years, he was regarded in a different light.",37
134,Mr CHAPMAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The honourable member could not say a good word about the right honourable gentleman a few weeks ago.,37
135,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I have differed from my right honourable friend on many occasions, and so has the Right Honourable G. H . Reid. We have both fought against him upon principle ; but he will admit that neither the Right Honourable G. H . Reid nor I have condemned him personally.",37
136,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I cannot recoHect anything that I considered unfair.,37
137,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,That is a fair admission.,37
138,Mr CHAPMAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The right honourable and learned member for South Australia does not say that the statements regarding him were not untrue.,38
139,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The right honout orable and learned member does not reOn spond.,38
140,Mr KINGSTON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I cannot recollect, I do not intend to try.",38
141,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I differed the from the right honourable and learned member in regard to the Goldring case, I still feel strongly about it, but that not prevent me from applauding him the for standing up for his principles and endeavouring to prevent the Government from acting in a manner inimical to the best interests of the electors. This which he sought. afternoon the Minister for Trade and Customs read a telegram which I despatched to Mr Mclntyre, the Chief State Electoral Officer at Sydney, but - which by some means or other was delivered to the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth. That was transmitted last evening because the Minister produced a document containing certain figures regarding the accuracy which the House had no knowledge whatutter ever. Certainly he. endeavoured to convey the impression that he was in possession of an important document which showed that that recent statements by the leader of the Opposition were not correct. We all ing, know the Minister's capacity for engineerAlthough ing, and, therefore, it behoves us to closely watch his movements. Accordingly I wired to Sydney to ascertain whether there was any substantial - difference between the figures which were recently used by Mr Reid and those contained in the official returns supplied by the Electoral Office. I did not receive a reply to my telegram, but evidently the Minister thought that he would score point against me by reading that communiman cation. I do not regret that he has done the so, because the telegram in question was a public document to a publie officer. In the absence of any official acknowledgment to the that wire, I sent >a further message to Mr. Mclntyre about 12.30 p.m. or 1 p.m. toAVill day. The reply which I received contained figures which are identical with those quoted by Mr Reid a few days ago.",38
142,Mr BHOWN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Did the reply come from the Federal Electoral Office or from the State Electoral Office? .,38
143,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Fro m the State Electoral Office. It is impossible to get information from the Commonwealth Ofiice. Some months ago I movedfcheadjournment of the House to call attention to the neglect of the Minister and his officers in carrj ing the provisions of the Electoral Act. that occasion I pointed out that, as a result of his dereliction of duty, there was and a danger of thousands of electors in New South .Wales being disfranchised. To-night honourable gentleman has quoted from a> communication which is addressed to the and Premier of New South Wales, and which is does dated November last, notwithstanding that Commonwealth Franchise Act was passed in June of last year, and the Electoral A ct in October. To that he received a reply in January or February giving the information",38
144,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,That relatedfcofche collection of the names of female voters.,38
145,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"No . I should like the Minister to'produce a copy of the correspondence which took place between wire the Commonwealth Government and the Premier of New South Wales in regard to fchis question. I am satisfied it would of prove that the Minister has displayed an incapacity to deal with this important matter so far as that State is concerned. I do not desire to attribute motives, but I say the outside public will attribute motives. Unless some better explanation is forthcomthey will declare that he acted designedly. the lists were completed in January or February, and notwithstanding that the Electoral Act empowered him to appoint Commissioners to undertake the work of dividing the States into new electorates, no steps in that direction were taken until the end of Apri l of the present year. Indeed, in the case of New South Wales the Electoral Officer was not appointed until three or a four weeks ago. Now the honourable gentleseeks to legalize an illegal act. Under provisions of the Electoral Acb, neglect or refusal on the part of any officer to discharge any official duty, or any interference with right of a single elector, is punishable by a fine of £200, or twelve months'imprisonmenfc. the Minister assert that that provision applies only to some subordinate officer ? I say unhesitatinglyfchafche alone is responsible in this connection. Had he faithfully discharged the trust committed to him there would have been no necessity for - the introduction .of this Bill. Now he seeks to make it appear that although the statute any which this . House deliberately passed declares that, in the event of either House disapproving of the divisions recommended by the Commissioners, the Government shall refer them back to those officers for reconsideration, it is left to his own sweet will to determine whether that course shall be pursued. Senator O'Connor, who, 1 understand, is shortly to be elevated to the High Court Bench, and who must, therefore, according to the view of the Government, be accepted as a very high authority upon legal matters, the Attorney General, and Senator Downer are unanimous in declaring that the word "" may"" in section 22 of the Electoral Act is mandatory and not permissive. I am indeed surprised to find the honourable member for New England supporting the proposals of the Government. In effect, he says that the miners and farmers of Armidale ought not to have equal political power with the electors of the adjoining division of Richmond. In the former electorate there are 24,000 voters, and in the latter only 17,000 or 18,000. Between the two electorates there is merely a bridle-path, and yet the honourable member denies to his own .constituents the same voting power that is enjoyed by the electors of Richmond. Why should not the vote of the miner of Hillgrove be equal to that of the farmer in the electorate of Richmond ? I do not think that this question should be considered as a politician's question. If we divided the States in accordance with our own desires, no doubt we should endeavour so to adjust the boundaries that our own seats would remain undisturbed. If that course were to be observed the Government would be able to divide the States into electorates in such a way that it would be practically impossible for the Opposition to win any seats. Many years ago a similar effort was made in one of the states of the United States of America with the result that the Republican party secured the return of fifty members, representing 50,000 voters, while the Federalist party were able to secure the election of only eleven members, although the constituencies which they represented comprised 56,000 electors. That is what is known as gerrymandering, aud my desire is that we shall be free from the suspicion of dssiring to encourage anything of the kind in relation to the Commonwealth Parliament. When the people of the State in question had the true facts brought before them they spoke with no 9T uncertain sound, and nearly all the men who were guilty of interfering with the rights and privileges of the voters never again entered into public life. The people of Australia, too, will not be slow to deal with any attempt to interfere with tlieir rights and privileges. Is it right that some 35,000 electors' in the Lang division of New South Wales should have no greater power than is possessed by about 13,000 to: 14,000 electors in the Darling division?",38
146,Mr SAWEBS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The honourable member is beating the wind.,39
147,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"My honourable friend will by-and-by have an opportunity of putting this matter before his constituents. He has thrown out a challenge, and I promise him that I shall have a few words to say to his constituents in relation to this matter. I shall ask them whether they consider it is right that, according to the Minister's own figures, 30,562 electors in the Riverina and Darling divisions should have as great a voting power as is possessed by 48,578 electors in the New England and . Hunter divisions. It is exceedingly difficult to obtain any reliable statistics from the Government. They ask us to approve of divisions without putting before us any official information relating to them. The Minister furnished us last night with an incomplete return, and I have experienced great difficulty in securing information which should have been supplied to us by the Government. According to the figures which I have obtained, there is a difference of nearly 10,000 in the ' number of voters in certain country constituencies in Vic-' toria as compared with other country electorates. Yet we are asked to pass a Bill! that will allow such a state of things toexist. I trust that the Government will not be successful. I have already pointed out that the Electoral Act provides a penalty for undue interference with the rights of any one voter.",39
148,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Why does not the honourable member, impeach the Ministry 1",39
149,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I believe that if they succeed in passing this Bill, the public will say that they should be impeached, for. I do not think there could be a more barefaced attempt to interfere with the rights and privileges of the electors of the Commonwealth. Mr L . E. GBOOM - The public desire to see some .business carried out by us. .. - Mr SYDNEY SMITH - This Bill was introduced only on Wednesday last.",39
150,Mr WILKINSON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"And it has been almost continuously discussed since then, although it contains only three clauses.",40
151,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Butitaffect s che continuance of the rights and privileges of 200,000 electors. Does the honourable and learned member think that is a matter of no importance 1 When the Bill was introduced it was proposed that the motion for the second reading should be submitted on the following day. The Opposition, however, took exception to the adoption of that course. The leader of the Opposition was so strongly against the Government proposal to revert to the existing divisionsand that feeling is entertained by honourable members of the Opposition generallythat he resigned his seat, and is now appealing to the electors of East Sydney, and through them to the electors of the Commonwealth to approve of his action.",40
152,Mr MAUGER,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The electors of the Commonwealth do not care a straw about it .,40
153,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The honourable member will be able later on to explain his action to his constituents. We asked that the motion for the second reading should not be proceeded with until Tuesday last, and the Government eventually agreed to that request, an undertaking being given that the Opposition would assist the Government in closing the debate on that day. I was not present when that undertaking was given, but T felt that as far as I could do so consistently with my duty to my constituents, I should endeavour to abide by the undertaking. As a matter of fact, the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, the honourable member for Canobolas, the honourable member for South Sydney, and other members of the Opposition, desired to speak on the motion for the second reading, but they adhered loyally to the compact, and allowed the motion to be dealt with last night. Mr L. E. GROOM - What has this to do with the Bill 1",40
154,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"In the first session of this Parliament honourable members sitting behind the Government debated the Defence Bill for six weeks, although they knew that it was never likely to reach the Committee stage. The Government also allowed the House to discuss the Inter-State Commission Bill and. other measures at great length, notwithstanding that they never intended to proceed with them.",40
155,Mr LE GROOM,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The honourable member is now endeavouring to block the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.,40
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Is this Bill more important than the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill ?,40
157,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"That is the question. The Government could easily have brought forward the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, of which honourable members on this side are more sincere supporters than are many of those opposite. I am afraid, however, that we are making a vain appeal, since it is evident that honourable members opposite came to some understanding with the Government weeks ago, an act which was nothing short of political treachery. But the time is not far distant when they will have to face the electors, who voted for the Constitution in the belief that in any electoral law passed in accordance with its provisions the principle of equal representation, as far as each State is concerned, would be adhered to. Honourable members who support this Bill will, therefore, have to answer for a betrayal of trust. Although the people of the Commonwealth have all to submit to the same taxation, we are not giving them an equal voice in regard to the affairs of the Commonwealth.  voice in regard to the election of senators 1",40
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The members of the Senate are chosen to represent the States as separate entities.  tors the representation of the States is unequal.,40
159,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"^Yes. I objected to that provision. The value of each vote cast within any one of the States for a senator is, however, the same; but my honourable friend is prepared to make a distinction between the voting for the Senate and the voting for the House of Representatives by making the votes cast for members of the House of Representatives unequal in value. As I have said, I opposed the acceptance of the Constitution, and the Prime Minister warned the electors against returning me, on the ground that I would try to infringe its provisions, whereas it is he, and the members .of his Government, who are ready to do that. The Government have, on several occasions, tried to evade the terms of the Constitution, while we on this side bave endeavoured to prevent them from doing so. It istheG overnmentand their supporters who are trying to break the Constitution, and to create more dissatisfaction than already exists w ith respect to federation. There is yet time for the reports to be sent back, but the Government appear to be afraid to place it within the power of the Commissioners to reply to thestatenientswhich have been made by the Minister without adequate data. I challenge the Minister to produce any reliable official document which will support his remarks with reference to the decrease in the population of the Biverina and Barrier electorates which is said to have resulted from the drought. I have regarded it as myduty to enter the strongest protest against the action of the Government, and I hope that a number of honourable members may be induced to take to heart the words of the right honourable and learned member fdr South Australia, Mr Kingston, and to support the amendment. By following that course they will do justice to the people of the Commonwealth and at the same time prevent a violation of the Constitution.",40
160,Mr SAWEBS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," I am very reluctant to take any part in this debate,-because I quite recognise that, in view of the tactics pursued by honourable members opposite, those who desire to see the Bill pass - will most readily achieve their end by maintaining silence. I feel, however, that it is necessary to make a few observations in explanation of the vote I intend to give in support of the Government. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and the honourable member for Macquarie were most persistent in directing attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the rolls upon which the distributions were made, and yet they are now clamouring for the adoption of the reports of the Commissioners. The honourable member for Macquarie repeatedly declared that it would be impossible to conduet the elections fairly upon the rolls that had been compiled in New South Wales and other States. He still believes that the rolls are in an unsatisfactory condition, and yet because he thinks the interests of his party would be served he is anxious to secure the adoption of the 9 T2 distribution recommended by the Commissioner. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa has denounced the supporters of the Government as dishonourable, and the proposal of the Government as the basest that could possibly be submitted He stated on a former occasion that the rolls for New South Wales were deficient to the extent of 150,000 names, and yet because he believes that the distribution proposed by the Commissioner would result in a gain of one seat for the party to which he belongs, he is clamouring for its adoption. The honourable member for Kal goorlie on the 18th of June last stated that any distribution made upon the basis of the rolls at the disposal of the Commissioners would be unjust.",41
161,Mr KIRWAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,We desire that the reports should be sent back to the Commissioners for reconsideration.,41
162,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"It was urged in support of the Government proposal for the rejection of the distributions that the divisions were unsatisfactory, because they were based upon rolls collected at a time when large areas in Yictoria, New South Wales, and Queensland were, to a considerable extent, denuded of population owing to the drought. I submit that that contention was a good one. I have a very intimate knowledge of the greater part of the western district of New South Wales. For some years I represented the State electorate of Bourke, which is now included in the Federal division of Darling. Ten years ago that district had a larger population than it has today. Any comparison made between the number of electors on the roll in 1901 and those on the roll last collected could not be a fair one, because a drought of more or less severity has prevailed over that country for a series of years and the population has been gradually reduced.",41
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Is not drought the normal condition in that part of New South Wales?,41
164,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The honourable member did not think so when he wanted toimpose heavy rentals upon the unfortunate settlers. I desire to illustrate my point by referring to the three State electorates which embrace a large extent of the western country of New South Wales now included in the Federal electorate of Darling. I have obtained some figures from the Electoral Officer of New South Wales, who informed mefchathe had none that were later, and at .the same time reliable. These returns show that in the Barwon electorate in 1899 there - were 2,917 electors on the roll, whereas in 1902-3 the number had been reduced to 1613. In the Bourke electorate in 16991900 there were 2,427electors on the roll,and in 1902-3 only 1576. In the Cobar electorate in 1899-1900 there were 3,246 electors, whereas in 1902-3 there were only 2,418. ""Why was not the honourable member for Macquarie honest enough to tell us the jDosifcion in regard tofcheState electorate of Bourke ? Thafc district contains a smaller number of male electors today than it did last year.",41
165,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I gave the figures hopeless task. for the Bourke electorate. - Mr SAWERS - Then I beg the honourable member's pardon. Take the three Sfcate electorates of the Barwon, Bourke, and Cobar. During the year 1899-1900 those districts contained 8,590 male electors, whereas in 1902-3, they contained only 5,607 voters- a decrease of 2,983 males, or more than one-third. If , in three State electorates during a period of three years, the population of adult males was reduced by one-third, is not that substantial proof that the drought did result in an exodus of population from the western divisons of New South Wales? If such a reduction in the male population took place, what must be the position in regard to the female portion of the community ? The men fought on throughout the weary drought, submitting to all sorts of privations, but they sent their women away. Thousands of females left the interior of Australia during the prevalence of the drought for the easier conditions which obtain in our coastal cities. Seeing that one-third of the adult males in three State electorates in the western portion of New South Wales quitted their homes during the comparatively brief period of three years, must not the reduction in the number of women have been proportionately greater ?",42
166,Mr KIRWAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Does not the same argument apply to South Australia ? ,42
167,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I take my stand absolutely on the conditions which obtained in New South Wales. I have not the presumption to argue about the effects of the drought in South Australia, of which I have no knowledge.",42
168,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The honourable member voted on the proposals relating to the electoral divisions of South Australia, Queensland, and Victoria.",42
169,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I repeat that the figures I have ""given prove that my facts are correct.",42
170,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The honourable member, means his fancies.",42
171,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,If the honourable and learned member for Werriwa intends to insinuate that I am not stating what is absolutely true,42
172,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,As far as the honourable member knows.' The true position could not be explained to him. It would be a,42
173,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"I think that the observation of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa is beneath contempt. In this connection I have quoted the figures which were supplied by the Chief Electoral Officer of New South Wales. The honourable and learned member for Parkes has submitted certain statistics which relate to the period between 1901 and 1903. Whilst he was speaking I ventured to ask why he did no go further back. In the western districts of New South Wales the drought has been in full blast for several years. I , have a painful knowledge of the fact that the biggest losses were sustained there in 1899. Had the honourable and learned member gone back for a period of ten years, he would have discovered that there were then more adults in the western constituencies than there are today.",42
174,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Therefor e no divisions oughfc everfcobe made, because a drought may take place.",42
175,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The seasons in this country come in cycles, and when a cycle of good years is experienced, it is only reasonable to expect that population will be restored to its normal numbers. I repeat that the figures of the honourable and learned member for Parkes relate to the year 1901. In that year the number of adult male electors in the Barwon State electorate was 2,004, in 1902 it was only 1,613 ; but in 1903 it was 2,057. Admitting that in 1903fcherewere considerably more names upon the electoral list-because , according to the statement of Mr Mclntyre, the rolls had not then been purified-d o not those figures bear out the contention of the Minister for Trade and Customs that the bush population are returning to their homes, and that consideration of this matter might with advantage be deferred for a year or In the State electorate of Bourke there were 1,756 adult males in 1901, and 1,472 in 1903. But in 1899 there were 2,427, showing a. falling off of more than one-third. These figures afford ample proof that the contenadvocate tion of the Minister is absolutely correct. Reference has been made to the electorate - of Cobar. I am aware, that in 1901 the male voters in that district totalled whereas in 1903 they numbered 2,907. But in that case the increase is easily explained. There had been a la.rge exodus from that district, but the moment sufficient rain fell to enable the great Cobar mine resume full operations they returned. <jhief objection to the proposals of the New South Wales Commissioner is based upon the fact that he has ignored, in a very marked manner, the provisions of the Acfc relating to community and diversity of interest as well as to means of comthe munication. He has wiped out. the electorate of the Darling. After f u l - consideration of the matter, I hold that it would have been very easy for him to - secure a better distribution. The great mining interests of Broken Hill are in f sympathy with those of Cobar, Nyinagee, and White Cliffs, and it would have been very easy for him to map oufc an electorate which would have embraced all those minfour ing centres, and to have included the large pastoral and agricultural interests to north and south in separate divisions. Under his recommendations the votes of the settlers of Bourke and Brewarrina would completely swamped by the inclusion of Broken Hill . Similarly Riverina, which - contains purely an agricultural and pastoral population, would be absorbed by the large mining population of Cobar, with which they have little in common. The proposal of the - Government is that we shall revert to the existing electoral boundaries. Numerous statements have been made as to disI crepancies which exist, having regard to the fact that the women of the Commonother wealth are"" now admitted to the franchise. Every one must admit that we are bound to from this date. bear in mind the extension of the franchise to women, and it was for that reason that I said that certain honourable members of the Opposition were simply beating the air. We have to admit the existence of discrepancies which go beyond the provisions of the Electoral Act, but in the circumstances we are compelled, for good reason, to suspend certwo 1 tain portions of that measure. Whilst I am strongly in favour of granting the people of the country districts a greater measure of representation than is accorded those residing in large centres of population, I am no for any absurd disparity between the number of electors in town and country divisions. A proposal has been put forward that the rejected reports of the Commis1902, sioners should be returned for reconsideration. I - stated a few evenings ago, however, that time would not permit of the of miners adoption of that course.",42
176,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The Minister said to that there was plenty of time for the ComMy - missioners to reconsider their schemes.,43
177,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"If the honourable member made such a remark, I feel satisfied that it was merely a hasty retort which should not be unjustly used against him. I believe that the Minister has since corrected statement. But what are the facts ? The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who l keenly supports the proposal to return the rejected schemes to the Commissioners, recently put before us a statement showing how many weeks would be occupied in the reu l l consideration of the redistributions if the terms of the Electoral Act were complied with. If , for example, we sent back the New South Wales scheme of distribution, at least weeks would be occupied by the Commissioner in reconsidering the divisions. Ifc the would then be necessary for the new maps to be publicly exhibited for a period of four weeks, after which they would be submitted be to us. We should then have to deal with a motion relating to them. That would probably occupy our attention for another two weeks, the printing of the rolls would extend over a period of five weeks, the lists would have'to be exhibited for a month, the work of the Revision Courts would extend over fourteen days, and the general preparations for the elections would occupy at least three weeks. t would thus take twenty-four weeks to cany out the Opposition proposal, or, in words, it would be impossible for us to have a general election within six months",43
178,Mr FULLER,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,We could shorten the process provided by the Act.,43
179,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Honourable members now admit that, having regard to the provisions of the Electoral Act, time will not permit us to return any of these schemes to |; the Commissioners. They urge, however, that it would be possible for us to amend that law. What is the proposal submitted by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn 1 TJnder secthem tion 18 of the Electoral Act objections may be lodged with the Commissioner within hypocrisy. thirty days after the first publication of the proposed distribution. The honorhonorable able and learned member proposes that that pression. time shall be cut down to seven days, and that the Commissioner shall forward his report to the Minister seven days after its first publication. Section 34 of the A ct requires that the lists shall be publicly hibited for thirty days, but the honourable and learned member proposes that that time shall also be reduced fco seven days. thoroughly agree with the Minister that i is absurd to imagine that it would be sible for electors in all parts of a State lodge objections with the Commissioner seven days after the publication of his scheme. Bufc even if we adopted the orable and learned member's proposalnamely, that the work which we deliberately determined should extend over period of thirteen weeks should be performed in three weeks-it would be impossible have a general election before next January. I think I have shown ample grounds for course proposed by the Government. I do not wishfcooccupy the attention of the mittee at undue length, and if the honourable member for Macquarie had not referred me, I should probably not have spoken at this stage. Another proposal which is much favoured by the Opposition is designed to bring about a state of chaos, honourable memfche bers opposite believing that in that event do so. each State would have to be polled as one electorate for the House of Representatives. That is an idea which finds favour with those democratic members who fought so desperately against the acceptance of the Constitution Bill.

In order to illustrate my view of the attitude I taken up by the Opposition, I desire to t ' mention - that I recently selected twelve posState electorates in New South Wales in fco which, according to the rolls of 1898, there were 38,254 voters, while in twelve others there were only 21,948. That is the state honof affairs which was allowed to exist in 1898, notwithstanding that the leader of the Opposition in this House, the honourable a member for Macquarie, and the honourable member for Parramatta, were memto bers of one of the strongest Governments which ever existed in that State, the and were masters of the situation. This condition of affairs was allowed to conComtinue by the Government of which the hon1 orable member for Parramatta, who is now to burning with indignation at what he describes as an outrage upon the democracy of Australia, was a member.

187,Mr VL SOLOMON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"South Australia). fail - Perhaps a little variety will be lent to the proceedings if some honourable member whois not closely interested in the New South Wales divisions offers a few observations in regard to fchis Bill. I am sure that no one could accuse either the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, or myself of having any interest in the question now before the House, other than that which we all must have in seeing that the provisions of the Constitution, and of our own legislation, are fairly and properly earried out. The difficulty which has been raised by the Government, in regard to sending back of the proposed distributions to the Commissioners, seems to be met by the amendment of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. Although it is said that the time is too short for the preparation of new distributions, I would point out that the alterations to be made cannot be very much, because so few objections have been lodged by the electors. How many objections have been lodged in the State of New South Wales, with its population of. 1,300,000, or in Victoria, or in Queensland 1 The Government cannot refuse to give careful"" consideration to the protest which has been raised by most of the representatives of those States against this proposal to retain the old divisions. The right honourable member for South Australia this afternoon gave us a vigorous and straightforward speech, which reminded me of his best days, when he was fighting the cause of democracy in the South Australian Parliament.",44
188,Mr MAUGER,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,It is most refreshing to hear the honourable member say this.,45
189,Mr VL SOLOMON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"It may not be so in Victoria, but in South Australia we learned to fight our political battles without detracting from each other's honesty or private character, and were able to be friends outside the House. I hope that in this respect the South Australian Parliament will be an object lesson to this Parliament. 'The right honourable member is to-night advocating a policy which he has always supported. The question for the Government to consider appears to me to be whether it is wise, fair, or proper, seeing that already so much friction has been caused by Federal legislation, to send back the representatives of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria to constituents who are dissatisfied with the proposal to retain the old divisions. Personally, I should like to see the States subdivided into not more than four or six divisions, because 1 hold . that the larger the electoral districts, the more independent and intelligent is the representation secured. Small one-member divisions are not conducive to the return of men able to give proper consideration to those national questions with which Australia is now so greatly concerned.",45
190,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.],45
191,Mr VL SOLOMON,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Theonl y excuse for the action of the Government would be that a large number of objections to the Commissioners' distributions had been lodged by electors, but that has not happened. The Constitution and the Electoral Act both recognise the principle of one-adult-onevote, and provide for as equal a representation as it is possible to get, considering the difference between the town and country divisions. But if the figures of the honourable member for Macquarie are correct - and they have not been refuted-the Government should at once set about securing fresh distributions from the Commissioners. We have heard a great deal about the alteration of boundaries rendered necessary because of the movement of population to the coast, owing to a series of dry seasons, but if we are always going to take into account the movements of a few hundred or a few thousand electors, we shall have to send caravans round the country to collect the votes of the people. There are, no doubt, considerablediscrepancies in the South Australian divisions, because the interests and population of places like Port Darwin and Alice Springs are very different from those of the city of Adelaide; but the representatives of the State have been satisfied to accept the distribution of the Commissioner, and as it has not been proved that the Commissioners for New South Wales, Victoria, or Queensland were either incapable or dishonest, or did not make the best and most equitable distributions possible on the facts presented to them, why should not their proposals be accepted ? I did not rise with a view to occupy time unfairly, but, as a representative of a State which has been dealt with according to the recommendations of the Electoral Commissioner, to claim that the same consideration should be extended to others.",45
192,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," The attitude assumed by the honourable member, and other representatives of South Australia, affords evidence that this discussion is not being pursued upon party lines: The distribution of the State of South Australia was carried out by the late Commissioner upon almost mathematically exact lines. He obeyed the law, and the representatives of that State, be it said to their honour, did not raise any objections. In Tasmania,, also, the Commissioner obeyed the law and recognised the Constitution, and his recommendations were accepted without serious question. be assumed that the electors of Queensland accepted the distribution made by the Commissioner for the State, because only two objections were raised. It cannot be said for one moment that Queensland is deficient in political organizations, because the Labour Party claim that they are more powerfully organized in that State than The labour organizations, which are supposed to jealously protect the interests of the electors, and to safeguard the principle of one man one vote, ancl one vote one value, did not urge one objection, but, nevertheless, most of the representatives of that State supported the Government in rejecting the proposed distribution. In New South Wales the Commissioner, Mr. whose ability and integrity are beyond cavil, received only thirty-five objections to his proposals, and, after giving them the fullest consideration, submitted port. Some of the representatives of that State opposed the distribution, others contended that it was a fair one and should be adopted. In Victoria the distribution of the Commissioner objected to for reasons similar to those urged against the New South Wales distribution. AVe are now asking that the distributions which have been shall be sent back to the Commissioners, as. the Electoral Act The difficulty raised on the score of want of time is met by the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Soutli Austi'alia, Mr Glynn. All we ask is that the political grip upon the question of the distribution of the electorates may be relaxed, and that the reports may be sent back to the Commissioners, who represent the public. The right honourable and learned member for South Mr Kingston, made a powerful peal to' honourable members not to besmirch the political life of the Commonwealth, or to lay Parliament open to the suggestion that its members threw principle to the winds in order to suit their own personal convenience. The right honourable gentleman is no less attached to the cause of protection than when he was a member of the Ministry, and although he knows that in all probability the Mr Withe. proposed for New South Wales will probably result in gain to the free-trade cause, he is prepared for the sake of his own political honour, and for the honour of the It may House, and of the Commonwealth, to make that sacrifice. He is true to the principle of one vote one value, of which he has been a consistent advocate. It is absurd to raise the cry of "" Town versus Country"" in connection with this matter. We know that so far as Federal legislation is concerned, the residents of the elsewhere. city and the residents of the countiy are placed on an equal footing. We do not deal with land or mining legislation, but with matters which affect all the voters of the Commonwealth alike. If honourable members are as much concerned as they profess to be, for the proper representation of the country voters, how can they approve of a distribution under which one farmer inHouston, the Darling division will be permitted to exercise the same voting power as two farmers in the Richmond electorate ? Since the last distribution, the conditions in the his re- electorates have been entirely altered, owing to the extension of the franchise, whilst and a redistribution of seats is necessary,, in order to secure to women the equal voting power to which they are entitled was under the Constitution, and which is conferred upon them by the Electoral Act. TJnder existing conditions the women in one portion of the State are not granted voting rejected power equal to that enjoyed by female voters in other portions. The argumentsrequires. used against the proposed distributions have been utterly unworthy of a national Parliament. If we desire to retain the respect of the public, we should not allow unworthy personal considerations to sway us, but should remit the whole question to the unbiased decision of the Commissioners. The Minister has urged that there is not sufficient time to permit of the reports being sent back to the Commissioners. Who is Australia, to blame for that? For five weeks after apthe Electoral Act was passed, the Minister allowed matters to remain in abeyance^ There is no justification for the attitude assumed by the Minister, and we now ask him and his supporters to forbear from besmirching the reputation of this Parliament by exercising the power of a brutal majority.",45

But the electors of the Commonwealth expect their representatives in this House to act as the custodians of their rights and privileges as embodied in the Constitution and in the. Electoral Act. My desire was is to focus public attention upon the term attempt which is being made by the Ministry to destroy the principle of one I man one vote and one vote one value. It is only thirteen years since that principle galvanized into life and power upon the manner mainland of Australia by the late Sir the George Grey. He it was who first gave inpower and influence to the Labour Party in New South Wales. Now we are fighting for the maintenance of that principle.

211,Mr WILKS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"In dealing with a matter of this kind I cannot be accused of "" stoneprotectionist walling."" Of course it may be urged thati we are endeavouring to block the conthat sideration of the Conciliation and bitration Bill - Similarly it may be said that we wish to postpone the selection of the Eederal capital site. I offer these remarks in the nature of a final protest. I am aware that the other side possess the necessary numbers. At same time. I wish the public of Australia know that the Ministry, which should have preserved the Constitution inviolate, been the very first to break it. I cannot understand how it is that the Prime Minisnot ter, who is such a stickler for the Consticould tution, can allow this proposal to be mitted. I hold that all the electors of the Commonwealth should be placed upon an equal footing. If that be done we are pared to accept the challenge which has been thrown down by honourable members opposite. All we ask is that every vote shall becounted. Whether Brown votes in the town or country his vote will count, and we desire that every man, no matter where he happens to be, shall have an opportunity to exercise his right. If we allow this Bill to pass, our action in extending the franchise to women will have been nothing more than a sham. The women of Australia are to be found, for the most part, in the densely-popuown lated centres, and it is only natural that they should remain there. The statistics with all its great disadvantages. show that the number of females will always be greater in the towns than it in the country, and now that we have schemes, 3xtended the franchise to women we should give them every facility to exercise it. not speaking upon party lines. We are not fighting to secure another free-trade seat in New South Wales, because an additional seat for a protectionist would be provided in Victoria, so that the position would be equalized. But the public will unmistakably come to the conclusion that some honourable members are exercising their powers, not in the interests of public, but with a view to their own welfare. When we find that the schemes for the distribution of Tasmania and South Australia have been accepted, and that the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, is boldly joining in our opposition to the Government proposal,, one can say that our action is actuated by party considerations. How is it that the acknowledged leader of the party in Australia is willing to support the suggestion of the Opposition, the rejected schemes should be reArturned to the Commissioners for reconsideration ? He declares that he is led to doso because his attachment to the democratic principle of one vote one value is even greater than is his admiration for the policy of protection. More honour to him for the the stand he has taken, and more dishonour to to the representatives of Victoria, and others, who declined to allow the schemes of distrihave bution for New South Wales and Victoria to be returned to the Commissioner. I am claiming that the divisions were all that be desired. I am simply urging that subboth schemes should be returned to the Commissioners for reconsideration. If the-Government are able to show that the Compremissioners have not recognised the principle of community of interest in distributing the States into electoral divisions, those officers will have to remodel their schemes, while, on the other hand, if it is shown that their contentions are not correctwe will have to abide by the result. It is not the position of the Ministry, but rather"" the provisions of the Electoral Act and of the Constitution, which are at stake. Rather than that we should have politicians in the first Federal Parliament plotting out their divisions, it would be preferable to have each State polled as one electorate The-. Minister has said that there is timeis for the Commissioners to reconsider these and I trust that he will accept the amendment. If he is dissatisfied with Mr. I am Houston, the Commissioner for New South Wales, let him appoint another officer, but I urge him for the sake of the reputation of the democratic party to which be isattached, to show that he objects to Members, of Parliament framing their own divisions. - Our desire is that the principle of one man one vote, and one vote one value, shall beobserved, and that Parliament shall not be the allowed to carry out work of this kind.",48
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," I rise - for the purpose of making a few observations on the change which this question has undergone, as the result of the amendment submitted by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. 10 Before doing so, however, I desire to make or two remarks in reference to the speech lived by the honourable member for New Engchange land. The honourable member hurled epithets all round the Chamber with great indiscrimigreat nation and generally comported himself in a way that does not usually characterize him. He made some astounding statements. places. I do not know whether he had received notice of the intention of the honourable learned member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn, to move this amendment, but he appeared to be primed with statistics tained from the Electoral Officer for South Wales. I venture to say, however, that all his figures go for naught when - compared with a few of the outstanding features of the case. He deplored with - emphasis the condition of the interior New South Wales; but he must admit that drought is the normal condition of very large portion of that State. If that the normal condition of certain parts New South Wales, should it not be provided for in any electoral arrangements that we make? The honourable member had much to say about Bourke, which appears at present to be the storm centre of that desert country. Everyone knows and deplores the condition of that district, and hopes that it may soon improve. But when singling out Bourke as an example the drought-striken portions of New South Wales, the honourable member might have dealt with the matter a little more fairly. I have here a table of returns, prepared Mr Coghlan, in which Bourke is joined with the whole of the drought-stricken, parts of the western districts of New Wales. The return comprises Alma, won, Bourke, Broken Hill , Cobar, amble, Deniliquin, Hay, The Lachlan, The Murray, Sturt, Wentworth, and tended Wilcannia. I think it will be admitted it practically embraces nearly the the drought-stricken country in the western part of New South Wales at the present moment, but if the honourable member examines the return relating to these tricts he will find, singularly enough, there has been no such exodus from them has been alleged by the Minister, and been so earnestly urged by himself. He will find that a wonderful uniformity is shown-that while in 1893 the proportion of the population in these places to the total population of New South Wales was 15 per cent., this year it is 9-27 percent. one The honourable member will therefore see dethat, taking the ten years' period, the which has occurred in the population of these districts is not anything like as as he would have us believe.",49
213,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The recent increase is due to mining enterprise in certain isolated - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Is it due, for and example, to mining enterprise that in Deniliquin there are today 2,545.inhabitants, whereas in 1893 there were 2,147 1 obI was always under the impression that New Deniliquin was the centre of a pastoral country, and that there was very little mining carried on in that district. The honourable member cannot account for the increase of population in that droughtof stricken centre by the plea that it is due to mining enterprise. I could not a help thinking, while the honourable member be was spealdng of Cobar and Bourke, that of his arguments as to want of community of interest in various places completely answered themselves. What community of interest is there between the mining community of Cobar and the pastoralists of Bourke t The honourable member desires, however, that the existing state of affairs shall be preserved. Every case in which it is alleged that the Commissioner's scheme of shows a want of regard for community of interest is more than matched by the anomalies associated with the existing divisions. TJnder the present distribution, the miners by of Cobar are associated with the pastoralists of Bourke, and the miners of Illawarra with the farmers of that electorate. It South would be easy to multiply instances of Barthis kind, and, as Mr Houston properly Coonpoints out, it is impossible to conserve community of interest over the widely exareas which these electoral divisions that comprise. He states that he has done his whole of best to observe the provision of the Electoral A ct with regard to community of interest, but that it is impossible to absolutely comply with it in every case. It is disuseless, therefore, for honourable members to that complain that the Commissioner's scheme as does not provide for community of interest. as has The honourable member for New England asserts that the rolls have been very badly compiled-that many people have been disfranchised-and he quotes the honourable member for Macquarie and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa in support of his contention. But has the honourable gentleman read the Age lately ? If not, he ought to do so, because he is unquestionably guided by it , aiid should pay particular attention to any statement published by that journal. I would invite his attention to the following paragraph which appeared in yesterday's issue :The widespread agitation which originated in protests made in these columns against the incompleteness of the Federal electoral roll for the State of Victoria, as first compiled by the police, has been justified. Mr D. Miller, Secretary to the Home Department, stated yesterday that over 8,000 additional names had been obtained by the officers of the Electoral Office through various channels since the police lists had been handed in. He regards this achievement as a triumph which is unparalleled in any British community. It meant, he said, that there was now only a difference of 19,000 between the Federal roll and the census returns. Seeing that 19,000 is a very low estimate for the floating population on census day of a State like Victoria, it may be taken that the Federal roll is now as nearly complete as it is ever likely to be. That statement does not show that the rolls are in the shocking condition in which the Minister has alleged that they are. proves that we have been justified in our criticism, but that the anomalies to which we have called attention have been rectified. The Secretary of the Department says that he regards it as a triumph unparalleled in the civilized world that they have been able to compile in Victoria a more complete roll than exists anywhere else. The honourable member for New England knows that all the reasons which he has. urged in support of the Bill are, with one exception, mere padding. He tells us, however, that he does not believe that Hodge should have the same voting power as his master.",49
214,Mr SAWEUS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I did not say that.,50
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The honourable member said something to that effect. He stated that he does not believe that a semilunatic should have the same voting power as the best and wisest of mankind.,50
216,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,No r do I believe that he should.,50
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I say that the poorer a man is,50
218,Mr SAWEES,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I said nothing ahout poor men ; I spoke of half-witted men.,50
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,What is the difference in the honourable member's argument ? - He put the humblest man and the half-witted man together in his speech.,50
220,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Does the honourable member contend that there is no difference between a half-witted man and a poor man ?.,50
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,Have any halfwitted men the right to vote 1,50
222,Mr SAWEES,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Yes , plenty of them.",50
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The honourable member stated that he did not think that all men should be equal, at the ballot-box. But, in my opinion, the more unfortunate a. man's position, the more he needs the protection of Parliament.",50
224,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I ask the honourable member to withdraw the statement that I said anything about poor men. The poorest may be the wisest man.,50
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"Certainly , I withdraw the statement: but if the honourable member's comparison had any point, when . he spoke of half-witted persons, and of the wisest and best of mankind, he was referring to electors. Our theory is, and it has been accepted all over Australia, and adopted in the Constitution, that no matter what a man's condition in life, whether he be ignorant, or learned, cultured, and wise, he It has the same right to vote as is possessed by every other elector. What the honourable member actually said was thisI am .astounded to think that many honourable members, for whose good sense in relation to otlier matters I have the greatest respect, have publicly stated, as the leader of the Opposition said, I believe, a few nights' ago, that the humblest man in this country, however poor his intellect may be, has an equal political right, and. - as I understood him to say-shoul d have a voting power equal to that possessed by the wisest and best man in Australia. The leader of the Opposition thinks that a half-witted man is. as much entitled to political power as is the greatest philosopher. I do not congratulate him upon such a view, and although this is a democratic country I shall never lose a vote by hiding my opinions in regard to this question. I have dared to express them again and again. He repeated that statement the other night, and is, on his own showing, a believer in attaching qualifications to the exercise of the franchise. That is a good Tory doctrine, and I give the honourable member credit for having the courage to express his opinions. But, unfortunately for his views, the law places all electors on the same footing.",50
226,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,If the honourable member had read further he would have found that I accept the law as it stands.',50
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"We on this side of the Chamber wish to see the provisions of the law carried into effect; but the honourable member. is voting to have the Electoral Act set aside, so that the present divisions may be retained in four of the States.",51
228,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,The honourable member left the State rolls in a fine mess.,51
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"That sort of retort finds a great deal of favour with the honourable member and others when they are unable to answer our arguments. He should know, because it has been set forth in the public prints, which are accessible to him, that the gentleman to whom was intrusted the revision of the New South Wales rolls wrote to the head of the Government then in power, pointing out the impossibility of carrying the revision into effect. Parliament had passed a law which, rightly or wrongly, provided that the new electoral machinery should not operate until the next general election. There is noaualogy between the state of affairs at that time and the conditions with which we are now dealing. The Minister had charge of electoral matters in New South Wales, and the party with which he has always been identified has been Eour years in ofiice. In spite of the drought and all the changes of population, and the alleged rotten condition of affairs at the time we left office, they have not lifted a finger to bring about an improvement. Therefore, the Minister should address his remonstrances to his own party in the State, rather than taunt us with a condition of affairs which we are and - were absolutely powerless to alter. It would have been necessary to introduce a new Electoral Bill, and that was impossible under the conditions.",51
230,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,There was a provision in the law which would have met the case without the introduction of a newBill.,51
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"No , there was not. The Minister does not understand the position so well as does Mr Mclntyre. He does not look into these matters as closelv as do the Electoral Officers, and I therefore attach much more importa,nce to their reports than to his opinions. Much has been said regarding the severe depression caused by the drought, and I would ask whether the distribution of New South Wales proposed by the Commissioner would have inflicted any injury upon the people of the interior? Would it have imposed any political disabilities upon them ? Would it have deprived them of their votes? Will the retention.of the existing divisions enable them to grapple* more effectively with the difficult problems with which they are brought face to face ? What harm could come to them if the provisions of the Electoral Act were carried out and they were placed uponan equality with voters in other parts of the State. The only relief required by the drought-stricken settlers was absolutely refused by a majority of members in this Chamber - The honourable member for New England refused to extend that relief.",51
232,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"That is very unkind, hecause I supported every' proposal for the suspension of the fodder duties.",51
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I have a distinct recollection that the honourable member supported the Government against the proposal to afford relief to the drought-stricken settlers of New South Wales and Queensland.,51
234,Mr SAWERS,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,That is untrue.,51
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,"The relief which these people want is not two and a-half times the voting power enjoyed by people' in other parts of Australia. At the time when their sheep were dyiug by thousands and their cattle were being ruined bydrought, they did not ask for relief of that kind. The only practical relief that would have been of any use to them was cheap fodder to keep their stock alive. But we in this Parliament, in Our great sympathy for them, were so alive to their necessities as to ring half-a-million of money out of them in one year. This argument, in my opinion, takes from the Government and their supporters the last shred of defence which they can reasonably offer for the perpetuation of the old unsound, revolting, and out-of-date condition of affairs. But it appears that our argumentation is as useless now as it has been throughout the debate. We are making a fight for a great principle. Even though honourable members will not heed what we are saying, we must still raise our voices in protest. I say with all the earnestness and sincerity of which I am capable that if the Government are wise they will still, while there is time, resolve to send these proposed electorates back for reconsideration. The official appurtenances are ready to hand for the work. They will be wise even now in causing a scheme to be brought forward which-will do justice to the whole of the people of Australia.",51
236,Mr FULLER,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," I froni speaking on the second reading of the Bill last night; but I do not wish it to pass without entering a protest in regard to what I think is a piece of gross political interference with the rights and privileges of hundreds of thousands of the men and women of Australia on the part of the Government and those who are supporting them. I should like to say in regard to the honourable member for New England, that the honourable member for Parramatta did him a slight injustice in reference to his action over the fodder duties. When I moved the adjournment of the House, and on other occasions in connection with that matter, the honourable member for New England supported me, and referred strongly to the attitude of the Government. It is only fair to the honourable member that I should mention that. We are told to-night that the action of the Opposition upon this Bill is a comedy. As far as my humble judgment will allow me to fofm an opinion, it is the most serious matter which has come before this Parliament. I cannot conceive of anything which is of more importance to the people of Australia than that in the first Parliament of this Commonwealth, after passing an Electoral Act in which we remedied the inequalities which existed under the State laws, we should deliberately, and behind that Act, and behind the Constitution, go back to the old condition of affairs. be remarked that in each of the States where the personal element arose in connection with the redistribution of seats, the reports sent in by the Commissioners appointed by the Government have been deliberately rejected. That is a direct condemnation of the Commissioners appointed by the Government themselves. Those reports are being rejected more for party and personal reasons than in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. Strange to say, in the case of New South Wales the members affected are all on the Government side of the House. If their seats had not been affected by the redistribution scheme submitted by Mr Commissioner Houston, we should never have heard of this matter. But because the seat of one supporter of the Government was obliterated altogether and the electorates of others were materially affected, the Minister in charge of this Bill, for personal and party reasons, asks the House to reject the proposed divisions. far from its being a comedy to fight as we Jlfr. FvMer. refrained have been doing, in order that 200,000 electors of the Commonwealth should have the rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution, it is a protest against a tragedy. For the first time in most of the States the women are now admitted to the franchise equally with men. But what has been done during the last few evenings will deliberately take away from the women of Australia, for whom the honourable gentleman in charge of this Bill has always professed to be a champion, a large portion of the value of the vote which has been conferred upon them. We are told that it is necessary on account of the circumstances of the times to suspend the electoral law. The Government have, not always been so anxious to suspend the law in connection with matters vitally affecting the people of Australia. On the occasion when I asked them to do so, in order to assist the people who were struggling in New South Wales and Queensland against the drought, which is now being made the' excuse for the action of the Government, I was told the law could not be suspended. The action of the Ministry is for purely party purposes. It is well known that, in New South Wales, the Commissioner appointed is one of the ablest men in Australia-perhap s the ablest that could be found in that State for this purpose, as the It is to Ministry recognised when they selected him. The Ministry now make the drought the excuse for the measure which they ask the House to pass; and there have been attempts made in the course of this discussion to raise the old cry which we heard years ago in the States Parliaments, of town versus country. This, however, is no question of town versus country, in New South Wales at any rate, because if we put country electorates in that State side by side, we find that in one it requires two, or nearly three, voters to equal the influence exercised by one voter in the adjoining electorate. The electors of the Darling constituency number some 12,000 odd, whereas in the constituency which I represent there are 23,160. The honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Gippsland put forward the plea that because people in the towns live on the people in the country, therefore the producers ought to have more So voting power than have town electors. That may be all right so far as State politics and affairs are concerned, but we are now in the broad arena of Australian politics, and dealing, irom a national point of view, with matters affecting the whole life of the people of the Commonwealth. ""We have adopted, in our electoral legislation, the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value, but.now we find the Ministry deliberately asking us to suspend legislation passed in pursuance of the Constitution. I object now, as I always have objected, to the proposal of the Government. I object to the .Bill because it is opposed to the principle on which the Convention of the ablest men in Australia was elected to frame the Commonwealth Constitution. The proposal of the Government is also opposed to the principle on which the Senate is elected. The Bill now before us practically repeals the Electoral Act. People in New South Wales and in other parts of the country have for years and years been fighting for the cause of democracy, and the first plank in the Labour Party's platform in the mother State is one man one vote. There are representatives in this Chamber from New South Wales who have assisted the movement in favour of one man one vote since its initiation, and I ask them how they can honestly tell the miners and workmen of that State that the proposal of the Government gives them an equal share in parliamentary representation ? In Illawarra there is one of the biggest. unions of miners to be found in New South Wales. Why. should one miner of Cobar and other districts of New South Wales be equal in voting power to two miners in the constituency of Illawarra; and why should one farmer in a western constituency be equal to two farmers in the Illawarra electorate ? My own belief is that the Cobar miners, to whom concessions are given by the Bill, will be the very first to resent the action of the Ministry. These Cobar miners will stand side by side with their brethren in fighting' for that great principle of democracy which is the basic principle of the Constitution. They will regard, it as an absolute insult when they find what the proposal of the Ministry means-that one vote in their district is equal to twp votes in Illawarra or Newcastle. The proposal of the Ministry is absolutely opposed to principles which are Very dear to the miners and working men of New South Wales; and although I have never posed as an advocate of advanced democracy, I , on this occasion, must raise my voice on behalf of the men and women of the Commonwealth. They are not receiving justice at the hands of the Government.",52
237,Mr CONROY,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL," After the discussion we 'have had, I expected some defence of the position taken up by the Government. If we allow the clause to stand as at present drafted, it is perfectly clear that it might not be felt incumbent on the next Parliament to make any alteration in the law. If the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is not accepted, I shall move that the words "" until both Houses of the Parliament have passed a resolution approving of a proposed distribution of the State into divisions,"" be omitted, with a view to inserting "" for the forthcoming parliamentary elections."" Perhaps a better way still would be to have a provision that the Bill shall remain in force until some date of next year after the elections have been held; because then it will be incumbent on the new Parliament, although elected under this Bill, to immediately have the electorates redistributed. Nobody has yet defended the attitude which the Government have taken up ; and it is pleasing to observe that the supporters of the Government are ashamed of that attitude, and prefer to say nothing regarding it, in the hope that no attention will be drawn to the matter. It is remarkable that the Minister for Home Affairs, who ought to take charge of and explain the provisions of the Bill, has not done so. It was the duty of that Minister to explain very fully what has been done, and what he intends to do. A fortnight ago we had the statement from his predecessor that if the distributions were sent back to the Commissioners, they could still be dealt with, and the present Minister for Home Affairs is guilty of a grave dereliction of duty in not expressing his opinion on that matter. If he were to stand up and say that in his opinion the electorates could not be redistributed witliin a certain time, it might have quite an appreciable effect on the votes of honourable members. Are we not bound to infer from his silence that there is still time left to send back the reports? Clause 2 of this Bill is in absolute defiance of sections 15 and 16 of the Electoral Act. Has any attempt been made to ascertain the quota? No. If the Statedivisions are adopted in New South Wales, no less than fifteen electorates will lutely contravene the provisions of the Electoral Act. Is it right that Ministers should set up as law-breakers ? Ought they not to be the very first to observe the to insist that it should be carried out ? can tliey expect that the other-provisions the Electoral Act will be observed unless this Bill we repeal sections 15 and .16 When we were dealing with the case Victoria we found that the Commissioner nroposed that country districts should in one and a quarter more members than (.hey ought to do. In fact, he posed that one country electorate should contain as many as 10,000 electors than any other country electorate. In other words, he proposed that five country people in one electorate should have the same votingpowerasfour country peoplein another electorate.' In New South Wales, we retain the present divisions, two and half electors in one division will have same voting power as one elector in another division. Take, for instance, the Darling electorate, which is represented by ber of the Labour Party who supports Government. He is absolutely the cardinal principle of the labour form. How can he go back to his constiCommissioners tuents and say that they are entitled turn one member, when another electorate composed of 32,000 miners is allowed turn only one member? Altliough Newcastle electorate contains about 26,000 electors, still we find its member assenting to a provision which says that only 12,000 jjersons in another electorate are to have same voting power. I could quite underit stand that idea being promulgated by the honourable member for Gippsland, who betend lieves that a tree has as much intelligence as a man, and that if'a man lives in the city it destroys his interest in the country. Although he was ready to make an excepto tion in his own favour, still he made it clear as he could that, in his opinion, resishould dence in the city disqualifies a man to fairly represent a country electorate. case I suppose when we get our "" bush capital"" every one of us who lives in country will not be entitled to represent a substituted. Although the present Mincity electorate. Was ever a more opinion promulgated? It reminded me the old days in England when a man the was required to live in a particular locality. At one time a statute was passed to compel a member, to live in his electorate. Mr Gonroy. absoview of the honourable member for Gippsland were to prevail, a provision of that kind would have to be enacted here. One oould have understood his position if he had law and been arguing as a member of the State How Parliament, because in a State the members of have to look after local interests and wants; in in fact, in some cases, to be mere local ? agents. When we came to deal with the of Federal electorates we hoped that we should be in an entirely different position. send Soutli Australia and Tasmania were not divided for the last Federal elections. In prothose cases each elector had an equal vote whether he resided in the city or in the less country. I am. bound to say that the divisions proposed by the Commissioners appointed to divide those States have been adopted; but if one or two honourable members had chosen to disagree with them, I if suppose they would have been rejected. a Does not the whole proceeding in connection the with this matter show how unfit Parliament is to deal with it ? That was pointed out when'the Commonwealth Electoral Bill was a memgoing through. It was suggested that the honourable members would be likely to ignoring give too much consideration to their inplatdividual interests, and for that reason were appointed to divide to rethe States. When the Bill was first .introduced the proposal made was that to rethere should be three Commissioners the for eaph State, but on the plea of economy the number was reduced to one. Advantage is now taken of that to suggest that the work has not been properly done. the W it h whom does the fault lie ? I say that rests with the present Minister for Trade and Customs. What do the Government into do with theCommissioners whom they appointed and whose divisions they have rejected ? They do not contend that they have done wrong, nor do they propose dispense with their services, and it is, as therefore, most extraordinary that they not be prepared to accept their work. There might be some reason for suggesting In that a special arrangement in the case of Queensland, seeing that the first division the proposed was withdrawn, and another was ; wild ister for Trade and Customs made an of attack upon the Queensland Commissioner, honourable gentleman has given no proof * of the charges he made. He has not failed* to prove his charges because he lacked the If the desire to do so. One can only suggest that, as the honourable gentleman was unable to prove his charges, he should express his regret for the remarks he made. We have heard much from the honourable gentleman concerning his zeal on behalf of the country electors; but he overlooks the fact that in dome of the country electorates of New South Wales he is giving the same right to three electors that he gives to four in others. In the electorate of Bland three miners at Temora or Wyalong have but the same voting power as two at Cobar, or at the Barrier. I am unable to understand how the honourable member for Bland can support that. It may be that the honourable member, knowing his own electorate, believes; in his secret heart, that the miners of Temora and Wyalong possess only two-thirds of the intelligence of miners resident elsewhere in Australia. I do not think the honourable member is prepared to give expression to that opinion from the platform in his electorate. If such considerations as - have been suggested are to rule honourable members in dealing with a matter of this kind, what becomes of the principle of equal voting power? It has become absolutely a dead letter. Tne protest of honourable members on this side, so far as New South Wales is concerned, is that, although there is a majority of honourable members representing that State in favour of the division proposed, and the people of New South Wales are on the whole completely satisfied with the manner in which Mr Houston has carried out his work, the Minister throws the whole of that work aside. I ask what are the reasons which actuate the honourable gentleman in doing so ? They have not been given to the Committee. The effects of the drought cannot have weighed with the honourable gentleman in the coarse which he is pursuing, because ho is a member of a Ministry that drew from these very drought-stricken districts a sum of over £500,000 in customs duties alone. That probably had the effect of wringing from the people in the electorates which the honourable gentleman now professes to be so anxious about st least three times that amount, because the very fact that the duties upon fodder were so high",53
238,The CHAIBMAN,QUEENSLAND ELECTORAL,I musfc ask the honourable member not to discuss the Tariff. 1,55
