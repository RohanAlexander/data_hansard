1,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether, if in the course of events he has the power, he will make a Bill to provide for old-age pensions one of the first measures to be introduced into this Chamber next session ?",13
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If by ""power,"" the honourable member means money, my answer is that it will be one of the first measures to receive the attention of the Government. PARADE OF TROOPS IN SYDNEY.",13
3,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is the Minister representing the Minister of Defence now able to make available to honourable members the papers dealing with the parading of certain troops in January last at the Australian Natives Association Exhibition in Sydney? I asked for their production yesterday.,13
4,Mr EWING,Unknown,The Department has' been requested to furnish them at once.,13
5,Mr KELLY,Unknown,When will they be available? Before the discussion of the Defence Estimates?,13
6,Mr EWING,Unknown,To-day .,13
7,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Is it not a fact that in New South Wales troops have been allowed to take part in school gatherings, and other fetes as well as this Australian Natives Association Exhibition?",13
8,Mr EWING,Unknown,I am unable to say; but I think that when the papers are produced it will be seen that the right thing was done in this case.,13
9,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Is it not a fact that two 'days which would otherwise have been devoted by the Australian Field Artillery in Svdney to firing practice were given up, with full pay, to help the Australian Natives Association Exhibition to obtain a bigger ""gate""? Does not the Minister think that the efficiency of that force, which has only about five davs in the year for firing practice, is of more importance to the country than the fostering of an exhibition held by the Australian Natives Association ?",13
10,Mr EWING,Unknown,The papers will disclose the facts of the case.,13
11,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Were not these troops engaged in assisting the Australian Natives Association to bold an exhibition to educate the public as to the resources of this country ?,13
12,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is all very well, but why take away from the men opportunities for firing practice?",14
13,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I am satisfied that the right thing was done in this case, though in the absence of the papers it might not be wise to comment upon them. NA TREASURER. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I wish to know from the Prime Minister if he has read in this morning's Argus the report that the Treasurer is about to resign, because of the insincerity of the Government in regard to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill?",14
14,Mr REID,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,The Treasurer's resignation - is the unlikeliest thing that I have ever heard of.,14
15,Mr DEAKIN,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,"If I may repeat an answer given by an honourable colleague recently, I may say that the honourable member would be the last to suspect any one of insincerity, even in putting a question. MAIL SERVICE TO EUROPE.",14
16,Mr REID,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,"I have noticed a statement in various newspapers, during the last few weeks to the effect that the new steam-ship company which has contracted with the Government for the carriage of mails to expects to receive a subvention from one source and another which will amount to ,£250,000 a year, and it has been reported that the steamers may go on from Adelaide to New Zealand. Is the Postmaster-General aware of an arrangement, either with this Government or the Government of New Zealand, under which the company will receive a greater subsidy than it has already contracted for?",14
17,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,"I have no information leading. me to think that the statements are correct. DEPUTY POSTMASTER-GENERAL , SYDNEY.",14
18,Mr BROWN,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General if there is any possibilitv that the position of Denutv Postmas- the Bill? ter-General, Sydney, will be filled before the end of the session?",14
19,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,"The matter is under consideration. No doubt the Public Service Commissioner will fill the vacancy .at the earliest possible moment. FUBLIC SERVICE (APPEALS) BILL. Bill presented, arid (on motion by Mr. HUGHES) read a first time. CASE OF CAPTAIN CROUCH.",14
20,Mr JOHNSON,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,"I wish to know from the Vice-President of the Executive Council if the Minister of Defence is willing to lay on the table of the Library the papers in what is known as the Crouch surrender case, for which I asked yesterday ?'",14
21,Mr EWING,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,"I have not had the pleasure of seeing the Minister ""this morning, but I shall endeavour to do so during the day.",14
22,Mr REID,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,"Can the honourable gentleman see any way of getting round the difficulty which he mentioned yesterday, a report having been received which, in the view of the Department, is abortive, and therefore cannot be laid on the table of the library as a report? Could it not be produced, accompanied by a written assurance to the effect that it is not a report ?",14
23,Mr KELLY,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,"In view of the honourable gentleman's answer yesterday, that the finding of the Board could not be acted upon, because the inquiry was informal, and therefore abortive, I wish to know how it came about that the Commandant received and made a recommendation on such a finding, Europe and what explanation has been asked of him in regard to his action?",14
24,Mr EWING,RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF THE,"The Minister informed me, as I stated yesterday, that the Commandant has reported that all connected with the case are satisfied to leave things as they stand, and that, therefore, he will not bother himself further in regard to it. TARIFF AGREEMENT: NA ZEALAND.  the Prime Minister what is the position in 1 regard to the New Zealand preferential trade agreement, since the Barrier mining industry is seriously affected by the duty on oregon ? Is it intended to go orr' with",14
25,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Premier of New Zealand has replied to the telegram which I sent yesterday, that he will lay the matter before his Cabinet today. Unless both parties accept the agreement, it will be void. BRISBANE TELEGRAPHISTS .",14
26,Mr CULPIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I . Is it a fact that the Commissioner has fixed seven hours per day for day men in Brisbane, and that such instruction is not being carried out, but that they are working fom 9 a.m. to 6.10 p.m., with an hour for lunch? a. Will he instruct that they get their day afternoon off from 1 p.m. ?",15
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. No. The 'Commissioner ruled that where .1 telegraphist is not kept constantly busy and can get time off for meals, he should, if necessary, work 88 hours per fortnight. 2. Inquiries are being made as to the arrangement in force with regard to the hours of attendance of the officers referred to. MELBOURNE - BURN IE MAIL",15
28,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. What was the amount of the lowest tender received for the mail service between Melbourne and Burnie, shown as A3 in the notice issued recently inviting alternative tenders for a service between Victoria and Tasmania? 2. Will the Minister state what action was taken by him in fulfilment of the promise he made on the 12th July last, in connection with the tenders for the service referred to?",15
29,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. No tender was received for the service referred to. It was, however, stated in subsequent correspondence that the cost of providing such a service would be not less than ,£25,000 per annum. 1. Negotiations were entered into with the view of the Loongana calling once a week at B,urnie, hut the tenderers stated that they were unable to agree to this. The new contract provides for a twice a week service throughout the year between Melbourne and Burnie, as against the present service once a week for eight months, and twice a week for the remaining four months; and for the replacing of the Flora (averaging 12 knots) by the Oonah (averaging 14 knots) before the end of 1907. In consequence of the action taken by the representatives of Tasmania, particularly by Senator Keating, in the Senate, and by the honourable member for Darwin, in this House, every effort was made to obtain a service for the North Coast, but without success. We have, however, improved the existing service, and hope to do still more for the people of Tasmania later. POSTAL RATE SBILL . SECOND READING. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro) [io.45] -^-I move That the Bill be now read a second time. In view of the information which has already been placed before honourable members, and the attention which has been given to this matter, it will hardly be necessary for me to detain the House at any great length. It is desirable, however, that certain facts should be submitted with a view Saturto enabling honourable members to arrive at a determination as to the desirability of establishing uniform postage throughout the Commonwealth. I think that honourable members will agree that the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution imposes on us a solemn obligation to bring about uniformity in postal matters as well as in other respects, so that all the people of Australia may enjoy equal advantages and opportunities. This obligation has been recognised so far as Customs and Excise SERVICE . duties, and also defence matters, are concerned, and I am sure that we shall do well if we can secure uniformity in our postal charges. Except in the case of Tasmania, we have made the telegraphic rates as between the States uniform, and a Bill has been passed through this House, and will, I trust, soon be agreed to by the Senate, which will place Tasmania upon the same footing as every other State of the Commonwealth. When that has been done, our telegraphic charges will be uniform throughout the States. This Bill proposes to place the whole of our citizens, whether they reside in the cities or the country, upon an equal footing so far as postal rates are concerned. Since I have been in charge of the Post and Telegraph Department, I have taken action with a view to secure uniformity in the money order system, and so far the results have been very satisfactory, not only from the point of view of increased business, but also from the revenue stand-point. My experience in this respect, as in others, goes to show that a reasonable reduction of charges always brings about an extension of business and an increase of revenue. We should have exposed ourselves to verysevere criticism if we had allowed varying Customs duties to continue in operation for any lengthened period, and in view of the fact that the great majority of the people are more interested in postal matters than in Customs administration, I think that we should endeavour to bring about uniformity of conditions in the great Postal Depart(Eden- ment at the earliest possible date. The proposed reform is one which should appeal to every citizen in the Commonwealth. It is stated that a loss will be incurred by introducing penny postage, but I should like to point out that the term "" loss"" should not be used in this connection, because we do not incur a loss by merely refusing to take money out of the pockets of the people. We shall certainly receive less revenue for a time, but I think that I shall be able to show that any deficiency will very soon be made up. I would also urge that the longer we defer this reform the greater will be the immediate reduction of revenue involved by the change, because the volume of postal matter is increasing every day. I contend that we should long ago have made an attempt to remove the present postal barriers. We should also help the people to recognise that they are not only citizens of a State,' but of the 'Commonwealth. This measure goes even further than that, because it will bring home to the people the fact that they are citizens of the Empire. Further, I believe that many countries that are not now parties to the arrangement for the introduction of penny postage will eventually come into line with us. When that occurs the people of Australia will realise that they are citizens of a world-wide postal. system, and that Australia is prepared to step forward in the path of progress, and keep abreast of the nations. I think that it is time we made a change in the present unsatisf actorv arrangements. In his address at the opening of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, Lord Hopetoun saidAs soon as practicable the postal and telegraphic rates of the several States wil l be assimilated, and when the finances of the Commonwealth admit, an uniform, and if possible, universal penny postage rate will be established.",15
30,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,There is a saving clausein that statement-whe n thefinancesadmit.,16
31,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think that I shall be able to show that they do admit of it now. Surely no honourable member will contend that this country is in such a bad financial position that we cannot afford to do justice to the people in the smaller centres and sparsely-populated districts, where the conditions of life are not so favourable as in the busy centres.",16
32,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We cannot afford to pay old-age pensions.,16
33,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It woulcl be a sorry day for the people of this country if we denied justice to the people because it was alleged that we cannot provide for old-age pensions. I have warmly advocated the payment of old-age pensions. I would point out that both New South Wales and Victoria have splendid surpluses, and that before any talk is indulged in with regard to the remission of income tax, we should give to the people of Australia uniform penny postage, and do justice to those who are living in the outlying districts.",16
34,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,If the Postmaster-General first provided better postal facilities in the remote districts we should back him up.,16
35,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I venture to say that in no single case within my knowledge has any reasonable postal facility been refused.,16
36,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Posta l facilities have repeatedly been refused on the ground that the estimated revenue was not sufficient.,16
37,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In many cases that is a very good reason, although I hold that the Postal Department should not be looked upon as one which musr, under existing circumstances, pay its way. . Mr Frazer - The difficulty lies in convincing the Department that a request is reasonable.",16
38,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I propose to give some reasons in favour of my contention that we can afford to make the proposed reduction of postage. Is it to be supposed, for example, that New South Wales, where the Treasurer has a surplus of jQt,000,000, cannot afford to spend ,£50,000 in extending to the people in the outlying districts and smaller centres the same advantages as are now enjoyed by residents in the cities?",16
39,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,How can the Minister account for the fact that some postal services that were in existence for a quarter of a century before penny postage was introduced in Victoria were afterwards discontinued ?,16
40,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That may te explainable, but .'has nothing to do with this question. I would ask the honourable member if he is prepared to vote against the establishment of uniform penny postage, and to continue to give the people of Victoria the benefit of penny postage within that State, whilst twopence is charged upon all letters sent for a mile or two across the border. If he were consistent, the honourable member would support the increase of the postage to 2d. all round. We are aiming at uniformity. Papers which have been distributed among honourable members show clearly the unsatisfactory character of the present postal charges. The existing rates of postage are bristling with anomalies, and their continuance cannot be justified, and should no longer be permitted. Victoria comes easily first in comparison with other States, because she has penny postage throughout the State. You can send a letter from one end of Victoria to the other for i d . , and people living on the border cannot understand why they should have to pay 2d. to send a letter 2 or 3 miles into a neighbouring State.",16
41,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Victori a pays for her penny postage.,17
42,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is quite true; but we hope to bring about uniformity within the Commonwealth, and to do away with provincial lines of demarcation. Is it fair that the people of New South Wales and other States should go on paying higher rates? After looking into this question very carefully, I have come to the conclusion that, if we are to act fairly, only one course is open to us, namely, to make our postal rates uniform. We must either reduce the postage to i d . all round, or the Victorian rate must be raised to 2d. It has been urged that this measure is proposed in the interests of merchants and big business people. All that I can say is that I shall engage in no vendetta against big business people. If they send away large numbers of letters they must receive replies, and thus lead to an increase of the revenue of the Department. The history of penny postage in other parts of the world shows that, upon the reduction of the postage rates, big business houses have increased their contributions to the revenue. New South Wales already enjoys the advantages of penny, postage in sixty different areas, embracing 1,300^ post-offices; but that is a very inequitable' arrangement.",17
43,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Has the Minister had any representations made to him as to the necessitv for reducing the postal rates?,17
44,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What has that to do with the question?,17
45,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"As soon as uniform penny postage is introduced, an agitation will be started in favour of extending further sideration to the residents in the cities.",17
46,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Do I understand that the honourable member objects to penny postage on the ground that the moment we bring it about some one will advocate a reduction to a still lower rate? If that is his contention, I cannot understand it.",17
47,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Minister misrepresents my contention.,17
48,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If such be the case, the honourable member will have an opportunity later on of putting the matter right. As the representatives of New South Wales are aware, these penny postal radii, as they are termed, have been established in many parts of that State, whilst other localities, possessing a greater population, and doing a large volume of business, have been denied the benefits of that system. ' I would further point out that when a letter crosses the border line of these radii it must bear an additional penny stamp, and, if it does not. its recipient is subjected to a further fine of a penny. The operation of this arrangement occasions frequent complaints on the part of the public-complaint s which are a source of annoyance to the postal officials, who are anxious to meet the people in every possible way. Moreover, we have often to refuse reasonable requests on account of this inequitable system. At the present time the majority of the letters which are posted in New South Wales bear only a penny stamp; consequently, this proposal, if it will benefit one section of the community more than another, will benefit those who are resident outside of large towns and cities. It will be of great advantage to those who are settled in the country districts, and who do not enjoy many of the facilities which are enjoyed by city residents. Consequently, nobody can justly contend that it is a measure which will favour only the merchant or the city resident.  have to impose additional duties to make up the loss of revenue.",17
49,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not propose to do anything of the kind. I maintain, that the adoption of penny postage will not result in a financial loss. It simply means that we would refuse to take a certain amount from the pockets of the people, and I contend that the increased volume of business which will result will con- soon make up any deficiency in revenue that may occur at the outset. That has been the history of penny postage , in all other countries. When it was adopted in Canada, nothing but disaster was predicted, but the fact remains that within three years the revenue derived under the new system was equal in the aggregate, to that obtained under the old.",17
50,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I suppose that the Government will impose a tax upon tea and kerosene to make up the deficiency.,18
51,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Some of the honourable member's constituents enjoy the blessings of penny postage. I am aware that some of the residents of his electorate do not share those advantages. Of course, there are always complaints against the Postal Department.",18
52,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They are absolutely just complaints.,18
53,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I shall be very glad to thresh out those complaints with the honourable member at any time.""",18
54,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Will the Minister's posal affect the granting of other departmental facilities to the people?,18
55,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No . The question of making the rates uniform will not interfere with any service. The history of penny postage elsewhere has been that a very large revenue has resulted from its adoption. Within a short time after its introduction I think that we should be able to extend greater facilities to the people, owing to the largely increased revenue that would be derived. As I have already stated, there are sixty penny postal centres in New South Wales and 1,300 offices which enjoy the benefits conferred by that arrangement. In South Australia, on the other hand, there is no penny town rate at all. There, if one wishes to send a letter to his next-door neighbour, or across the street, he is required to pay 2d. upon it.",18
56,Mr DAVID THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"A %'ery good provision, too.",18
57,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then let us make the law in all the States uniform. I notice that olne of the leading daily newspapers in Adelaide views the proposal to establish penny postage throughout the Commonwealth with approval.,18
58,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Whic h newspaper?,18
59,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Further , it has been very highly commended by leading public men in South Australia. read with very great pleasure an article upon the subject which appeared in the Advertiser. A member of the South Australian Parliament has already given notice of a motion approving of the adoption of penny postage. But after all, it ought not to be a question of who in South Australia are in favour of it, but rather a question of simple justice. If anybody here is opposed to penny postage, it is his business to provide a substitute. Throughout Victoria the postal rate is a penny. But if a resident of Albury, in New South Wales, wishes to send a letter to Wodonga he is required to affix a 2d. stamp to it, and if he fails to do so, the recipient is liable to pay double the amount of the deficiency. The residents of these places are clamouring for the adoption of penny postage. They contend that it is a simple act of justice, and that the existing anomaly ought to be swept away at the earliest possible moment. It seems to me that the main objection which has been urged against its introduction is that we cannot proafford it. But I have yet to learn that we cannot afford to do a simple act of justice, especially at a time when all the States are flourishing. At the present time, in many of the States, the Treasurers have large surpluses. What would be said if , because some'States were not financially as strong as others, we proposed to levy different Customs and Excise duties? What question goes home to the people more than does that of postal rates ? They are more interested in it than even in telegraphic rates, because for everv person who uses the telegraph there are probably twenty who use the post-office. What will be the effect of penny postage from a financial stand-point ?",18
60,Mr DAVID THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Les s taxation.,18
61,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I quite agree with the honourable member. In the United Kingdom penny postage has been established for many years. With what result? The people there enjoy facilities which I wish the people of the Commonwealth shared, and which I hope, under proper administration, will very soon be extended to them. In consequence of the adoption of the penny postage system, which has been in operation there for a number of years, they post more letters per head than do any other people in the world.",18
62,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What was the reI venue and expenditure of the Postal Department of the United Kingdom last vear ?,18
63,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not know. But I do know that every year the Postal Department contributes very largely towards paying for other services, and that every year some further privilege is extended to the people because of its expanding revenue. Mr MCCAY. - Is not that revenue the result of having a closely-settled population, and not of penny postage?",18
64,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then I ask the honourable and learned member whether he will deny to the residents in our sparsely-populated districts the privileges that are enjoyed by residents of towns and cities ?,19
65,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The proposal of the Government will hit the residents of sparselysettled districts harder than it will city residents.,19
66,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable and learned member will have an opportunity of replying to my remarks at a later stage. I shall be glad to hear him explain why the residents of South Australia should continue to pay a postage rate of 2d. whilst those in Victoria are called upon to pay only i d .,19
67,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Victorians themselves pay that postage rate.,19
68,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But we do not look forward to a continuance of the bookkeeping provisions for ever. The Government further propose to make the postal rates for the carriage of letter cards, post cards, magazines, and printed matter uniform, so that a person in any part of Australia will know exactly the amount of postage which he has to pay without first asking himself whether he is upon one side or the other of the River Murray. It is well known that, owing to the high rates of postage upon printed matter, many large local firms have had their printing done in the United Kingdom. these circumstances, we have suffered a double loss. We have had to carry their printed matter, upon its arrival here, for nothing, and Australia has lost the employment that would have been provided had the printing been undertaken locally. This fact became so apparent some years since in New South Wales that reductions in the rates for the carriage of printed matter were agreed to with the object of endeavouring to bring that State into line with some of the other States. That circumstance evidences the grave danger of having high postage rates. This Bill provides for the establishment of uniform rates. Under existing conditions, the people of Tasmania are much more favourably situated than are those of any other State in respect of the carriage of printed matter, whilst the residents of Victoria and New South Wales enjoy advantages which are not shared by those of South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland. The postage on printed papers in Tasmania is only one-half that charged in New South Wales and Victoria, and only one-fourth that charged in Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia on inland matter, and one-half that charged in the last three States on Inter-State matter. Surely we are not going to permit such a state of things to continue. I do not suppose that there are many officials who, without consulting. the schedule of rates, can say what the postage upon printed matter is in other States. We have levelled down in the case of one of the States, and in the case of Tasmania we have had to level ,up a little in order to bring the States into line.  to make up any deficiency which may be incurred as the result of the adoption of the penny postage?",19
69,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am contending that no loss will result to the people if we refuse to take a certain amount from their pockets. I cannot agree with the contention of those who take up a different attitude. The adoption of uniform penny postage will result, not in a loss, but in a saving to the people. We have refused to take money out of their pockets by means cf inequitable taxation, and I am going to show that we can well afford to reduce this tax. Surely we can impose taxation on a better basis. Under Mr Frazer -°-BV putting duties on tea and kerosene.",19
70,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,So that the country people will have to pay.,19
71,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The big business people in the cities will secure the benefit of this reform.,19
72,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is interesting to hear the right honourable member assert that the people in the cities will derive the chief benefit.,19
73,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Onl y a very few people in the cities will reap the benefit.,19
74,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Is the right honourable member prepared to deny justice to the people in the outlying districts of New South Wales? Is he prepared to deny them a privilege which those residing in his electorate enjoy ? Are the people in the electorate which I represent to be required to place a 2d. stamp on every letter which they post even to an address only 2 miles distant, while those residing in his electorate may send a letter though the post to an address JO miles distant for one penny? If the right honourable member favours such a policy, I can only say that it is an inequitable one. I am at a loss to understand the contentions raised by some honourable members in opposition to this proposal. It is said that the merchants will chiefly benefit. I should like to inquire to whom the merchants chiefly address their correspondence. Is it fact that they have a large correspondence with country residents, and that farmers and others in the country districts are constantly writing to the business firms in the cities? Is it, fair that the business people of New South Wales-thos e residing in the right honourable member's own electorate-shoul d have to place a 2d. stamp on a letter addressed to a client living 50 miles from Sydney, when their competitors in Victoria may send a letter three times the distance at a cost of one penny ?",19
75,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is what is troubling the honourable gentleman.,20
76,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It seems to me that at present I am not nearly so troubled as the honourable and learned member is.,20
77,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The worse postal service in Australia is that existing in the honourable gentleman's own electorate.,20
78,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That ought to redound to my credit.,20
79,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not know that it will.,20
80,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,If the honourable member for Gippsland will bring under mv notice any defects in the service in mv electorate I shall have them remedied without delay. His information cannot be of recent date. I have recently had the pleasure of removing several anomalies in relation to the postal service in my electorate.,20
81,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Score s of letters-som e of them containing money-sen t by my firm to persons residing in the honourable member's district have gone astrav.,20
82,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Referring , further, to the Tasmanian postage rates, in connection with the inland postage on books, the people of Tasmania are much more favorablv situated than are the residents of other States, whilst the people of New South Wales have a concession with respect to the postage on books not exceeding 2 ozs. in weight, which is not enjoyed by the residents of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. The inland postage, on books in Tasmania is only one-half that charged in other States. There are also great anomalies in connection with the postage on magazines, both inland and Inter-State, the rates charged for inland postage being higher in Queensland and Western Australia than in other States, and the Inter-State postage being higher in Queensland, not a Western Australia, and Tasmania than in the other three States. That is to say, magazines may be sent from New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia to Western Australia and Tasmania at half the rates of postage charged in the latter States on magazines sent to the other three States named. These are anomalies that we should endeavour to remove. They may be swept away at little cost. Experience shows that a reasonable reduction in postal charges leads to an increased revenue. A few years ago the postal rates were much higher than they are today. I can remember when we had to place a 6d. stamp on certain letters, but although! the rate has been reduced to 2d., the revenue today is much greater than it was under the old conditions. It would be just as logical to say that it was wrong to reduce the old rate from 6d. to 2d. per letter, as it is to say that it is unwise to adopt uniform penny postage.",20
83,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What are the postal rates in Victoria ?,20
84,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I shall give the honourable member some information on that point. In accordance with arrangements made while the Department was under Stare control, the rates of postage payable on magazines sent from New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia to Queensland are double those charged on magazines sent to> Western Australia or Tasmania. There is another anomaly in relation to that very interesting publication-Hansard . In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania, Hansard may be sent inland at one-half the rates of postage charged in Queensland and in Western Australia, and from New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia to other States at one-half the rates of postage charged on Inter-State matter from Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania.",20
85,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Hansar d would be dear at any rate.,21
86,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think fact at all events that we ought to have a uniform rate. There is no reason why the postal rate on Hansard in one State should be higher than it is in another. When such anomalies exist, people are led to wonder whether Federation has really been established. As in other respects the taxation imposed by the Commonwealth is uniform, they naturallv ask why the residents of some States should be called upon to pay double the postage rates imposed in others. Senator Stewart has taken action in connection with this matter in the right direction, and if honourable members refer to the Bil l they will see that we propose to allow Hansard to be sent through the post at a uniform rate.",21
87,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Is that a Boon to the public?,21
88,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I recognise that the more general distribution of Hansard may affect some honourable members, but my duty is to consider not the convenience of individual honourable members, but the general demand for an extension of postal facilities. It is unnecessary for me to dwell upon the facts that I have submitted to the House. It seems to me that they speak for themselves. The practice of imposing in some States postal rates that are twice as high as those imposed in other States is indefensible. It certainly presses most heavily on those least able' to bear the burden. The evidence we have with regard to the adoption of penn\ postage shows that it has given an impetus to business, and that any loss of revenue immediately following the reduction is soon made good. The adoption of penny postage in the United Kingdom has led to an enormous advance in the business of the Department. Every year its revenue shows an increase. The position is the same in regard to Canada, New Zealand, and Victoria. Are the people of the Commonwealth less enterprising, less energetic, than are the people of Canada, New Zealand, and other parts of the world where this system has been established? Have we less faith in our country than they have in theirs? we all pessimists? Are we to believe that what has proved a blessing in other countries will not prove a blessing here? I , at all events, am not in sympathy with the croakers. We should be hopeful. We should take credit for the that our country is as good as, if not better than, most others, and that our people are quite as energetic as are those of ofher lands. I feel that history will repeat it self in this regard, and that Australia will make still greater advances than have been made by other countries. I base my calculation on the improvements which have resulted from the adoption of penny postage elsewhere. I would point out that from 1st April, 1901. the postage on letters posted in Victoria for delivery in that State was reduced from 2d.' per oz. to i d . per £ oz. That was not such a liberal reduction as we are now proposing. But what was the result of it . In 1900, when the reduced rate was not in operation the number of letters posted in Victoria for delivery therein was 61,813,218. In 1901 - and the reduced rate was in operation for only nine out of the twelve months70,255,396 letters were posted; in 1902, during which year the reduced rate was in full play, 83,748,327 letters were posted; in 1903, 84,871,415; in 1904, 86,802,756; and in 1905, 92,340,704. The increase per cent., as compared with 1900, was as f o l lows:-1901 , 13.66; 1902, 35.49; 1903, 37.30; 1904, 40.43; 1905, 49.39. This was equal to an average increase of 35-25 per cent, per annum, as compared with the number of letters posted for inland delivery in 1900. In other words, the figures T have auoted indicate that the average number of letters posted between 1901 and 1905 was 35.25 per cent, greater than in 1900, when the higher rate of postage prevailed. Surely these figures speak for themselves.",21
89,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Has the honourable gentleman a return showing the increase which took place over a similar number of years before the reduction was made in Victoria.,21
90,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"- I shall present the honourable member with some figures which I think he will admit are fairly convincing. Let me first of all deal'with the result of the introduction of the system in Canada. ""In 1900 the postage on letters posted in Canada for delivery Are therein was reduced from i j d . to i d . per J oz. That is not such a liberal reduction as we propose, but the increase in the number of letters posted was as follows: 1899, higher rate of postage , 150,375,000 19<Xh /-178,292,o00 ... .18-56 1901 191,650,000 ... 27-45 1902 lower rate 213,628,000 ... 42 06 J903 of postage ' 235,791,000 ... 50-80 1904 259,190,000 ... 72-36 I90 o 285,541,000 ... 89-88 showing an average increase of 51.18 per cent, per annum, as compared with 1899. The revenue in 1899 was only £ 6 5 4 , 0 2 7, leaving a deficit of £ 8 1 , 9 6 8 , but it increased in 1905 to £1,053,159, showing a surplus of £ 1 0 0 , 8 5 8 . Surely this evidence should satisfy honourable members of the wisdom of our proposal. result of the adoption of uniform penny postage, we secured anything like the same increase, I am sure that ever)' one would be well satisfied.",21
91,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But immigrants have been pouring into Canada. Mr AUSTIN CHAP MAN - W.il l any one say that we should not have a stream of immigrants pouring into Australia? We shall certainly stand still if we do not give our people postal conveniences and postal rales equal to those enjoyed by the citizens of the Dominion. If we extend these conveniences to the people, a different state of affairs will arise. Surely we should make some effort in this direction. plenty of room for an increased population.",22
92,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We are too far from Europe to secure the immigrants that Canada has won.,22
93,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Mr Fielding, in making a statement of the finances of Canada, in May this year said It is but a few years since Canada had a 3-cent. (iid.) domestic letter rate, and a 5-cent. (2id.) rate on letters to Great Britain, and yet, even with these heavy, postal rates, the Post Office Department absorbed all the revenue it could collect, and, at the close of the year, some 600,000 or 700,000 dollars (^123,288 or ,£143,836) was usually required from the public Treasury to make good the deficiency and keep the Post Office running. We have no longer a 3-cent. rale; Canada has penny postage within her own borders, and Denny postage with the mother country. The Post Office Department no longer absorbs all its own revenue, no longer calls for 600,000 or 700,000 dollars from the Treasury. After affording the people a very liberal postal service, after giving reduced rates, after establishing the blessing-for it is not too much to speak of it so-of penny postage, the Postmaster-General comes at the close of the year asking for nothing from the public Treasury, but tendering the splendid sum of 900,000 dollars (,£184,932) to assist the other public serNumber of Increase per vices of the country. Letters Cent, as Posted. compared Those statements ought to be convincing, with 1S99. except to honourable members who think that we should not progress, but should remain satisfied with things as they are. Those who believe with me that we' are on the eve of good times will agree that we should extend to our people the privileges enjoyed by the people of Canada and of other countries. I had the pleasure of meeting at Rome Dr Coulter, the Canadian Deputy Postmaster-General. In the course of conversation he told me that the developments which had followed the introduction of penny postage in Canada were remarkable in many districts. He is If , as the a man of ripe experience and political knowledge, having held his position for many years, and enjoyed the confidence of Sir William Mulock, so that we should respect his opinions. If we refuse to adopt penny postage, the Postal Union will, a few years hence, compel us to send and receive letters to and from all parts of the world at the penny rate, although we retain the twopenny rate for correspondence within and between the States.",22
94,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Are the people asking for penny postage?,22
95,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,If the honourable gentleman had not.gone to Rome we should not have heard of this proposition.,22
96,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Some We have years ago, when a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, I carried a resolution affirming the desirability of establishing pennv postage in that State, and I think that the right honourable gentleman supported it. I know that many of the same political party did. I also gave notice of my intention to move a similar motion in this Parliament. It is only a little time since the honourable member for Corinella, and others on the Opposition side of the House, were pressing for an answer to this question. Now, suddenly, for some reason which I am at a loss to understand, they assert that the country cannot afford to adopt penny postage. Are not honourable members prepared to do justice to the people in the country districts?",22
97,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Will not the reduction of the rate prejudice country services?,22
98,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It will mean that the honourable member's constituents will be able to send their letters anywhere thoughout Australia for i d .,22
99,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,But they will have fewer post-offices.,23
100,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The ""increase in business which will result from the reduction in the rates of postage will mean an increase in post-offices, and in postal facilities generally. Persons in the country districts will be able to post a-dozen letters for 6d., the rate charged for town letters, instead of having to pay rs. This is a matter of great domestic sequence. A penny may not seem much, but in the aggregate it amounts to a good deal in the case of many letter writers. In the country districts the women do a great deal of writing. It is a pleasure, and a means of information and education, to communicate freely with distant friends and persons in other centres. But is it fair to require them to pay twice as much for postage as is charged to those who live in the towns? The honourable member for Wilmot asks if the people want this reduction. I say that undoubtedly there is a demand for it from one end of Australia to another. Sir John FORREST - They want equality of treatment.",23
101,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes . Any person in a country district who is asked if he would sooner pay i d . than 2d. for postage will replv in the affirmative, especially when he learns that he is now charged a higher rate than those living in towns and cities. If the honourable member questions his constituents on this subject from the platform, the reply will be a thunderous "" yes"" which will surprise him."""" In connection with my attendance at the Postal Congress, where I met the great postal reformer, Mr Henniker Heaton, to whom the thanks of millions are due for his great efforts towards obtaining cheaper postage, I had the pleasure of travelling for some months with Sir Joseph Ward, with whom I discussed this subject often and at great iength. We know that, after a strenuous fight, he convinced the people of New Zealand that penny postage would be a good thing for that Colony, and now letters are transmitted, not only throughout New Zealand, but to the mother country, and to any other part of the world which will reciprocate, on payment of a postage of i d . The public appreciation of Sir Joseph Ward's services is shown by the fact that he is now the trusted Prime Minister of New Zealand. The population of. New Zealand is less than one-fourth that of the Commonwealth, and penny postage was established there on 1st January, 1901. During that year the increase in the number of letters posted amounted to 11,705,io9j during the second year to 1.6,269,463; during the third year to half- 19,207,712; and during the fourth year to 24,014,411- a total increase of 72.78 per cent, on the number posted in 1900.' con- Sir Joseph Ward says that the inauguration of penny postage has greatly stimulated business activity in New Zealand.",23
102,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But the reduction was adopted there because an increase of revenue was expected, while the honourable gentleman looks for a decrease.",23
103,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I look for an increase.. Sir Joseph Ward, when he attended the Postal Union, asked its members to adopt universal penny postage. I recorded my vote in favour of that proposal, and so did the representatives of 100,000,000 white men. The representatives of Great Britain, for some reason, abstained from voting; but at the next conference the question will be a burning one, and I believe that five years hence the penny rate will be made universal. Will honourable members then be content to retain the twopenny rate within Australia?",23
104,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Fiv e years hence we shall have in power a Government which will be willing to impose a land tax.,23
105,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Honourable members may delay this reform; they may leave us sticking in the mud for a little while; but the people of Australia will insist on being given the privileges enjoyed by those, of other countries. I do not think that 'honourable members can advance good reasons why we should not adopt this reform. When Sir Joseph Ward made his financial statement the other day. he said that the result of establishing penny postage throughout New Zealand with other parts of the world was so satisfactory that he proposed to give still greater facilities by allowing the weight of letters to be increased without extra charge, and in other directions. He is at the head of one of the biggest and best commercial houses in the colony, and I have his personal assurance that the inauguration of penny postage so increased the volume of correspondence done by these .houses that, although the rates had been reduced by one-half, their aggregate payments for stamps was intelegraphic creased. These are hard facts from which there is no escape. Penny postage is in force in Egypt, France, India, Germany, and the United States of America.",23
106,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The rate of postage is less than i d . in India.,24
107,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The reyear presentatives of the countries which I have introduced there, and the named spoke highly of the penny system the recent Postal Congress.",24
108,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Is there a loss on the working of the system in those countries?,24
109,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There canshowed not be. They refuse to burden those who can least afford to pay high postage, and the revenue has gone up by leaps and to bounds. It is estimated that if in a protion gressive country the rate of postage duced to a penny, the revenue at the end of three or four years will be greater than it was under the old rate.",24
110,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is assuming that there is an increase in the population.,24
111,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"All I can sweating say is, ""God help this country!"" if we put a stop to it. are going to stand still and refuse to extend to our citizens the same privileges and conveniences that are enjoyed by residents in other countries. The Postmasterdeavoured General of New Zealand, Sir Joseph Ward, who knows what he is talking about when he .speaks on this question, says that reduction of postal and telegraph charges stimulates business, and there is no doubt that that result would be brought about i the proposed change is carried into effect. The Post Office affords means for the transaction of business, and there is reason why the people in other States should not enjoy the same facilities as now enjoyed by residents of Victoria. have no complaint against that State.' Every credit is due to her for having introduced the penny postage system. My contention, however, is that the residents of all the other States should enjoy a similar conveto nience. Let us go further, and extend penny postage throughout the world-the world with which we do business. any one for a moment suppose that there the slightest comparison between the numagainst the penny postage proposal. ber of letters now posted and those patched in the old davs, when the postage tem rates were much higher. I look forward confidently to the time when we shall have uniformity in regard to postal, cable, rates, not only throughout the Empire, but throughout the world. When one meets the representatives of other countries, and has opportunities of conversing with them, he realizes that such a consummation is well within our reach. We should endeavour to be progressive. Let us take the case of France. Only this the penny postage system was representaat tive of that country at the Postal Congress told me that it was estimated that, in consequence, £1,000,00 0 less would come into the Treasury. But he pointed out that the history of the world that that deficiency would soon be made up. He recognised that the falling off in revenue was not a loss, but a gain the people. I should like to direct attento the increase that has taken place in is rethe postal revenue in Victoria.",24
112,Mr DAVID THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is where they carry on sweating under the contract post office system.,24
113,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the honourable member will brintr any case of under my notice, I shall very soon",24
114,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What about the last case I brought under the Minister's notice?,24
115,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have ento prevent any abuses of the kind referred to. It is impossible to prevent anomalies creeping in occasionally. the Unfortunately, the idea seems to be prevalent among some officials that it is their duty to sweat others; but I shall do my f best to prevent anything of that kind taking place. That, however does not affect the question. We have about 11,000 offino cials in the Post and Telegraph Department, and it is a matter of surprise that those there are not more complaints. I invite I not only honourable members, but those who consider they are sweated, to direct my attention to any causes of complaint.",24
116,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"For months I wrote the Department about one case, which was proved up to the hilt, and I had the greatest difficulty in getting anything done. Can Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The honis orable member must not charge that In desVictoria, where the penny postage syshas been in operation since the 1st April, 1901., the revenue increased from £545=533 in I 9 "" - during 0 0 1 and the last three months of which year the penny postage system was in operation-to ^735>493 in 1905-6. That was an increase of 35 per cent, in five years. Similarly, in New South Wales, where, the penny postage is in operation in sixty different areas, comprising over 1,300 postal (owns, the revenue has increased from ^ 3 3 > 9 4 i in 1900-1 to £ 1 , 0 6 5 , 6 1 8 in 8 1905-6, an increase of nearly 28 per cent, in five years. In Queensland, Western Australia, and where such liberal arrangements the foregoing do not apply, but 141 which States town letters may be sent at the penny rate, the increase of revenue was as f o llows: - Queensland increased £ 3 0 9 , 1 7 0 in 1900-1 to £ 3 5 9 , 7 5 5 in 1905-6, an increase of only 16 per cent, in five years. Western Australia increased from £ 2 i o , i 2 6 in 1900-T to £ 2 5 2 , 6 6 5 in 1905-6, an increase of 20 per cent, in five years. Tasmania increased from £ 1 0 2 , 9 1 1 in 1900-1 to £ 1 1 8 , 7 2 4 in 1905-6, an increase of 15 per cent, in five years.",24
117,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why does not the honourable member tell us the increase in population?,25
118,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Why does the honourable member ask me for information which I have already told him is not ready to my hand. In. South Australia, where the 2d. rate applies generally the postal and telegraphic revenue increased from £ 2 7 2 , 7 5 6 in igoo-i to £ 2 9 1 , 9 2 7 in i9 5-6, an increase of only 7 per cent, in 0 five, years. These figures demonstrate the fact that cheap rates of postage create correspondence, and thus produce increased revenue, whilst high rates of postage restrict correspondence, and cause stagnation of revenue.",25
119,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"South Australia lost 30,000 of her population in ten years.",25
120,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What do these figures prove?,25
121,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Nothing .,25
122,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Figure s will not prove anything unless it suits the honourable member. We find that whereas in South Australia, where they have a 2d. rate of postage, the increase in the revenue has been only 7 per cent-, the Victorian revenue, under the penny postage system, has increased by 35 per cent.",25
123,Mr DAVID THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Victori a sweated contract post-offices.,25
124,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am speaking of the revenue, and not of the [187]expenditure. The revenue of Victoria has increased to a larger extent owing to the reduction of the postal rates. In New South Wales, where they have penny postal rates in different centres, the revenue increased by 28 per cent. In Western Australia, where penny postage prevails in the. towns, the revenue increased by 20 per cent.; in Queensland, the revenue increased by 16 per cent., Tasmania, and in Tasmania the revenue reas ceipts increased by 15 per cent. From these figures it would appear that the increase has been greatest where the rates have been lowest, and where the from greatest facilities have been afforded to the people.",25
125,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,W i ll the Minister tell us the increased expenditure that has been incurred in order to bring about those results ?,25
126,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The expenditure has not increased in anything like the same ratio as the revenue. The facts I have mentioned cannot be disputed, and I am surprised that any obiection should be raised by democratic honourable members who profess to desire to give the fullest facilities to the public. Now let us look at the financial aspect of the question from another stand-point. It is estimated by the offksers of the Postmaster-General's Department that, if penny postage were established, the immediate reduction in revenue would be £ 2 6 5 , 0 0 0 a year if limited to the Commonwealth, or about £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum if extended to the places within the Empire and to other parts of the world. In view of the experiences in other countries, I venture to think that an increase of 40 per cent, in correspondence in the first year may be safely anticipated, which would reduce the amount for that year to £ 1 5 9 , 0 0 0 if limited to the Commonwealth, or £ 1 8 0 . 0 0 0 , if extended throughout the Empire, and to other parts of the world. Besides that, there is another falling off in the revenue .to be allowed for. The estimated immediate loss on other items included in the Bill areLetter-cards, £""2,000; printed papers and books, , £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 ; magazines, £ 5 0 0 ; Hansard, . £ 7 0 0 ; or a total sum of £ 1 9 , 0 0 0 per annum, which, however, would soon be recovered consequent upon has the growth of postage. ' I propose to make provision for the reductions in these directions, because I think we should aim at uniformity in all these matters. We have been asked where the money is to come from, but it is a matter, not of finding money, but of levying less taxation. We have not hitherto retained our full fourth share of the Customs and Excise revenue, to which we are entitled under the Constitution. out this proposal and others which Have been indicated by the Treasurer, and yet not wholly exhaust .the balance at our disposal. I should like to direct attention to the amounts which we have returned to the States in excess of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled. Thefiguresare as follow :For the half-year ended 30th June, 1901, .£5771845; financial . £ 8 8 8 , 7 4 1 ; 1902-3, £ i , i 4 5 > 3 4 ; 1903-4, ^745:332; 1904-5. £ 7 3 5 - 2 8 6; 1905-6, £ 8 2 9 , 9 2 5 ; total, £ 4 , 9 2 2 , 3 6 3.",25
127,Mr DAVID THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,How mucK does Queensland and Tasmania get out of that?,26
128,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I will give the honourable member figures presently. Thus, in five and a half years we returned to the States nearly £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than was required by the Constitution to be handed back to them.",26
129,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And yet the Government would not make provision for old age pensions.,26
130,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,No man is a stronger believer in old-age pensions than I am.,26
131,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,But nothing has been done to provide for them.,26
132,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Every thing possible has been done by this Government, and yet our proposals have met with opposition firom many honourable members who profess to desire that old-age sions should be provided for. Honourable Tasmania. members should not urge that we cannot afford to give the people the advantages penny postage, because of the necessity providing for old-age pensions. things should be dealt with separately. my opinion old-age pensions would be proper charge upon the revenue of the and country irrespective of any ear-marking special duties. Old-age pensions are to come, and the advocates of the system need not fear that the establishment penny postage would in anv wav interfere with the accomplishment of their desire. The amounts received by the States from Customs and Excise duties in the year 1900 aggregated, according to the Budget, 1901, £7,762,653, equal to a sum of £42,494,591 for the five and a half years ended the 30th June, 1906, during which period the Commonwealth returned to the States a total sum of £ 4 1 , 0 7 4 , 2 5 1 , and also relieved the State Governments of all We can carry expenditure, previouslv borne by them, in connection with the Department of Defence, which expenditure, for the financial years 1901-2 to 1905-6"" inclusive, although there was a reduction each year on that for 1900, amounted in the aggregate to £ 4 . 3 8 8 , 4 6 3, or about £5,000,000, so that as compared with 1900, the States have benefited to the extent of over £ 3 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0. These figures show that they are better off under Federation than they were formerly. year. 1901-2, I maintain that this is not a provincial 2 question, but a national one. We hlave to consider how it affects 4,000,000 people, and in this connection I would ask, "" Is it fair that any one of the States whose people feel that this proposal does not exactly fit their circumstances at the present moment should deny to the other States the opportunity to secure uniform postal rates?""",26
133,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Will the Commonwealth pay any loss which! may be incurred in South Australia?,26
134,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There will be no loss. I maintain that under these circumstances the States Governments have been liberally treated, and there should be no sound reason for complaint on their part were the amount of excess payment reduced by the sum necessary to provide for - the proposed uniform postal rates, including the penny postage on letters.",26
135,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Postmaster-General penhas not given us the figures relating to,26
136,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I intend of to present those figures in my own way and of in such a form that the honourable member The two will be able to understand them. Moreover, In although we have given up about £.100,000 a a year by reducing the charges on inland Inter-State telegrams - £ 7 2 , 0 0 0 per of annum immediate loss; reducing the fees sure for private bags and private boxes-£2,50 0 per annum immediate loss ; reducing the of charges on Inter-State money orders£ 1 , 8 0 0 per annum immediate loss; reducing the postage on letters to the United Kingdom and ""British Possessions from 2^d. to 2d. per half-ounce-£9,00 0 per annum immediate loss; foregoing the Inter-State poundage on postal notes - £ , $ ° ° per annum immediate loss; and by the adoption of uniform terminal and transit charges on international telegrams - £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 per annum immediate loss; and also given to the public other concessions involving loss of revenue, the revenue of the Department for the financial year 1905-6, namely, ,£2,824,182, exceeded that for the financial year 1900-1 - £2,269,502 - by no less a sum than £ 5 5 4 , 6 8 0 , whilst the revenue for 1905-6 exceeded that for the year 1901-2 by £ 4 5 1 , 3 2 1 . On the other hand the expenditure, omitting that for new works, which under State control was in most instances defrayed from loan votes, for the year 1905-6 exceeded that for the year 1901-2 by only £290,850 . It is not possible to make a reliable comparison with the expenditure for 1900-1, as in that year certain items of expenditure such as pensions, repairs to buildings, rent, stores, fuel, and light, & c , which are now included in the expenditure of the Department, were charged to other State Departments. It will thus be seen that for the period from 1st July, 1901, to 30th June, 1906, the increase of revenue has exceeded the increase of expenditure by £ 1 6 0 , 4 7 1 , a sum which it is anticipated will be sufficient to cover the loss of revenue involved in the adoption of the penny postage within the Commonwealth. Now let us take the growth of revenue, and see how the figures work out. The important fact must not be lost sight of that the normal annual increase in the revenue collections of the Department represents a very substantial sum, the increase between the years 1904-5 and 1905-6 having been £ 1 9 1 , 6 3 1 , and the average annual increase between 1901-2 and 1905-6 £112,830. Further, after reducing the estimates of revenue by £157,000, which represents the . immediate loss involved in the adoption of reduced rates for nine months from the 1st October next, and allowing for an anticipated increase of correspondence consequent upon the adoption of such reduced rates, it is anticipated that the revenue of the Department for the year 1906-7 will be £2,813,000 , or only about £ 1 1 , 0 0 0 less than the actual receipts for the year 1905-6- a sum largely in excess of the anticipated expenditure, exclusive of new works for the current year. words, it is within £ 1 1 , 0 0 0 of the esti[ l 8 ] -2 7 mated revenue for) the current financial 1 year, assuming, that we give penny postage from the 1st of October.",26
137,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"A loss of £ 1 1 , 0 0 0 .",27
138,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,There is no loss. It represents a gain to the people. Is it a loss to the country if we refuse to take a. certain amount from the people's pockets ?,27
139,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It applies unequally to the people.,27
140,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is what I desire to alter. . It may be mentioned that for the year 1905-6 the revenue of the Department exceeded the ordinary expenditure by £ 1 8 6 , 6 6 6 , or, if new works be also included, the revenue was £ 4 1 , 5 6 4 in excess of the expenditure. The honourable member for Parramatta has urged that we have made no provision in our Estimates of revenue and expenditure for the payment of interest upon the cost of transferred properties. But when certain facts are brought under the notice of honourable members it will be seen that such a statement is only apparently correct, and in reality is incorrect. In the first place, the revenue for 1905-6 exceeded the ordinary expenditure-that is, omitting the expenditure on new works which under State control would, in most cases, have been charged to loan votes - by no less a sum than £ 1 8 6 , 6 6 6 . On the other hand, if the Department be charged with interest at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum, or £1.80,000 on the value of the transferred properties, which for our present purposes may be stated at £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and if we add to that 3 per cent., £ 1 9 , 1 2 8 . on the cost, ^037,588, of new works completed by the Commonwealth, the revenue for 1905-6 would be short of the total expenditure, plus the above-mentioned charges, by only £ 1 2 , 4 6 2 . As against this apparent shortage, however, must be set the cost - not less than £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum--of expenditure, the full amount of which, at aerate,-is not properly chargeable against the Department. I maintain that in a new country like this the Postal Department ought not to be expected at the outset to pay. It ought rather to be expected to provide facilities for opening up the country. Many of the conveniences conferred by it are really the forerunners of settlement. I repeat that the Department is at In other present debited with many items of expenditure the full amount of which, at any rate, cannot fairly be charged against it . For instance, as a subsidy to the Vancouver mail service, we pay £ 3 6 , 6 2 7 . But everybody knows that that is not essentially a postal service. In Canada the expenditure in this connection is charged to the Department of Trade.",27
141,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why have not the vernment the courage to do that here?,28
142,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I wish to take one step at a time. Then I ask, "" Ought the Department to pay the whole of the money charged against it as mail subsidies?"" It contributes, by way of subsidy, to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 per annum. It also pays handsome surplus to deal with. £ 2 8 , 5 0 0 for Pacific Cable guarantee, £ 4 , 0 0 0 per annum for the New Caledonia cable guarantee, £ 4 . 2 0 0 per annum as a Tasmanian cable subsidy",28
143,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Government should have done that before.,28
144,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable member grumble because we have done an act of justice? I am surprised to hear him protesting against it.,28
145,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is very_ late in the day for the Government to be seized with such a fit of. virtue.,28
146,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"To the Pacific Islands mail service the Department contributes £ 3 , 6 0 0 per annum; and to the coastal mail services in Queensland and Western Australia £ 3 0 . 0 0 0 per annum. It can hardly be said that that money is paid entirely for postal services. there is the Tasmanian mail service, £13,000",28
147,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,U p till the present year for the carriage of its mails. the cost of that service was charged to mania.,28
148,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Gofive vernment have had to pay to alter that arrangement.,28
149,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"They ought to have Australia, done it long before.",28
150,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Why did not the Governern ment, which the honourable member supported, do it?",28
151,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Exactly . The honourable member had the power in sparselv his own hands for a fortnight to effect reform, and failed to do it.",28
152,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Minister admits that the £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 , which we now pay a subsidy for the carriage of our mails, is not, in reality, paid to provide a mail service ?",28
153,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I submit that the whole of. the amount ought not to be charged to the Postal Department. Besides this, numerous costly inland mail services, and also telegraphic communicaGotion, are maintained in sparsely populated districts, not in the interests of the Postmaster-General's Department, but for the purpose of helping to open up the outback territory of the several States of the Commonwealth. If we continue to construct works out of revenue, we shall, later on, have a very But at the present time we are handicapped' by the fact that we have to pay excessively high charges for the carriage of our mails by rail. It is unfortunate that we should be compelled to do this. At the same time it is preferable that we should pay the railways for the carriage of our mails rather than that we should pay private individuals, because in the former case the money received is credited to the general revenues of the States. Nevertheless, we ought not to be called upon to pay for the carriage of our mails by rail twice, and even three times as much as we could get them carried for by road.",28
154,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The State authorities increased the charges for the conveyance of mail matter just before the Federation was established.,28
155,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is Then very true. When the railway balance sheet did not look too well it was a veryeasy matter to charge the Post Office more That is Tasone of. the reasons which militates against the Department paying. During the past years, although the revenue has exceeded the expenditure charged against it in New South Wales, Victoria, and South the expenditure has exceeded the revenue in other States by the following amounts:-Queensland, £5.13,186; WestAustralia, £23.5,179; and Tasmania, £ 3 1 , 1 4 2 ; total, £779,507This is accounted for' to a certain extent by the fact that the services of some of the more populated districts, such as are to this be found in Queensland and Western Australia, involve a heavy expenditure, whilst the revenue obtained from them is small. as As pointed out in the memorandum of the ict'h July, 1906, which I addressed to the Prime MinisterTlie early introduction of uniform postal rales and also uniform telegraph rates (which latter have already been adopted), was considered by those who advocated the federation of the Australian States as one of the important matters, specially Federal in character and certain to appeal lo the people of the Commonwealth as an outward and visible sign of Australian union. I pointed out in that memorandum thatThe reduction in the letter postage rate in Victoria, taking effect as it did after the transfer of the Department to Federal control, only served to emphasise the local and temporary nature of the present system of charging for postal services. The want of uniformity of treatment within the Commonwealth is a standing illustration of the incompleteness of Federation. To continue, for example, the twopenny rate in other States while Victoria enjoys a penny rate, as also to compel residents of South' Australia to pay 2d. per half ounce for their town letters, while the residents of all other States pay only i d . per hiilf ounce for similar correspondence, is not in accordance with the real spirit of the Constitution, and such a state of things should be altered at the earliest possible moment. J submit that the proper way to remedy existing anomalies is to introduce uniform postal rates, including penny postage, on letters throughout the whole of our territory. By this means we should remove State barriers, and bring home to the minds of the people more forcibly than could perhaps be done in any other way the fact that they are citizens of the Commonwealth, and also that Federal control has greatly improved their postal facilities. There is a world-wide sentiment in favour of penny postage, and to grant it here will have a beneficial result from a national, a commercial, an educational, and a household point of view. It would bring within the reach of the poorest an opportunity of making full and frequent use of the postal facilities provided by the Government, f t would give a greater opportunity for the people of Australia to communicate with each other, with other parts of the 'Empire and with other countries. It would also facilitate the transaction of business; help to extend commerce; and, indirectly ""opening up new avenues for employment, generally benefit Australians individually and collectively. As indicated by the revenue returns for the financial year 1005-6, the' Commonwealth is at present in a prosperous condition; business is flourishing; new country is being occupied by farmers and others; and there is good reason for the belief that this satisfactory condition of affairs will continue. The change proposed is obligatory from a Federal point of view, so as to bring home to our minds the fact that Federation is a reality, and that, from a postal as well as any other point of view, Australians are one people. Uniform postal rates are also essential for the purpose of removing the present anomalous condition of things under which, in this particular respect, the residents of one State have an undue advantage over those of other States, while the residents of cities and other large centres are afforded more liberal treatment than those in country, districts, though the latter, certainly quite as deserving of the same treatment as is accorded to the former, are, in a sense, penalized for their hardy enterprise in helping to open up and develop the interior of the Commonwealth.",28
156,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The States themselves pay for these reductions.,29
157,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I desire to consider this matter not from the standpoint of any one State but from a Commonwealth view point.,29
158,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then the honourable gentleman should propose that the Commonwealth shall pay for these reforms.,29
159,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The experience of other countries has proved conclusively that the commercial community, tfie largest contributors to the postal revenue, almost invariably spend more under a reduced than under a higher postage, recognising that a cheaper rate enables them to communicate with a larger number of potential customers, and thus assists them to extend their business and create wealth, from which the people as a whole derive substantial benefit. I think that I have given honourable members sufficient facts to enable them to come to a decision on this question. If further argument were necessary I should be prepared to advance many reasons for the passing of the Bill. Mr.MCLEAN - Is it in order for the honourable member to speak of all he has told us as being ""facts?""",29
160,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Judgin g from what I have heard the honourable member describe as facts, I do not think it would be. From my stand-point, however, I consider that ample facts have been placed before the House to justify the passing of this Bill. I shall be surprised if the honourable member for Gippsland does not rise presently, and in his usual straight-outfrom-the-shoulder style advocate the'adoption of penny postage, so that the residents of Bairnsdale may send their letters across the New South Wales border at a cost of a penny instead of 2d., as at present, and also that other existing anomalies may be removed. I have no desire to labour this question. The facts and figures relating to it have been, put before honourable members, and I have approached their consideration with an open mind. I trust that the House will conto sider this question carefully, and view from a Commonwealth stand-point. I hope that they will realise that if the Bill rejected a backward step will be taken. We should consider what will be the result of the passing of this Bill today. Are to continue the old slip-shod methods of the past? Are we to continue the existing inequitable postal rates? Are we to have a different system in each State, giving to much irritation on the part of the public and causing great annoyance to postal officials? In a short time we shall have universal penny postage throughout the rest of the world. Are we to say that some parts of Australia a 2d. stamp must be placed on letters posted to an address 50 miles distant, whilst we shall pelled by the Postal Union",29
161,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"When that we shall be prepared to reconsider this, question.",30
162,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I mainof tain that now is the time to take action. The people demand this reform. Domestic penny postage. correspondence is now an important' feature in our . social l if e ; the higher standard of education of our people requires that - increased facilities in the way of cheaper postage shall be forded, so as to offer every inducement for the exchange of correspondence. Viewed either from an educational commercial, domestic stand-point, it must be recognised that this proposal is a sound one. The people demand uniform penny postage matter of fair play. There can be no doubt that the Postal Department more closely touches the homes of the people than does any other branch of the Public into Hansard. Service. Mr ^BAMFORD - I think that spect the Customs Department is ahead of M..",30
163,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There are many people who are only slightly affected by the Department of Trade and Customs, but the work of the Postal Department age? reaches every one. Every man, woman, and child in Australia is interested in it. If this Bill be passed, it will no longer be open to the people to complain that in some cases they are required to pay a service that should be rendered for As to the effect which this reform have on ourfinances,I think the facts, show that wherever the postal rates have it been reduced an increased revenue has been secured. The reduction of postal rates be and the adoption of a uniform system have always proved to be a step in the right direction. The new revenue has soon overwe lapped the old. I therefore ask honourable members to assist me in making the Postal Department a Department for the people. We ought to give the people of Australia rise this boon. They ask for it, and will insist upon it. No matter what opposition may be offered to this Bill-eve n if time will not permit of our properly dealing with this question today-the proposal in cannot finally be defeated. I am just as confident that we shall have penny postage throughout the world as I am that this day be comwill be followed by night.",30
164,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We shall have halfpenny time arrives postage by-and-by.,30
165,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Certainly', , but now is the time fb take the initiative. I believe that the honourable member was one those who, as a member of the Parliament of New South Wales, advocated",30
166,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is not correct.,30
167,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Did not the honourable member vote for the proposal afthat I submitted to that Parliament?,30
168,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am sure that I did not. The honourable gentleman's bluff does or not always come off.,30
169,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The motion in question was carried, and I shalt as a turn up the division list.",30
170,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member will turn himself up if he looks too closely,30
171,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member, at all events, has been an in that readvocate of penny postage.",30
172,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is not correct.,30
173,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Will the honourable member say that I cannot produce in cold type a statement made by him that we should at once have penny post,30
174,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I say most emphatically that the honourable gentleman cannot.,30
175,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I accept is. for the honourable member's assurance. 6d. Mr WATSON - The Postmaster-Generai may knows very well that he never saw any go such statement by me in type.,30
176,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I can that only say that I think the honourable member is on the wrong track, when he seeks to mix up the question of penny postage with the adoption of an old-age pension - scheme. Surely I am entitled to the opinion that the revenue will permit of the reduction of postal rates. I have produced the facts.",31
177,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member has presented not facts, but a few opinions.",31
178,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I assert that I have brought forward facts in support of my contention. The views of officers of the Department support my statements.,31
179,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member has gone against them.,31
180,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not wish to drag in the opinions of the officers. I have presented to the House facts which the officers of the Department have submitted to me, and I have expressed my own views upon them. If honourable members give the people of Australia the boon of penny postage they will do well. It is a mistake to suggest that we should, as it were, "" stick in the mud ' ' ; that we should make no progress. It is idle to say that we cannot afford to bring about this reform ; that the States now showing big - surpluses cannot afford it. It may suit some of the States Treasurers to put forward that plea, but, as a matter of fact, the people of the States believe in fair play, and recognise that penny - postage is necessary. I therefore have pleasure in submitting this Bill to the House, and feel oonfident that it will be dealt with fairly and soon passed into law.  speech made by the Postmaster-General was a very interesting one.",31
181,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It was not very palatable to some honourable members.  tleman carefully swept aside many perfew tinent interjections.,31
182,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The facts that we did not secure ""from him are very interesting.  tleman prefaced his remarks with the statement that the House should do justice the people- a sentiment with which we all agree-and then went on to show **** inyear. equity of the present system. He urged an official office. it was unfair that the people of some of the States should have to place a 2d. stamp on a letter posted to an address only a few miles distant, whilst others enjoyed the boon of penny postage. From his remarks one might have reasonably drawn the inference that this reform would not cost the people anything. The honourable gentleman certainly suggested that the cost of the reform in one State would be borne by the people in others. When asked whether the States would not bear the loss that might result from the adoption of penny postage, he promptly replied that no loss would arise, since the money would remain in the pockets of the people. Such statements may do very well for the hustings, but they are not likely to prove acceptable to a deliberative assembly. Any financial loss which results from the adoption of this system must f all on the people. The estimated loss of £ 2 0 8 , 0 0 0 in the first year will have to be made good out of revenue, and the man who posts two or three letters in the course of the year will contribute as much to the amount necessary to make good that deficiency as will the business man who sends thousands of letters thirough the post, and will thus reap the chief benefit of the reduction. If the Postmaster-General is anxious to establish a uniform service, there are many other directions in which he might well take action. Why, for instance, has he failed to deal with) the contract system of post-offices in Victoria ?",31
183,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The sweating dens.  to give some figures showing the revenue which the Postal Departmentis receiving from some contract offices, and the salaries paid to those conducting them. Recently, on the motion of the honourable member for Darling, a return dealing withl the contract post-offices in Victoria was presented to the House, and I shall invite the attention of the Postmaster-General to a facts which it discloses. The honourable gentleman has said' that he does not think that the Department should be a paying one. I am going to quote a few figures showing how some of these contract offices",31

It is believed that interest should be paid on an amount estimated to be from £9,000,000 to £11,000,000. It may be contended that it does not matter whether the Commonwealth or the States pay this interest, because the money has, in any case, to be found by the people of Australia. When a State receives something in excess of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue returnable under the Constitution, that may be treated as a setoff against interest due on buildings transferred to the Commonwealth; but when no such surplus is returned, the State has to pay this interest out of its own revenues, and this decreases the amount available for expenditure in other directions. making the proposed change, the Postbelieving master-General should do justice to the employees of the Department. Some them were transferred to the Commonwealth at a time when they were enjoying certain rights, which it was thought were preserved to them under section 84, but which have not been recognised by the Public Service Commissioner.

I was very much impressed by his statement that in all bability, when the next Postal Congress was held five years hence, universal penny postage would be decided upon, and that i we adhered to a twopenny rate we should stand in a very invidious position. But the prospect to which the Postmaster-Geneduction of postage. ral pointed seems to be so far off that need not allow it to influence us. We have to consider whether we can afford to make the proposed change. If I were a reprethink sentative of New South Wales or Victoria I should probably be prepared to support the Bill, but the financial necessities of own State compel me to oppose it.",33
190,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member must not forget that he is an AusI tralian.,33
191,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No ; but I must remember that I am a Tasmanian first. So far as I have been able to ascertain, the Before people of Tasmania are almost unanimous in that that State cannot afford to pay its share of the loss that would be inof curred by adopting the penny postage system. I understand from the estimates which have been presented to us that, taking into account the loss incurred upon magazines and leaer-cards, the share of the deficiency which Tasmania will have to make good In his were last financial statement, the Tasmanian year, Treasurer announced a surplus of about £ 4 7 , 0 0 0 , but he estimated that, owing to the increasing expenditure of the Comthey monwealth and the reduced amount that would be returned to the States, the surplus at the end of the current year would be only £ 6 , 0 0 0 . He had not taken into conthe loss of £ 2 4 , 0 0 0 that would be incurred in connection with the adoption has of the scheme now before us. Therefore, f the Bill be passed, Tasmania's anticipated surplus will be converted into a deficiency of £ 1 8 , 0 0 0. Owing to the operaare tion of the Braddon clause, Tasmania will absolutely lose three-fourths of this 1 8 , 0 0 0 , or, say, £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 . I admit that it is quite possible that the estimated deficiency will be reduced to some extent by a. the increase of postal business, but that will make no appreciable difference to TasFor the last two or three years that State has been living from hand to mouth. The roads in the country districts have been allowed to f all into disrepair, the construction of a number of desirable public works has been deferred, owing to the financial straits of the Treasurer. proTherefore, much as I should like to see uniform penny postage established, I cannot support the second reading of the Bill . f I say, unhesitatingly, that the commercial men in the large cities would derive the greatest advantage from the proposed reFor every letter we written by a man or woman residing in the back blocks,' hundreds are posted by the commercial men in the city; and I do not that it would be fair to confer further benefits upon the residents in the great centres of population at the expense of the my already heavily burdened settlers in the outlying districts. Those who send business letters through the post can very well afford to pav the present rates of postage, and consider that the proposal is inopportune. I should like to direct attention to the fact that, whilst it is proposed throw away a large sum of money - the we are starving many of our postmasters and postmistresses. At a small town called Glenore, in Tasmania, the postmistress, the Bill. Mrs Baker, has to carry the mails twice a dav to and from the railway station, which is a mile distant from the post-office. She has, in addition, to attend to all other work connected with the post-office, such as the sorting, and delivery of letters, and for all this she receives the munificent remuneration of £ 1 4 per annum. If orable members will multiply the 300 workalternative ing days in the year by four they will as this matter. certain the number of miles over which poor woman has to carry the mails for sum of £ 1 4 - If the anticipations of Postmaster-General are realized there will' be a considerable increase in the amount of mail matter. I ventured to remark presented. whilst the Postmaster-General was speaktempted ing, that, if the reduced rates came into operation, persons, upon posting letters, would be inclined to say;, "" God bless Chapman!"" But what would Mrs Baker say ? If she found that the weight of the mails she had to carry was doubled, she not be inclined to say, "" The devil fly away with Chapman ! """,33
192,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the postal business increased, the Minister would be able to increase her remuneration.",34
193,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Perhaps so. But happen it is admitted that, for at least a year two, there will be a deficit. If Mrs. applies for an increase of salary, the Postbe then?"" master-General, as a keen business man, would naturallv say, "" I shall be pleased to consider your case when the revenue increases; but while there is a deficit must continue to carry double the amount of postal matter at the same low rate o pay that you have been receiving."" No doubt there are many other cases of kind to which I have been referring, and, whilst a number of our officials are so poorly paid, we should not entertain a proposal which woulcl have the effect of seriously depleting our revenue. As one who has a fair amount of correspondence to despatch, I am. perfectly prepared to pay the present rates of postage until anomalies such as I have described are removed, and fair consideration is shown for officials who have very responsible duties to discharge. Before agreeing to the Minister's proposal, to I venture to say that we should increase, remuneration of those officials. Personally, I am quite prepared to accept the responsibility of voting against Unfortunately, in addressing, myself to this question at the present stage, I occupy a somewhat difficult position. In moving the second reading of the the measure, the Postmaster-General submitted a bewildering number of figures. I attempted to obtain, isome of those figures with a view to analyzing them, but I was honunable to do so. Consequently I have no but to trust to my memory in We all know what a rapid this' speaker the Postmaster-General is, and the how eloquent he is. Upon the present octhe casion, it is somewhat disconcerting to honourable members to be denied an opportunity of criticising the figures which. he Whilst he was speaking, I atto elicit information from him, but he always evaded mv questions by stating that he would deal with that point later on. He said that he would "" come back to it."" but he always forgot to do so. Being of a bashful and retiring nature, I naturally would felt that I had received a rebuff ",34
194,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Postmaster-General is a great ""bluffer.""",34
195,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In my opinion, he adorns the position which he fills, but I trust that he will not fill it long. When he was describing what would probably during the next five years, the quesor tion which suggested itself to my mind Baker was, "" Where will the honourable member Undoubtedly he will be out in the cold in a political sense. At the end of. that period, it will be a matter of no importance to him whether penny postyou age be carried or not. The real question which we have to consider is whether the f States at the present time are in a position to bear the loss which the adoption the of penny postage would involve. I have endeavoured to show that to the people of Tasmania it is far more important that they should be able to obtain roads, bridges, and railways than that they should be able to secure penny postage, which would benefit only a very limited section of the community. I submit, therefore, that this measure has been introduced at an inopportune time, and under the circumstances I have no option but to vote against it.",34
196,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Hindmarsh) [2.36] - As the Postmaster-General truly remarked, if this Bill be defeated, the adoption of penny postage will merely be delayed. I do not think that any honourable member of this House desires to see penny postage defeated. The whole question at issue is whether we can afford to adopt that system at the present moment, and to - that question I think a Large majority of honourable members will reply in the. negative. The Postmaster-General has pointed out the benefits which would flow from the proposed change, especially to South Australia. I congratulate him upon - having made a judicious selection of figures, enabling him to make a very good presentment of the case from his stand-point. But he did not supply honourable .members with all the figures that they expected. For instance, we heard a great deal about the revenue aspect of the question, but very little in regard to its expenditure side. The Minister attempted to bolster up his proposal by quoting the effect of penny postage in other countries, but without mentioning what was the increased expenditure there.",34
197,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I intended to tell honourable members that, according to the Postmaster-General of New Zealand, the increased expenditure there, consequent upon the increased business resulting from penny postage, amounts to only 5 per cent.",35
198,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In spite of the advantages, which!, he said, would flow to South Australia from the adoption of the system. I doubt whether there is a single representative of that State who will support the Bill at the present time. Prior to the advent of Federation the South Australian Postal Department was one of the best paying public Departments in Australia.",35
199,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Tasmanian post-office was also returning a good profit.,35
200,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ye t we find that in boom times such as we are now experiencing the Postal Department is returning a profit of only £ 3 7 , 0 0 0 per annum. I venture to say that, ' if full information were forthcoming, it would be seen that in reality it is incurring an enormous loss. The Minister has not allowed a single sixpence for depreciation in connection with the enormous number of postal buildings scattered throughout the Commonwealth. He pointed out that penny postage obtains in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Germany, the United States, Egypt, India, and France. But I would remind him that in those countries, with the exception, perhaps, of New Zealand, there is a very dense population. In New Zealand, too, there is a constant influx of immigrants which does not obtain in any part of Australia. The Postmaster-General further pointed out that South Australia had the lowest percentage of increase in the amount of correspondence which passed through the Department. But, as honourable members are aware, that State lost 30,000 of her population within ten years, and, consequently, one might expect a decrease and not an increase in the volume of postal business there. To Canada there is a constant stream of immigration from Europe, such as we cannot expect for many years-that is, until we have faster lines of steamers connecting us with the old world, and until the existing freights are lowered. Even, according to the most optimistic estimate of the Postmaster-General, the adoption of penny postage would mean a loss of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually.",35
201,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Not a loss, but a saving to the people.",35
202,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is absurd for the Minister to constantly repeat that statement. If it were true we ought to at once abolish the Customs House,35
203,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And we ought to entirely abolish postal rates.,35
204,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Exactly. We should then be. able to tell the people that the money was still in their podkets. But I venture to say that the Postmaster General would immediately want us to devise some other means of raising the wherewithal to run his Department. His own officers assure us that the immediate loss of revenue consequent upon the adoption of penny postage would be £ 2 6 5 , 0 0 0 per annum if limited to the Commonwealth, and £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum if extended to all other parts of the world. They say that, in view of the experience of other countries, they think that an increase of 40 per cent, in correspondence in the first year might be safely anticipated, which would reduce the loss for nine months of that year to'£150,000 if limited to the Commonwealth. But here again they have not taken into consideration the enormous increased expenditure which would probably result from the introduction of the new system. I venture to say that if tomorrow Victoria could adopt a half-penny postage rate, the Postmaster-General would not urge that her example should be followed throughout the Commonwealth. He is not prepared to introduce uniformity into his Department at the present time. For instance, there is no uniformity in the ter of telegrams. He is not willing to propose that there shall be 6d. telegrams throughout the Commonwealth irrespective of distance. Then the Minister informed us that there is a world-wide sentiment in favour of penny postage. I venture to say that it is a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence, and that we have to discard sentiment in considering it, because we have a shrinking surplus. Why was not this Bill introduced when we were returning to the States such enormous surpluses? Why did we not make provision for this reform out of the £5,000,000 returned to the States, during the last five and a half years, in excess of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, to which they were entitled? It was because we - considered the finances of some of the States were so disorganized that it would be improper for us to expend the whole of the one-fourth which we are entitled to retain. I think that the money might have been put to a better use, but, af sent, I should not be in order in dealing with that phase of the question. The Postmaster-General has urged that we ought to entirely dissociate this question from that of old-age pensions. He ought to remember, however, that our expenditure on the Defence Department is increasing enormously; that we have to face an enormously increased military expenditure as well as the prospect of a large expenditure on old-age pensions. It is all very well to tell the people that we believe in old-age pensions, but they will be disposed to discount the plea that we have not the money to institute the system, when, at the same time, we introduce other reforms, seriously curtailing our revenue. There is no prospect of direct taxation being imposed by this Parliament, and I am afraid that the next Parliament will not be inclined to move in that direction. If I thought that it would, I should have no hesitation in voting for this Bill. The honourable member ought to recognise that we have been compelled to do something which is really repugnant to us. We have been compelled, owing to lack of revenue, to ask the people to agree to an amendment of the Constitution enabling us to raise the funds necessary for old-age Mr Hutchison. pensions by taxing the poorer sections of the community ",35
205,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That amendment of the Constitution will not necesmat- sarily mean taxing the poorer sections of the community in order to provide for old age pensions.,36
206,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If we ear-mark Customs revenue for the purpose, it will mean that old-age pensions will be paid for by the poor. They will have to submit to duties on tea and kerosene.",36
207,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not admit that. There is plenty of room for the taxation of luxuries.,36
208,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the Government had not contemplated the taxation of tea and kerosene, they would not have asked for an amendment of the Constitution. I have not met an elector in my constituency who is in favour of penny postage. On the contrary, I have been asked by many whether I am prepared to ask the poor, instead of the wealthy, to pay more taxation. I certainly am not prepared to do anything of the kind. The Government of South Australia is very anxious to provide for a minimum pre- wage of 7s. per day being paid to the labourers in the Public Service of that State, and they do not desire that the revenue which they at present derive from the Commonwealth shall"" be cut down.",36
209,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Who pays the postage of the commercial classes?,36
210,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The poorer people all the time. I have already pointed out the result of the reduction of the telegraphic rates. The loss so incurred has'had to be made good by the taxation of the poor through the Customs and Excise Departments. The Postmaster General tells us that he is going to do much for the people of the back-blocks. As a matter of fact, if this Bill be passed, it will result in such, a loss of revenue that demands for increased facilities in the remote parts of the Commonwealth will be refused. The honourable gentleman mentioned that one newspaper in South Australia is in favour of this Bill. He did not tell us that it is the conservative organ, which represents' only the commercial classes, and which, when dealing with national questions, has not a word to say for the democracy. The newspaper owned by the honourable member for Barker was^ at one time, in favour of a penny postage, believing that it could be established without loss to the community ; but as soon as it was shown that it would involve a loss of revenue to South Australia, which, owing to the attitude of the Upper House, could not be made good in other ways, it pointed out the iniquity of the proposal. It is unnecessary to detain the House by adducing further arguments against the Bill . There is no doubt that penny postage, like old-age pensions, and many other reforms, will come when we are able to find the necessary revenue. The Postmaster-General has not shown how he would make good any deficiency arising from uniform penny postage.",36
211,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Bot h penny him from all sides of the House. postage and old-age pensions should be at once established.,37
212,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If they are to come at once we shall require a new vernment. If the Government would i troduce an old-age pension scheme they would secure my support, since if we agreed to the payment of old-age pensions we should soon find the necessary funds. Havipg regard to the present state of Australia is prosperous. the finances of some of the States, I 'not prepared at this stage to support Bill. I hope that it will be shelved the time being. The one State which the Postmaster-General said would derive the creasing by leaps and bounds. greatest benefit from this reform is posed to it .",37
213,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Governincreased by about £500,000. ment of that State have already made vision for it.",37
214,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The v do not with favour any proposal which must sult in a reduction of the revenue now turned to them.,37
215,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Las t year they had a. surplus of nearly £.r .000,000.",37
216,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I wish that were so. As I have said, the Government of South Australia are anxious to give a mum wage of 7s. per day to the labourers in the Public Service of that State. one would sav that that is too bountiful payment to be given a man who works all day with pick and shovel. As a matter of fact, however, the Government have able to increase the wages of only a small section, by 6d. per day, and if we cut the revenue returned to them by the monwealth they will probablv strike that increase. If on the other Bill is shelved, and the Postal Department, as well as the Department of Trade Customs, yields an increased revenue, sure that the Premier of South Australia will be delighted to give every labourer in the service 7s. per day. I agree with the Postmaster-General that we should give postal facilities to people living in all parts of the Commonwealth, and particularly to those living in the back blocks, and therefore I shall-not vote for a Bill that would for some time to come hamper the extension of those facilities.",37
217,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Gippsland) [2.56] - I have to congratulate the Postmaster General on his very comprehensive speech, 1 and the excellent temper he displayed under the raking fire of interjections aimed at I am just as anxious as he is for the establishment of penny postage. It is a progressive step, and one that we ought to try to work Goup to. The principal consideration that n - weighs with me at present, however, is whether or not we can at this juncture afford to institute that reform. It is not a matter of the prosperity or want of prosperity of Australia. We allknow that But we know am also that the revenue r f the Commonwealth the for some four years hence will be cirf o r cumscribed by the Braddon section, whilst on the other hand our expenditure is in In his opBudget statement, the Treasurer told us that the expenditure this year would be He also proinformed us that we were within £350.00 0 of the limit to our expenditure. It seems view to me that one item of expenditure realone-the payment of interest on the retransferred properties-wil l swallow up the whole of that balance. We must meet that claim. The Prime Minister suggested that the transferred land and buildings should remain the property of the States Governments. I do not see that our finanminicial position would be affected in anv way by the adoption of his suggestion. If we No did not pay anything in the shape of in a terest, we should certainly have to pay rent for these buildings, and we might just as well pay the interest as the rent. There is been no just means by which we can avoid paving the interest on the transferred properdown ties. Assuming that they are worth someComthing, like £10,000.000 the interest bill off in respect of them would amount to about hand this £350,000 per annum. That being so, we have really reached the limit to and our expenditure, and it will be imI am possible to go on. increasing it , seeing that we must meet the requirements of the different Departments, which are rapidly growing. Confronted as we are with these facts, it is most imprudent to suggest the cutting off of revenue to the extent which this Bill would involve. I found that the reduced postal rates in Victoria made it far more difficult for the country districts to obtain postal facilities than it was before. Our postal facilities should extend, as settlement progresses, throughout the country districts, but dayafter day these increased facilities are refused on the ground that the revenue would not justify the expenditure. When that is the position in a State of short distances like that of Victoria, one may well understand how gravely this Bill would affect those States of magnificent distancesQuensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. It would seriously affect lesidents of country districts. It, therefore, seems to me that it would be premature at present to adopt penny postage. I hope that when the next International Convention takes place, some five years hence, we shall be able to throw in our lot with other parts of the world in bringing about this reform; but during the existence of the Braddon section it is hopeless to attempt anything of the kind. In reply to an interjection which I made, the Postmaster-General inquired whether I would be prepared to increase the postal rates in Victoria. He seemed to indicate that any loss accruing as the result of the reduced postal rates had to be made good by the other States. That is not so. Each State pays for the services rendered to it. If any one State has a lower rate of postage than has another, it has to bear the loss which that reduced rate involves.",37
218,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They thought when they introduced it that the Commonwealth would have to pay for it.,38
219,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is quite possible. But the Commonwealth does not pay for it. Each State has to bear its own postal losses, and some of the States are not in a position to bear the further loss which would follow the adoption of universal penny postage. Within a very short time the Commonwealth will have to pay interest on the transferred properties. That will mop up the whole of the surplus. Much as I should like to see penny postage adopted, I think that the proposal is premature, and, therefore, I shall vote against it.",38
220,Mr RONALD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Southern Melbourne) [3.1] - For one reason or another men have come to look upon a penny as the proper price to pay, for the postage of a letter, or for a newspaper, and if asked to pay ?d. they grudge the difference. A penny is regarded as what might be called the orthodox rate, and one might imagine that the spirit of Rowland Hill would rise in protest aga'inst the timidity of some honourable members in regard to the proposed concession. We have surely reached a time when a penny might be regarded as the universal rate, not only for internal correspondence between the States, but for correspondence with all other parts of the world. Nothing will do more to make the nations one than the adoption of a uniform and low rate of postage; but until the internal rate of the Commonwealth' is a penny, we cannot consistently advocate penny postage with the world at large. I shall support the proposal of the Government, because of the civilizing and unifying influence which I think will flow from the adoption of the proposed reform. If we have a surplus, there can be no better way of distributing it. It is the experience of other countries, however, that the making of concessions in regard to postal rates tends to so increase the volume of correspondence that the revenue does not suffer. There is nothing in the objection that the commercial classes will chiefly benefit by the proposed reduction; penny postage will be as great a boon, to the poor, although they have only a few letters to post. The Bill will have my hearty and earnest support.",38
221,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Corinella) [3.4] - The Postmaster-General, in the eloquent address with which he introduced the measure, clothed certain figures with the flowers of his imagination, but left others discreetly in the background, as out of harmony with the picture he was drawing. I have not been able to appreciate the force of one of his arguments. If in re-stating it I make any mistake, I ask him to correct me. I understood him to say that the reduction of the postage to a universal rate of a penny will not mean any loss; that it simply means that money which would otherwise be taken out of the pockets of the people will be left in them. Let me carry the assertion a little further, with a view to testing its soundness. If the reduction of the postage to a universal penny rate means, not a loss, but a saving to the people, obviously that saving would be greater, while there would still be no loss, if the rate were made Jd., while it would be still more if letters were conveyed free of charge. That is a perfectly fair and logical deduction from the Postmaster General's assertion.",38
222,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable and learned gentleman should remember what he said last session when speakingon a similar proposal.,39
223,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Postmaster-General forgets that if the Commonwealth fails to receive revenue from postal charges, the expenditure of his Department-whic h must largely increase if there is to be an increase of business corresponding to any reduction-mus t be met in some other way, namely, out of the general revenue. Therefore, any falling off in the receipts of the Post Office must be regarded as a loss to the revenue. To my mind, the question we must ask ourselves is: Can we afford, at this stage, to make a reduction in the postal rate which will involve a diminution of revenue, estimated by various authorities at from £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year? A few weeks ago, when the question of the total amount necessary to provide for a Commonwealth old-age pensions system was being discussed, the Prime Minister interjected that £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 saved in connection with postal charges might be added to the other sums available. I took that interjection to indicate the abandonment of the present proposal, and the continuance of the existing rates. The £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year by which the postal revenue would be diminished, if the proposed change were made, might well be diverted to the payment of Commonwealth old-age pensions. I should have no hesitation, if a choice had to be made between the reduction of the postage charges and the provision ofl an old age pensions fund, about voting for the latter. If we cannot find the money necessary for both objects-and I venture to think that we cannot, because it will be difficult enough to obtain sufficient to provide for Commonwealth, old-age pensionsthe reduction of the postal rates must wait. The Commonwealth pensions system should certainly take priority. In mv opinion, the proposed reduction, if it did not result in a diminution of rural postal services, would prevent the improvement or increase of those services. At the present time, if one asks for any improvement, he is immediately faced with a report from a post-office official showing the revenue and expenditure of the present office, or the estimated revenue and expenditure of the proposed office, and told that unless the revenue closely approaches the expenditure, no extension or improvement of service is justified. The reduction of the postal rates will mean that the revenue from rural services will be smaller, and, consequently, the Department will have still stronger reasons than it has at present for resisting requests for improvements or extensions. Therefore, as we must choose between reducing our rate and extending and improving the meagre services now given to rural and remote districts, I prefer to vote against the proposal of the Government, in order that our rural services may not suffer. There are two other points to which I wish to direct attention. It has been urged that the public ask for the proposed reduction. I am perfectly prepared to vote for a penny rate if its adoption will not hinder the extension and improvement of rural services, or create a deficiency which will have to be met out of the general revenue. The great mass of the public will be only slightlybenefited by any reduction of rate. It is the great banking and commercial institutions which will benefit most. I venture to say that when the Victorian rates were reduced tc* a penny, some of the banking institutions! ,ini Melbourne saved between £ 3 , 0 0 0 and £ 4 , 0 0 0 a year in stamps. The people generally do not write many letters, and, therefore, would gain very little by any reduction such as is proposed. It is, no doubt, wise to try to extend our commercial and social facilities : but it is putting the present proposal on unsound grounds to advance the plea that it will financially benefit the great mass of the community. My position is this: The Commonwealth is within an appreciable distance of having to meet considerable financial troubles. I do not mean that we shall be short of money. We shall, however, find it difficult to arrange our income so as to meet our expenditure. When we have to pay interest on transferred properties, to provide old-age pensions, and to spend monev in other directions which I need not mention, we must husband our resources very carefullv , unless, at the termination of the Braddon section, we choose to run riot, and expend a large portion of the Customs and Excise revenue, with, which we can then lawfully deal as we please. Tf we do that, it will mean mischief and troable for the States, which means mischief and trouble for the taxpayers, because we are too to forget that there is only one set of payers, although there are two spending authorities in each State. We shall have all we can do to provide revenue to meet expenditure regarded as essential or exafter tremely desirable. While it might be thought well, on sentimental, or even on practical grounds, to adopt penny postage, we canpurposes, not afford to do so at the present time. I the Postmaster-General will refer to sard, he will find that the views which expressed last session in regard to this subject are those which I am now expressing. I have said all along that I will not vote for penny postage while it is likely to tail a loss, to be made up from the general revenue.",39
224,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,How else can it be brought about?,40
225,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I leave that for the honourable member to work out for himself.,40
226,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I should like a statement from the honourable and learned member on the subject.,40
227,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not wish to occupy so much of the time of the House as it would be necessary to take to make the honourable member understand this or any other point. There are other and still more urgent reasons why we should pause in this matter. For example, the old-age pensions scheme is certainly in much more immediate prospect than it was twelve months ago. The Postmaster-General has estimated an increase of 40 per cent, in the number of letters carried during the first year of the penny postage, but I venture to believe that is a very generous estimate. In Canada. tEe increase during the first year amounted to only 35 per cent., whilst in Victoria the access of ness amounted to only 20 per cent. I do not think that we have anv reason to suppose that the increase throughout the Commonwealth will be any greater.",40
228,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable and learned member must remember that Victoria reduced the weight of the letters as well as the postage.,40
229,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Minister must know that, except in the case of letters exchanged by those who are in the .bright bloom of youth, the weight does not often exceed the |-oz. And I do not think that even the Departmental estimate has taken any excess postage into account. When the Postmaster-General says that the proposed reduction of postage is not likely to apt involve any diminution of revenue-the taxhonorable gentleman does not like the word loss because he holds that the money will be kept in the pockets of the people, and taken out of the general revenue-o r that, ceasing to receive £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, there will still be enough money left to provide for other such as old-age pensions, which is f so dear to his heart, I shall be prepared to Hangive the matter mv favourable consideraI tion. At present, however, the whole position resolves itself into this: That desirable as it may be to introduce penny postage, the Commonwealth cannot afford enit. It is not necessary to introduce the change at present, and there are other worthy and more important objects to which our money should be devoted.",40
230,Mr BAMFO RD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Herbert) [3.20] - I wish to place on record my objection to the Government proposal. In noting the results that have followed upon the adoption of penny postage elsewhere, it must be remembered that the character of the population in other countries differs very materially from that of our own. I am sure that the difference between one-penny and two-penny postage would not greatly affect the volume of correspondence in Australia.",40
231,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes , it would.",40
232,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am sure that it would not. Persons in different parts of the States who may desire to correspond are not deterred from doing so by the fact that it will cost them 2d. instead of i d . to post their letters. The experience gained in Victoria has conclusively proved that what I am saying is correct. The fact that, after the rates were reduced, busithe volume of correspondence increased by only 20 per cent, indicates very clearly that we shall not be warranted in looking forward to a very large increase of mail matter. It must be recollected that if we reduce the postage rate by 50 per cent., we must increase our postal business by 100 per cent, in order to restore our revenue to its original position. I do not think that the number of letters posted in any country have been increased more than 70 per cent, by the reduction of the postal rates, and, therefore, if we pass the Bill we shall have to face a certain loss. As the representative of one of the smaller States. I shall have to vote against the second reading. I have asked repeatedly for increased postal facilities^ which are far more strongly desired than are cheaper postage rates by the people in my electorate. The Department has been fairly liberal, but they have not been able to give me a great many facilities for which I have asked, because there has been no money available. Now, it is proposed to make a free gif t to a small section of the community at the expense of the rest of the people of Australia. As has been pointed out by other speakers, the loss of revenue that would result would seriously hamper the smaller States.",40
233,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They do not want pennypostage.,41
234,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No ; no community of people, either large or small, in the Commonwealth, has asked for the reduction of the postal rates.",41
235,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable member think that the'people would be in favour of increasing the postal rates?,41
236,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not think they would.,41
237,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Why should they not be in favour of doing so, if it makes no difference?",41
238,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If that be the argument of the honourable member, I must admit at once that a great many persons who do not understand the question would probably vote for the proposed reduction of. postage. If the man in the street were asked whether he was in favour of penny postage, he would answer in the affirmative, although probably he would not post one letter per month. He would not take the consequences into consideration. I do not think that we could afford to incur the loss that would be involved by the proposed change, and therefore I shall vote against the Bill.",41
239,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Moreton) [3.25] I regret to say that I shall have to vote against the Bill."" Although I believe thoroughly in the principle of the measure, I object to it on the ground mentioned by the honourable member for Herbert, namely, that the time for its introduction is inopportune. Of other things it has been said"" If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly."" But in view of the condition of some of the States finances, I think we should pause a little before we commit ourselves to the Government proposal. It does not follow that, because most of the States have been blessed with a surplus during the past year, that state of affairs will continue. The honourable membet for Gippsland and others have already pointed out that we are' rapidly approaching the end of our financial tether, and that we should hesitate to embark upon a policy of this kind, for which there has been no public demand. I do nob agree, with the honourable member for Grey, when he says that those who enjoy services should pay for them in proportion to the advantage they receive. The Post and Telegraph Service is of benefit to the whole community, and not only to the merchants, as has been suggested. If the commercial and banking classes use the Post and Telegraph Department more than ordinary individuals, they manage to pass their share of the cost on to their customers, and, after all, the general taxpayer has to bear the expense. There is much force in the contention that we should have a uniform system of postage, and, if the present time were opportune, I should be willing to support any measure in that direction. In some of the States cases occur in which, if vou live upon one side of the road, your letters are delivered for a penny, whilst upon the other side they cost 2d.",41
240,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And the honourable member would continue that state of affairs ?,41
241,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I should be glad to see uniform rates of postage established if the finances of the States would permit of it, and I hope that the time will soon come when we shall be able to extend that benefit to the people. Whilst at present I feel compelled to vote against the Bill , I shall feel myself perfectly free during the forthcoming elections to urge the adoption of a system of penny postage. At present I have no mandate from my constituents to support such a reform, and I feel compelled to pay full regard to the financial necessities of the State which I represent. If the people of Queensland are willing that the incidence of taxation shall be changed, I am quite content that the postal rate shall be reduced. But at present I think we had better leave this matter over for the consideration of the next Parliament, after the public have had an opportunity of expressing their opinion upon it. In speaking of the increase that has taken place in the postal business of Victoria since the penny postage has been instituted, the Postmaster-General did not take into account the fact that the amount of mail matter has been largely .added to owing to the post-card craze, which has been in full swing during the last few years. Perhaps Victoria has benefited more than any'other State from this new development, because of the very large number of Inter-State visitors who resort to her capital at certain seasons of the year. We know that the volume of postal business in the way of transmitting post-cards has very materially increased the revenues of the Post Office all over the world. Consequently the whole of the increase which has taken place in Victoria must not be attributed to the adoption of penny postage as against the mixed systems which obtain elsewhere. It would have been interesting if , amongst the voluminous figures which he quoted, the Postmaster-General had told us the number of letters per head that are annually received and despatched in the various countries which he cited. Had he done that I believe it would have been apparent that the position-in Victoria is not very much better than in Western Australia and Queensland. Certainiy the position in France, Italy, and other Continental countries would not have compared at all favourably, even with the position in South Australia, where a 2d. rate of postage obtains. I noticed from the particulars given in the course of the Minister's address that many items of expenditure are being unjustly charged to the Postal Department. The sooner that system is put an end to the better. Amongst other statements which he made, the honourable gentleman conceded something which upon previous occasions he has denied. He has repeatedly stated that the mail contract which was recently entered into by the Commonwealth is a mail contract pure and simple. To-day he stated that the £125,000 which we pay for the existing service should not be entirely debited to the Postal Department, inasmuch as it did not provide purely for a mail service, but largely for a trading service. As a Queenslander, I claim, therefore, that differential treatment has been meted out to three of the southern States to the detriment of Queensland, inasmuch as the Commonwealth in subsidizing a line of steamers which are partly trading steamers has practically stipulated that the}' shall visit only the capitals of those States. I now wish to say a word or two regarding the excessive charges made by the Railway Departments for the carriage of our mails. This is a matter which has been frequently Mr Wilkinson. referred to in this Parliament. It seems to me that immediately prior to Federation the States Parliaments made a very grave mistake. When Victoria decided to lower her postage rate she did so un3er the impression that any loss sustained would have to be made up by the Commonwealth. In exactlv the same way the Queensland Parliament, in October, 1900, increased the rate paid for the carriage of mails upon the railwavs of that State by £10,000 a year. Prior to that period the Railway Commissioners had been paid £40,000 annually for that service. That price was increased to £50,000, in the belief that the difference would have to be made good by the whole Commonwealth. In precisely the same fashion other items of expenditure were inflated-item s out of which a good deal of capital is being made by certain enemies of Federation and by the States Treasurers, but by none more than by the Treasurer of Queensland. There is a grave necessity for separating from the Postal Department all items of expenditure which do not legitimately attach to it. If that were done, it would then be apparent whether the postal service would be able to stand the loss which would be occasioned by the adoption of penny postage. To my mind, the present time is inopportune for the introduction of this Bill. As every honourable member is aware, whenever the Postal Department is approached with a request that it should provide increased postal facilities in country districts an inspector is deputed to make an, investigation, and to report what would 'be the cost of the undertaking, together with the probable amount of revenue which it would return. If the business does not appear sufficient to warrant the expenditure, the concession is refused upon the ground that the undertaking would not pay. Personally, I have nothing to complain of in this respect. I have been met in every possible way by the Department, and my constituency is well served. I am very forunate, because I represent an electorate in which settlement is fairly close. In my district there are not more than fifteen or sixteen miles separating one country post-office from another, whereas in some districts the distance between the various offices is from fifty to sixty miles. I maintain that the residents of our back country are deserving of every consideration at our hands. They are not only frequently denied a mail service; but, when they succeed in getting one, ft is usually a very infrequent one. Moreover, they are often compelled to ride ten or twenty miles, in order to receive their correspondence, whereas in the cities there are five or six letter deliveries every day. Further, when country residents apply for the substitution of a tri-weekly for a biweekly mail service, they are often told that their request cannot be acceded to, be- cause it is unlikely that the revenue forthcoming would be sufficient to cover the additional cost. If it were possible to extend postal facilities to our back country without having to impose extra taxation in some form or other, I should be entirely at one with the Postmaster-General in regard to this Bill. Uut, until the matter has been put before the electors, and until they have had an opportunity of declaring whether they are prepared, by some other form of taxation, to make good the deficiency which would certainly result from penny postage, I cannot support the measure. At the same time, I hold myself free to urge the advantages of penny postage upon the public platform.",41
242,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Kooyong) [3.41] - In moving the second reading of this measure, the Postmaster-General delivered a very informative /address. If we were not so near the close of the session and of the Parliament, honourable members, before continuing the debate upon this question, would naturally have desired an opportunity of seeing that information in print, and of seriously studying it. I think it is generally admitted that the adoption of penny postage would for some time to come involve us in a loss of from £150,000 to £200,000 annually. It is true that the Postmaster-General pointed out that it would probably result in an increase of 40 per cent, in the volume of our postal business; but we must deduct from, that the increased cost of handling the additional mail material. For a long time, too, we must contemplate the granting of additional postal facilities, which will involve a very large outlay. My feeling is that the Minister will be acting injudiciously if he presses this Bill to a division. Most honourable members are just as desirous of seeing penny postage introduced throughout the Commonwealth as is the Postmaster-General himself; but before, we impose this extra charge upon the people, I feel that they ought to be afforded an opportunity of being heard. If the Bill be pressed to a division, I shall very reluctantly be compelled-in view of our present financial position-to vote against it. I trust that not many^ years will elapse before this reform is. carried out, because I am one of those who hope before long to see Imperial penny postage established. I trust that honourable members will not be called upon now to vote against a Bill which, if thefinancesof the Commonwealth would permit, they would heartily support. I trust either that the adjournment of the debate, will be agreed to, or that the Government, having regard to the clear expression of opinion during this debate, will withdraw the Bill for the time being.

244,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Canobolas) [3.55] - I listened with considerable interest to the discussion which took place last night on this division, and especially to the speeches delivered by the honourable and learned member for West Svdney, the honourable and learned member for Parkes, and the Prime Minister. Captain Strachan, upon whose case the debate chiefly centred last night, is not an intimate friend of mine, arnd I am unable to speak of him as the result of any lengthy acquaintance. may say, however, that I was recently brought into contact with him, and that having inquired into his case, it seems to me that, although the Prime Minister sought to lightly brush aside the points raised on his behalf by the honourable and learned member for Parkes and the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, a grave injustice has been done him. That being so, I should be lacking .in my sense of the responsibility attaching to my position if I did not voice my feelings on this question. A further investigation should be made in order to ascertain whether a legitimate complaint can be made against the administration of Papua. . The complaints levelled at that administration are not confined to one or two individuals. Quite recently the conduct of a leading official, and one of his subordinates in Papua, was brought under our notice, with the result that a Commission was appointed to inquire into the matter. There is a possibility of that Commission rendering very valuable service by investigating the whole question of the administration of Papua, instead of confining its attention to the two cases which were chief!v responsible for its appointment. It ought certainly to inquire into Captain Strachan's case. He is an old trader, his connection with Australian coast and outlying islands tending over thirtv or thirty-five years. Those who can speak from a very long personal knowledge give him the highest character as a seaman, and bear testimony to the very valuable work which he has done for the Empire in exploring remote places, particularly in New Guinea. He did a large amount of exploring there ESTIMATES. twenty-five or thirty years ago, when the island was very little known, and his explorations, among others, have made possible the occupation of part of it by Great Britain. But, although intimately acquainted with a portion of the New Guinea coast, his connection with the island has been very limited during the past ten or fifteen years, so whatever friction there may have been between him and residents there, cannot but be a matter of ancient history. According to the captain's letters to the Department, copies of - which are now in my possession, he set out to do some exploring in the neighbourhood of New Guinea, working in conjunction with the authorities at Port Darwin or on the northern coast of AusI tralia. Whilst so engaged, he encountered a very severe storm, which caused him to lose his anchor and chain, and drove his vessel a considerable distance east, so buffeting it that it became very leaky. He therefore made for a point on the New Guinea coast where he knew that he could careen, and ascertain and repair the damage done. He made for a beach at the mouth of the Katau River, because, seventeen years previously, after a similar experience in another vessel, he had gone there, and had successfully effected the necessary repairs. The Prime Minister has asked why he did not make for the Port of Daru, or comply with the instruction of the officials to proceed there. If the honourable gentleman had given Captain Strachan a personal interview, he would have explained that the passage between the two places is uncharted, full of reefs, and, therefore, very dangerous, and that, .when he made it some years ago, he met with so manv difficulties that he was unwilling to risk the lives of those on board by repeating the experience. Whether that explanation is in accordance with fact could easilv be ascertained b v. allowing an inquiry by some competent and disinterested authority. _ Mr DEAKIN - Wh v was it easier for the him to go 900 miles to Port Darwin than exto Daru; a distance of 12 miles? Mr BROWN.-Bec.nuse, as I have said, of the dangers of the passage.",44
245,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Reef s and shallows abound for a longer distance on the way to Port Darwin.,45
246,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,But perhaps there is sufficient sea room to avoid them.,45
247,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They have to be gone through in order to get out to sea.,45
248,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think that an investi- choragegation should be made to ascertain the facts, seeing that there is such a conflict of opinion on this point. At any rate, it was less dangerous to take his vessel to the point to which he wished to go.",45
249,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,There was no objection to his going to Katau.,45
250,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The captain states that he landed at Daru, with his papers, to secure permission from the local Customs officials to do what he desired. He interviewed Mr Fitzgerald, the officer in charge, and handed him his papers. They were examined in his presence, and he was given to understand that he could take his vessel to the Katau River, and there careen her. He then went to the store, to purchase some supplies which he required, and, on his return to the Customs office, met the District Magistrate. Although not much passed between them, he was given to understand that the permission to go to Katau River was surrounded with certain conditions. The Customs authorities wished fo search his vessel, treating him as a suspected person.",45
251,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Ever v .one who does not go to a recognised port is treated in that way. That is absolutely necessary.,45
252,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Customs authorities have to discharge their duties, but the captain's explanation as to how he came to the place is reasonable. He says that he was driven there by stress of weather, and the condition of his ship. I do not think that it was the duty of the Customs authorities to deal harshly with seafarers in distress, as undesirable persons whose object was, not to secure safety and protection, but to infringe the law.",45
253,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Accordin g to the papers, Captain Strachan, in order to get*!o Katau, .sailed past Daru, through the dangerous reefs about which the honourable member has spoken.",45
254,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The captain indicated to me the position of his vessel and of Daru, and made it clear that it would be more dangerous to go to Daru than to the spot which he wished to visit. Writing to the Department of External Affairs on the 12th May, 1905-and I have verified my copy of the letter by reference to the original-h e saidOn the second day after clearing reefsHaving been blown away from his anwind increased to a gale, blowing with great violence with heavy cross sea. On the tenth day out ship sprang a leak, which increased until pump had to be kept going continually; finally pump gave out; ship making eight inches per hour. Got pump repaired, and on 14th - April ""made Hellish Reefs, Coral sea. Here I lay with two anchors down for eight days, browing a living gale all the time, there being no possibility of getting at the leak. I decided to run for the Katau River, British New Guinea, where twenty years ago I beached the schooner Herald. We sailed from Mellish Reef at 4 p.m., Saturday, 22nd April, and ran to the northward, with oil bags over the side to smooth the seas. On Sunday, 30th April, entered Torres Straits, and at 7 a.m. Tuesday, 2nd May, anchored in 3^ fathoms, three and a half miles distant from Katau River. Proceeded in my boat to village to engage native pilot to take ship into safety, was met by a canoe, and warned not to land.' Then he proceeds to describe his interview with the Customs officers.",45
255,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does he say why he was warned not to land?,45
256,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The natives warned him that he should not land at that particular point, because it was against the regulations. He engaged a canoe, and went to Daru, where he had an interview with Mr Fitzgerald, to whom he handed his papers for the purpose of perusal. He practically obtained verbal permission to do what he required; but, after purchasing some stores, called back at the office, and was then informed that it was considered necessary to search his vessel. Next morning Captain Strachan proceeded with the Customs officers to the place where his vessel was lying. He was asked what length of time he required to complete repairs, and very naturally said that that would depend upon the amount of work found necessary-that it might be done in a very short time, or might extend over some considerable period. The Customs official wished to limit him to four days at the outside, and then a dispute arose. The captain said that he did not wish to stay on the coast, because he had trading engagements to fulfil elsewhere; but, at the same time, he did not see why he should be required to give an undertaking that he would clear out in four days. Then, he alleges, he was told by the Customs offithe cials that they would not allow him to go boxing about their coast.""",45
257,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The officers absolutely dayIn examined deny using any such expression.,46
258,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am only placing one seams statement against another, and I contend that Captain Strachan's account of the circumstances is as reliable as by the officers, who have landed themselves in an awkward position. I desire that whole question shall be submitted for inseams? vestigation to some competent tribunal, in order that we may know who is to lieved. Captain Strachan proceeded Port Darwin without his papers. cers say that Captain Strachan left his papers behind him; but he states that they on took his papers, and that Mr Fitzgerald, who had the papers with him when he the visited the vessel, refused to hand them over, stating, that, after the careening of - that the vessel was completed, Captain Strachan would have to report himself at Daru, basket. and would then have his papers restored to him. Captain Strachan says that, cording to international law, the Customs mission ? officials had no right to interfere with him, because he was beyond the three-mile limit, and therefore on the high seas Strachan, who', I understand, is the owner of the vessel, demanded the return of the papers, but Mr Fitzgerald took them to Daru. The vessel was then puf to sea, and finally reached Port Darwin.",46
259,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why did not Captain Strachan visit Thursday Island?,46
260,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Captai n Strachan says that if he had gone to Thursday Island would have cost him much more to effect repairs-£100 , instead of the £ 2 0 , which was all that he had to pay at Port Darwin. I think that the honourable member will mit that that was a consideration.",46
261,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yes ; unless the whole thing is a fairy tale.,46
262,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I trust that the honorposted, able member will assist me to secure an investigation of the matter, and ascertain whether Captain Strachan's statement true. The statements made by the offitain cers in New Guinea suggest that the he vessel was not in a leaky or dangerous condition, and that Captain Strachan's request to be allowed to effect repairs was prompted by some ulterior motive. Whilst vessel was at Port Darwin, she was examined by the harbour master who, writing on the 25th May, saidaccordance with your request, I have this the ketch Envy, and found that vessel in a most unseaworthy condition; the in many places below the water line were open, the caulking had either come out, or had never been put in. When the copper had been removed daylight could be seen all along the that given seams both fore and aft.",46

A copy of the harbour master's memo, to me I enclose herewith . . . and cause of the tremendous influx of water was solely due to the defective work of Sydney caulkers, who had scamped whole seams, so the long continued bad weather had opened them out to that extent that the ship was like a",46
265,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Will not the whole of acthe evidence come before the Royal Com,46
266,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is the whole Mrs trouble. Captain Strachan will be only too pleased to lay the whole of the facts before the Commission, but under present back conditions he cannot very well do so. Captain Strachan, having failed to secure any satisfaction from the Department of External Affairs, proceeded to New Guinea with a view to obtain redress. He put in at Samarai, and his vessel was at once seized because he could not produce his papers. The chief official was absent, it and those who were acting on his behalf^ detained the vessel for forty-eight hours until his return. Captain Strachan then stated his case and obtained a clearance, adafterwards proceeding to Port Moresby, where he interviewed Captain Barton. After the incident at Katau and Daru, Captain Strachan, upon reaching the very first place at which"" a letter could be despatched a communication to the Minister of External Affairs, and forwarded a copy to the Administrator of is New Guinea. When he interviewed CapBarton, that gentleman told him tnat had been instructed to refer him to the Department of External Affairs for any redress to which he might consider himself entitled. To his first telegram, .to the Secretary of External Affairs, he received the following reply:Referring to your telegram, desire to state that this Department accepts no responsibility for action of New Guinea officials complained of. It was that reply which induced him to go direct to the New Guinea authorities for redress. When he approached Captain Barton he was informed-no t that his papers had been forwarded to the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, Mr Hunt, but that they were at Daru, and that he could secure them by visiting that place. He was further told that if he wished to secure anv redress he would have to communicate with the Department of External Affairs. After having been buffeted from pillar to post, without being able to obtain any satisfaction, he brought his case before the High Court. It was Only then-afte r he had incurred a considerable expenditure-that he was met with the plea of the Commonwealth Government that they were not legally responsible for any acts of their servants in New Guinea. That plea, Captain Strachan was informed, was fatal to the prosecution of his action. The Chief Justice of the High Court told him that, whatever moral claim he might have in respect of the wrong which had been done to him, he had no legal claim. Seeing that the Governmenr had been charged with the administration of the Possession for four years, I ask honourable members whether it is creditable to the Commonwealth! that it should urge a technical plea of that sort? My own impression is that the proper course for the Commonwealth to pursue would be to accept responsibility for the acts of its servants, and to allow the Court to see that justice was done. As the result of his action, Captain Strachan has incurred out-of-pocket expenses amounting to about £ 1 0 0 , and I understand that the Government have an account against him of £ 2 5 0 for legal expenses. Thus, through no fault of his own, he is denied what ought to be the right of every British subject. Of course, I am aware that it has been urged that Captain Strachan is not a reliable man, and that at some time in his history he was connected with certain shady transactions. Such accusations, I submit, are entirely extraneous matters, irrespective of whether or not they are true. Strange to say. however, these charges are chiefly made by the Secretary of the Administration , Mr Musgrave, who 1 affirms that he knew Captain Strachan as far back as 1886. Captain Strachan, on the other hand, declares that Mr Musgrave's. personal knowledge of him is very limited, that they have not spokenhalf-a-dozen times during the twenty years, and that they had not at any time been brought into close contact. He further states that he is prepared to defend his honour before any impartial tribunal, and will place it alongside that of Mr Musgrave. I hold in my hand a communication which I have received during the past few days. It purports to come from a disinterested person, who merely knows CaptainStrachan - by repute, but who knows something of the officer who has made the charges against him to which I have referred. H is statements are of such a character as to invite inquiry in another direction, altogether apart from the allegations made against Captain Strachan. The latter has endeavoured to secure justice at the hands of the New Guinea officials, and it has been denied him. I do not think that this matter should be allowed to rest where it is. So far as I know, Captain Strachan has actually sought to appear before the Commission which has been appointed to investigate the administration of New Guinea. Some time ago I informed him that all he would have_ to do was to state his case to that body, when it would be in r vestigated. He then informed me that he had interviewed the Chairman of the Commission before he had left Sydney, and had been told that the Commission had received no instructions to investigate his case, and had no papers relating to it. Under such circumstances surely the matter should be referred to that body !",46
267,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why not appoint a separate Royal Commission?,47
268,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We do not want to unnecessarily increase the number of Commissions. The body which has already been appointed is quite capable of dealing with the matter. Inasmuch as Captain Strachan has ineffectually attempted to secure an investigation of his case, and has taken all the steps that were open to him without obtaining redress, I think that the Government ought to provide him with reasonable facilities for appearing before the Commission.",47
269,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is a pity that the honourable member cannot devote his efforts to a worthier object.,47
270,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That remains to be proved. The honourable member is scarcely doing himself justice. He must recollect that there are two sides to this case. I am not an advocate of either side. But I say that it is not probable that in a fit of temper Captain 'Strachan, as an old seaman, would commit the error which is charged against him. He must have known that he would be helpless without his papers, and that after leaving Daru he could not reasonably expect to secure them without considerable trouble and loss of time. All I ask is that there should be an impartial investigation of this matter, not only in the interests of Captain Strachan, but in the interests of the future administration of New Guinea. To my mind, the administration of the Possession is in a very chaotic state. For instance, 1 the papers disclose that the man who is alleged to be responsible for this trouble, Mr Jiear, was appointed some years ago as acting-Magistrate, but although for some time he has been acting as if his appointment had been made, the Crown could not obtain any authoritative information on the point. The probabilities are that he has been properly appointed, but that a big Department should find itself in a difficulty in this regard does not reflect credit on the administration. Various cases affecting the administration of Papua have been brought under notice. We had, for instance, the case of Mr. Craig.",48
271,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Do not drag in that case.,48
272,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I merely wish to show that Captain. Strachan's case is not an isolated one. We have had before us papers relating to the Richmond case and the O'Brien case, whilst we have been well informed on Mr Craig's complaints. The probability is that half-a-dozen other cases have yet to be reported. These facts go to show that there is something radically wrong with the administration, and that steps should be taken to insure its effectiveness. The Commission now proceeding to the Territory should, if necessary, have its powers enlarged so that it may investigate all these complaints. In the interests, not only of Captain Strachan, but of the Commonwealth itself, every facility should be given the Commission to inquire into these matters. The Prime Minister last night took up a biased attitude. I do not know whether he has since looked more carefully into the question, but I will test the feeling of the Committee by movingThat the proposed vote be reduced by ^2,000. Such a reduction would practically cover the salaries of these officials.",48
273,Mr DEAKI N,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4-49] - This is an extraordinary procedure for any representative of the people to take. On a mere ex - parte statement, placed in his hands by a person whose evidence on important points is mostly contradicted by other testimony, as well as by documents that we have in his own handwriting, the honourable member proposes to punish the administration by reducing the amount provided for their remuneration. Why is this to be done? Captain Strachan chose to bring against the Commonwealth an action that should have been brought, if at all, against the British Government who appointed these officers, and who at the time in question were responsible for their actions. He makes the further complaint that he is not permitted to bring his case before the Royal Commission. No obstacle has been put in the way of the Royal Commissioni hearing this or any other complaint. If Captain Strachan can show that his complaint affects the officers of New Guinea, or its administration, he is entitled to have his case heard by the Commission. The Courts still remain open to him; the Royal Commission is also open to him. What, then, is the meaning of this proposal? As I have said, on a mere ex parte statement against a body of officers who have not had ani opportunity of being heard in their own defence, the honourable member proposes to reduce the item. He is acting on a complaint made by a gentleman, several of whose assertions have already been disproved... What warrant, therefore, is there for such a proposition? I think that in this case the honourable member has allowed his feelings to get the better of his judgment. If the step which he has taken were successful, it would paralyze part of the administration of Papua. We are not responsible for the fact that Captain' Strachan chose to proceed against the wrong person 01 in the wrong Court. We have already lost £200 in respect of law costs which we are not pressing him to pay. We have appointed a Commission charged with the duty of inquiring into anything affecting the administration of Papua, and if that Commission considers Captain Strachan's case is affected, it is at liberty tomorrow to inquire into it.",48
274,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Canobolas) [4.52] - It seems to me that the Prime Minister is now doing me an injustice. I have looked through the papers relating to Captain Strachan's case.,49

276,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have read a number of them, and find that they contain many contradictory statements.",49
277,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There is a great deal in these papers which neither the honourable member nor any friend of Captain Strachan's has quoted, and which, out of generosity to Captain Strachan, the Government have refrained from referring to. I am very anxious that Captain Strachan shall be treated in the tenderest way.",49

287,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Coolgardie) [4.54] - It seems to me that the Prime Minister, in the goodness of his heart, is preparing trouble for himself and his successors by including in these estimates the item, "" Australian men of letters fund, £ 5 0 0 . """,49
288,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Perhaps if I spoke now I might give the honourable member something to criticise.,49
289,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I merely desire to know whether the honourable and learned gentleman proposes to withdraw the item ?,49
290,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.55]- - I still hold what, from the honourable member's point of view, is the erroneous opinion that some provision of this sort woulcl befit Australia. But although I have received one or two rough sketches of the way in which the fund should be disposed of, and the persons by whom it should be dispensed-becaus e it ought not to be a fund capable of being used for political or such other purposes- I have not yet arrived at a definite scheme. I do not propose to expend any part of this sum until a plan shall have been laid before the House, and either directly or tacitly approved by it . I am sorry to say that there have been brought under notice a certain number of cases in which the relatives of well-known Australian writers now deceased, and some living writers well known by reputation, are suffering privation. All that I ask the Committee to do now is to allow the item to stand, on the understanding that nothing will be done in connection with it until the plan of distribution is submitted, and either expressly or tacitly approved by the House. The Committee must remember that if the proposal be adopted an annual proposition of the same sort must necessarily follow. The provision of £ 5 0 0 on the Estimates for one year may meet a few cases arising during that year, but cannot effect the purpose which a similar fund in London accomplishes. My rough idea is, at present, to ask some small body of competent persons to consider the various claims that are made, leaving in the hands of the Government, in submitting the item to Parliament, simply a power of veto in detail, and not the power to interfere with the distribution of the fund. Then we shall be faced by the question how much should be devoted to persons still living who, by means of this assistance, might be able to use their gifts for the benefit of the public, and what proportion should be. devoted to the families of men who have left them in want, possibly because of their devotion to a pursuit which, although brilliantly remunerative in some cases, is poorly paid in others.",49

299,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I would appeal to the Prime Minister to withdraw the item. If we recognise such a proposal as this, we shall have to readjust our attitude on many questions. We have decided, for instance, that pensions or retiring allowances shall not be paid to the public servants of the Commonwealth, many of whom render very valuable literarv services to Australia. Having adopted that attitude in dealing with those who devote their services to the Commonwealth, how can we justify the making of contributions - however desirable from sentimental reasons it may seem-to others who have not, directly at all events, served th""ir country, or to their relatives who have been left unprovided for.",50

313,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Corio) [5.5] - I do not think that it is fair to argue that, because certain men are neglected and treated unjustly by the non-recognition of their ability, all should be so treated. The Prime Minister, in asking for a vote of £506, is men making a small attempt to acknowledge perthe obligations of the community to a very deserving class, the work of whose brains, in this country, where material .wealth seems to absorb the attention of the public, receives very little attention. It would be a great pity to do nothing in this direction, though there is not much use in voting the money if the Prime Minister does not intend to expend it until special legislation hlas been passed.",50
314,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I did not speak of passing special legislation, but of putting a statement before the House in regard to the matter.",51
315,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am very glad to hear that, and think that £ 5 0 0 is not sufficient. We should vote £ 5 , 0 0 0 to commence with. A vote of £ 5 0 0 would not meet the cases now awaiting relief. Literary ability receives very little recognition from those who conduct our newspapers, which are filled with articles written elsewhere. We protect manufacturers, producers, and workmen, but not literary men. We foster industry, but we do not yet protect brains.",51
316,Mr CARPENTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,This is in the nature of a bountv.,51
317,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes . We have authorized the Government to spend £500,000 during a period of ten years for the encouragement of tropical industries, and why should we not try to encourage literary production-? It is the literarv work which does not attract a large reading public that gets too little consideration. Such work has been encouraged by the French Academy, and, recently, notwithstanding some abuses, by the Roval Pensions Fund of England. It is a disgrace to us that the widow of a distinguished Australian scientist, who did good work in the Commonwealth and in the Pacific, should have to depend on English bounty, by receiving .help from that fund.",51
318,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why not do something for the relief of distressed politicians?,51
319,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In the early history of this Parliament I suggested that the ordinary member's allowance of £ 4 0 0 , which is paid to Ministers in addition to the remuneration attached to their offices, should be used to form a fund to which other members should contribute, to prevent politicians from falling on evil days. Every member of the French Chamber of Deputies contributes to such a fund. That would prevent men who had passed many years in public life from ultimately having to seek assistance from the community, as has happened in Melbourne recently. On today's business-paper I gave notice of a question, asking the Prime Minister if his - attention had been drawn to the original musical work of Mr I . A . Rosenblum r librettist, of Bacchus Marsh, a man of Australian birth, of brilliant parts, .who receives for his genius too little attention from his compatriots. It is distressful to have to mention a case of this kind, but Mr. Rosenblum has written, and has at present on his hands, a complete grand opera in three acts, a symphony of the bush in four parts, several violin pieces, some overtures, and four complete novels. What chance has he of getting those published unless he goes to London?",51
320,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Not a dog's chance.,51
321,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Probabl v the Australian tone and character of his work would prevent it from receiving ready attention in London. I think that such men should be assisted, and I hope that the Prime Minister will consider the advisability of increasing the proposed vote to £ 5 , 0 0 0 . If he cannot do that, I should like him to establish a grand prize for musical or literary competition such as is given in> France. That would encourage Australian effort, and would, probablv, have helped Marcus Clark in his earlier years. The adverse conditions under which our literary men have to labour are a disgrace to the community, and our disregard of the finer literary and artistic aspects of life is not creditable to us. The proposal deserves the strongest support of the Committee.",51
322,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Wentworth) [5.13] - No doubt a pensions fund is an excellent thing, but why should we not provide, first, for those who have most claim upon us?

332,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,All that I desire is that they shall honour their responsibility.,52
333,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The best way in which are we can encourage them to do that is by ing patriotism! to the people. assisting them to take action such as that now proposed. I am prepared to support the item, because the Prime Minister has promised that no action shall be taken rary men. with regard to the distribution of the vote until some scheme has been prepared submitted to the House. I am afraid that considerable difficulty will be perienced in laying down the principles upon which grants should be made, and that probably it will be some time before any of the money will be expended. The amount proposed to be voted is too small to be of much practical use, but we shall make a very good beginning if we throw upon the Government the obligation to prethe pare a scheme for the assistance of Ausof tralian men of letters. If we strike out the item, nothing will be done, whereas, we permit it to remain something must be done. The proposed fund will have to be placed under the control of an indewould pendent board, which will have to take into account the benefits conferred upon the pubyond lic by those who are now in need of sistance. Many literary men have been unable to make any reasonable provision for their old age, and as the community has benefited from their labours, we the should take a generous view of their the position, and do the best we can to place them in comfortable circumstances. I with the honourable and learned own. member for Corio that it is a disgrace rethat many of our leading and most wealthy journals pay large sums for contributions by writers in other parts of the world, and entirely overlook the talent which we have amongst us. Perhaps the Australian writers are too radical, and too much up to date to suit many of our leading news",52
334,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Did the honourable member ever know of a decent book that kind, the author could not get published?",52

339,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It might be a very exgood thing to impose an import duty upon some of the literary productions that come from abroad. In addition to showing our appreciation of genius in literature, I think that we should go further and provide a fund with a view to enable men of genius amongst us, who have a scientific bent, to devote the whole of their lives to service of the public. I refer to men the type of Berthelot, the great French chemist, who performed such great service if to humainity. Perhaps the provision I suggest could be made in connection with some of our larger universities, but certainly it be well for us to place men who devote themselves to scientific pursuits be the necessity for struggling for their asmere bread and butter. They should be iii a position to concentrate the whole of their energies upon scientific research, with a view to conferring benefit upon the community as a whole. I shall support the item.",52
340,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Melbourne) [5.26] I desire to compliment the Government upon having made provision for the expenditure of .£200 upon the investigation of tropical diseases. I regret that the amount is not larger, and that cancer is not included among the diseases to be investigated. I also cordially approve of the proposed vote of £500 for the assistance of Australian men of letters^ and I think that the Government are to be congratulated upon having been the first to place such an item upon the Estimates. I trust that we shall be in a position to increase the vote very largely in the near future. We should do everything, possible to encourage men engaged in literary, scientific, Or artistic pursuits, who are doing their best to keep up the end of Australia. We must add volume to the cry, "" Australia for the Australians, and goodwill for the whole of the Empire."" I am sure that, if the proposed vote were larger, a competent committee could make a selection of beneficiaries which would, if placed before honourable members, readily receive their approval. I wish to say a few words with reference to my old friend, Tom Roberts, who painted a picture in connection, with the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament, which I believe will become the most valuable work of art produced in Australia. Some criticism, which I consider to be far from just, has been directed to that great work, and I think that His Majesty is to be congratulated upon having it presented to him. I have known Tom Roberts for many years. I spent seven years with him in Europe, and no man upon the sunny plains of Spain, in the clear atmosphere of France, or in, the murky atmosphere of London, did more than Tom Roberts to keep up the name of Australia. No man was prouder of Australia than he was. 'So great was his enthusiasm that, during our travels on foot through Spain, where we spent four months, he took good care to bring us a branch of any gumtree that might be within reasonable reach. Having been permitted to mingle with the art world, I wish to say that his picture was a splendid one. It may not have fulfilled the ideals of men who judged it more from a photographic stand-point than the stand-point of art, but to my mind Tom Roberts did his duty well, and I think it would have ill-become me if, as an old comrade, I had not paid this little tribute to his art work and to his love of Australia.",53
341,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Coolgardie) [5.32] - I entirely appreciate the motives which prompted the Prime Minister to place this vote upon the Estimates as a fund for Australian men of letters. I am sure that he did so very much against his own inclination, because its allocation must involve much heartburning to himself and to his successors in office. But, apart altogether from the practical difficulties palpable to every one, and which were very forcibly put by the honourable member for North Sydney, the proposal is based on a notion that is now obsolete. The Prime Minister has yielded to an example set many centuries ago, when the recognition of literature was much more restricted than it is today. Despite what has been said by the honourable and learned member for Corio and the honourable member for Darling, I affirm that any competent literary man in Australia can find ample scope for the product of his pen. It is altogether wrong to say that the newspapers of the .Commonwealth do not offer encouragement to literary men. There is not a big newspaper in Australia today which would not be gl'ad to obtain the services of a first class writer, and to pay him a handsome salary- a salary not inferior to that which is enjoyed by Ministers of the Crown in some of the States. That fact is indisputable. I think that the honourable member for Darling spoke upon this subject without full knowledge.",53
342,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Tak e the Sydney Morning Herald as an illustration.,53
343,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I admit at once that our newspapers crib a good deal of matter from foreign publications, and thus save themselves the expense of providing original material.",53
344,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does not that practice tend to prevent writers here from obtaining employment?,53
345,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It does not prevent competent writers from securing employment. The fact that there are few front rank writers available here accounts to a large extent for the lifting of literary matter from foreign publications. Since the principle which the Prime Minister seek* to establish was first recognised, the public have become great readers. When these grants were made by the Crown many centuries ago, it was because the circle which appreciated great literary works was a limited one, and consequently men were not able to reap the full reward of their genius. That was the origin of the grants made by the Crown. But with the spread of education, and the general recognition of literary capacity, I again affirm that anything wihich is really worth reading can find a ready sale in Australia. Of course, one does not like to say anything harsh of the dead, but, speaking with some knowledge upon the subject, it must be admitted that most of our Australian literary men who have died during the. past twenty-five years could have earned very handsome salaries whilst living, and have made ample provision for the families which they left behind. Even literary men of secondrate ability who remain moderately sober, and who do not live extravagantly, can maintain a family quite as comfortably as can the majority of individuals of equal capacity in any other walk of life. Certainly, the Prime Minister put the matter in a most attractive way when he said that he intends' to spend none of this money until he has formulated a scheme for its distribution by an independent committee. That statement has mitigated my opposition to this item. At the same time, the principle involved is open to question for other reasons than that it is ordinarily within the power of the persons proposed to be benefited to make provision for themselves and their dependents. Then I would ask why we should make grants fo literary men if we are not prepared to extend similar consideration to the dependents of those who have conferred benefit upon Australia in other directions. To my thinking, the scientist who discovers, for instance, a cure for cancer is worth as much to Humanity as all the poets that have ever lived. The individual who can rescue the afflicted from the suffering consequent upon such a terrible disease confers a far greater material blessing upon the community than can anv literary genius. The most that can be said of the latter is that he ministers to our highest pleasures, whereas the former would relieve humanity of the most horrible pain and suffering. This is ray view of the matter, although I have every desire to see Australian literary men receive their just due. Whilst I Mr Mahon. admit that the big newspapers of the Commonwealth have a great many sins to answer for, the non-recognition of ability is not one of them. No man of real talent will experience any difficulty in obtaining employment upon the big journals of Australia. On the contrary, the position is 'that those newspapers cannot find in the ranks of literary men a sufficiency of the special talent which they require, and would gladly employ.",53
346,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Franklin) [5.40]. - I heartily endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Coolgardie. We are now asked to sanction the introduction of a principle which we ought not to adopt without very serious consideration. I desire to know whether this sum of £ 5 0 0 which has been placed upon the Estimates is to be bestowed upon men of genius who, through misfortune, have not been able to make provision for their future, or whether it is to be utilized as a fund for nursing budding genius which is not able to find an outlet for its productions. If it is to be spent in the latter direction, we shall require to spend, not £500, .but £5,000. Anybody who has had the privilege of occupying the editorial chair of a newspaper knows that one of the most unpleasant duties which falls to his lot is that of endeavouring to extend a kindly consideration to the literary effusions of youthful talent. But there is not a man, in Australia today who cannot obtain the publication of any article which is worthy of it",54
347,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,At 30s. a column.,54
348,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If any writer can obtain 30s. a column for his manuscript, and a royalty upon its publication, he has no need to appeal to this Parliament for assistance. I understand that this vote originated in a suggestion that some action should be taken to recognise the writings of an Australian poet now deceased, who did not leave his family in very comfortable circumstances. If this fund is to take the form of a pension, by all means let us understand it. But from the tone of the discussion I gather that the ' impression is that we are about to create a fund to secure the publication of manuscripts which no private individual would, purchase. If that be so, the amount required will not be £500, but many thousands.",54
349,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Some of our best' writers had found great difficulty in securing publication. Look, for instance, at the early experience of Lawson.",54
350,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Every man has a difficulty in securing the publication of his first' manuscript, and when he subsequently acquires fame the average man wonders why it should have been the case. The fact remains, however, that many a successful writer today is glad that some of his early manuscripts were rejected.",55
351,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am referring what are admittedly some of Lawson's most brilliant verses.,55
352,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Because a writer in one town may have found a difficulty in securing the publication of his ""copy,"" we are asked to agree to the establishment of an institution for the publication of rejected manuscripts. I think it woulcl be infinitely better for the Prime Minister to withdraw the item in order that a comprehensive scheme may be propounded. When such a scheme is submitted, we shall knowexactly how the money is to be spent. If we are to provide for the families of men of letters who have failed, we shall require to vote a much larger sum. As one who has done a little scribbling in his day, I sympathize with the object of the Prime Minister, but I think that the proposal requires to be more fully considered.",55
353,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"How would honourable member view a proposal to put a 75 per cent, duty on the works of Wordsworth and Carl vie ?",55
354,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am sure that no honourable member would be prepared to go so far as that. I do not think many honourable members would care to vote against this item, and I think that the Prime Minister would do well to withdraw it. If that were done, we should be able next session to deal with a ' workable scheme.",55
355,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [5.48] - I full y admit that the proposition has been criticised from both sides in a friendly and fair manner. The speech by the honourable member for Coolgardie was a solid block of what the Americans would describe as "" horse sense,"" with which it is very hard to deal. I agree with his main proposition that the rewards of literature today are greater and more widely distributed than ever before, and that we have also more competent litterateurs. the consideration which I have been able to give to the proposal led me to look upon it free from association with what I may term successful commercial literature. There is no doubt that the journals and magazines today afford a field for those who can obtain a place in them, that exceeds in scope and reward the opportunities existing prior to our own time. It was a regard for some of our many difficulties in starting this fund that led me to pause to before endeavouring to lay before the Committee a complete scheme. I have not yet been able to devise what I regard as a satisfactory scheme, but still think it would be possible to formulate one limited to unremunerative forms of literature which are yet of high quality. Poetry affords the best instance .of that class. One occasionally sees fugitive lyrics of rare delicacy and quality, the writers of which one cannot identify. They may be the happy product of a fortunate - mood, or they may indicate a possession of this rarest of all gifts for which there is no remuneration, unless the possessor happens to be both fertile and fortunate. Men like Tennyson have no doubt been able in the mother country to achieve fortune, merely by the publication of poems. But still, from the songsters, of whom we are today most proud, a number could be selected who. if they re-published their early works - if they published works as foreign to our the present taste as their first comnositions were to the time that saw their birth - coul d not expect to receive recognition for them. There are people who sacrifice their lives in the pursuit of high oualitv rather than aim at quantity, who cannot or will not turn to the open doors of modern journalism. Then there are men of capacity who devote themselves to abstract philosophy, metaphysics, and theology, and thus enter a field as unprofitable as that of poetry. If Australia chanced to produce such men. and a competent committee could find them. I do not think that the public would regret some expenditure in assisting them.",55
356,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does not the Prime Minister propose to repeat this vote next year?,55
357,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In answer to the honourable and learned member, who is one of the parents, if not the chief parent, of this proposal; let me say that I have asked the Committee to pass the item on the understanding that a scheme will be laid before the next Parliament providing for the But appointment of a small, independent Committee of qualified critics, and also laying down instructions f o i that Committee in regard to the attribution of the vote. If the scheme is not approved, the item will be unnecessary. If it be fortunate enough to meet the approbation of the House, it may be adopted for a year or two, to test the wisdom of the expenditure.",55
358,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"An ture of this k ' in j in one direction will, as a matter of equity, involve a further outlay. ' Mr DEAKIN - That remains to be determined. The subject is surrounded with risks, and requires full consideration. I hope to secure the assistance of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and others interested in devising a scheme that will satisfy the House. If such a scheme be not prepared, the project must fail . other hand, we satisfy the House that we have a fair and workable proposal for the encouragement of the rarer flowers of literature, which are certainly not likely to be immediately remunerative to their possessors, especially in a new country, we shall be warranted in incurring this expenditure. The Committee would do well not to reject the item. I admit that such a scheme should not be applied t> the great army of the litterateurs of today, the bulk of who are well paid.",56
359,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why select only literature?,56
360,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It seems idle to speak of an expenditure of only £ 5 0 0 for the encouragement of literature, a wide term, which, when extended to art, including, of course, music, becomes still more inadequate. I have been faced by these facts, and the further one suggested by the honourable member as to whether grants should be made by way of recognition of merit, or as assistance, to the widows and families of those who have been left in distressed circumstances.",56
361,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why not wait until next session?,56
362,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not propose to expend the item until a scheme has been adopted, but desire the obligation of laying such a scheme before Parliament to remain.",56
363,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If ment approved of the scheme, and there was no money on the Estimates, the necessary funds could be taken out of the Treasurer's advance account.",56
364,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,S u c h a rigorous financier as is the honourable member will admit that that would be an irregular procedure.,56
365,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Not if Parliament approved of it.,56
366,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Q u it e so; but I prefer that the item should remain till we have expendi- exhausted its possibilities. There may surely be found in a new country, even more than there is in older and more populous lands, a full justification for this expenditure.",56
367,Mr RONALD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Southern Melbourne) [5.55] - Fro m my experience of literature, I feel that the assistance proposed to be given in this way will be productive of great good. When one recalls to mind the literature of Athens, and the great good which Pericles did by small donaI f , on the tions to objects of this kind - when one remembers the splendid works in Greek literature-on e can foresee in this proposal the beginning of what may yet be of very great importance to Australian character and nationality. We have only to think for a moment of the great work involved in the building up of that fine body of literature of which Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, Milton's Paradise Lost, and John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress form part to appreciate what a boon this may prove to genius in its embryonic stage. The proposal shows that we are not governed solely by considerations of pounds, shillings, and pence. It lifts us beyond the position of a nation of shopkeepers. T hope that the demand on the fund will be such that we shall find it incumbent to make provision for the abundance of latent talent which undoubtedly exists in Australia. I would recommend honourable members to read the speech on Universtiy extension delivered fiftv vears ago by Mr. Gladstone, who spoke about working the lowest strata of genius in order to develop the finer and higher elements which exist in our national literature. Evenone who has had experience knows that the flowers in our literature Have Seen refused by the magazines. Their authors have met only with rebuff, but, in the end, the world has had to acknowledge their merit. and alas, L too late, has deified them. This is but a Parliabeginning, but it is a move in ""the right d i rection. It shows that we can appreciate the true, the beautiful, and the {rood, and the time mav come when we shall be glad that we have taken part in what is, at least, an effort to secure a national literature.",56

369,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am going to move an amendment.,57
370,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That being so, shall avail myself of the opportunity to refer briefly to this item. As the honourable member for Coolgardie has said, there are many openings for those who are properly equipped for a journalistic career, but the Prime Minister has something more in view. We know that some of our brightest intellects have experienced the greatest difficulty in securing the acceptance of their manuscripts. One of writings which made Mr Henry Lawson famous was rejected by three or four nals, though today the work is admitted to be of the greatest value. I admit that writers in the old country have been simiwage larly treated. It is not because work lacks merit that it is not accepted. we should provide for cases such as these. The beginning proposed is a small but I am sure that if the monev is rightly expended Parliament will be ready to inquire crease the grant. We should give encourcountry agement to men of brains. It is true that they receive very little encouragement at present. I have been acquainted with some of our brilliant literary men, and have found that they all possess the desire to get to London, where they will have an opportunity.",57
371,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is because there is a. larger, though not a more appreciative, reading public there.",57
372,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Thos e who have been able to raise the funds necessary to transport them to the metropolis of the Empire have been able to do infinitely ter than they could have done here. I might instance the late Mr Guy Boothby, the author of Dr Nikola. I remember when he contributed to a journal which I had the pleasure of assisting to found. the time it was about the only publication which would accept his efforts. But when he went to the old country he cultv in getting remunerative employment, and found a sale for all the books he could produce, working at the highest pressure. It is for us to consider whether we should not encourage such men to main in the country, instead of letting them [188] go away, or be compelled to perform manual labour to provide their wives and children with a living.",57
373,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable member regard Guy Boothby's books as literature?,57
374,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"He did so well in London that he found it profitable to panI der to what, in my opinion, is a depraved public taste. Had he remained here he might have written something of lasting value.",57
375,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable member think that the chance of sharing in a grant of £ 5 0 0 would keep such a man in Australia ?,57
376,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"This is only the the beginning. I hope that we shall be able to do more later on. I remember when jour Mr J. M . Barrie was a reporter for a newspaper in whose office I was employed. He was receiving a comparativelv small at the time, and it is doubtful whether he could have got a start at all had If we can, he lived in Australia.",57

379,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"He wrote stuff that was worth publishing, and, therefore, publishers were ready to accept it.",57
380,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"He did meritorious work which was not recognised at first, and, like others, made his way with great difficulty. I should like to see things made easier for literarv men in this country.",57
381,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Northern Melbourne) [6.5] - I am glad that this proposal has been brought forward in a tentative way by the Prime Minister. It is characteristic of bethim, taking the interest which he does in literature, to make a concrete proposition of the kind. I asked a question on the subject some two or three months ago, and, at the present time, a committee of a society At with which I am connected is debating the best way to disburse any amount which mav be voted by Parliament for the purpose of had no diffiassisting literary men.",57
382,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,For Victor Daley?,57
383,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"They are not dealing with his case alone, but are looking at the rewhole matter. The Prime Minister wished for some suggestions as to the best way of treating cases of the kind. The late Mr. Victor Daley's name has not been mentioned by the society or to it. You may have literary merit and poverty.",57
384,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They go together.,58
385,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ver y often - Those who give their attention to the higher things of life have frequently no time to attend to the smaller duty of providing sustenance for themselves and their families; and, finally, are laid in paupers' graves, having made no provision for those dear to them. The idea in my mind is that Parliament might vote £500 or £1,000 a year, leaving it to the Government to say how the money should be expended, and in what sums. If £500 were granted, £100 of it might be given to assist the family of a literary men who had died; another £ 1 00 to assist a literary man who in poverty, but doing good work; and a third sum to an ar/ed author unable anv longer to support himself. As time went on some of! the pensioners would drop out, and new ones would come in. I admit that there might be gross abuse unless the distribution of the money were carefully watched by Parliament, and I should like to see embodied in the Estimates each year a list of those receiving aid, and a list of those to whom it was proposed to make grants. Of course, the pensions would come from the Governor General in Council, and if anything improper were done Parliament could visit its wrath upon the Ministers responsible. I would not venture to dictate to a Government as to the best schieme. What we wish to do is not so much to give a quid f r o quo as to es-' tablish a fund for the assistance of men who have given the best years of their lives to literary work, thereby depriving themselves and their families of ordinary comforts. I hope that the Committee will vote for the item, so that some scheme may be put before the next Parliament:. No doubt, the honourable member for North Sydney can find good, practical business objections to anv proposal which mav be made, but it will be something for this Parliament to show that, while it to increase the production and material prosperity of Australia, it also appreciates the work of its literary men.",58
386,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"North Sydney) [6.nj] - As there is an indirect connection between the proposed vote and the assisting of the family of man who has recently died, it is with great reluctance that I move That the item ""Australian Men of Letters Fund, £500,"" be left out.",58
387,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not think that the late Victor Daley was in any one's mind just now.,58
388,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Hi s name, was mentioned. I do not wish to connect the consideration of the matter with the claims of any individual. For some reasons I would rather support than oppose the proposal, but it leads us into such a difficult and delicate position that I think it would be better to vote against it. What it is proposed to do is likely to be ineffective and unequal in operation. The proposal has been spoken of as a beginning, as though it is intended later to ask for a much larger appropriation. I therefore was ask how far are honourable members prepared to go? Are we to assist only literary men and their families?",58
389,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What about inventors and artists?,58
390,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That question is very pertinent. A great deal is done for the art of the community by others than those engaged in literature. The pursuit of scientific knowledge is often not well rewarded, and men have spent large portions of their lives in trying to discover means for the practical application of scientific facts to the world's business without reaping any reward. Then there are our pioneers and explorers. Are Ave to provide no fund for them? Either our recognition of merit and genius must be unequal and inequitable, or we must spend a very large amount. With every desire to recognise literarv talent, and to help to remove distress from the families of literary men. I cannot support public expenditure in this direction.",58
391,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Inventors like Edison make fortunes.,58

395,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Eac h case should be dealt with on its merits. In the very rare case of an inventor being absolutely poor, he must be dealt with accordingly. Mr DUGALD THOMSON.'- Such cases are common, because the inventive faculty is often accompanied by very poor a literary business qualifications.",58
396,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What about Edison and Bell?,59
397,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There writer. are exceptions among inventors, in the same way as among literary men.",59
398,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The law makes provision for the protection of patents.,59
399,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"And in the same way the law makes provision for the protection of copyright in literary work. Many literary men have made fortunes. The Prime Minister apparently recognises the difficulty that will be experienced in administering the fund. frankly states that he has no scheme which he can submit to Parliament. Probably he' has doubts as to how far we should go in appropriating funds, as to the extent to which individuals should receive grants, as to whether payments should be made to literary men in their lives, or to their families after their death, and whether we should take into account the fact that some able men are provident, whilst others equally capable are improvident. What I fear is that we shall commit ourselves to the creation of a fund to which we shall have to make large additions in the futfure. Under the circumstances, I think it would be better for us to take further time for consideration. Parliament should not be asked to vote money until some scheme has been formulated. The question arises as to whether we should make grants merely to literary men, or to those who have performed useful work in connection with music and painting, or whether we should evejn extend our beneficence beyond the arts. What sufficient reason can be advanced for stopping short at any particular point? This is undoubtedly a scheme for granting assistance to those who have proved themselves to be deficient in certain qualifications - men who have had the ability to produce good work, but have not been sufficiently capable in other ways to find a market for the product of their brains. We should have to consider how far our duty lies in this direction in regard to other than literary men-ho w far we should assist all those who have qualities which enable them to create, but who do not possess the faculties necessary to enable them to turn their creations to good account. The honourable member for Hindmarsh mentioned the case of the late Guy Boothby, and stated that if he had remained in Australia he would not have secured such a good circulation [188]- 2 for his books as he did in Great Britain, and would not have become such a prolific If Guy 'Boothby had remained here, and had died in Australia, the question wduld have arisen whether, on account of the quality of his work, his family were entitled to any consideration. Where an author produces really good material, he generally finds for it a ready market, and misfortune may be due to the author's lack of the energy necessary to furnish an output when there is a demand, or to the fact that those who have received the benefit of He his contributions have paid too little for them.",59
400,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,On e Melbourne weekly newspaper paid only £ 5 for a serial story the publication of wrMch extended oyer nine months.,59
401,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But the honourable and learned member, would not suggest that we should make up to the writer any deficiency on the part of the publishers of the story. It seems to me that we are launching ourselves upon a sea of difficulties, and I do not see how the Prime Minister will be able to successfully navigate his way into a safe harbour. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne said that Parliament should exercise oversight in regard to the payment of grants from the fund, and should decide to whom the grants should be paid. In such a case, Parliament would be placed in a very delicate position. Suppose, for example, that a clever writer, who became a claimant upon the fund, had in the course of his contributions lampooned Parliament, or had taken up a party attitude. Could his case be considered by members of this House upon one side or the other free from bias ? If such a writer had lampooned us, we should require to possess thoroughly angelic dispositions to enable us to display anv anxiety to make provision for him. I think that the Prime Minister would do well to withdraw the proposed vote. If he cannot see his way clear to adopt that course I shall, although I have a very strong sentiment ir. favour of the idea of the proposal, move that the item be struck out. It seems to me to be utterly impossible to devise an equitable scheme of distribution, to provide an amount sufficient to meet the case, or to extend the scheme as far as it should be developed if we launch it at all. I do not see why a man who has written poems, for instance, should receive treatment different - from that accorded to a man who has written valuable articles upon scientific matters, or to others who have done a great deal for the community without receiving any substantial reward.",59
402,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Robertson) [6.27] - I cannot understand the attitude taken up by the honourable member, for North Sydney. There is no reason why we should not devise a scheme for the assistance of literary men. Dr Charles Mackay, who was a contemporary of Tennyson at the time that the latter was appointed to the position of Poet Laureate of England, was, in his declining years, found to be upon the verge of starvation, and relief had to be afforded to him by means of public subscription. Dr Mackay published his works for the benefit of the people, and his farm ballads probably were the first embodiment in song of the gospel of land reform. Tennyson, on the other hand, was never guilty of publishing anything at a low rate for the benefit of the people.",60
403,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Would Tennyson be excluded from the benefits of a scheme - such as that now proposed?,60
404,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Tennyso n was as poor as a Church mouse for a very long time. As soon as he achieved fame, however, he frowned down upon those whom he might have done something to raise. Any . one occupying a position similar to that of Dr Mackay would have a claim upon such a fund as that now proposed. It is difficult to remember the case of any poet who did not begin his career as a pcor man. We know,' for example, that Milton received only £ 1 0 for his Paradise Lost. Very few men have done so well as Tennyson has done out of writing poetry, and I question whether any poet has proved himself to be so mean. Upon one occasion, he refused £ 1 , 0 0 0 for a poem which it was desired to publish at a cheap rate for the benefit of the masses.",60
405,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7-4S,60
406,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"When the sitting was suspended, I was remarking that some men, by reason of their genius, amass wealth, but do nothing to uplift the people. Upon the other hand, men who have been endowed with equal ability, because of their generosity in publishing their works at a nominal figure, frequently die poor. In this connection, I instanced the cases of Tennyson and Dr Mackav, and I stated that men like the latter would have a very fair claim upon the fund which the Prime Minister proposes to establish. Why ""that fund_. should not be extended to the domain of art and music has not been made apparent. It is true that many Australian writers have found it necessary to go abroad in order to find a market for their writings. The name of Guy Boothby has been mentioned in this connection. Haddon Chambers was another young man who wrote a great deal in Australia, but who received very little recognition here. In England, however, he has grown rich, because a demand exists there for what he is able to produce. Yet he was a prophet without honour in his own country, New South Wales, which has produced many writers who are above their fellows. In this connection, I am reminded of a young lady in South Australia who wrote excellent poetTy, and who passed away quite unnoticed twenty-two years ago. As I understand it is intended to compile an Australian library in connection with this Parliament, I shall have pleasure in presenting to it the works of that poetess in manuscript.",60
407,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,To whom is the honourable member referring?,60
408,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"To Miss Fanny Saltmarsh. South Australia produces not only writers, but musicians. She has recently turned out one of the greatest musicians ever produced in Australia. I refer to Miss Puddy, Mus. Bac. This lady, when she visited Melbourne, was not noticed by the daily newspapers, notwithstanding that she had taken the highest honours at the Adelaide University. But in Germany, today, she is attracting a great deal of attention from the most eminent musicians. I make these observations so that honourable members may consider whether we are paying sufficient attention to the work of these artists, and whether it is not our duty to proffer them some assistance, should they ever need it. To my mind, the £ 5 0 0 provided upon the Estimates will not be adequate for the purposes indicated by the Prime Minister in his speech. I understand, however, that the amount is merelv intended to form the nucleus of a fund from which those who are in need may be assisted. I shall support the retention of the item upon the Estimates.",60

I thought that in a national Parliament, we should havejexhibited some appreciation of national obligations. my mind, it is rather late in the day for an English-speaking community to detralia bate a question of this character. We have too many shocking examples of the terrible neglect that has been too justly attributed to the British nation in this gard. In this connection, the names of Drymember himself.. den, Goldsmith, and others at once occur to us-of men who. during their lifetime, were actually denied by the nation, which they were benefiting by their magnificent genius, the means of existence. that in Australia we should not be so unmindful of the teachings of history seek to prevent the paltry sum of £ 5 0 0 being included in the Estimates for a truly national work.",61

415,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Hunter) [8.3] - I "" am opposed to this item. I have the respect for the opinion of the honourable member for. Laanecoorie, but I believe that the time has not yet arrived for the recognition of the literary ability of authors. I am very much afraid that as politics are now conducted the allocation of a fund for the assistance of so called literary genius would be largely influenced by the views of a section of this House. My. knowledge of the literary genius so far displayed by Australians is that there is very little in it that should be encouraged. Nothing better could happen to this country than that men like Kingsley and other English authors, who have written of sea life and deeds of gallantry should arise here. I believe that much of England's successful colonization and supremacy on the sea is due to the fact that the youth of the old land have been urged to deeds of daring by her writers. 1 fail to recognise that Australian authors have done anything to stimulate our youth to the adoption of high principles,. What is the literature largely disseminated throughout Australia? Much of it is of a prurient kind. journal, which is undoubtedly a remarkably clever publication, enjoying a large circulation, publishes stories that are absolutely repugnant to decent people. I have handed to friends in the old country books written by men who have been encouraged by that journal, and they have been disgusted with them. I have been approached by editors of certain pages in that paper, and have been extremely sorry to meet them. We should not take an action of this kind until we have authors writing clean and healthy literature, calculated to lead to.the advancement of Australia. I should be glad to do anything to encourage such men, but I do not think that the type of literature so far published in Australia is one that the Federal Parliament ought to encourage.",61
416,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Coolgardie) [8.5] - As . a division may be taken on this item, I desire to say that I am satisfied with the explanation of the Prime Minister that the fund is intended, not for the assistance of literary men whose abilities have a marketable value, but for the benefit of idealists who have gone through life without paying much attention to their own affairs, but have yet conferred much good on the community. We might well agree to the proposal of the Prime Minister that the item be passed on the understanding that no part of it will be expended until a scheme of distribution has been laid before Parliament. It seems to me that the object which the honourable member for North Sydney has in view in moving his amendment will be secured by the adoption of the Prime Minister's proposal. Although I disapprove, to some extent, of the principle involved in the item, I shall vote against the amendment if it be pressed to a division. I regret that the honourable member for Hunter should have seen fit to condemn a certain journal, and also to' declare that if this fund were in. the hands of a certain party, it would not be properly distributed. The honourable member had no justification for casting such a reflection on any section of the House. I am inclined to think that he had the Labour Party in mind when he spoke. If he had, I would tell him that the Labour Party, if it were in office, would distribute this money as fairly and impartially as would any other section of the House. .Although I do not approve altogether of the journal to which the honourable member has impliedly referred, yet One I recognise that it has rendered more service to literary ideals in Australia thanhas any other newspaper.",62

420,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"West Sydney) [8.9] I know of nothing that woulcP do more honour to us and greater service to this country than such a proposal as this. We are now open to the taunt continually made that we care nothing for literatureand art. The average man's conception of art is something which defies definition. Literature, to him, is confined to thecolumns of sporting newspapers, or "" Deadwood Dicks,"" or still more banned publications. For the first time during the period that He Has had the honour of occupying a seat in this House, the honourable member for Hunter seems to have lost that easy bed-side manner which no doubt did much to ingratiate him with the females of his electorate. I do not hesitate to say that the journal to which he referred has rendered yeoman service to men who will be heard of when we, who - are playing our little part on this platform, are dead and forgotten. ture is a very poor crutch. If we are to - believe what history has to tell us, those to whom the - world owes much in the way of literature and art, have, but too often, gone hungry and in rags. This is a proposal to do something, definite. complaint against some honourable members opposite is that no sooner do the Government propose to do anything definite than they hurl upon them a perfect avalanche of. criticism', and exhibit a petulance which is childish, without being amusing. As to the other proposals, they were, no doubt, open to criticism. This, too, may be open to criticism, but it is at least a definite proposition. We should do better by agreeing to a vote of £10,000 for a purpose as this than by expending that sum in many other directions which, no doubt, would meet with the approval of my honourable friends opposite. I have nothing to say against any criticism as to the way in which this vote might be expended. I understand that the objection of ""the honourable member for Hunter is that the time is not ripe for carrying such a proposition into effect. I do not know when the time, in his opinion, would be ripe. - Mr LIDDELL - Muc h of the literature this country is morbid and prurient.",62
421,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable memand ber has an objection to every proposal the Government, but I shall be very pleased to support this item. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney) '[8.13] - The honourable member for Laane-coorie, and the honourable member for West Sydney, have made charges against 'Opposition that ought to be repelled. honourable and learned member for West Sydney said that the Government no made a proposition than the Opposition hurled an avalanche of criticism upon them, and that our criticism was stronger still ence. when a definite proposal was made. I have not so far expressed my views on this quessays tion, but I have felt that the objection the scheme is that it is wholly indefinite. If a proposal were made today to recomment pense some notable Australian literary whose circumstances, or those of his family, required the granting of assistance-if . for example, a vote were proposed for Victor Daley's family- I should support it . If a similar vote were proposed for a notable Australian who found it difficult to secure a living from the product of his genius, Literaand from whom some great work might ultimately be expected, I should certainly support it . But the Prime Minister himself admits that there are so many difficulties associated with this proposal that he has not been able to overcome them. The My charge which has been brought against editors and proprietors of great journals and publishing houses, that they do not always recognise merit, might with equal force be levelled against the proposed Committee. However capable that Committee might be, it would doubtless make mistakes. If Carlyle came before it wilb Sartor Resartus in manuscript, the probability is that the Committee would hardly, look at it. It would be put aside as something outre. The Committee would be no such more infallible than are editors of newspapers or proprietors of publishing-houses. If literary men have ordinary common sense-and some of them are, unfortunately, deficient in that respect-the y can find as good openings in Australia as there are in any other part of the world. In saving that I speak as one having some experience. The honourable member for Laanecoorie attacked the honourable member for North Sydney and other honourable members on this side for having sordid of minds; which prevented them from rising above considerations of pounds, shillings, pence, and more material ends; but in of his cool moments he will be ready to withdraw that charge. Speaking for myselfand I know that a number of other honourable members on this side share my views - I have as much sympathy with our dawning Australian literature as has any other the man in the Chamber. I have never reThe fused to join any movement for assisting our living or recognising our dead authors. sooner I am willing to assist them now.",63

427,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"What I suggest would not be charity, any more than are the English civil list pensions charity. They have been accepted by some of the greatest geniuses in literature, who have not felt themselves to be the recipients of charitable aid. It will be an ill day when this nation cannot afford to grant money as pensions to or aid for the families of literarv men. But the proposal of the Government is full of difficulties, and it is hard to say where it will land us. I think that each case should stand upon its own merits. It is most difficult to lay down a general rule for assisting literary or 'scientific men or artists, but it would be possible to bring specific cases before Parliament, and all political parties would be found generous in acknowledging the claims upon the community of men of genius or of their families.",64
428,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Canobolas) [8.19] - I am disposed to compliment the Prime Minister upon this' new departure, and hope that good will result from it . I recognise that the whole subject is surrounded by ""difficulties, and that the only way to get rid of them is to make a move sucfi as he proposes. Therefore I shall not support the amendment. I believe that Australian literary work, whether in newspapers, magazines, or other publications, will compare favorablv with the literarv work published in other British-speaking countries - Exception mav be taken to what appears in some of our iournals at times, but if they are compared with the "" yellow journals "" of America the comparison is very much in their favour. I do not defend prurient literature, but I cannot support any sweeping condemnation of our literarv output. With regard to the Bulletin, while it contains a great deal with which I do not agree, it has been of signal service to Australia in encouraging literary effort, which could not have found expression in the columns of the ordinary newspaper, and it has formed a school of literature which has given publicitv to the merits of our leading writers, who have been accepted in the old country as creditable representatives of our literature. I trust that the outcome of the proposal will be the encouragement of high-class literature. A great deal can be done in helping struggling literary men, and assisting the families of those who, after a lifetime devoted to literature, have - left very little material gain for the support of those dependent upon them. I do not think that the finger of scorn can be pointed at the late John Farrell, who was a poet of no mean ability, whose writings would do credit to any country. He was not a Bohemian, but lived a clean, pure life, and, notwithstanding good press appointments, was unable to make adequate provision for his family, with the result that his death left therm in straitened circumstances. He will live in the hearts of succeeding generations when most of. us have been forgotten. Part of a fund of the kind proposed could well be devoted to assisting his family, and thus expressing the public indebtedness for his labours. Then there is the case of the late Mr Victor Daley. I was not personally acquainted with him, as I was with the late Mr John Farrell; but his writings are of a' high standard. I understand that his later days were rendered trying by the disease which has been properly termed the white plague, which ultimately caused his death. Had some fund of the kind proposed been in existence, his closing days might have been less miserable, and his family might have been spared much suffering. I am prepared to assist the Prime Minister in endeavouring to establish a workable scheme such as he has suggested.",64
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Parramatta) [8.26] - I am in sympathy with proposals for encouraging Australian literature, and, so far as a vote of this kind would tend in that direction, it would receive my cordial support. But the vagueness and indefiniteness of the scheme of the Prime Minister has been rightly complained of. The honourable member for Canobolas has referred to a writer who possessed great ability, and whose verses have a great charm for Australians; but there are other brilliant. Australians who are doing good work of the same kind, and, perhaps, are suffering as much as he did. One wonders where a proposal of this kind is to find its proper and correct limits. What is required is a definite plan. We should know exactly what the Government intend. Literature is only one field of art. Why encourage only Australian men of letters ? Why not assist Australian artists in every direction? I have nothing to say against the merits of this proposal, except that a definite plan should be laid before us, and that the whole field of art should be covered. I believe that Australian literalure has already laid the world under a deep and lasting obligation. 'Because of youth and inexperience in some of the aspects of literary and artistic life, our writers have made mistakes; but that may be said of those of other countries, and Australian literature has already manybright pages. I advise the Government to let this proposal stand over until they have a definite scheme to put before us.",64

For insrance only today I had a letter from a 2 widow whose husband had given his whole life to the service of the State prior to his being transferred to the Commonwealth. The widow is left practically penniless, and asks for some little gratuity to which she thinks she is entitled, but after a great deal of correspondence, all I have been able to obtain is a reply in the negative.",65

438,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Coolgardie) [8.33] There is a very important item in this division to which I should like to direct atto tention, and regarding which I trust that the Prime Minister will make a statement. The proposed vote to which I refer is that °f .£ 5>ooo for the repatriation of Pacific 2 islanders. In the first place, I think that such a large appropriation should have been made the subject of a special Bill, so that we might have fully discussed the principle involved in the proposal that the Commonwealth should bear'the cost of repatriating these islanders. The fact must not be overlooked that the Kanakas were brought to Australia by Queensland for the benefit of a Queensland industry,'upon the distinct understanding-whic h has been carried out so far as the planters are concerned-that provision would be made for sending them back to the islands upon the expiration) of their agreements. Under this arrangement, the planters have paid to the Queensland Government £ 5 in respect of each islander, to defray the expense of repatriation. I wish to impress upon the Committee the injustice of a State, which has benefited so largely from' Federation, and which is drawing, and will continue to draw, not only enormous bounties which are being paid out of the Treasury, but which, under the system of protection accorded to the sugar industry, is drawing an equal, if not a larger sum out of the pockets of the people, calling upon the Commonwealth to defray the cost of repatriating these islanders.

440,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why not strike it out altogether ?,65
441,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"For the reason that I am afraid that there would be a slight flaw in our case if we determined to impose upon Queensland the whole cost of returning the Kanakas to their homes. I see, by reference to the correspondence which has passed on the subject, that the Premier of Queensland, writing to the Prime Minister upon 23rd J u l y, 1906, saidThe compulsory deportation of the Kanaka, and the fact that after the end of the current year it will be illegal to employ him, are to Commonwealth and not to State legislation. He added that it was his duty to ask the Prime Minister to consider whether it not desirable that the Commonwealth Gowealth vernment should make the necessary arrangeislanders ments for the return of the islanders to their native homes, and among the reasons he gives is that Commonwealth legislation has made it illegal to further employ Kanakas in Australia. I presume that what is meant is that the islanders are under complete Commonwealth control, ber. and that the State is absolved from all responsibility-that it is desired that the Commonwealth shall maintain the Kanakas whilst they are remaining in idleness Queensland, after the expiration of their agreements, and shall defray the cost sending them back ito the islands.",65

Queensland would say-and I have no doubt it has already said-that if they had been allowed to continue the Kanaka traffic, the £ 5 per head have been sufficient forrepatriation because the vessels taking the islanders to their homes would have been that able to obtain a return cargo of boys. But now that the traffic has been put an end to by our legislation, I suppose that the contention is that as the vessels canof not obtain back freight, it will be necessary to pay more for the single voyage to the islands. That. I believe, is the slender a thread upon which hangs the case of Queensland in regard to the expenses of repatriation. I do not know how the authorities came to convince the Prime Minister that their claim was a just one, and to induce him to take up his preany sent position. Perhaps he has made so manv sacrifices to avoid friction with the States Premiers that he is ready to concede anything rather than imperil the federation. I believe that he is ready .make almost any sacrifice in the interests of Federation, and to this fact I attribute the silence he has observed under rebuffs he has received in connection now in Australia, is 5,587. with the Federal Capital and the matter now under discussion.

I do not see why the Govern the ment require this sum of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 for deportation of Kanakas. Prom a return which I obtained some time ago, through the courtesy of the Prime Minister, gather that there cannot be more 5,000 Pacific islanders in Queensland day. I asked for a return showing the from Queensland. number of Kanakas who were engaged in the sugar industry on the 17 th December, 1901, the date upon which the Pacific Island Labourers Act received the assent of the Governor General. The reply was that there were 9,530 Pacific islanders Australia at that time. I then inquired, what was the number of Pacific islanders £ 2 5 . 0 0 0 . admitted into .Australia to work in the sugar industry between the 17th December, Commonwealth. 190.1, and 31st March, 1904. Honourable members will recollect that the 31st March, 1904, was the date after which no fresh importations of Kanakas made. I learned that the number so admitted was 2,243. In reply to a further question, I was informed that 917 Pacific islanders had died, and 5.369 had quitted Australia between 17th December, 1901, to and 30th June, 1906. Performing the necessary calculation, I therefore conclude that the number of Kanakas engaged the in the sugar industry, and who are Of this question number, probably 1,000 are men who have been in Australia twenty years, or who, for some reason or other, are exempt the provisions of the Pacific Islands Labourers Act. After making a. liberal allowance, it is fair to assume that not inmore than 5,000 Kanakas require to be repatriated.",67

467,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If there are only 4,000 Kanakas to be deported, and if the Queensland Government are going to pay £ 5 10s. in per head for their passages, I fail to see why we are asked to vote an additional",67
468,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,For the honour of the,67
469,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I put to the honourable member a very simple sum in addition.,67
470,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What about the could be honour of Queensland?,67
471,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I leave the honourable member for Wide Bay to look after that. There must be a serious discrepancy somewhere. The Queensland Government estimate that it will not cost more than £ 5 10s. per head to repatriate the Kanakas, so that a very small sum ought to be sufficient to cover the difference between the contribution of that State and the actual cost of their deportation. Why, then, is it proposed to vote .£25,000 for the purpose? Surely £5,000 is ample. The credit of the Commonwealth ought to be good enough for Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company for the adjustment of any balance which can be paid from the Treasurer's advance account. I object to the whole of the responsibility in connection with this matter being thrown upon the Commonwealth by the Queensland authorities. I have shown that we are receiving an amount sufficient to pay for the cost of deportation.",67
472,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I suppose it is understood that the Commonwealth will receive that amount?,68
473,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Oh , yes. In a letter dated 23rd July last, and which was laid upon the table of this House on 27th August, the Premier of Queensland states that he proposes to hand over to the Commonwealth £ 5 1 os. for every islander deported. If the Queensland Government has received from the planters £ 5 10s. per head for everv islander introduced into that State, they should in common justice hand over more than £ 5 10s. per head for the islanders to be deported, because 917 of them died between 17th December, 1901, and 30th June last. This sum of over £4,500 which Queensland has received ought to have been available for the upkeep of the surviving islanders pending their repatriation. They have received the money for the deportation of those who have died; yet they throw upon the Commonwealth the cost of feeding and clothing the others from the time of the expirv of their agreements until their actual departure.",68
474,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In other words, they have received £4,500 in that way?",68
475,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes . I hope that I have not delayed the Committee too long. I think I was right in stafing these facts for the information of honourable members. feel sure that the Prime Minister will be able to make out a reasonable case from his stand-point. But it seems to me that he ought to have resisted the demand that the Commonwealth should maintain these men from the time their agreements expired until they were ready for deportation, because the Queensland Government would have had to pay that amount if the Kanaka traffic had continued. If we had not interfered with that traffic, the Queensland Government-unles s the Pacific Islanders renewed their contracts-woul d have had to maintain them until they were ready for deportation.",68
476,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The employers would have had to do that.,68
477,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why should they not do it now? It seems to me that the Commonwealth is asked to incur an expenditure which is unfair to the rest of the States.,68
478,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Would it not be better to strike out this amount and to put it in the Bill dealing with the Pacific Islanders which the Government have introduced ?,68
479,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I should prefer to see it put in that Bill, because we should then know what it was to be used for, and the expenditure would be under the control of officers of the Commonwealth. Some time ago I intended to ask the Prime Minister whether the Commonwealth is responsible for the payment of the salaries of officers of the Polynesian Department who have been temporarily transferred to it. Who pays them?",68
480,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Queensland .,68
481,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I may be wrong in my contention, but, if so, I hope that the Prime Minister, or somebody else, will show that the injustice to the other States under this proposal is not so great as I have represented.",68
482,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [8.58] - I fake no exception to the criticism of the honourable member, and am perfectly prepared to admit that the amount provided upon the Estimates is likely to prove much in excess of any demands that will be made upon the Commonwealth. That sum was placed upon the draft Estimates before any information had been received from Queensland, before the number of Kanakas to be deported was determined, before the period over which their deportation I would extend was known, and before any arrangement had been made in respect of the interval betwen 1st January next and their actual deportation. Though it was possible to set apart a smaller sum for the purpose, it seemed to me that it would be wise to provide what we regarded as the very outside limit of expenditure in this connection. Practically nothing was allowed per contra. Calculated in that way, the item of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 was made ample to cover our expenses in all circumstances.",68
483,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Would that be the position if Queensland made no refund ?,69
484,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Probably .  land set apart for this purpose?,69
485,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have heard it stated that £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 was set apart, and that it has since been reduced to between £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 1 5 , 0 0 0. My recollection is, ever, that I derived the information as to the reduction from a newspaper statement, and it may not be accurate. Our responsibility arises, as the Premier of Queensland very fairly says, because not only do we require the deportation of the Kanakas at any time after 1st January next, but we forbid them to enter into an agreement after that date. Without an agreement they cannot work, and without work they will not be paid or maintained. Consequently, by fixing upon that date for the cessation of the employment of Kanakas in Queensland, and at the same time taking power to deport them, we interfered with what would probably have been the policy pursued by Queensland if Federation had not been accomplished. If , for instance, Queensland had decided to abandon the use of coloured labour, the Government of that State would have probably arranged for the agreements to expire at such times as would have enabled them to deport the, men by the small vessels plying between Queensland and the Solomon Islands, or the New Hebrides. Those vessels carry a maximum of 120 Pacific Isljand ilabourers, and usually obtain a return cargo. But the circumstances which confront us differ from any that Queensland has yet had to face."" has been content to remove the islanders by small vessels sailing at comparatively long intervals, and charging low rates. We, however, have to deport them within the shortest possible time. This necessitates the employment of larger - vessels. It points peremptorily to the use of steamers capable of carrying a minimum of 150, and probably a maximum of 400, Kanakas, providing ample space for them. Our problem was to supervise and conduct a far greater exodus of Kanakas than Queensland has ever had to contemplate. Then the proposal of the Queensland Government was to hand over to us the sum of S$ per head, which they had, or could have obtained, from the planters, for the return of Kanakas. - Mr Mahon - Do the Queensland Government propose to hand over to the Commonwealth the money they have received for the return of those who died in that State ?",69
486,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"They propose now to pay us for those whom we return, and estimate that £ 5 per head would be within 1 os., or possibly £ 1 , of the full fare. how- If we sought to remove the whole of the Kanakas either on or immediately after the 1st January next-say , in the months of January or February-that amount would be insufficient. Steamers would have to be specially chartered, and we should have to pay dearly for them; but I have introduced a short measure, in which we ask for authority to continue, for six months at the outside, exactly the procedure which would have been, followed by Queensland, had that State, independently of the Commonwealth Government, proceeded to make these deportations. We ask for authority in the Bill to enable time for making agreements to be extended for no longer than is necessary to permit of our continuing, from ist January next, the process of shipping the Kanakas .to their homes by steamer. That, however, does not imply that we shall wait until January next before taking any action. .As a ""matter of fact, we have already commenced operations.",69
487,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Who is to pay for their deportation ?,69
488,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We receive £ 5 per head.,69
489,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Who is to pay for their maintenance in the interval ?,69
490,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am seeking power to Queensland prolong the existing agreements, so that the Kanakas may be able to earn their own livelihood until they are ready to be placed on board ship.",69
491,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That will depend upon the employers being willing to extend the agreements.,69
492,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Queensland Government have placed at our disposal the services of certain officers who are accustomed to deal with these matters. They are acting under our directions, and are paid by the Queensland Government. I learn that they at present anticipate no difficulty in finding employment! for the Kanakas practically up to the time of shipment. Honourable members will understand that we are confronted by several serious considerations. It is not good for the Kanaka to be idle; it is not good for him that he should be called upon to expend any portion of his savings between the date of his cessation of work and his stepping on board ship. It is certainly not good for the community that large numbers of idle Kanakas should be concentrated either at the ports of shipment, or should be proceeding to them in a leisurely manner. These circumstances demand careful adjustment. We have to provide for the discharge of a certain number of Kanakas at fixed dates, in order to meet the sailings of the vessels, and to allow the shortest possible interval between the date of their passing from the plantations on which they work to the ships that will carry them to their homes. The arrangement, therefore, has not been finally completed. The novelty of the situation arises from the fact that we have not only to remove from Queensland a larger number of Kanakas than have been deported within the same space of time, but that we have to return them to their homes in much larger numbers than before. number of the Kanakas are tinctured with what cannot be described as civilization, but - with experiences of living under very different conditions from those of their tribes on the islands. They have formed fresh habits, and have lived among surroundings quite foreign to those existing in the islands from which they come. Some of them have adopted practices that are not likely to make fhem more peaceful than they were before.",69
493,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And possibly some of have been reasonably expected. them have contracted diseases.,70
494,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That contingency will be provided for as far as possible; but the honourable member knows that we cannot entirely avoid the dangers that he has in mind. ' The High Commissioner of the Western Pacific has been good enough to send to Sydney one of his officers, who has conferred' with us as to the difficulties likely to arise at the other side. have been apprehensions as to the food supplies in certain of the groups being insufficient. There have also been apprehensions that on one of the islands, at all events, if not on others, there may be some danger in returning the Kanakas in any number. We require to provide that they shall be absorbed without friction by their own native villages. If any particular part be disturbed about the time of the return of these men, we shall be able to retain them at t)wo central', ispots-on e ,in the New Hebrides, and the other in the Solomonspending the return of normal conditions permitting them to take their place without disturbance among their own tribes.",70
495,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That may involve expense.,70
496,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It does not appear likely to amount to a considerable item. The information we receive in regard to this matter is added to each mail, but the latest does not point to the expenditure of any large sum in that regard. We shall probably be able soon to return the Kanakas to most of the Solomon Islands, and with the assistance of the missionaries it is anticipated that very little difficulty will arise in the New Hebrides. These contingencies, however, have been foreseen.",70
497,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,H as any provision been made on the islands for the return of the Kanakas?,70
498,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The tribes on some of A certain the islands were, informed some time ago of their contemplated return. Meanwhile we have to deal with another situation. The islanders have been properly described as ""children of a larger growth."" They are gregarious and very imitative. At the present time, owing to an agitation, which I do not think originates with them, but has nevertheless impressed them, there is a good deal of uncertainty, in their desire to depart as quickly as possible; the officers, however, are not in the least alarmed. This sentiment is what might, They say that as scon as the Kanakas have had time to accustom themselves to the idea of departure-whe n some of them commence to give the lead-the impulse which asserts itself among men of their class will be exhibited, and there will be a general movement outwards just as there is at present a tendency to hesitate.",70
499,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Every Kanaka ""that I There met on the occasion of the parliamentary visit to Queensland said that he wished to go back.",70
500,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The officers inform me that the Kanakas are of variable moods. They have no persistency of purpose. This week they are anxious to go; next week they are anxious to remain, and the week after they are not certain whether they wish to remain or depart. Probably some of those whom the honourable member met have already ""left for the islands; others will follow. No' difficulty is anticipated, but patience and consideration must be exercised. Then, again, the impulse from without has induced them to challenge the Commonwealth law providing for their deportation. A case has been taken before a Police Magistrate, and is now on appeal to the High Court. Fortunately, the Justices of the High Court left Melbourne today for Queensland, so that I hope that in the course of two or three weeks the High Court will be able to decide the points of law that have been raised on behalf of the Kanakas who may desire to avoid the deportation. Honourable members ^should clearly understand that there are exemptions. It is not proposed to deport all the Kanakas now in Queensland. Under the law of that State a certain number are entitled, on account of long residence, to remain. The Commission which recently sat in Queensland, and, after making an exhaustive inquiry, made some excellent recommendations, proposed that exemptions should be extended to Kanakas, for instance, who have married white women or aboriginal women of Australia, and do not desire to leave. We already have evidence that that exemption, of which the Kanaka may or may not avail himself, will not be taken advantage of in all cases. We , have had am application from one, if not more, Kanakas married to aboriginal women who desire to be deported with their wives and children.",70
501,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,How will their relations welcome the wives?,71
502,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Probably with open mouths.,71
503,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is a question upon which we are not competent to express an opinion, because their reception will differ according to the tribes, and the islands to which these Kanakas belong.",71
504,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If a Kanaka leaves his wife behind him, will she become a. charge upon the Commonwealth ?",71
505,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"They do not propose to separate. So far, we are not confronted with that difficulty. I think I have placed before honourable members a fair outline of the position. Up to date everything is working smoothlynot finally entered into a contract with the lowest tenderers, Messrs. Burns, 'Philp. and Company, because, although our legal advisers have no doubt as to the constitutionality of our law, there is a contingency which must be allowed for until the point has been decided by the High Court in the case about to be heard. The suggestions made in the most friendly and considerate manner by the High Commissioner having jurisdiction over the Solomon and New Hebrides, whence most of"" the ' Kanakas came, have also to be regarded. He is willing to take any that are willing to'work in plantations in F i j i . His resident Commissioners have been consulted. We desire to work amicablv with them, and to have their assistance in providing every possible precaution against any undue disturbance likely to result from the return of a considerable number of islanders. We think that this can be prevented, but, remembering the people with whom we are dealing, care must be taken. The Commonwealth is providing, in what I hope will be considered a generous as well as a just and wise fashion, for the return to their homes of men who, speaking of the great mass,"" should never have deserted them, but should have been left to the untiring and self sacrificing labours of the missionaries, who endeavour to impart the principles of civilization as fast as they are qualified to receive them. There are exceptional natives, who have adapted themselves to our modes of life - They will re1 main, and, no doubt, continue to be useful citizens of the Commonwealtn. It must be remembered that the return of all these islanders was always contemplated.",71
506,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,There is no danger.,71
507,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There may be danger in isolated cases, where men who have been absent for years, and have acquired other ideas and ways of regarding native customs, are returned to mix with those who have never left their own land.",71
508,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That danger existed prior to Federation.,71
509,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yes. Disturbances still occur in islands where recruiting vessels have seldom or never touched.,71
510,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The death-rate among Kanakas is lower in their own islands than in Queensland.,71
511,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The mortality in Queensland is due largely to change of conditions.  cause.,71
512,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We have regard to the possibilities of friction ; but it must not be thought, because I have dwelt upon them, that we consider them serious. The reports of the High Commissioner and the Resident Commissioners are most encouraging, though they do not relieve us from the obligation of making careful provision against accident, so far as that can be done. We cannot return 4,000 or 5,000 Pacific Islanders to their homes without incurring slight risks. Had they remained in their islands, they would have had to take unnumbered risks, because in some of the islands there is a constant, though intermittent, tribal warfare.",71
513,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What is the deportation to cost?,72
514,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is possible that £5,000 will cover the cost, but, as much expenditure must be met which cannot be foreseen, I ask the Committee not to limit us too severely. We did not expect that the cost would be £25,000. unless every condition was adverse, and, as we now believe that half the sum provided will be sufficient, I move That the item "" Repatriation of Pacific laiulcTS, .£25,000,"" be reduced by £12,500.",72
515,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,When does the Government expect to receive from Queensland the £ 5 per head to be paid for the deportation of the Kanakas?,72
516,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,No doubt that will be paid as the Kanakas are deported.,72
517,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why not get the money beforehand ?,72
518,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I think that Queensland is rich enough to be trusted.,72
519,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Hindmarsh) [9.23]. - I am glad that the Prime Minister has moved the reduction of the item, but his statement would justify us in making the reduction suggested by the honourable member for Coolgardie.",72
520,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Nothin g would be gained by a further reduction.,72
521,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Then I am in favour of striking out the item. According to the honourable and learned member's statement; very little need be spent in maintaining the Kanakas who are waiting for ships, because it is proposed to extend their term of engagement, and, therefore, fewer Kanakas will remain to be deported, because as the honourable member for Coolgardie has shown, they die off very rapidlv in Queensland. Those who have the welfare of the Kanakas at heart should be most anxious to send them from Australia. According to the returns, the death rate among them from consumption is thirtytimes as large as the death rate from that disease among the white population, and it must be remembered that the Kanakas in Queensland are mostly men in the prime of life, who have been selected after medical examination. The number of Kanaka women and children there are very few, whereas the phthisis statistics relating to white persons apply to both sexes of all ages. If the reports of the debates of the Queensland Parliament are referred to, it will be seen that the Labour Party of the State has been anxious that the State authorities should take it upon themselves to deport the Kanakas, who - were introduced against the will of the people of Queensland. In the old blackbird ing days, a member of the Labour Party called for a return which showed that Kanakas had been put underground at the rate of one a day ever since the system commenced, and, if anything, the death rate has increased rather than diminished. It is the sugar-growers who have benefited Is- by the employment of Kanakas, and they should meet any expenditure incurred over and above the amount which the Queensland Government proposed to contribute, though we have no guarantee that that Government will pay anything. ThePrime Minister told us that originally there was a fund of £30,000 for the return of the Kanakas, but he believes that it now amounts to only £15,000. If that is so, we have a right to know-what has become of the other half, and what guarantee there is that any money will be forthcoming.",72
522,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Queensland Government undertakes to pay £ 5 a head in any case.,72
523,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then I am satisfied on that point. But what has been done with the £ 5 collected in regard to each of the thousands of Kanakas who have died?,72
524,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Onl y 1,000.",72
525,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It does not take long for 1,000 Kanakas to die. According to a return which has been handed to me, 917 died in the four and a half years between the 17th December, 1901, and the 30th June, 1906. I have spoken of the immense number of deaths from consumption among the Kanakas.",72
526,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member's estimate is rather high.,72
527,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,In a few weeks the honourable member will have proof that it is under the mark.,73
528,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Do the honourable member's figures cover a long period?,73
529,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yes .,73
530,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The deaths from all diseases are seven times as numerous among Kanakas as among white persons.,73
531,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Excluding the deaths from consumption, which are thirty times as numerous. The Kanakas were imported into Queensland on the condition that they would be returned on the expiry of their agreements, and it is only fair that Queensland should do what the Labour Party of that State thought it to be her duty to do, and take the responsibility of returning them, especially in view of the consideration which has been shown by_ the other States. If the honourable member for Coolgardie moves to reduce the item to £5,000, he will have my support.",73
532,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Corinella) [9.30] - I do not pretend to have such a knowledge of the legal position, or of the Queensland legislation upon this subject, as to enable me to farm an opinion as to the shoulders upon which the legal liability rests. Nor am I prepared to say that there is a moral liability on the Commonwealth to the extent even of expending £12,500 upon the repatriation of the Kanakas. I feel, however, that, whether the legal or moral liability rests upon the State or the Commonwealth, we cannot afford-and I do not think Queensland could afford-to incur the risk of going wrong with respect to the return of the islanders to their homes. At the same time, we should not be justified in meekly submitting to any obviously unjust proposal on the part of Queensland. Reasonable counsels seem to have prevailed on both sides, and the representatives of the Commonwealth and the State appear to have met each other in a reasonable spirit, although some of us may think that Queensland is not unnaturally looking at the matter from her own point of view a little more carefully than from that of the Commonwealth. Whatever difficulties may exist as between the State and the Commonwealth, I heartily approve of the Government attitude in taking over the Polynesian Bureau, and in shouldering the responsibility of insuring, as far as possible, that the repatriation shall take place in a proper and satisfactory way. Any differences that may exist can be settled subsequently.",73
533,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Queenslan d previously conducted the work of repatriation satisfactorily, and she should be able to do it now.",73
534,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member quoted what he admitted to be a very just statement by the Queensland Premier, to the effect that some of the responsibility, at any rate, rested upon the Commonwealth, because the wholesale repatriation was rendered necessary by Commonwealth legislation. We recognised that fact when we passed the Act, and I do not suppose that on that account any honourable member regrets that the measure was passed.",73
535,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Did any one contemplate that the Commonwealth would have to pay the whole of the cost of repatriation ?,73
536,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Commonwealth is not going to pay the whole cost, but only to defray any expense in excess of the £ 5 per head already provided for. So far as one can guess-the Prime Minister did not give us any definitefigures-the expenditure on our part should not exceed £10,000-it may be nearer .£5,000. I am quite sure that the Government will not spend the money needlessly because it has been voted, and I am prepared to give the Administration more rope in a matter of this kind than in ordinary cases, because the honour of the Commonwealth is, to a considerable extent, involved. A much more onerous obligation rests upon us in this case than would have to be discharged by us under ordinary circumstances, because we are dealing with people who are not in the same stage of development as we are, and have to take into account unusual conditions owing to the still lower state of mental development and different environment of the kinsmen on the islands to which we are returning them. We must hold the Administration responsible for insuring that the repatriation is conducted as satisfactorily at the other end as at this end, and we must be prepared, on this account, to give them a little latitude in regard to the finances. I am prepared to accept the assurance that proper economies will be observed, and that all just obligation on the part of Queensland will be insisted on. I am pressed by the consideration, which seems to outweighl all others, that our honour and moral obligation are deeply involved in seeing that the repatriation is properly carried out, and I submit that we must be prepared to trust the Administration more than in an ordinary case.",73
537,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Franklin) [9.38]. - I think this is one of the most important matters that the Commonwealth has had to deal with. The very first question that I addressed to the Prime Minister in this House was in reference to this subject. I urged that as the Commonwealth: Parliament had deliberately adopted the policy of a "" White Australia,"" it was our boundcn duty to make immediate provision for the repatriation of the islanders in a common sense and humane manner. It is to be regretted that we have allowed matters to remain in abeyance until almost the twelfth hour, when Parliament is expiring, and the Kanakas have to be removed. Up to the present very little of a practical character has been done. I do not think that the Commonwealth Government should be called upon to pay is. towards the cost of repatriation.",74
538,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Would the honourable member risk trouble of various kinds in order to assert what he believes to be the financial rights of the Commonwealth?,74
539,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There is a just way of looking at this matter. I yield to no man in the desire to see the Kanakas treated kindlv and properly. But we must remember that the Kanaka trade has been in existence for something like forty years, and that since 1884 the law of Queensland has demanded a deposit of £ 5 per head in order to provide for the repatriation of the islanders. I have ascertained from a gentleman who is well qualified to speak upon the subject that something like 50,000 Kanakas have died in Queensland, and that of this number probablv 20:000 have expired since the Act to which I refer was brought into operation. Therefore, if the law has been complied with-and it was the duty of the Queensland Government to see that it was - the State authorities must have in their hands something like £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 which has been hlanded over to them in respect to islanders who have died.",74
540,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Queensland Government have - received nothing. The whole of the money has been paid into a trust fund, and is still there.",74
541,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The deposit was refunded in the event of a Kanaka dying.,74
542,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not think so. If my impression is correct, the Queensland Government hold £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 of blood money, and yet are asking the other States to defray the cost of 'repatriating Kanakas who were imported into Queensland for the benefit of the sugar planters. I have no sympathy with the planters. The history of the kidnapping of the Kanakas embraces the blackest pages in our records.",74
543,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"And yet these planters .are now receiving heavy bounties, which are being paid out of the pockets of the people.",74
544,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,If the Queensland Government are holding the amount I have mentioned,74
545,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The whole of the hospital charges in connection withi the illness of the Kanakas who died were defrayed out of the trust fund to which I have referred.,74
546,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The hospital charges should have been defrayed by the planters who obtained the labour of the Polynesians at an exceedingly cheap rate. I am informed that the death rate among the Kanakas at one time ran up to 200 per 1,000. We are making a very great fuss about the repatriation of some 4,000 Kanakas. I have always been a very stout defender of the policy of a ""White Australia,"" but it seems to me that we are making a mere pretence when we bring the whole of our machinery into operation for the purpose of deporting 4,000 Kanakas, and leave behind in Queensland 18,000 other coloured aliens.",74
547,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Not quite that number.,74
548,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am credibly informed that, irrespective of Kanakas, that number of coloured aliens are still in Queensland to-dav.",74
549,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The "" Chow "" is twenty times worse than the Kanaka.",74
550,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I quite agree with the honourable member. Some of these coloured aliens to whom I have referred are infinitely less desirable than the Kanakas. I submit that we are dealing with this matter in anything but a proper manner. We should strike out the item altogether. A Bill to amend the Pacific Island Labourers Act is now awaiting our attention, and I think that it would have been better to include in that measure a provision such as that now sought to be made. We should then have been able to impose whatever conditions we considered necessary. It would be a. standing disgrace to the Commonwealth if we dumped the Kanakas down upon their native islands without making the slightest provision their welfare, or assuring ourselves that they would meet with a friendly reception.",74
551,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is what we are taking all the pains about.,75
552,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"As I said last session, it was the duty of the Government to remove the Kanakas as their agreements expired. If that course had been pursued, the work of repatriation would have been carried out far more cheaply, and we me. should not have experienced any of the difficulties that, are now arising. If Queensland Government shoulder their share of the responsibility which still mains to them, I think that the whole of the Kanakas can be deported for £ 5 per head. I should like to know what it cost to bring them to Queensland. stand that the food bill of a Kanaka rewhich presents only about £ 1 per month. There is no reason why an ordinary steaming vespay for their deportation. sel should not be able to convey them from Queensland to their homes within seven days, and it is therefore apparent that , per head would be ample to cover their portation. If the Commonwealth Governwhich it was paid. ment are not able to make better terms with the shipping companies in this matter, it seems to me that they would be acting wisely if they chartered a selves undertook the deportation of the Pacific islanders. Unless . the honourable member for Coolgardie intends to submit their homes. an amendment, I shall move to reduce the amount of this item to £ 5 , 0 0 0 . I should like the Queensland Government clearly to them. understand that this Parliament expects them to compel the sugar-planters of that State to pay £ 5 per head towards the patriation of the Kanakas in accordance with the Act which was passed in 1884. If the provisions of that Statute have been enforced, the Queensland Government must have nearly £100.000 in hand which was contributed for the purpose of repatriathis relatives. ing those who have-since died there.",75

554,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What has been done with it?,75
555,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It has been spent in viding hospital 'accommodation for the Kanakas.,75
556,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the planters have been permitted to shirk their duty under the Act, the Queensland Government ought to shoulder the responsibility. In my judgment, honourable members should pired. be afforded a great deal more information for upon this subject. I am not prepared to vote a single shilling of the taxpayers' money to make up any deficiency which has been caused by the planters being permitted to shirk their unmistakable duty.",75
557,Mr BAMFO RD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Herbert) [9.50] - I feel impelled to make a few observations, in view of the strictures which have! been passed upon the Queensland Government by honourable members who have preceded In the first place, I should like to tell the honourable member for Franklin the that presumably the Queensland Government is responsible for a considerable reportion of the fund which has been paid for the repatriation of the Kanakas. From the Budget statement of the Queensland Treasurer, I learn that the Pacific Islanders I underFund is in credit to the extent of £ 8 , 6 6 1 , sum will no doubt be handed over to the Commonwealth Government to assist to But I wish to point out that a great deal of the money which was provided b f the indentors of the £ 5 Kanakas was, upon the death of a "" boy,"" dedevoted to other purposes than that for",75
558,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It was subscribed for a specific purpose, and should have been used vessel and them for that purpose.",75
559,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,But the Government could not send deceased Kanakas back to,75
560,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,A country like Queensland ought to have had the charity to bury,75
561,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"A great deal of the money subscribed for the repatriation of rethe islanders was, I understand, expended in the maintenance of Kanaka hospitals. Further, I am told that when a Kanaka died, it was customary for a trade chest to the value of £ 5 to be sent to the island from which he came for distribution among",75
562,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Did the Queensland Government collect the unpaid wages of de,75
563,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,". No, I think not. Their wages were so small that anv balance due to them was of no account. They only proreceived about £ 6 per annum. Out of that they had to pay for incidentals such as tobacco, blankets, & c , and consequently they had not very much to draw. The honourable member for Franklin has stated that the Commonwealth should, have deported the Pacific islanders as their agreements exBut when the Pacific Island Labourers Bil l was under consideratioB I asked the then Minister of Trade and Customs, the right honourable member for Adelaide, whether it was possible to insert such a provision in it . H is reply was that it was impossible to do as I suggested, because, whilst we exercised fulPcontrol over matters of immigration and emigration, we had no control over the conduct of Kanakas in the State of Queensland. I would further point out to the honourable member for Coolgardie that the return from which he quoted specifically referred to the number of Kanakas employed' in the sugar industry in Australia.",75
564,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Are there any in New South Wales?,76
565,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member had better ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council.,76
566,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think there are about 1,000.",76
567,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I regara the request of the Prime Minister for £ 1 2 , 5 0 0 as a most reasonable one. We have to recollect that a special contract will require to be entered into for the deportation of these men. Inasmuch as no recruiting is now being done, fresh vessels will have to be chartered. At present there are, I believe, only two boats trading from Queensland to the islands, one of which, the Svdnev Belle, is now taking Kanakas aboard at Townsville. The Premier of Queensland estimates that the cost of repatriating the islanders will range from £ 5 to £ 5 10s. per head. If that be so, the cost to the Commonwealth will be very small indeed. If the Bil l relating Pacific islanders which was recently introduced by the Prime Minister be passed into law, the cost will be still less. At the same time, I view the proposal of the Prime Minister in connection with that Bill with some gravity. Upon, numerous casions I have pointed out the necessity for takintr. immediate action in regard to the repatriation of these Pacific islanders. I have always recognised that, whoever has to undertake the responsibility of deporting them within a brief period after the end of the current vear, will have a big contract oa hand. We have also to recollect that in the early part of the vear the hurricane season., which is experienced along the Queensland coast, mav considerably affect the sailing of ships. I acknowledge that something must be done in the direction in dicated by the Prime Minister, and I do not see that anything better than that which he has proposed can be attempted. I believe that the work could be carried out in three, or, at the most, four, months. When the honourable member for Coolgardie was referring to the number of Kanakas in Queensland, I interjected that possibly not more than 4,000 would remain at the end of the year. The return to which he referred shows that, up to the 30th June last, there were in question 5,587 Kanakas. It is reasonable to assume that 1,000 or more of the Kanakas at present in Queensland and New South Wales will be exempt, and, having regard to the number who have been sent away since 30th June last, I think we may safely assume that not more than 4,000 will remain to be deported next year. That being so, I think that we should be able to get rid of the whole of them within four months of the 1st January next. I should like to point out to the honourable member for Franklin, who is very severe upon the Queensland farmer, the foundation upon which the farming community of Tasmania has been built. The farmers of that State originally cleared and cultivated their lands by means, of prison labour. They were not asked to pay for anything which the farmers of Queensland have now to pay for.",76
568,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"What has that to do with the subject? If they were prisoners, they were white men. I fancy there were convicts in New South Wales.",76
569,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have not heard of any representative of New South Wales adopting the argument used by the honorto able member for Franklin, and therefore I am replying only to his assertion. The prison labour to which I refer was brought out at the cost of the country. The convicts, when sick, were treated at the cost of the country; and yet the honourable oc- member complains of this proposal.",76
570,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They were treated at the cost of England.,76

573,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable member approve of the kidnapping of Kanakas ?,76
574,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No man has spoken more strongly against it than I have. But for the action of the Imperial Government, that practice might still be going on. The Government placed an agent on every ship to see that the Kanakas were properly rebesmirched. cruited, and I should like to know whether the Federal Government propose that ofthing of the kind? ficers shall be placed on board the vessels by winch the islanders are returned to their homes.",76
575,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is proposed not to have an officer on board the steamer, but to have officers at the depot.",77
576,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is satisfactory. In the event of the Bil l to which the orable and learned gentleman has referred being passed, enabling fresh agreements - be entered into after 30th January next, will the farmers or planters who employ these Kanakas after that date be responWestern sible for any portion of the passage money in addition to the £ 5 per head ?",77

Every Kanaka to be deported these kanakes. will have a certificate showing the date on chosen to misapply the fund raised by the which he is to be ready for shipment.",77

I am not very enthusiastic about the item as now proposed to be put, but I think is far more satisfactory than as originally proposed. The Commonwealth has got of a very grave difficultv with less trouble than manv contemplated when the underisland taking was first entered upon. It would lamentable if . as the result of anv action on our part in the final stage of the ceeding, the fair name of Australia were",77
586,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why should we fear any,77
587,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not think that anything is likely to arise that will involve our good name, but we should guard against only such a contingency. The question we have to consider is as to who is to foot the Bill with respect to the deportation of the Kanakas. I certainly share with the honourable member for Coolgardie the view that hon the people of Australia have sacrificed much for the sake of the policy of a White to Australia, and that, so far, Queensland has reaped most of the benefits of that policy. The only result of it, so far as Australia is concerned, is that her people have had to pay something like 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, more for their sugar than they had to do.",77
588,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable member assert that there has been such an increase ?,77
589,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That has been the result of the imposition of the duty of £ f i per ton to assist the movement for the production of sugar by white labour in Queensland. During the debate on the Pacific Island Labourers Bill , the statement was freely made that there was under the conbe trol of the Queensland Government a fund sufficient to provide for the deportation of If that Government has t planters for a particular purpose, the arguthat the Commonwealth Parliament should now bear the cost of deporting the Kanakas is not a sound one.",77
590,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Queensland Government are going to bear part of the,77
591,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Quite so; but when the vote for Pacific Island Labourers Bill was passed it was understood that the cost of deporting the Kanakas would be full y met by the to fund in question. I think, therefore, that up a the Oueensland Government should meet obligation cast upon them by the passing of this measure. When I was travelling through the northern State as a memit ber of the parliamentary party, I was strongly impressed with the view that a rid great number of the Kanakas were anxious to return, at the first opportunitv. to their homes. In common with other honbe orable members. I conversed with scores of Kanakas, and. in the cane-fields, met only proone who was anxious to remain. Many of them made serious complaints against the immigration officers of Queensland. said that when their original contracts expired they were told by the immigration officers that a ship would be sailing to the islands in a few days. They remained idle for some days, and on again calling at the immigration office, were told that the ship would be sailing a week hence. After being kept hanging about in this way for some time they were finally told that no ship would be sailing for some time, and, consequently, they had to re-engage. It is due partly to the tenacity with which the northern planters have clung to Kanaka labour, and partly to the lack of proper attention to this question by the Queensland Government, that we are called upon, - within a very short space of time, to deport so many of the islanders. In .these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that Queensland has reaped the advantage of the retention of the Kanakas in Australia, I think it is fair that the Government of that State should bear the cost of returning them to their homes. I should like the Committee to take such action with regard to this item as would necessitate the Prime Minister entering into further negotiations with the Queensland Government. If they can be induced to accept the full responsibility, well and good: but I should prefer the Commonwealth to make some sacrifice rather than that the name of Australia should be besmirched in the closing stages of this movement.",77
592,Mr DAVID THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The black labour crowd will be delighted with the honourable member's speech. They desire the matter to be delayed.,78
593,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am not in favour of any delay, and have not said that I am. I have not done anything of the kind. I wish to leave the Prime Minister free to negotiate, and would be prepared to endorse' his decision in the event of his not being able to make the Queensland Government recognise its responsibilities in this matter. In the meantime, any necessary expenditure can be met from the Treasurer's Advance Account, or from the £ 5 , 0 0 0 which we are ready to vote, and Parliament will be sitting again long before the date after which noi Kanaka, with certain exceptions, mav remain in Australia.",78
594,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Wide Bay) [10.16.] The sentiments of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie are quite correct. It would be a pity if any action of this Parliament led to injustice or the appearance of it in They regard to the Kanakas who are to be repatriated.,78
595,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Has Queensland done them no injustice?,78
596,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member for Kalgoorlie is in error in thinking that the Queensland Government could have arranged for the deportation of the Kanakas as their agreements expired. The State law made no provision for their return during the past two years.,78
597,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Will the honourable member deny that many Kanakas whose agreements had expired could, not get away because the Government had not provided the necessary ships ?",78
598,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I will not deny that; but, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, the Kanakas change their minds two or three times in a week, at one time being desirous of going home, and at another of remaining, while there are mean whites who do their best to keep them here, and the Government has - no power to send them away. This Parliament, 'however, enacted that the traffic should cease at the end of this year. Had the honourable member for Kalgoorlie been a member of the first Parliament, he would not have said that the Government in power in Queensland when the Pacific Islands Labourers' Act was passed, announced that it had a fund to provide for the renatriafion. of Kanakas. That Government did all that it could to prevent the law from passing. It said 1 that the sugar industry would be destroyed if Polvnesian labour were not employed, and got a resolution passed by Parliament asking the Government to disallow the measure. Afterwards the King was petitioned *o the same effect.",78
599,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I said that it was stated : not that the Queensland Government hadstated it.,78
600,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member was right in saying that the Queensland Government should pay to this Government the £ 5 a head contributed by the planters for the return of the Kanakas. Legally, it cannot be asked to do more. It devolves upon this Parliament, having enacted that the Kanakas shall be deported at the end of a certain term, to see that that deportation takes place under proper supervision, even though that may cost a few pounds We know what an outcry there has been against the imprisonment of Chinese in compounds in the Rand, and we should very much regret anything casting a reflection upon the good name of Australia. There are a large number of persons, both here and elsewhere, who seek to besmirch our reputation, and they would seize upon the paltriest injustice to support their denunciations of our legislation.",78
601,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Some injustice may be done, even if we spend £50,000.",79
602,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes , by reason of accident. If we spent nothing, and an injustice happened, we should be without an excuse; but if we do everything possible we cannot be held responsible for accidents. We may be charged with want of foresight, but not with dereliction of duty. The honourable member for Coolgardie argued the whole question of sugar bounties.",79
603,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I only touched the fringe of it.,79
604,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I shall not do so much as that. The honourable member for Franklin has pointed out again and again that the sugar industry depends upon black labour, and, when the question was discussed last session, tried to show that the production of black labour is increasing in a greater ratio than is the production of. white labour, so that when the Kanakas are removed, disaster must overtake the industry. Yet, to-night, he said that Queensland would gain largelv by - the deportation of the Kanakas. Both positions cannot be right.",79
605,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"He referred Kanakas who have died, for whose return the Queensland Government must have received money from the planters.",79
606,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Queensland Government have not used the money collected for the return of Kanakas. If honourable members knew the fight Jhat some of us made in Queensland against this traffic, they would be more considerate. Many men have sacrificed their positions in life in order to oppose it. I have never sought the vote of any person who favoured the traffic. The Labour Party, from the day of its inception, declared the whole system to be immoral, iniquitous, and a slander upon, and a disgrace to, the people of Queensland and of the Commonwealth. We have proved if to be so, and have shown that the conduct of the sugar industry by white labour is an economical not a physical question. But it is our duty to see that no blunder or want of foresight mars .the success of our efforts. Verv few of ""those who in Queensland supported the white labour policy believed that effect would be given to it in. so short a time. I am exceedingly thankful for what has happened. With regard to the bounty question', I would point out that this Parliament has now imposed Excise duties in regard to the productions of certain protected industries, exempting from their incidence manufacturers employing white labour under proper conditions. All the sugar planters ask is for similar treatment; though the matter is one for argument at' another time. I am glad that the Government have taken this action. I hope that the proposed repatriation will be carried out in January, February, March, and April. I approve of the granting'of certificates to those who are to be allowed to remain, and of permitting those who are to be repatriated to obtain work for the month, six weeks, two months, or three months during which they are waiting for ships. This will make it unnecessary to keep them in compounds. I feel sure that there will be no unnecessary expenditure, and as all parties are desirous thatnothing shall happenwhich might bring the good name of the Commonwealth* into disgrace, I ask the Committee, to agree to the Prime Minister's proposal.",79
607,Mr DUGALD THOMPS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"ON (North Sydney) [10.29] - The honourable member for Coolgardie was right in calling attento the tion to this matter. He has given the Committee some very valuable information. I think, however, that he should be satisfied with the reduction of the proposed vote by one-half. We desire that there shall be no stain upon the Commonwealth in connection with the deportation of the islanders. Already there are some stains on Australia's escutcheon arising out of the traffic in island labour, and'long ago I formed the conclusion, without regard to the sugar industry, that it should not be encouraged. Although I have been charged with looking at everything through commercial spectacles, I came to the conclusion that no commercial advantage that might accrue would afford sufficient justification for the evils attendant upon the traffic.",79
608,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Does the honourable member think that Queensland, which has been deriving such a large amount of benefit from the payment of the sugar bounties, should ask the Commonwealth to contribute towards the cost of repatriating the Kanakas?",79
609,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think that we ought to regard this matter as entirely apart from the payment of the bounty. The social disturbances caused in the islands by the removal of so many young men to Queensland, and the return of the islanders, many of whom were not improved by their residence in the State, whilst in some cases they took back very undesirable evidences of their contact with civilization, have no doubt led to serious consequences, and have tended to accelerate the disappearance of the island races. I take it that the Queensland attitude is this: "" Under our arrangements, it would cost us jQ$ per head to send the islanders back to their home, but under the arrangements made by the Commonwealth for a wholesale deportation extra expense will be incurred which should be defrayed by the Commonwealth Government."" The State has some reason for assuming that attitude, and the only question which arises is as to the payments that have been made of repatriation deposits in respect of Kanakas who have died. Several representatives of Queensland have explained that some of the money was sent back to the relatives of the Kanakas in their native homes, and that certain expenses in connection with the return of their belongings and hospital charges had to be defrayed.",80
610,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What about their wages?,80
611,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The wages due to the Kanakas who died were sent to their friends.,80
612,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I could scarcely believe that the Government would allow the wages to remain in the hands of the planters. I think that we can reasonably accept the offer that has been made by Queensland to pay £ 5 per head towards the cost of repatriation.,80
613,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And to give us the services of their officers free of cost.,80
614,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Queensland Government would have found it necessary to employ some officers in any case. Under all the circumstances, we should not hesitate to authorize the Prime Minister to incur the expenditure necessary to insure humane treatment, so that no further slur shall be cast upon our character. The honourable member for Coolgardie has rendered good service by drawing attention to the matter, but I think that he might very well fal l in with the proposal of the Prime Minister.",80
615,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Parramatta) [10.35] - I "" m v has a responsibility in this matter altogether apart from that of the Queensland Government. It may be that we have treated Queensland liberally, and that the sugar bounties have' been of immense advantage to that State. But that is not quite the question. We are simply shouldering the responsibility for the consequences of our own acts.",80
616,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Would not the islanders have been returned by Queensland in anv case under the operation of their own laws ?,80
617,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes , but if there had been no Federal legislation on the subject, it is reasonable to assume that many of the Kanakas would have remained in Queensland, or would have come back to that State.",80
618,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I allowed for all that.,80
619,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"This is one of the matters in which there is a concurrent responsibility on the part of the Commonwealth and of Queensland. I do not deny that the Queensland Government have some obligation, because if the Pacific Islanders Labourers Act had not been passed they would still have had to insure the protection of the Kanakas. From the correspondence between the Premier of Queensland and the Prime Minister it would appear that both Ministers recognised the responsibility of their respective Governments to an extent which seemed to reach the point of broad justice. I cannot help being struck by the easy way in which this vote has been brought forward. It does not say much for the care with which the Estimates have been prepared when the Prime Minister can so readilv cut down a proposed vote by half. He must have been extremely liberal in the first place. _ Mr DEAKIN - I intended to err on that side, because I thought it would be more fair to the House than to provide for a small sum and ask for an increase later on.",80
620,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not think it is fair to ask for twice the amount required.,80
621,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We fixed the vote liberally recording to the best information that we had at the time.,80
622,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"So far as I can gather, the proposal now made by the Prime Minister is a very fair one. Whatever sum mav be required, if it be double or treble the amount now proposed to be provided, our obligation requires that we should spend judgment, this Parliament the last copper in seeing that these boys are sent safely home, and that the greatest possible care is taken of them even after they get there. We are now being brought face to face with the full responsibility attaching to our previous action. I think that the sooner the Kanaka traffic ceases the better for Australia. As was remarked to me in the course of a private conversation lust now, the Kanakas belong to an apparently decadent race, and their contact with civilized conditions in Queensland has had a very serious effect upon them, and has led to very grave consequences. The sooner we send them back to their homes, and keen them there, the better it will be in the interests of the boys themselves, of their race, and of their islands-apar gether from the relation of the Kanaka traffic to the sugar industry. I am glad that an effort is being made to treat the Kanakas humanely, and to repatriate them under conditions of safety. Amendment agreed to.",80
623,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Parramatta) [10.4 c] - I should like to know what the Government propose to do with the £ 5 , 0 0 0 which is proposed to be devoted to advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. If it is intended to enter upon a scheme worthy of the name and importance of Australia, the amount is paltry. If , on the other hand, it is intended to merely trifle with the question, the amount is too large to throw away. I should like to know whether the Government have any scheme - in their minds for making better known the resources of Australia, and following ih'the wake of Canada and other_young countries which are in need of population.",81
624,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [10.43] - The story ' of the manner in which we have proceeded in connection with this immigration question will be best told by the papers that I propose to lay upon the table, including the correspondence, partly printed, in which we have been engaged with the Premiers of the States. This correspondence commenced in July last year, when we obtained their assent to our communicating with their Agents-General, with the object of encouragincr desirable immigrants, and establishing direct agencies in London. This assent was given, ' in one case under some restriction. When we approached the business question of practically advertising Australia in connection with immigration, it became clear that they held different opinions, which will be found set out in the correspondence. They appeared to apprehend some interference with the efforts which, they were making to obtain settlers from Great Britain, and though they were reassured on that point, the first part of this correspondence, which closed at the beginning of the present year, left us without any definite understanding with the States as a body, or, indeed, with any of them. Then followed the Premiers' Conference in Sydney, at which I took the opportunity of laying before them the practical proposals which had commended themselves to us. Honourable members are aware that the Agents General in London considered the question t altoand prepared a report, which has been printed and laid upon the table. In that report they preferred suggestions for the advertising of. Australia with a view to encourage immigration. I laid that scheme before the Conference of Premiers with some amendments. My proposal, briefly was that the general task of advertising Australia as a whole should devolve upon the Commonwealth, and that the States should be asked to furnish us with the necessary statistics to' enable us to present a correct and adequate view of their resources to the people of Great Britain, and, if necessary, of other parts of the world. In addition to that, I proposed that the Commonwealth 'should establish ai 'Central Immigration Office, in which provision should be made for an agent or agents of each State. The object was that we should be able to point intending settlers to one place in Great Britain where they could meet the representatives of the Commonwealth, and where, under the one roof, and without difficulty, they could make themselves acquainted with the attractions which the different States were offering. That appeared to be the most direct and promising course to pursue. At the present time, the offices of the Agents-General are separated by a considerable distance. The Southl Australian Agent General is located in the heart of the city, the New South Wales office is in Cannonstreet, and the offices of the other States are mainly in Victoria-street, Westminster. Hitherto the many to whom Australia is better known than are its individual parts have had to go to one Agent-General, and after having obtained what information they could as to the prospects offered by his State, have had to travel 2 or 3 miles to visit a second Agent-General, and possibly then may have been obliged to visit a third. That plan has been found disadvantageous. idea of Federal unity, which is essential to Commonwealth action, demanded that we should bring the States together under one roof, without interfering in any way with their business, but simply for the purpose of placing before inquirers the whole of the statistics relating to Australia, and of enabling them to get into touch with every part of the Continent. That seemed to us a fair proposition. I shall presently lay before the Committee a second correspondence, which commenced after the Conference. . We began with a request that we should be furnished with a general statement of the facts and figures which the States wished to have made known, with, a summary showing the area of lands open for occupation by immigrants, with general plans and information as to soils, products, rainfall, access to markets, terms of purchase, & c, and with an outline of all concessions granted to settlers. Particularly did we wish to know the number of immigrants that could be annually absorbed during the next few years. Honourable members will be as disappointed as we are when they weigh the responses which have been received to that communication. Apart from New South Wales, which has gone to the length of informing us that it could absorb ioo families each week, we are without definite information from the States. Even the New South Wales Government were careful to point out that agricultural^ labourers could be absorbed only in the proportion of about four to each farmer of capital, and that immigrants were clearlv to understand that they must take their chance of acquiring any Crown lands that might be thrown open for settlement, equally with other applicants.",81
625,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In that case, they would die before they got them.",82
626,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"During the past year or so, I have been collecting statistics relating to the lands available for settlement in the various States, and the number of applicants for them. I find that within the past few months applications for land in New South Wales have been received from 2,000 or 3,000 persons, a mascale. jority of whom have been disappointed. I desired to be in a position to study this question in connection with the inducements that we can hold out to intending settlers from England. I found that even in the The State which is throwing most energy into this matter the results are quite unsatisfactory from this point of view. The number of immigrants who have been placed in possession of the land is quite trifling. ' Almost all of them have been purchasers-that is to say, men possessed of small capital, whom we have every reason to believe will do well. In Victoria a good deal of activity is being displayed in the re-purchase of large estates for closer settlement- a form of State Socialism to which nobody will take exception. But, even under these circumstances, the area of land available for buyers appears to be limited, and for anything like good land there seems to be an excess of purchasers. In regard to the encouragement of immigration, therefore, it was open to me to adopt the estimates which I took in respect of the repatriation of Kanakas. But in the present instance I adopted the lowest figures, because experience justified me in doing so. Honourable members may well ask, "" What are we going to advertise in London if it is not the lands of Australia ?"" If we cannot give intending settlers something like definite information as to what land can be obtained, as to its quality and its-rainfall, what shall we gain by extensive advertising in the mother country? I do not mean to suggest that the Agents-General have not put forth their best efforts. I do not say that in New South Wales, Western Australia, and Queensland, land has not been thrown open for selection in London. It has been to a limited extent. But the quantity of land available for immigrants who come from Australia under the present unadvertised conditions is as much as the States seem able to afford. I repeat that the only reply which I have received as to numbers is that New South) Wales is able to absorb about 100 families per week. I do not know how that estimate has been arrived at. But T take it that the Government of that State are fully seized of its resources, and that we can rely upon their statement.",82
627,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They are going in for the re-purchase of estates upon a large,82
628,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have already mentioned that. That circumstance, however, appeals to only a limited number of new settlers. In Victoria there is an excess of purchasers for the good land which is available. A similar condition obtains in the other States. Consequently, the quantity of land^available to immigrants from abroad is not large. The general impression which has been conveyed to me by more than twelve months of correspondence with the States is that their attitude in the matter of providing land for immigrants as compared with that of Canada is one of more or less lethargy. In some of the States there is entire lethargy, and in others a modified activity. The most active States are Western Australia. Queensland: and New South Wales. That is a discouraging condition of affairs.",82
629,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The General of New South Wales has a considerable number of applications for land. - Mr DEAKIN - They are chiefly applications from would be purchasers, and the honourable member must recollect that the New South Wales Agent-General has been conspicuous for the energy which he has displayed in this matter ever since his arrival in London. More is being done in all the States than in the past, but nothing like enough. If I thought the States would exhibit no more disposition to make provision for intending settlers than they are doing at the present time, I should take a very much darker view of the future of immigration than I do. If I were to advertise the facts which we have been collecting, what would happen? If I were to show the excess in the number of applicants for land available, we should be out of court as compared with Canada, where the settler can always find land ready for the plough.",83
630,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Is land our only asset?,83
631,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The development of our mineral resources and our land are the two magnets upon which we must rely to attract population to this country. How can we attract it when the only advertisement we shall be authorized to publish shows that with but little outside competition our local demand for farming lands is more than equal to the present supply.  time are far too congested.,83
632,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I agree with the honourable member. Have we not great areas that ought to be opened up? If we have not, then we are incapable of providing for a great population. If we can advertise only what the States are advertising at present, this small sum will be quite sufficient to bring to Australia all the immigrants for whom we can provide homesteads.",83
633,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable and learned gentleman is new getting dangerously near a great economic truth. - Mr DEAKIN - The nearer we are f o the truth the better.,83
634,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What is truth?,83
635,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,""" What is truth , "" asked jesting Pilate. In this case the answer is' that the States will require tothrow far greater energy than they are doing at present into the opening up of farming lands if we are to have something Agent- substantial to offer. They must afford more opportunities for settlement if they are to reap the fruits of a proper advertising of Australia in Great Britain, such as we are prepared to undertake for them:",83
636,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does not the honourable and learned gentleman think that they can do this work Tor themselves?,83
637,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Not as well.,83
638,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What advantage should we derive from this expenditure if we cannot absorb more population?,83
639,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The complaint made by the Agents-General, and repeated by many, is that, although the States are doing a great deal, the English mind refuses to divide Australia into parts and to distinguish the one from the other. The competition between States does not assist Australia.",83
640,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It should do'good.,83
641,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"E a c h immigration agent - seeks to point out the advantages of his own State. When interrogated as to the t prospect in some other part of Australia with which he has no relation, he is not disposed to represent it as favourably as that of his own section. The competition between rival agents may have stimulating uses, but it has greater disadvantages. The people who seek information do not obtain that which they desire. What they wish for first of all is information about Australia as a whole. That we propose to supply. If the States - consent to work with us, we intend to have a central office, which will undertake the work of making known throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom all the opportunities for settlement - offering in Australia. We will make public everything that is most attractive in Australia, tending immigrants will then be brought to the one central office. Having done that, our part as canvassers ceases. Under the same roof representatives of each of States will be found. They will be ready to give particulars as to the available lands that have been placed at their disposal, and to afford other information that .induce the emigrants to select the particular State to which they desire to go ",83

Another difficulty, however, has to be removed. The Prime Minister suggested that some of the States wish to conduct this, business for themselves. The whole trouble arises from the fact that the States are competing against each other in Great Britain. The only way to get over that difficulty is for the Commonwealth, on its own responsibility, to publish information in regard to the conditions prevailing .in each of the States. In some of the hand-books published by Western Australia, the advantages offered by that State are contrasted with those offered by the other States. A page from one of these hand-books was sent to me the other day.

What is being done by her authorities is being done more or less by the authorities of the other States.

There should be an authority in London which would inform the people of the old country as to the actual conditions in each of the States, without reference to any consideration but the interests of truth. Then, too. each Agent-General, in the patriotic desire to do his best for the State which he represents, is neutralizing, to some extent, the efforts of the others, ""and confusing those who are in search of information about Australia.

If there were one voice in London speaking on behalf of Australia, as there is one Canadian authority, we should begin to get a steady stream of immigrants, tending to the ultimate enrichment of the country. We shall have to get in between these conflicting representations of the States authorities which are confusing the people at Home as to the real condition of affairs in Australia. Therefore, instead of proposing to spend £ 5 , 0 0 0 , the Prime Minister would have done well to ask for £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 . With such an amount at his disposal he would have been able to formulate a definite scheme enabling us to speak with one authoritative voice in London.  would suggest that the Prime Minister could make better use of the £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 which it is suggested should be devoted to advertising Australia by expending f t in efforts to impress upon the land-owners, who are represented by honourable members of the Opposition, that the best way in which they could advance the true interests of Australia would be by utilizing their lands to the fullest possible extent, or throwing them open for settlement by other persons. If we could excite the patriotism of the landowners, we should accomplish more good than if we encouraged a number of people to come here and crowd into our already congested centres of population.

It seems to me that the only solution of the present difficulty lies in the settlement of some of our best lands, which are now held by monopolists. It would be criminal on our part to induce immigrants to come here and compete with our city workers. The congestion of population in our principal cities is the curse of this country. If we are to make any real progress, we must encourage rural settlement, as is being done in New Zealand. I believe that Australia is the grandest country in the world, but we must stagnate so long as land monopoly prevails to the extent that it does to-dav. The whole of the country lying between here and Warrnambool, which comprises some of the most valuable land in Australia, is occupied by a comparatively few settlers.",87

That is the true solution of the great problem that lies before us. Sheep must give place to human beings. In all the States land monopoly is proving a perfect curse, and our object should be to burst up the big estates and turn them to profitable use. If we adopted this course, we should have no need to enter upon an immigration policy. People would come here of their own accord because of the steps we were taking to develop our natural resources.",87

At an earlier stage of the evening I pointed out that in ten years South Australia lost 30,000 of her population-me n who were the very backbone and sinew of the country. Many of them were the sons of farmers, who went to New Zealand and to Western Australia because they could not find land upon which to settle. This was not because there was no soil in South Australia, because, without mentioning the Northern Territory, South Australia has such a large area, that we could put New Zealand, with all. her cultivable country and maglnificent mountain scenery, in one corner.",88
695,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And one acre in New Zealand would be worth half-a-mile of South Australian country.,88
696,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No , it would not. The soil of New Zealand will not compare with that of South Australia. I give as my authority Professor Lowrie, who, before he resigned the position of chief of the Agricultural College of South Australia to go to New Zealand, said that if he were soing to engage in farming he would return to the State. He returned on a visit, and is confirmed in his opinion that, so far as farming is concerned, the land in some districts-is superior to that of New Zealand.",88
697,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why does it not grow as much acre for acre?,88
698,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I shall tell the honourable member.,88
699,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The nonorable member will be in order in making a general reference, but not in going into details as to production in South Australia.",88
700,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I want to show the Prime Minister, if he will take the same view of the expenditure of the money as I do, that in one corner of Australiathe Yongala Estate-wher e at one time only a few sheep could be grown, there are over too families all doing well, and at the same time many more sheep to the acre. That is precisely what could be done in thousands of parts of the Commonwealth if we only had a mind to do it. If we vote £5,000 for the purpose of advertising Australia lief ore we open up our lands or find other employment, we shall only proclaim our own weakness. If the Prime Minister is as much in earnest as I am, he will do something which would enable the finest land in the world to be freed. This can be done by a simple process, and I ask the honourable member for Parramatta to revert to his old opinions, and then we shall have as constant a stream of immigration to Australia as there has been to New Zealand during the last few years. I do not intend to support the omission of the item, but I propose at the earliest possible opportunity to take some steps to carry my idea into effect.",88
701,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"South Sydney) [11.38] - This is another proposal of the Government which I think has not been well thought out. My idea of advertising Australia is that we should begin by the appointment of a High Commissioner, and secure good offices in London, where the Agents-General would be located, and all available information would be supplied to inquiring persons. But. apart from that, it seems to me that the idea that every immigrant should have a block of land is most absurd. I travelled across the Atlantic in the same ship with Canadian immigrants, who were travelling third-class, in charge of a Salvation Army officer. I undertake to say that not one of the 450 immigrants was going to get a block of land on his arrival. A few of them had the whole or a part of the passage money advanced by the despatching organization, and certainly they were not eoing to take up a block of land. The officer in charge of the men told me that, with rare exceptions, the Salvation Army got the passage money returned.",88
702,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What were the men going to do when they got to Canada?,88
703,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"They would get work as farm labourers. While so many are taking up farms somebodv must want labour. That is what we chiefly want in Australia. If the Government had considered this question, their proposal would have taken a more practical shape. I am assured by competent men that if circumstances continue as favourable as they are, we shall have the most bountiful harvest that Australia has ever had, and that there will not be available sufficient labour to deal with the crops. In various parts of. the Commonwealth a considerable number of farm hands could be absorbed. At the present moment, it would be very foolish to introduce mechanics or artisans to any considerable number. There will not be sufficient work available until we have advanced somewhat further in the work of breaking up huge land monopolies and opening up land for settlement. I agree with the honourable member for Grey that the crux of this position is land taxation of some sort. I have always been in favour of the Commonwealth imposing a land tax, but I do not go with the honourable member to the extent of making a £ 5 , 0 0 0 exemption, because I think that the occupier of 5,000 acres is a monopolist of some sort, and should be taxed as well as others.. There is another point which I think the Government have missed. Only an hour ago, we provided for repatriating 5,000 Kanakas. There is not enough labour in Australia to take their places in the coming season.",88
704,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Thre e times the number of men required are now available.,89
705,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is all very well for the honourable member to talk in that way. There have not been 5,000 or 6,000 who were available for work on the sugar plantation idle for years past, and certainly men will not be idle in the coming vears when the crops are increasing. suggest to the Prime Minister that he should strive to get a class of immigrants who would be able to take up this work in the warm latitudes. I believe that in the district of Calabria, in the south of Italy, we could get a body of men who would be best suited to fake up work in either Queensland or the Northern Territory. I look forward to the time when the Commonwealth will take over the Northern Territory, and if possible a large slice of the northern part of Queensland, and set to work to develop the country by a stream of immigration from the southern part of Europe. We could do very well now with 5,000 immigrants Ifrom the south of Italy and France, In travelling through the district' of Calabria, one can see the intense cuifr.re which is carried on and the abilitv of the men to labour in the fields would make them a most desirable class of immigrants. I notice that recently a Commission has come from Italy to Western Australia with a view to puttine these very people on the land here. If the Government could s;et info touch with, the Commission and find out whether anvthing could be done in that regard, they would do well. [189] They would do better, however, if they would send an agent to the south of Italy and France. I am assured by an Italian gentleman of some experience- a bankerthat many hundreds of these men would be willing to come to Australia if they received only a little assistance. They seem to be about as poor as any people in Europe. But they are well able to labour; they understand farming, orchard work, and viticulture, and some of them have some experience in sugar-cane growing. I believe that they grow the cane for fodder purposes rather than to make sugar from it. These men would make the best class of immigrants we could ' have. A practical proposition would be to open up negotiations with the authorities in the southern parts of Italy and Fiance, and by sending agents to act for us. We absolutely know that within the next few years we require 5.000 men to take the places of the Kanakas who are to be removed from Queensland. The demand for labour is increasing in that portion of"" the continent, and it is likelv to increase further in the future. The area of Crown land available for plant ing in the Northern Territory and the north of Queensland is very large indeed. As I would to the question of making land available in other parts of Australia, I am quite with the honourable member for Grey in thinking that the crux of the whole question is to have a just system of land taxation, which will make it unprofitable for monopolists to hold vast tracts of country, and will force them to put their lands to higher forms of cultivation. It is ridiculous nonsense to think that there is not sufficient scope in our wide Australia for very many millions more people than we have at present. Any proposal in the direction, of a Federal land tax would have my support. I have been in favour of it from the first, and shall be to the last. But, in the meantime, the Government might seriously consider the practical question, of getting into communication with the authorities in the parts of Europe that I have mentioned, with a view to the immigration of 5,000 of their inhabitants to take the place of the Kanakas whom we are sending back to their native islands.",89

That remark covers many features of Commonwealth affairs in Great Britain at the present moment. The States are, so tirely covered with snow. to speak, warring against each other, not only in respect of immigration, but also other matters, in Australia as well as in London.

The consequence is that there is an, impression in the minds of British he has not been successful. people today, as we Hear from reliable these land ballots sources, that the British immigrant coming ticipating in a Tattersall's to Australia, is in danger of being gaoled, that is what it amounts to. instead of welcomed as a settler. the broader question, how we can make Australia more attractive to immigrants, have this peculiar feature presented to - that people will subject themselves greater stress to earn a living in other countries than they seem inclined to here. Let me give an illustration regardsettle. ing our farming population. Where in Australia will you see a farmer who would think of settling on land above what we of know as the snow line? Yet in Canada an enormous amount of the wheat production takes place in country which for six weeks or two months of the year is enI n - the district which I have the honour to represent in there is, roughly speaking, between twenty and thirty miles of land that is as fine as any to be found in Australia.

But apart from ""that, although it a question that the Federal able to pick deal with up to the present time, if the Government take an active hand inducing immigrants to come to Australia must face the question of settling to them upon the land. We have, as the it honourable member for Grey has pointed out, a large number of people in Australia who been reared to farming pursuits, but who find it to be absolutely impossible to get land to pursue farming operations upon. we I know personally several residents in us my owni electorate, men who have been trained to farming, who have been attendballots in New South Wales with the object of getting land.

The States Governments are coming to realise man in his noble ambitions. that, although they are doing a little, they are not doing enough to afford our own ple the opportunity of settling on the land. Within the suburban radius there are holdtaxation ings running into many thousands of acres, and these, of course, are tapped by the suburban railways. There is no reason why these holdings should be confiscated, but the policy of the Government should be framed in view of the fact that people are absolutely wanting in the means of earning a livelihood. Then, arising more, I think, from climatic conditions than any other cause, there are seasons the year, in all the principal towns, when Ave find a considerable number of men who, though willing to work, are not able to get tralia for others. employment. Before we ask immigrants to come here, we should be most careful to see that there is a sufficiency of employlivelihood, ment to enable them to earn a livelihood. wish to emphasize the opinion that, until the Prime Minister is assured that there an opening for immigrants-that there is a possibility for them to get land on which to make homes, or that there is employto ment for them, so that they may not swell the ranks of the unemployed, and become, a charge on the State-h e should be verywho chary about asking a single individual come to Australia.",90

Speaking on the Addressin-Reply, he saidTn this immense continent there is room,. far more than room, for all the farmers' we have, and for all that we can attract here. That is a deliberate statement made by Prime Minister. ",91
711,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Listenin g to the reto marks of various honourable members, one would think the statement was not true. The Prime Minister went on to sayWe are in a position to embark on what believe will prove to be a successful competipopulation tion for immigrants of the same blood as fathers-of the race which has made Australia, Canada, and New Zealand what they are. These are very good sentiments, and, the Prime Minister having given expression to them, it is the duty of Parliament to en-, deavour to support the honourable gentle[ 1 8 9 ] - .2 After all is said and done, the question has nothing peoto do with the various land laws of the States. I am not here to argue as to land and matters of that sort; but I have one fact in my mind, namely, that we must have an increase of population. It is absolutely necessary to have new blood if we are to keep up the stamina' of the race. Further, it is absolutely necessary, if we are to hold this continent in our possession-if we are to protect our shores from foreign aggression-that we should have more people. The only way to attain of that object is to encourage immigration. It is ridiculous, in view of our resources, to talk about there being no room in AusLet people come, and they will soon find work for themselves, and, while they are looking for a means of they will be giving employment I to others. We hear it suggested that every man should be supplied with so many acres is of land to squat on as soon as he arrives ; but that is not altogether what is wanted. Those already on the land require others work for them j and we know that every man in the country gives employment to dozens of others. The honourable member last addressed the House made a reto mark with which I disagree. I think it '* shows rather a petty class-feeling to say that people come here, and, after they have some made fortunes, go Home and decry Aus",91
712,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is true, though; they, are always travelling about and decrying",91
713,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"On l y a mere handful of people have made fortunes in Ausand tralia and returned to the old country. sons Those who decry Australia are those who come here and do well, but who write to the their relatives at Home, and would complain, no matter where they were. Honourable members speak as though work ought be found for the unemployed all the year round. I disagree with that view, because, in an agricultural country, there must be periods when a certain number of men are I out of work-w e cannot employ all the all the vear round. It is ridiour culous to say that because there are a certain number of unemployed, there is no room for others in the country. When we look at the amount which Canada spends in encouraging immigration, the item under consideration becomes absolutely ridiculous. In 1904, Canada spent £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 direction.",91
714,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And the Canadian railway companies spent more.,92
715,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am now dealing purely with the efforts made by the minion Government. has said that he thinks it would be well, the various agencies in London were unified, and placed under one roof.",92
716,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Onl y so far as having representatives under one roof is concerned.,92
717,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I quite agree with that idea; but I think we ought to go very much further. When I last visited America and England, I was struck with the different - methods of trade in the two countries. The American does not stand at has door and simply show his wares, but he puts them under your very nose. In the railway trains books are handed to you open, so that you may become interested and buy them. In London, on the other hand, the idea seemed to be, "" Here are the goods; if you want them, take them, but if you do not want them, leave them."" I suggest that the Prime Minister could not spend a large sum of monev to better advantage than in estab- lishing agencies in London, and in em- ploying agents to travel in the villages and towns, and tell the people there the advantages and resources of Australia. Unless something of that sort is done, and a large scheme of advertising is entered upon, I quite agree withi the deputy leader of the Opposition, that it would be better to spend a smaller sum than that which appears on the Estimates. I feel so strongly on the point that, although at.this late hour I cannot express myself as I should like, I sh'all move that the item be increased by",92
718,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member cannot move 'that the item creased.,92
719,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If it were open to do so, I should move that the item increased by £45,000. I should like see the sum of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 spent in ing the resources of this great country in encouraging emigrants from Europe come here and develop the country in the wav in which it ought to be developed.",92
720,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Tasmania) [12.5]. - I regard the voting of £ 5 . 0 0 0 for advertising Australia as simply throwing money awav. It is, however, on a par with we have been doing throughout the session, . Mr MCWILLIAMS and that is making pretence. The. different 0 in this States are now represented by Agent* General, who are advertising tliem to the extent approved by their Governments and Parliaments. We have heard a great deal as to what is being done by Canada in Dothis connection. It has been pointed out The Prime Minister that the Government of the Dominion spent if £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 last year, but, in addition to that, the Canadian railway companies, and others competing for immigrants, must have the spent another £50,000. The probability is that nearly £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 was spent last year, chieflv in Great Britain, for the purpose of securing immigrants for Canada: We talk of diverting to Australia the stream of immigrants from the old country now going to Canada by an expenditure of £5,000. What we shall do will be to spend that money in covering the ground which is now covered by the Agents General of the different States. What can we hope to do for immigration by establishing an office in London? To establish an agency in London is not the way to secure the right class of immigrants. Canada found that out, and the Australian States found it out years ago, when they had State-aided immigration. If we want the right class of immigrants we must not go to London for them, but to the rural districts of the United Kingdom. Under this proposal we shall merely have the Commonwealth entering into the competition between the States. Believing as I do that to spend £ 5 , 0 0 0 will not have the slightest effect in securing immigrants for Australia, I should prefer to have the vote struck out altogether. If we are really in earnest in the matter of immigration,' let the States and the Commonwealth Government formulate a scheme which can be carried out properly, but to attempt to start an immigration scheme with an expenditure of £ 5 , 0 0 0 is to make a laughing-stock of the be inwhole thing. Some reference has been made to the introduction of Italian immito me grants, and I should like to say that not be one shilling will be.passed with mv consent to to bring Italians or Southern Europeans to advertisAustralia. According to the very hett and writers, the Italian immigrant is considered to as almost as great a menace to the social well-being of the United States as the negro himself.",92
721,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The southern States of America are now getting more of Italian, what immigrants than of any other class. - The Canadians are 'now discouraging immigration from Southern Europe, as the honourable member for Corio would know if he kept himself acquainted with what is appearing in the Canadian and English press. The Canadian Government has found, as Australian Governments have found, that the Britisher is the best settler in any climate. Of the hundreds of thousands of Italians in the United States today, I do not believe that 10 per cent, are working on the land. They are engaged on railway work and in the Pittsburg iron works, where they have chieflv been introduced by the ironmasters as strike breakers; but they are not settled on the land, either as land-owners or as farm servants. 'Mr TUDOR - The Americans do not like them.",92
722,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I know of no American writer on social subjects who regards the Italian as a successful or desirable immigrant.,93
723,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,If you work with them you will find that out.,93
724,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No proposal to spend money in encouraging the immigration to Australia of Italians will have my support. f t is a great pity that important questions which might be usefully debated at considerable length are submitted to us at midnight, and at the fag end of a session, when honourable members are not prepared fo give them the consideration they merit. Believing, as I do, that £ 5 , 0 0 0 is so small a sum for the work proposed as to be quite useless, I shall vote against the item.",93
725,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Wentworth) [12.13] - Perhaps now that it is nearly 12.15 a.m., the Minister will see his way to adjourn.",93

728,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the boss has really spoken, I do not know that the Minister will dare to adjourn' now.",93
729,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We must make so, some progress.",93
730,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I take the view vote is either too small to carry out the purpose for which it is proposed or too large to be wasted. If one thing more than anthe other has contributed to the disparagement of Australia in the United Kingdom it has been the practice adopted by other counsuggesting tries who have been catering for immigrants. I believe it was the practice, although understand it was discontinued during the of. last year, for the Canadian Government to give the shipping companies so much per head for every immigrant landed in Canada. The result of that was that every agent of the shipping companies throughout the United Kingdom made it his duty ' to disparage every other country but Canada. Australia therefore starts with a handicap which it will take many thousands of pounds to overcome. I suggest to the Prime Minister that he should not view Australian resources from the narrow stand-point of the quantity of land that is available for settlement. Of the immigrants to Canada each year, only a very small proportion acquired land before their arrival. In the same way, many who have immigrated to Australia have done so, confident in their own abilities and enterprise. They have prospered, and they do not regret the step which they took. I repeat that the Prime Minister should not content himself with advertising the lands which are available for settlement in the various States of the Commonwealth. Our wonderful mineral and other resources are in themselves sufficient to attract an enormous population. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. (Parramatta) [12.18] - I should like to know the purpose to which it is intended to apply the £ 5 0 0 which has been set apart in these Estimates in connection with the New Hebrides. It is a new item, and one in respect of which we have had no explanation whatever. I should also like to know why honourable members are being kept here till such a late hour? During the day we have been engaged in discussing the administration of New Guinea, the repatriation of Kanakas, and the question of advertising the resources of Australia in the mother country. The debate upon each one of those subjects might very well have absorbed a whole day. Apparently we are to be called upon to dispose of a certain amount of work irrespective of the importance of the issues involved. If I am not inclined to assent to any such proposal. It is not our fault that we dethat this bated penny postage today",93
731,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Order . I would ask honourable member to confine his remarks to the item which is under consideration.,93
732,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am merely to the Prime Minister the propriety of granting an adjournment, at any I rate, after this division has been disposed",93
733,Mr DEAKI N,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [12.23] - Honourable members are doubtless aware that the always unsettled condition of affairs in the New Hebrides has become even more unsatisfactory during the past twelve months. A Convention has been held in London, at which an agreement-subjec t to approval upon this side of the world-wa s entered into between the French and British Governments. In the meantime the concessions which have always been granted from New Caledonia to French settlers in the New Hebrides have been increased until they now amount to a very material assistance to them. British settlers, upon the other hand, enjoy no such concessions from Australia or anv other country. The proposal which I have made for their exemption from the operation of the reciprocal Tariff agreement with New Zealand has not yet been accepted. In addition, they have had to struggle against the low price of maize in this country, which has forbidden its importation, against the general, uncertainty of their future, and against a variety of trials, which have reduced them almost to despair. In these circumstances we have placed on the Estimates this small item which we propose to expend, with the advice and under the supervision of the Resident Commissioner, Captain Rason, who is intimately acquainted with the circumstances of the settlers. This amount will enable them to tide over the difficulty of the present season. Owing to the ""difficulties of communication, and the fact that Captain Rason has been absent in Fiji, no reply has been received to a letter which I addressed to him some time ago, nor to a cablegram sent in ample time to enable us under ordinary circumstances to obtain an answer before now. In those communications I inquired the best means of helping the settlers, whether we should provide them with additional labour for a particular season, or offer assistance in some other direction. We have been: pressing the Home Government to arrive at a conclusion as to the convention and to take steps to remove the present paralyzing condition of uncertainty. An answer to our request may come at any time. That is why this sum is not larger than it is. We may at arty time receive intelligence that an ment has been arrived at on the terms originally proposed between the two nations, taking into account also those made here. If the suggestions made by the late' Mr Seddon and myself be granted, the future of the British settlers, as well as of the French, in the New Hebrides-bu t particularly that of the British settlers, who have been subjected to many disabilities- will at last be placed on something like a permanent basis. It is also possible that under the proposed convention, Australia will be able to extend to the settlers in the New Hebrides some discrimination that will guarantee them the encouragement they deserve:",94
734,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Lang) [12.28] - This sum is altogether inadequate to grant relief to the British settlers in the New Hebrides. Distributed amongst them, it would average only something like £ 3 10s. per head. That is the magnificent payment that is to be made to tide them over difficulties that must be prolonged at least for many months, and probably for many years. The money might just as well be, pitched into the Pacific Ocean. The Commonwealth authorized steps to be taken by a steam-ship company to acquire land in the New Hebrides-practicall y on behalf of the Government-wit h the object of inducing men from Australia to cultivate it. and with the idea of establishing an effective British occupation of the group. The company acquired certain tracts of land, and invited a number of settlers to view it with the object of forming settlements. As we all know, the principal industry is that of raising cocoanuts for the purpose of making copra, in which the islands do a considerable export trade. It takes from seven to ten years for the cocoanut tree to reach maturity, and the settlers found it necessary, pending their plantations reaching a profitable stage, to grow maize and coffee in the expectation of the Australian market being opened to them. But no sooner had they proceeded to plant their crops than the Commonwealth imposed heavy duties upon the products they were raising, and absolutely shut them out from the only market available to them. As the result of this, their trading facilities were practically cut off. and they had to subsist as best they could. Most of them have undergone great hardship, and many of them have been reduced to absolute destitution. The French are constantly agree- jeering at them, and contrasting their treatment at the hands of the Australian Government, with that which the French) Government extend to their settlers. . Every inducement is offered to French settlers to cultivate the land, and to extend their interest in every direction. Immense subsidies have been paid to steam-ship companies to send their vessels to the group, and the French warship from New Caledonia, which usually visits only those ports where the French settlers are to be found last year, with the Governor of New Caledonia on board, visited the whole group. 'The trip was doubtless undertaken to enable the authorities to secure information likely to assist them in their colonizing experiments. The French authorities in New Caledonia offer every inducement to the Australian' settlers to throw off their .allegiance to Great Britain, and become naturalized French Those who become naturalized are given the same privileges as the French subjects - enjoy. Although duties are nominally charged upon the produce sent to. France from the New Hebrides, half is remitted directly to the growers, and the balance is returned to the authorities at Vila, to be spent on improving the .roads, wharfage accommodation and stores, and on other pubjic works facilitating the development of the country and the export of produce. But ias this is a subject of great importance, it should be discussed in the presence of a - quorum. [Quorum formed.] The British - settlers in the New Hebrides have from (ime to time complained of the Commonwealth Government, and addressed petitions for relief to the Prime Minister and other Australian citizens, while the missionaries have also raised their voices on their behalf, and letters have appeared in the public newspapers setting forth the drawbacks under which they labour. The only notice which has been taken of these representations is this proposal to place £ 5 0 0 in the hands of Captain Rason for charitable distribution. This is merelv a mockery of the misery and destitution of the settlers, which is due, not to any fault of theirs, but to the action of the Commonwealth Parliament in debarring their produce from - entering Australia. We could relieve their distresses .more effectually than by giving this miserable dolei f we removed the duties - on island produce grown by British plantersI have on more than one occasion urged that step, and have on the business-paper a notice of motion affirming the desirability of such action, which, I am 1 afraid, will not ow be reached this session. Unfortunately the Government appear disinclined to make this small concession, which would mean - so much to these unfortunate people. They can b""e"" sofidly benefited only by allowing their goods reenter Australia on special terms. Of course, the Tariff cannot be altered without the consent of Parliament, but our time would be more profitably occupied in considering a measure of that sort than it has been in dealing with some of the other questions which have been brought before us.",94

740,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am very much obliged to the honourable member; but, after having sat for many .hours in an atmosphere which is admittedly poisonous. I do not feel capable of adequately dealing with the subject. It is nothing short of cruelty to n keep us here for so many hours. The Government, instead of proposing a paltry vote of £ 5 0 0 , which is ridiculously small when we consider the number of persons whose necessities it is intended to relieve, should have taken steps to provide a market for the products of British residents in the New Hebrides. Many Australians were induced to settle in the Islands on the understanding that their products'would be admitted freely into our markets, and it is little short of criminal on our part to subject their commodities to heavy duties. Apart from the interests of the settlers themselves, there are important national considerations which should engage our attention. view of probable commercial developments along the whole Pacific trade route, it is desirable that we should induce British settlers to make their homes in the New Hebrides. In a very short time-perhap s within halfa-dozen years-the Panama Canal will have become a reality. We have to consider how the opening of the canal would affect the trade routes of Australia. That is where the importance of the New Hebrides Group comes in.",95

742,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Betwee n Panama and Australia there is a number of more or less fertile islands in the occupation of naval powers who are amongst the greatest rivals of Great Britain _for the trade of Australia. Then, contiguous to that direct line of route, lie the New Hebrides. Their importance to Australia consists not so much in their fertility and natural wealth as in their possession of harbors which, from a strategic point of view, are incomparable, because they are capable of accommodating the fleets of any two of the most powerful naval powers in the world. Unlike most of the other island harbors in the Pacific, these harbors are approachable in all kinds of weather. They are free from those characteristic obstacles which render so many of the island harbors unsafe when hurricanes are blowing. Notwithstanding hurricanes and all other adverse weather conditions, vessels even of the heaviest type can approach these harbors with absolute safety. Take, for instance, the harbour of Havannah, -}n the island of Vate, and the port of Mallicolo. in the island of Sandwich.",96

I was speaking on the assumption that the item of £ 5 0 0 was sir, that to be distributed in relief to settlers in the \Quorum group, but as you, sir, have pointed out, it is quite possible that it might be used for other purposes. The Prime Minister may have received private despatches from the Home authorities authorizing him to incur certain expenditure in view of future developments from a naval stand-point. The Commonwealth Government arranged for Australian settlers to be taken over to the islands, with a view to secure effective occupation, in case anv dispute arose concerning territorial rights between 'British and foreign settlers. It was well known that France was anxious to obtain the islands for herself. The original policy of the Commonwealth Government was a wise one. But, unfortunately,'it was not persevered with. Some of the settlers have been practically ruined, and others have been struggling, vainly against adverse conditions in the delusive hope that at some time the Government would take a more sensible view of things. Now the Government comes down with a proposal to spend £ 5 0 0 . We are entitled to know exactly how the sum, however small, is to be spent. All the information that has been given to us is that a certain, official has been over in Australia, and we must assume that he is to take the money back with him and enter into an arrangement with Captain Rason for its distribution. I do not propose to pursue the argument at the present stage, because I should like to hear what other honourable members have to say about it.",96

750,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"What is to be done with this £""500 which appears on the EstiPremier mates? On these islands there are, I unthese derstand, about 250 white inhabitants, that this sum, distributed, does not amount rum. to much per head. Is it intended to spend the money in planting cocoanut trees, planting maize, fortifying the harbors, in what direction? I fail to understand the Ministry could desire to "" b u l l o proposal of this kind through at this earlythat hour of the morning. My own opinion, in view of the preferential trade proposals have recently had before us, is that a better form of assistance would be to give the products of the British settlers of the Hebrides free entry into the markets Australia. If the' Ministry will take to pass such an alteration of the Tariff as will permit of the free importaworld, tion of produce grown by British settlers in the New Hebrides, i ' shall make no further objection to the vote. I direct tention to the fact that British settlers these islands are at a disadvantage when compared with their French rivals, because the Great Republic patriotically assists subjects, and, while their produce mitted free to the market of Noumea, a like concession is denied to the British A peculiar result of this is that the unfortunate Britisher is compelled to make his French rivals the medium for the introdiscuss duction of his produce to Noumea, where is sold as the produce of French settlers.

It is true that they possess why the finest harbour in the Southern Pacific, c k "" a with the exception of Port Jackson. But harbour is not perfect, and it is quite possible that the £ 5 0 0 which we.are asked we to expend in connection with the New Hebrides is designed to improve it.

"" Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [1.52] - I listened with interest to the speech made by the Prime Minister on the subject of the advertising of the resources of Australia. There are many ways in which the resources of the Commonwealth might be placed prominently before the people of the old world. We might advertise the opportunities for the farmer, the miner, and the trader. But we must show that the country is one in which it is pleasant and profitable to live, and that it is well governed. This ""bullocking "" through of important legislation in the early hours of the morning will not tend to create the latter impression. A very successful exhibition of Australian products was recently held in the Sydney Stock Exchange buildings, and Mr Coghlan, who has done more than any other official representative in England for the advancement of Australian interests, some time ago arranged for a similar exhibition in London. Within reason, these exhibitions cannot be too frequent. The big wholesale firms, and even the retail; shops, recognise that customers will not visit their establishments unless it is proved to them that it will be advantageous to do so, and, therefore, they send out commercial travellers, who exhibit samples of the wares which are for sale. Similarly, by exhibitions of our products, we should show the people of England what Australia is capable of. The Prime Minister seems to think that immigrants must be mollycoddled, and that we should determine beforehand exactly what is to be done with each new-comer; but Parliament does all that is to be expected of it when it provides, equality of opportunity for every citizen.",98

All we have to do is to insure that every one shall have an equal opportunity to advance himself under the protection of just and enlightened laws.

768,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The news cannot be rpgarded too seriously. When a resolution in favour of secessiorl is passed in one of the States it is about time for us to seriouslv consider our position. Now. we shall have to explain awav, not only ""the Government ineptitude and irresponsibility, but the Inter-State discord which exists. I . think that some portion of the amount proposed to be devoted to advertising Australia might be expended upon experiments in connection with the conveyance of f r u it and other perishables to the London market. Aery fact of our being able to place before - the people of England products which - under present conditions cannot be brought under their notice, would in itself be a valuable advertisement of the resources of the Commonwealth.",98

When I found that I was not able to reach the motion, I endeavoured to elicit the information from the Prime Minister' by means of questions. Unfortunately he was aiot in a position to deal with, the - various points I submitted in anticipation of the consideration of the Estimates. But I have a return for - last year which shows that the quantity of produce from the islands is so small that it cannot be regarded seriously as a - source of competition with Australian produce. Therefore, we might well remit the - duties on the articles, instead of voting a sum which would amount to only a miserable dole to the British settlers. Let us consider the treatment which is meted out to French settlers. In addition to getting land and being provided with facilities for its cultivation, and with means of transport to the markets of New Caledonia and elsewhere, they each received a bonus of £ 2 0 0 from the French Government. If it is intended to offer a sum' by way of a bonus to British settlers, then, in view of the disabilities which they have had to suffer through the legislation of the Commonwealth, it would not have been- - too much had the Prime Minister asked the Committee to vote £ 5 0 0 to each settler who has been adversely affected by our enactments. I believe that if such a proposal had been submitted, it> would have been sympathetically considered, and passed, perhaps, without material reduction. I believe that in some cases the settler has put as much as £T,OOO into the venture,'and everv penny has been lost. I am informed that, owing to the persistent efforts of the French authorities to get British and Australian settlers to foreswear their allegiance, some of them find their loyalty to the British flag so strained that, face to face with the choice between starvation and prosperity they are inclined to accept the The protection which is offered to them by the French authorities. One or two of the settlers, I understand, have already renounced their allegiance to the King, and are now living under a Government which looks specially after their interests, not really because they are colonists, but because it is desired eventually to an[Quorum nex the islands. The press in New Caledonia and France openly avowthat every effort of colonization on the part of France has that ultimate end in view. Possessing that information, and also knowing that the islands are required by the French for strategic purposes rather than for commercial reasons, the Commonwealth Government have nevertheless put forth no helping hand to the unfortunate British and Australian settlers. I have a mass of interesting and useful information, which, under more favourable conditions, I might have"" placed before honourable members; but I hope that the Government will now agree to report progress.",99

If the Government intends to push the Estimates through, of course, it has the power; but I venture to say that there has been no more unreasonable exercise of power than has been seen here today.

774,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Franklin) [ s . & \ - The question of the management of the New Hebrides in connection with other islands in the Pacific ought to receive a very great deal more attention from this Parliament than it has yet received. According a recent conversation I had with a gentleman from the New Hebrides, the position of the British settlers in the group is thing but satisfactory. From every point we have, a decided interest in the ment of the islands with men of our own race. The British settlers are placed a distinct disadvantage in comparison with the French settlers. Australia, while givextra ing a mail subsidy and professing to assist the British settlers, excludes from her market practically everything which they produce. The whole question of the treatment of the New Hebrides is a parody on statesmanby ship. The control of the Pacific is a important item in the politics of the United States, and has recently become important from the point of view of Japan. The question which power is to rule in the Pacific will have to be decided one way another very speedily. The best way in which Australia can strengthen her position there is by bringing the people of this try into close commercial relations with those who reside on the islands. But, inofficer stead of pursuing that policy, we seem have done everything possible to prevent trade. We are shutting Australian ports to the chief articles of production of the. islands, and, having done that, we perpoint. petrate the farce of voting a sum of £500 on account of the New Hebrides The Commonwealth legislation seems to be absolutely to prohibit closer relations. is time that the Government commenced adopt a statesmanship-like attitude in regard to the islands to prevent their further removal from sympathy and relations with us. If we do not. instead of being a proapart tection to Australia in the future, they be a very serious menace indeed. Proposed vote agreed to. ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT.

781,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Coolgardie) [2.50] - I wish to draw attention to item 10, under Contingencies- "" Compensation for services of Commonwealth and State officers, £ 5 3 0 . "" It appears that in some of the States the local Governments very properly allow officers to receive the amounts which this Parliament votes to them for services performed for the Commonwealth. The amounts are, course, first paid into the Treasuries, and are afterwards handed over to the officers concerned. But in the State of Victoria the amounts voted by the Commonwealth to State officers for rendering Federal services are, in some instances at all events, retained by the State Government. There is a very glaring case in connection with the High Court that has been brought under my notice. I am very reluctant to bring it before Parliament, but consider that it is my duty to do so, because I believe that Parliament will not allow an anomaly which amounts to a gross injustice to be perpetrated. The gentleman to whom I refer is a very able and highly trusted State officer, occupying Hie position of Prothonotary in Melbourne. He is also the Deputy-Registrar of the Principal Registry of the High Court. This officer, as I understand, has had everything to do with the initiation of the High* Court machinery throughout the various States.",101
782,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,He is a man great ability.,101
783,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am pleased to hear the honourable and learned member for Corio, who ought to know, give this testimony. I also understand that if their Honours the Justices had been consulted they would have recommended that a very substantial allowance should be paid to this officer-in fact, that there should be a special vote for the work performed by him.. To show that his duties are not - merely perfunctory, but involve transactions of very great .moment, I may mention that in connection with the various election petitions decided by the High Court the whole of the ballot-papers were reviewed by him. For instance, in the case of Chanter v. Blackwood, he had this duty to perform, and did it in such a manner as to win the approval of both parties to the litigation.",101
784,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Hear , hear.",101
785,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think that where an officer of this character has rendered valuable and substantia] services to the Commonwealth, we ought not to allow a 'State Government to interpose, and prevent him from receiving the reward which we as a Parliament have decided that he ought to receive, and that Ministers, in framing the Estimates, have recommended. I may point out that on one occasion at least the State Government have of allowed a State official to receive a gratuity States from the Commonwealth. I find in the Commonwealth Gazette of the n t h August, 1906, a notification to the effect that the services of an officer might be placed at the disposal of the Commonwealth Attorney General for three months, on his salary being reimbursed to the State, and a gratuity of £ 2 5 being paid to the officer from Commonwealth funds. There are a number of other cases in other States, but I am now referring to the practice in Victoria. The Electoral Commissioner, Mr. Topp, a State officer, has been allowed to receive a gratuity for Federal work. If that officer and the Government Printer of Victoria be allowed to receive £ 1 5 0 a year, why should this gentleman, who has performed equally important work, be denied any recompense to which the Commonwealth Parliament thinks he is entitled?",101
786,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I think the Government Printer has to hand over his gratuity to the State Treasurer.,101
787,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I may be mistaken, of very but I thought it was distinctly understood that the Government Printer had not to do so. There is the curious anomaly that the branch registry in Sydney receives 1 a vote of £ 3 0 per year more than the principal registry in Melbourne. The actual expenditure on the Melbourne registry, eveni supposing this gentleman receives his allowance, is only £ 7 0 a year, whereas the vote in Sydney amounts to £-ibo. I cani see no justification for the anomaly, not merely in reference to the amounts, but in reference to the practice of refusing to allow officers in Victoria to receive gratuities, while permitting oflicers in New South Wales liberty in this respect. Both Mr. Higgins, when Attorney-General, and the present Attorney-'General, approved of the payment to this officer of gratuities. In the case of Chanter v. Blackwood, the work of counting the ballot-papers was largely done in this officer's own time.; and he was often engaged three or four days a week up to n o'clock at night in this work. have here a memorandum written on the 14th May, 1906, and addressed to the Attorney-General of the State of Victoria, as follows: In the case of the Deputy-Registrar, the amount has been allocated on the basis of the amount which the Commonwealth Government thinks he should get for the services personally rendered lo it.",101
788,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Will the honourable member kindly tell me what he proposes?,102
789,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I wish to commend this case to the consideration of the Government, and to submit a motion which shall secure iustice to this officer. The Justices of the High Court - were appointed in October, 1903, and during all the years since then this officer has been doing the work of Registrar. As the Commonwealth Parliament considered that this gentleman is entitled to £ 4 0 per year, I propose to move that he be granted a special gratuity of £ 1 2 0 .",102
790,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That would be increasing the amount on the Estimates.,102

He will have no consideration at the hands of the Public Service Commissioner.

From my own observation, I know that the officer in question conducted the business to which reference has been made, not in the time of the State, but i'n his own time; and I do not think that Parliament, when voting the gratuity",103
818,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is a payment for services rendered.,103
819,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It was an absolute payment for services rendered, not only for a clay or two, but for long weary weeks, during hours when the officer ought to have been home with his family. He was engaged night after night, over many weeks, doing the work of the Commonwealth, and, in recognition of these services, the Parliament voted him a sum of money. I cannot see why this matter should not be arranged. The Commonwealth Parliament did not vote this money to the State of Victoria, any more than it has voted money under similar circumstances to the State of New South Wales; the monev was voted to a particular officer for specific services rendered. I can quite understand that the sympathies of the Attorney-General are with the officer; but we want something more than sympathv-w e wish to be certain that the money will go to the individual, and not to the State. What is this Parliament to do if the negotiations of the Attorney-General fail? I suppose that then this officer would be in exactly the same position he has been in for some years; and if that be so, I shall refuse to vote a shilling. I can say from my own knowledge that no man ever undertook a more herculean task than did this gentleman. All the parties concerned in the case were thoroughly satisfied, and congratulated him personally. Indeed, they placed on record in an official communication to the Minister their appreciation of this gentleman's valuable services.",103

Where a State officer performs duties for the Commonwealth, in addition to those which he performs for the State, I understand that the practice adopted is - for the authority employing the officer to fix the salary of the office, and then for an apportionment of the salarv to be made as between the Commonwealth and the State - I hold that in this case the Commonwealth would not be justified in offering a gratuity for services rendered, any more than the' State would be justified in' offering a gratuity to a Commonwealth officer for services performed in the same way for the State.",103

As the years officer. go by, and as the States and Federal Parliaments are brought into closer touch the people, I believe that, instead of salaries of highly-paid officials being creased, they will suffer a reduction.

Of course, where a State officer can be employed to do Federal work, there can be no objection to the Commonwealth making the .State Government an allowance for the performam ance of that work. To my mind, there is always a danger that officers who are brought more closely into touch with members of Parliament than are the lower grades of the service will receive more in the nature of increments. For instance, the honourable member for Riverina saw this that the Prothonotary to whom allusion has been made did very valuable work, and in a deal of overtime.

I do not know whether the TreaGovernment intend to make them before the session closes, or whether they propose to defer them until after the general elections. Certainly some definite statement on the subject ought to be forthcoming. I well t . remember the urgency which it was alleged existed for these appointments when the Judiciary Bill was under consideration. We were then told that the Justices of the High Court were being worked to death. We were assured that justice was being denied l to litigants. _ That was the expression which in was used in the correspondence which passed between the present occupants of who the High Court Bench and the Attorneyable General. But as soon as ever the Bill had passed, and it was possible to afford relief to the Justices, we heard no more about the matter of urgency. Apparently, even the Justices themselves find that ' the necesthe sity for additional appointments is not reso urgent as they represented If to be. If these appointments are so desperately urgent as we were led to believe, why have a they not been made? The Prime Minister himself has been offered a seat on the High in Court Bench.

I hope that when they are made they will not indicate that the only way to secure an appointment is to become a member or a supporter of a Government. It cannot be too strongly, emphasized that they should be open to the whole of the legal talent of Australia. I hope that no consideration as to a member of the legal profession being in opposition to or a supporter of a Government will influence in the slightest degree these appointments. I trust that the only consideration will be that of fitness. If those possessing pre-eminent fitness are to be found in the ranks of the Government or amongst their supporters, well and good : but once let it be thought that the only wav. to secure an appointment of the kind is to become a party politician and a member of a Government, and a blow will be struck at the impartiality and legal standing of the Court. I am led to make these remarks owing to the unconscionable delav that has taken place. There is no dearth of eligible persons. A selection may be made from the whole bar of Australia, comprising many men who have worked for years to fit themselves for these high positions. The whole of that legal realm should be thoroughly searched. I do not know whether it is of any use to appeal to the Government for information.",106
873,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In reply to a question asked on the 18th inst., the Prime Minister saidThere are good reasons why the appointments should not be deferred; but honourable members will agree that they are amongst the most responsible which a Government could be called upon to make. The subject will be taken into consideration immediately, thoucrh I do not promise that the appointments will be made at once. That is a clear and definite statement.",107

877,Sir TOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,But another place must be considered.,107
878,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"My complaint is that immediately the Bill left the House for another place it lost its urgency. I admit the importance of these appointments, and, that being so, the Government might very well put an end to this period of uncertainty, and furnish the High Court of Australia with that legal reinforcement which the present occupants of the Bench have declared to be so necessary, and even urgent. If the statement by the Prime Minister, to which reference has just been made, is ai definite one, I congratulate Ministers on their conception of definiteness. It is just about as definite as have been most of their statements this session on matters of policy. Yesterday we discussed for hours a Bill which is said to be very urgent, but finally the Government allowed it to be taken out of their hands. Two or three days of our valuable time have also been wasted in discussing other proposals which were said to be of equal urgency, but which have quietly been set aside. There is no justification for delaying these appointments, and a definite statement should be given that they will be speedily made.",107

If this proceeding can be described as the carrying on of the King's Government in a constitutional way, I do not know what the conduct of responsible government is. I have never seen anything more inept or more unjust than tlids action on the part of the Ministry. No sense of justice is shown in rushing business through the House at the point of physical endurance. The public have a right to expect these matters to be discussed in a fair and proper spirit. It is not the fault of the Opposition that we have been sitting here all night. Throughout the evening there has been nothing but fair discussion. As a matter of fact, there is no urgency, so far as the business of this Chamber is concerned. The urgency relates to the work of another place, the members of which are sleeping peacefully, whilst - an attempt is being made to bludgeon business through this Committee. There is no sense of justice shown by such conduct If there were anv need to take this step in order to complete the business of the session, no one would begrudge the sacrifice involved in sitting up all night. But after the Government have got their business through this House, we shall have to wait for the Senate, which has enough before it to occupy two or three weeks - We are kept out of our beds when there is no urgency, and later, shall have to fiddle about until the Senate finishes its work. However, protestations are wasted upon the Prime Minister.",108

Is lt this a fair or proper way in which to transact the business of the country, n - : volving expenditure totalling tens cf thousands of pounds? If a photograph of the Chamber were taken at the present moment, and copies were distributed throughout the electorates, the protests which are now being made by the members of the Opposition, who are awake and alert, wouldi be reinforced by those whose money we are voting away. As the Government is not alive to its responsibilities, it behoves us on the Opposition side to be all the more watchf u l in regard to its proposals, and since we are forced to this test of physical endurance, it will be our .duty to scrutinize every item very closely. I should like some information regarding the work of the Secretary to this Department. I notice that while he receives £ 8 0 0 and the Chief Clerk £ 6 0 0 per annum, three other clerks are paid only £ 7 0 5 , and nine only £ 1 , 1 6 5 . The Chief Clerk has a salary which amounts to more than half the amount paid to nine of his subordinates, which suggests that some of them must receive remuneration not in proportion to the services they render, and appears to justify the complaint sometimes heard that those who do most work are paid least.",108

The Department of Home A f fairs, when approached in regard to the matter, very rightly took the view that the interests of Defence are paramount to those of any municipality, but were willing, if the Defence Department felt that it could do without the frontage, or a portion of it , to agree to the re-transfer.",109

I , as representing the electoral division in which Paddington is situated, was duly notified of the minute, and informed the Municipal Council and people of Paddington accordingly. When a minute, written to express a Government intention, is made public, it must be taken to have become a Ministerial .promise; but, although the promise to which i i refer was made in January of last year, nothing has yet been done. The Department of Home Affairs, at one time, despite my representations, appeared to be under the impression that the municipality of Paddington is not altogether in favour of the re transfer. All my letters to the Department bearing upon this subject pointed to the unswerving desire of the municipality of Paddington to have this exchange effected, but for some reason or other the Department thought that this point was open, to question.

In June, after the honourable member not a had been communicated with, the honourable and learned member for Corinella, whc was still Minister ofi Defence, sent an officer to Sydney, who came back and reported against the Oxford-street frontage being handed over. The Minister concurred in that report. Subsequently, the matter came before me, and was again referred to the Defence Department, which adhered to the late decision of the previous Minister. The report presented by Colonel Bridges set out that the land that was proposed to be transferred could not be given over to the State without detriment to the property and the position of the barracks. It was considered by the Department undesirable to convey more than two small pieces of land. The papers were sent on to Sydney, and the whole matter.was re-opened, but the Defence Department adhered to the late decision.",109

952,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I ask the ruling of Chairman as to whether the honourable member for Lang is in order in reflecting upon the procedure of the Committee, and in stating that he has taken names with the object of using them for a certain purpose later on.",112
953,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member-is quite in order up to the present stage.,112
954,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I beg to move That the honourable member for Lang be no further heard. We are not going to sit here any longer listening to this twaddle.,112
955,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Under what standing order does the honourable member submit his motion?,112
956,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Unde r standing order C passed in November last. I am not going to be a party to business being blocked by stupid twaddle.,112
957,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,There can be no debate upon the motion.,112
958,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I rise to order. The honourable member for Corio used the phrase ""insulting twaddle"" concerning another honourable member.",112
959,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I did not hear the remark, but if it was made the honourable member for Corio must withdraw it.",112
960,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I gladly withdraw it on vour. instruction. Question-That the honourable member for """"Lang be no further heard-put . Division called for, but there being no tellers for the "" Ayes,"" question resolved in the negative.",112
961,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Corio) [5.35]- what has occurred I refuse to take any further part in this all-night sifting; and I shall leave the Chamber. An all-night sitting is only justified by obstruction, and if there is obstruction we have power to deal with it. I sat up several nights last vear to give the Government this power. 1 think the Government have a duty in the Estimates, conduct of the business of the country, and to that end I think they ought to have voted to stop this stupid, senseless twaddle.",112
962,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,112
963,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I withdraw it.,112
964,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Lang) [5.40] - After sitting until this hour, honourable members are not in a condition to deal with large questions of finance. I have here a list of eleven honourable members who have been the asleep in the Chamber during the discussion.",112
965,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I rise to a point of order. If the honourable member for Lang has such a list he ought to read it, so that we maybe in a position to judge whether it is correct.",112
966,Mr TOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am the judge of the correctness of the list, and I have 110 desire to read the names, and perhaps cause innocent members embarrassment. My point is that it is scandalous on the part of the Government to endeavour to transact important public business under the present conditions; and I know .of no more effective protest than a motion of the kind I have submitted. Before I proceed further I should like to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.'] We were told that we should have a proper opportunity to discuss grievances when we consented to abolish grievance day. Under the circumstances, however, I wish my amendment to be regarded as a protest against this method of conducting public business. Amendment negatived. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 21 (Electoral Office), £6,012. *",112
967,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Wentworth) [5.54] - I de : sire to draw attention to an improvement which I think should be made. In the Chief Electoral Office there is a great deal of work involved in placing the.names on the roll; and I desire to point out that the office in Sydney is, perhaps, one of the most inaccessible in the city. It is situated at the top of Denman Chambers, and there is no lift. I feel quite sure that if there were an accessible office a great many more A f t e r people would enroll themselves than we find under present conditions.",112
968,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Darling Downs-Min ister of Home Affairs) [5.55] - The enrolment of electors usually takes place at the offices of the electoral registrars and divisional returning officers. , In manv instances the electoral registrar's office is at the post-office. I promise the honourable member that I will look into the matter to which he has referred. Perhaps sufficient notification has not been given to the public as to where the offices of electoral registrars are to be found. That is being remedied now, ""and notice-boards are being put up in conspicuous places to indicate those offices.",112
969,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Canobolas) [5.56] - I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister a matter which has possibly been the cause of very grave irregularities in the past, and if not attended to might lead to complications in the future. I have here what is known as a tally-sheet, which is used by presiding officers for the purpose' of recording votes polled. It is supposed to record 150 votes. It is marked off in squares of fives, but if closely inspected, will be seen that the last square instead of providing for five should provide for ten in order to make up the 150. The result has been that where these sheets have been accepted as recordng the full number of 150 ""votes, they have recorded five more than has actually been polled.",113
970,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the honourable member will let me have the tally-sheet, I shall make inquiries into the matter.",113
971,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I shall do so. There is one other matter to which. I should like to refer. I think that better arrangements might be made for enabling electors to ascertain whether their names are on the various rolls. I understand that the rolls are now being compiled^ anc! it is proposed that as soon as they are printed they shall be issued to police stations, post offices, and public schools for the information of electors. It seems to me that in some instances rolis should be issued and exposed at polling places outside of the division to which they refer. Where the polling places, for instance, are on the boundary line of a division, this should certainly be done. I may take as an example the town of Young, which: was previously in the Bland electorate, and is now in the Calare electorate, and I think the rolls for both divisions should be exhibited there. The same thing would apply to Borenore, in the West Macquarie Division. The rolls for each of these divisions should, I think, be exhibited at both polling places. Again, residents in the vicinity of Wyalong, which is in the Riverina electorate, are on the Calare roll, and the rolls 'for the two electorates should be exhibited at Wyalong. If the 2 object of exhibiting the rolls is to give the fullest information possible to the electors, I hope the suggestion I have made that rolls for adjoining divisions shall be exhibited at polling places on the boundaries cf electorates will be carried out.",113
972,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I shall attend to that matter.,113
973,Mr RONALD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Southern Melbourne) [6.3] - I wish to call attention to the remuneration given to returning officers. I ask the Minister to look into that matter, because I have been led to believe that they are very poorly remunerated.",113
974,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have looked into that matter, and will make a recommendation.",113
975,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Parramatta) [6.4] - I hope the Minister will take some it notice of what has been said by the honourable member for Canobolas. I should like to mention the case of the North Shore polling - place. The North Sydney electorate has hitherto comprised all that northern suburb, and the electors have conveniently recorded their votes, at a polling booth established on the North Shore pier. The North Sydney electorate has since been curtailed very much, and the upper part of it has been included in the Parramatta electorate. If the polling place for the residents of this district is not continued at the North Shore pier, from 12,000 to 14,000 persons, who still travel to the city through the North Sydney electorate, will be greatly inconvenienced.",113
976,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member is going a little further. What the honourable member for Canobolas referred to was the exhibition of the rolls. The honourable member for Parramatta is referring to the establishment of polling booths.,113
977,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yes . The electors should have the same facilities as they have previously enjoyed.,113
978,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I think that the very place to which the honourable member has referred is under the consideration of the Department at the present moment.,113
979,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I shall be satisfied if a polling booth is established at which the electors can vote as they go to the city. I should like to hear from the Minister some statement as to the condition of the rolls. From all the evidence I can get, they would appear to be in a shocking, condition.",113
980,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [6.7] - The New South Wales rolls were collected last year under Estimates. [REPRESENTATIVES.,] instructions given by my predecessor. They were compiled and exhibited by the registrars, who received all applications for enrolment from that time up to the beginning of June. We then gave instructions to the New South Wales police in collecting the police rolls to include in our rolls the names of all persons who were entitled to be on them. These rolls are now being printed, and if the instructions given have been carried out, the New South Wales rolls should be complete to date. They are being distributed now, and will be exposed immediately in order that if by accident the name of any elector has been omitted an opportunity will be afforded for remedying the omission in the preparation of the supplementary rolls. By the middle of October, the whole of the rolls for New South Wales should be in the hands of the divisional returning officers and registrars. Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) .[6.10] - All I have to say in reply to that is that I heard a man say that on investigation he found that scores of names of persons residing in a single street were not on the roll.",113
981,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Perhaps he has the old rolls, and not one of the rolls now in the hands of the registrars.",114
982,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I understand that he had a new roll.,114
983,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the honourable member will supply me with exact information, I shall make inquiries. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I shall be glad to communicate with my informant, and ask him to forward the information.",114
984,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If what the honourable member says is correct, there must have been some defect in the police collection.",114
985,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not pretend to say who is to blame, but I have been informed that some of the Sydney city rolls are in a shocking condition.",114
986,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In some parts of the city area the annual movement of the population represents 33""? per cent, of the total number on the rolls.",114
987,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There should, therefore, be all the more care on the part - of the Department. I am told that the names of nearly 10,000 persons have been added to the Dalley roll, and 8,000 or 9,000 names have been taken off that. roll. This bears out what the Minister has said.",114
988,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That woulcl, I think, represent a movement of 50 per cent. Estimates.",114
989,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not think that any of the new rolls have yet been exhibited, and it is, therefore, impossible to say what names ought to be on the roll. Mr JOSE PH COOK - If instructions were given that the names should be collected as far back as June, the rolls should be readv for inspection before today.",114
990,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think the police began their collection on the 1st July. It occupies about six weeks, and then the manuscript had to be prepared and the rolls printed from the manuscript. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The Minister must see that if it takes three months to compile the rolls displacements to the extent of one-third of 33^ per cent, of the total names on the rolls will take place while they are being compiled.",114
991,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Quite so. But in the meantime notices are issued informing people that if they transfer their residence from one place to another they should notify the registrars of the change. All transfers which take place up to the date, of the issue of the writ will appear on the supplementary rolls. one of Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It was stated the other dav that in the case of the new portion added to the Parramatta electorate alone no-less than 1,100 notices of objection had been lodged.",114
992,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That would probably be due to the police examination of the rolls. If they discover that people have removed from one district to another they notify the registrar, and he serves notices on the persons concerned, who have then twenty-one days within which to appear and object.",114
993,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am' afraid that even after we have done our best the rolls will be very imperfect.,114
994,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The trouble is chiefly due to the movement of population, and to the apathy which electors exhibit in respect of the registration of their names.",114
995,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Can the Minister explain why the names of persons who have sent in their electoral claims do not appear upon the roll ?,114
996,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We have had Instances in which registrars have failed to carry out their duties.,114
997,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I suppose that the name of any elector who has sent in a claim within the past eighteen months will appear upon the roll which will be issued during the next fortnight?,114
998,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yes . Mr. JOSEPH . COOK - The probability is that a great number of them will »ot appear there. I presume that no postmaster who acts as an electoral official will be removed from the district in which he is at present located until after the elections ?,114
999,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,No . All the divisional returning officers have received their instructions in anticipation of the election.,115
1000,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,When will the rolls be completed?,115
1001,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In some instances, the country lists have been circulated.",115
1002,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is important that honourable members should be provided with copies of them at the earliest possible moment.,115
1003,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have issued instructions that so soon as the rolls for each electorate are issued, half-a-dozen copies shall be forwarded to the sitting member.",115
1004,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,When will they be ready?,115
1005,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They will all have been issued by the 13th October.,115
1006,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is very late indeed, although I gather from the way in which business is progressing in the Senate that the general elections will not take place until December. we shall not have a repetition of what occurred at the last elections, when thousands of electors were disfranchised through no fault of their own.",115
1007,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Riverina) [6.21] - There is one matter that I should like to bring under the notice of the Minister.,115
1008,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I think should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],115
1009,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister relates to the removal of names from the rolls.,115

[Quorum formed.""] ' Mr CHANTER - In many instances the police lodge objections to certain names which appear upon the rolls. jections are forwarded to the electoral registrars, who in turn transmit them to the returning officer for the division. A letter is then sent to the last known address of the elector concerned, apprizing him of the objection which has been lodged. scores of cases in which men have simply moved from one town to another in the 2 same electoral division these communications have not reached them.",115
1011,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why did they not notify the electoral office of their change of address ?,115
1012,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"They are under the impression, that so long as they remain in the electoral division it is not necessary to do that. The result is that their names are struck off the rolls. The remedy for this evil appears to be a very simple one. In stead of a letter being forwarded by the authorities to the last known' address of the voter it should be forwarded to his new address.",115
1013,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have taken a note of the honourable member's complaint, and will have it attended to.",115

1016,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [6.32] - In reply to the honourable member, I wish to say that many voting machines have been submitted to the Electoral Department, but it is utterly impossible for us to extend a preference toany one of them. ' I have asked the Comthat we monwealth electoral officer to inspect the. machine which is now on view outside .""of this chamber, and, if advisable, to secure the expert advice of the Department upon it.",115

Of course, whatever'' privileges are extended to one machinei n that connection will be extended to others.",115
1019,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Lang) [6.33] -'fh e honourable member for Parramatta has mentioned one matter which is of very great In importance. It relates to the compilation of our electoral rolls. Not long ago ninety names were collected in one street in Surrey Hills, Sydney, which was selected haphazard. Mr 'GROOM - How long ago?",115
1020,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Only three or four weeks. A couple of persons armed with a small book made a house-to-house canvass with a view to ascertaining who were entitled to be enrolled. As scon as the work of collection was finished the names were checked with the manuscript which had been supplied by the police.,116
1021,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,How were they able to get access to the manuscript of the police?,116
1022,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The names were checked at the electoral office. The result was that out of ninety names which had been collected, it was found that fifty sons were not upon the roll. The street in which the experiment was tried was chiefly inhabited by. artisans, with fheir wives and families.",116
1023,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I should like to be supplied with full particulars of the case to which the honourable member refers, so that I might look into it.",116
1024,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Claim s were entered on behalf of those who had been left off the rolls, and I presume that they received attention. It seems to me, however, that it is reasonable to assume that the names of persons residing in other streets, and in other electorates, - may also have been left off in the same way. The omission was certainly a very serious one.",116
1025,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It calls for a report, and if the honourable member will supply me with the particulars of the case, I shall obtain one.",116
1026,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I shall endeavour to supply the Minister with the necessary information. There is another matter which I desire to bring - under his attention. The polling places for the various electorates have already been fixed, but I wish to know whether, on a complaint by anv considerable body of electors that the polling booth nearest to them is inconvenient, a more convenient one would be appointed?",116
1027,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,If the honourable member will supply me with the names of polling places that are considered inconvenient I shall see what can be done in the matter. We had a complaint the other dav in regard to a polling place at Mortlake. New South Wales.,116

Division 22 (Public Service Commissioner) -^8,785.",116
1034,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Barrier) [6.47] - Some misunderstanding has arisen in certain quarters in connection with the examinations held under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner. From what I can gather, complaint has been made that the fact that so few members of the general division sought, at a recent examination, to qualify for the clerical branch of the service was an evidence of a regrettable lack of ambition. It would appear, however, that many members of the general division of the Public Service, who had been training for months to pass the examination, were, at the last moment, constrained to stand aside, owing to an alteration of the subjects being made without sufficient notice. Mr Muirden. the principal of a college at Adelaide, has written a letter to the press, in which he deals with the question. He tells me that he, personally, has no reason to complain, since three out of the five candidates who were successful at the last examination in the Commonwealth were coached by him. In the letter in question he statesIn the column containing Federal news in your issue of the 23rd inst., reference is made to the Civil Service examination which was held recently to enable officers in the general division to transfer to the clerical. The Public Service Commissioner reports that out of 700 general division officers entitled to compete only 20 felt disposed to face the examination. By inference the Commissioner assigns the cause to apathy on the part of the officers concerned, but a consideration'of the facts will force one to a very different conclusion. Bv the regulations for transfer from the general division to the clerical officers are required to pass an examination in handwriting, dictation, English, arithmetic, and geography. Basing their studies on these regulations, many officers spent a good deal of lime and money during last year to become proficient for transfer, and to take full advantage of the forthcoming examination. One can imagine their surprise, however, when it was publicly announced in January last that shorthand and typewriting were to be substituted for geography in the examination to be held within three months of that time, and that the test in shorthand was to be '120 words per minute. Later information revealed the fact that candidates were expected to make, in 30 minutes, a typewritten transcript of their shorthand notes, consisting of 600 words. The result was that many who had spent the previous twelve or eighteen months in hard study had to abandon the examination because lliev felt that they could not in so short a time reach the standard required. Such occurrences are very unfortunate.",116

1037,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think we ought to popularize these examinations - Let the standard be as high as is considered desirable, and the examinations conducted on sound lines, a^d good results will be 2 secured. If the successful candidates were in excess of the number for whom appointments could be found, I am sure that private employers would be glad to secure the services of those who had passed such a test.",117
1038,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I will make a note of the point.,117
1039,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Another matter to which I desire to call attention relates to the position of the Postal and Customs officials in the Barrier district, who hold that they should be entitled to receive at least the No. 2 scale of allowances. At present they are in the No. 1 scale, and they contend that, owing to the increased price of groceries, meat, greengroceries, wood and coal, lighting, sanitary fees, and milk, the cost of living there,, in the case of a man with a family, is about £ 5 2 per annum more than it is in Sydney. I understand the officers of the New South Wales Government who are stationed there receive living allowances on the No. 2 scale, if that is so, there seems to me to be an injustice to the Commonwealth officers.",117

1042,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,No . The Government intend to pass a measure this session raising the age from eighteen to twenty.,117
1043,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I also desire to direct the attention of the Minister to the absurdity bf requiring officers who will never have to use it to pass an examination testing their skill in shorthand writing. While the ability to write shorthand is undoubtedly of great service to those engaged in secretarial employments, for 75 per cent, of the officers, such as those in the accountants' branches, it is practically a useless acquirement. If , as I have been informed has been the case, men have been asked to show their proficiency by writing shorthand at the rate of 120 words a minute after to have a only three months' notice that they would be examined in shorthand, great injustice has been done, because, although we sometimes read of persons who have attained that degree of skill in so short a time, one never meets actual shorthand writers who have done so.",117
1044,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Canobolas) [ 7 . 0 ] - I understand that under the Act, whenever complaint is made against an officer in nexion with which an investigation is dered, he is suspended, often venience and loss of the Department, and sometimes suffers unmerited aspersion his character.  tion is not ordered because of the inconcase venience which suspension would cause.",118
1045,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes , and in those cases perhaps injustice is occasionally done. New South Wales, probably because of aleither. terations in the inspecting staff, and new officials taking charge, the rule is rigidly insisted upon now than was forsolicitors, Sydney: merly the case, with the result that men are sometimes suspended on the most trivial charges. In a.country town angry words may be used by an official to his subordiduty nate as the result of a quarrel, and on the matter being reported, an investigation ordered, and word goes round that "" Mr. So-and-so is suspended."" The public, not understanding the technical nature of the procedure, conclude that a very grave they charge has been preferred, and for - tion a time unjustifiable reproach is cast £21 upon the person suspended, notwithout standing perhaps years of good service.

1053,Mr JOHNSO N,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Lang) [7.8] - I wish to under the notice of the Minister the of two men employed in the Postal Department who are being buffeted between the Commonwealth and State authoriI n ties, and cannot obtain satisfaction from The particulars are set out very clearly in the following'statement, prepared more for them by Messrs. Shipway and Berne, William S. Gowen and Alfred E. B. Gilder for some time previous to iSg6 were members of the New South Wales police force doing as detectives for the Postal Department. In i8g6 they were graded with the Postal Deis partment by the New South Wales Public Service Board, the first intimation they had of the fact being the Gazette notice. In consequence of this change, they made applications for a refund of the amounts which had contributed to the Police SuperannuaFund, which in Gowen's case amounted to gs. 3d., and in Gilder's, to £37 :s. rod. In support of their anDlication they pointed that in consequence of the transfer from the Police Department they were deprived of any prospective benefits from the Police Super-, animation Fund; also that the transfer was not made at their request, but purely as a matter not a of Departmental arrangement and convenience, the duties remaining - unchanged in any way. therefore considered they were entitled to the refund asked for. The matter was subto the Police Department through the Secretary's Office. In September, 1896, the Inspector-General of Police wrote the fol ""This would not be legal under the provisions of the Police Regulation Act. There are many who have left the service for other emMessrs. Gowen and Gilder pointed out that if as implied therein they are regarded as hav"" left the service for other employment,"" by virtue of the action of the Public Service in placing them nominally under the Postal instead of the Police Department, it would be illegal to grant them the refund sought, the effect upon them would be serious, as they neither obtain a pension under the police nor the Public Service Act, and would also be of their superannuation contributions to the police fund. On this appeal the then Postmaster-General (Mr Crick), wrote the following minute :"" I quite agree that Gowen and Gilder should be granted what they ask. They did not leave service for other employment, but are in their present position as an act of obedience to the Government of New South Wales, and if the Colonial Secretary's Department still refuse to comply, then I must strongly urge Mr Drake to pay the amount as a matter of justice, but it will be well to bring the papers again before my honourable colleague Mr See."" As directed, the matter was again brought tinder the notice of the honourable Sir J. (then Mr See. Reporting further, the Inspector-General of Police on 12th May, 1902, states- "" No such refund could be legally made unless by special vole of Parliament. I can see no distinction between these cases and thousands of others where members of the police force have resigned to improve their conditions. Some in other branches of the Public Service. The refund would create an embarrassing precedent."" Messrs. Gowen and Gilder explained that there may of course be other cases similar to theirs, but they have never heard of any. They pointed out that the Postmaster-General, Mr Crick, who is a recognised legal authority, agreed that their request was a just one; and they urged that if the refund could not be made to them from the Police Superannuation Fund the alternative course suggested by the Inspector General of having the amount placed on the Estimates to meet the case by vote of Parliament be adopted. As su<""*ested by Mr Crick, the case was referred to the Postmaster-Genera! of the Commonwealth, Mr Drake. transferof the Postal Department to the Commonwealth took place just at this time. reply received through the Commonwealth inspector, Mr G. A. MCKay, then Acting-Secretary, was as follows :- "" I am directed to return herein the papers in connection with the above matter, and to say that the Public Service Commissioner has looked carefully into the facts of the case, and is of opinion that the claims are against those who are administering the Police Superannuation Fund, which is purely a State matter. If those administering that fund cannot legally pay the amounts said to be due, the State Government. I am to state, and not the Commonwealth, should, he considers, provide the necessary funds on the Estimates."" The position of Gowen and Gilder is they are confident, and quite unique. They were transferred as a matter of Departmental arrangement and convenience, and without being consulted, their case is fairly put by Mr Crick in his minute, which recognises the equity of their claim, and points out that "" they are in their present positions in obedience to the Government of New South Wales."" They therefore humbly petition the Premier, the Honourable J. H . Carruthers, to give their case the consideration it deserves.",118
1054,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Did they apply to the State Government?,119
1055,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes , and the State Government refused to recognise any liability in the matter. Technically, the State may be responsible, but the moral liability rests upon the Commonwealth, because the accruing rights of these men should have been considered when they were taken over from the State service.",119
1056,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The question is whether they fTave any accruing rights within the 2 meaning of the Constitution. I shall look into the case.,119
1057,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not rest any claim, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, upon legal grounds. I certainly think that we should deal justly by them. There should be no suspicion of sharp practice on our part.",119
1058,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Wentworth) [7.19] - This matter might very well be taken up and definitely settled by the Minister without further delay. A number of other cases involving almost as much hardship have been brought under my notice. Officers having certain rights under the States are not protected by section 84 of the Constitution, and, by means of a legal technicality, are being cheated out of that to which they are entitled. The Commonwealth is morally responsible beyond any doubt, and I trust that the clamour of the States Treasurers, who are seeking to evade their liability, will be resisted by the Minister. The inThe tention of the provision in the Constitution is very clear, namely; that no officer The transferred to the Commonwealth shall suffer any diminution of the rights to which he was entitled under the State laws at the time of transfer. I trust that the Minister will at once recognise the rights of these men, and take definite action in the matter.",119
1059,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Newcastle) [7.25] - I quite agree with the remarks of the honourable members for Lang and Wentworth with regard fo the hardships inflicted upon some officers owing to the fact that their accruing rights are not sufficiently protected by the Constitution. I know of one case in which a postmaster, who had been considerably reduced in status by.the Public Service Commissioner in New South Wales, had an appeal pending at the transfer of the Department to the Commonwealth. Consequently, he was taken over at a veryconsiderable reduction upon his previous salary. The Commonwealth Commissioner could not take cognisance of anything that had occurred prior to the date of transfer, and, therefore, could not hear the appeal of trie officer, whilst it was held that the hearing of the appeal could not be completed by the New South Wales Commissioners. As a result, the officer referred to has had to remain at his reduced status, and a number of juniors have been appointed over his head.",119
1060,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"As a matter of fact, the officer' had a right to an inquiry under the State laws, and that right should have been preserved under the Commonwealth.",119
1061,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Precisely . The officer was practically denied the right of appeal, and his case is typical of many others. It appears to me that the Commonwealth is taking advantage of a technicality to deny justice, and I trust that the Minister will give the matter his careful consideration.",120
1062,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Canobolas) [7.28] - I think that grave injustice is being done to a large number of officers in connection with, their retiring allowances. Certain officers in the Postal Department were contributors to the New South Wales Superannuation Fund, and brought over with them their rights in connection with that fund. I understand that since the transfer of the Department to the Commonwealth some alteration has been made' in the conditions with regard to the payment of retiring allowances, and that the State authorities insist that these should apply to officers in the Federal service. I know of a line inspector who was recently compelled to retire owing to his having reached the prescribed age, and who, instead of receiving a month's pay for everv year of service has been asked to accept a fortnight's pay.",120

1064,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It seems to me that, a matter of justice, these men are entitled to their retiring allowance upon the scale previously fixed.",120

1068,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Parramatta) [7.32] - I know something of the case to which the honourable member for Lang has referred. I believe that the transfer place at the time that I was in charge of the Post Office in New South Wales, but that owing to their reliance upon the jusmatter. tice of their claim the two detectives did not bring the matter under my notice. Since then they have endeavoured to obtain some small meed of justice, and although sive Ministers have told them that they would look into the' matter, no satisfaction has yet been obtained.",120
1069,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I promise the honourable member that I shall look carefully into the papers, which I have not yet seen.",120
1070,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The only difficulty that arises is due to the repudiation by the State of its obligation in the matter. There is no reason why the officers 'should be allowed to suffer owing to their transfer to the Commonwealth. The whole question hinges upon the certificate of the Inspector General of Police, who 7 did not want these men to leave his service. He was not very pleased with them, and perhaps was not very generous when he placed them in the same category as men who left the service voluntarily. As a matter of fact, they were transferred by the Public Service Commissioner from the Police to the Post and Telegraph Department, and it is only fair that the Department, after having had these men transferred for its own special purposes, should see that they are not penalized. The amount involved may not be very much, but it is of considerable importance to the men concerned. I should like to refer to the relation which grant of leave to officers who are retiring bears to the value of their pension A number of officers who have the been transferred from the New South Wales service to that of the Commonas wealth are entitled to receive pensions based upon the salary received during the three years immediately preceding their retirement. When a Commonwealth officer asks for six months' leave on half pay. as he is entitled to do, and takes advantage it , he is held to reduce the amount of salary upon which his pension is calculated. In the case of an officer receiving .£200 o r £ 3 ° ° P annum, the reduction may ree r mempresent a difference of .£20 per annum in I think that the difficulty might be overcome by a very simple act of legislation, which would - merely have the effect of carrying out the intention which was held in view took when the holiday rights were granted.",120
1071,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I shall look into the,120

1081,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [7.47]--Immediatel y upon his appointment the Statistician was called upon to inquire into the work which was being done by the States, and also the work which was being done by other Departments of ihe Commonwealth, and to organize his Department on an efficient and economical scale. He has visited all the States in the Union. After the Census and Statistics Act was passed, the States Premiers held a Conference in Sydney, at which they passed a resolution to the effect that the Commonwealth should take over all general statistics, and that each State should confine itself to State statistical work. We then asked the States to define what in their opinion was State work and what was general work. I think New South Wales is the only State which has attempted to make the definition. It suggested that it was highly desirable to have a conference of statisticians presided over by the Commonwealth Statistician, in reduced order that the Commonwealth and the States should realise where they stood, and arrange, if feasible, for co-operation and the practice of economy as far as possible, Staff), and also to secure uniformity in the collection of statistics. The Statistician has made recommendation as to the officers whom he requires. There will shortly be held in alMelbourne a conference of Statisticians, purand then the Commonwealth Statistician be in a position to lay down definitely and completely the work which will be r undertaken by the Commonwealth. The proposal is not to have a statistical branch' in connection with each Department of the n Commonwealth, but to prevent the duplication of work as much as possible, and to have all the work done in one bureau of why is it census statistics.",121
1082,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Has the Minister any idea as to when a publication will be,121
1083,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"-It will not be possible to produce a work before next year, because Statistician is busily engaged in organizing his Department. of Works, Mr MCWILLIAMS - Why is it necessary for nearly all the officers, when appointed, to make a kind of holiday tour?",121
1084,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think the honourable member will admit that it was absolutely essential that the Statistician should visit the States. The Statistician also had to investigate in each State the statistical work which was being done by the Department of Trade and Customs. His visit has been of great value, because it will lead to the adoption of a uniform system. Air. MCWILLIAMS - All that was discussed and decided at the Conference.",121
1085,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I can assure the honourable member that the visit was absolutely essential. Very late in the year the New South Wales Government notified the Commonwealth that they did not intend to continue the publication of Mr Coghlan's book, and, therefore, no item was put on the Estimates for that particular purpose. We have since been informed by the Pre'mier of that State that Mr Coghlan has brought his book up-to-date from information which has been supplied to him, presumably by tihe Statisticians, and will publish it this year, thus completing the series of his works. We propose to assist Mr Coghlan to the extent of taking so many copies of his book, and supplying honourable members of Parliament and the Departments with them, and giving him a grant, as hitherto. When the Statistician gets to work it is proposed to have a Commonwealth annual publication, and also a monthly statistical register, dealing especially with the returns relating to trade, commerce, and shipping. .",122
1086,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Franklin) [7.50] We are getting into a most extraordinary recurring. state of affairs. Immediately the head of a Department is appointed, his first act publication is to make a holiday tour round the States, and to throw away money. The statisticians met in Melbourne, and all matters in regard to statistics and work were thoroughly discussed. The Commonwealth then appointed a Statistician, we - cannot get it at once. and at once it was incumbent upon him make a tour. Either today or tomorrow '.t shall endeavour to get a return of the velling expenses of Commonwealth officers during the present year. I think that the figures are produced they will shock honourable members. When we were asked to sanction the appointment Statistician we were led to believe that there would be a considerable reducTasmanian tion in the work of the States offices. But. according to my information, the work which the Commonwealth republications, quires will necessitate the employment ! an increased staff in some of the States offices. I know that the cost of collecting Statistics in Tasmania will be greater the result of the creation of a Federal Bureau than it was formerly. The promised reduction in the States offices has not been effected. That is not because the States are not willing to reduce their staffs, but because additional' work has been cast upon them by the creation of the Federal Bureau. We are going to an absurd extent in the creation of Federal Departments and highly-paid offices. The time is close at hand, I think, when the Commonwealth will have to cry a halt and prevent the enormous increase in the annual expenditure. It is increasing so rapidly that I feel quite certain the electors will not be prepared to foot the bill. There will be grievous disappointment when it is discovered that the creation of a Federal Bureau of Census and Statistics has resulted, in some cases, in increased expenditure on statistical work in the States offices.",122

1111,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I respectfully submit that I am quite in order in discussing this question. Although there is no vote for the Governor General, there is certainly a vote for a Governor General's establishment ; and it is for us to say whether we agree to an establishment under the present system. The ' CHAIRMAN - The honourable member is quite in order in saying whether or not he is in favour of a Governor General's establishment, but he is not in order in expressing the opinion of the honourable member for Parramatta. M.r. HUTCHISON - I do not propose to express the opinion of the honourable member for Parramatta., because I do not know what the opinion of that honourable member is today. Speaking on the subject of Federation on ist December, 1892, the honourable member, as reported in New South Wales Hansard, vol 6r, page 2386, said It does not follow at all that to have Parliamentary government we must have a Governor General appointed by the authorities in England. . . . It seems to me that the better way to harmonize colonial with Imperial interests would be to allow the people of the Colonies to select a Governor General of their own, who would be in touch with the aspirations of tliose people, who would know what their prejudices and aspirations are, what their conditions of lif e are more intimately and closely by reason of his having lived here a great number of years himself. And this need not necessarily interfere with the government as we know it to exist under the Crown. It would not do so. I venture to say that we should have a little less friction created in the machinery of government if permission were given to the Colonies to elect their own Governor General. At that time. I had some sympathy with the views of the honourable member in this regard, but I am now quite satisfied with the experiment which has been tried, and I think we have reason to be proud of our imported Governors-General. Until something else happens, I hope we shall continue to have imported Governors-General, though I could wish some different plan in regard to the States Mr. JOSEPH COOK [8.17] - I have not the slightest objection to respond to the desire member for Hindmarsh that I should state my views.

1126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There is no quorum present, Mr Chairman. (Quorum form-ed.)",125
1127,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I was under the impression that the last visit of honourable members to various suggested Capital Sites was conducted at the expense of the New South Wales Government. Consequently the item cannot relate to expenditure of that character, and, so far as I am aware, no fresh surveys have been undertaken. To what does the proposed appropriation relate?",125
1128,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is intended to cover expenses which may be incurred during the vear.,125
1129,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not think that we should provide any additional sum to enable honourable members to visit sites which have already been inspected. I am aware that the Prime Minister informed us the other day that, in consequence of a desire on the part of some honourable members to re-visit certain sites in, the Albury district and at Toomaj.. this question could not be finally settled during the current session. But in view of the long hours which we are compelled to sit day after day, I hope that the Government will be able to set apart an. afternoon before the session^ closes for the discussion of it . Surely before we agree to any further expenditure we should know exactly the purpose to which it is to be devoted. In the has absence of that information we should refuse to sanction it. If any money be required to carry out further survey work it can be taken out of the Treasurer's advance account.",125
1130,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Not if this item be 1 struck out.,125
1131,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Whateve r Treasurer may be in power will be compelled to introduce Supply Bills during the progress of next session, and any necessary provision for expenditure, in connection with this vexed question can be made in them. In my judgment the Government are censurable for the apathy iwhich has marked their treatment of it from the very beginning. In New South Wales the matter is regarded in a far more serious light than it is by the representatives of other States and by the members of the Ministry. Certainly it is high time that it was finally disposed of.",125
1132,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If we select Albury, will the honourable member be satisfied?",125
1133,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am not wedded to any particular site. I merely desire to see the most eligible one selected, always provided that it conforms to the spirit of the agreement which was arrived at by the Per-miers' Conference prior to the d r a f t Constitution as amended being submitted to the people. I fail to see why a decision upon this question cannot be arrived at before the close of the session.",125
1134,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Whic h site does the honourable member prefer?,125
1135,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not bind myself to any particular site, but I believe it is now admitted that Mahkoolma or Canberra would be more suitable than Dalgety or Tumut. I am satisfied that the majority of the people of New South Wales would favour the Lyndhurst site. We know that several honourable members voted against Lyndhurst for a particular purpose, and it was not because they thought Dalgety the most suitable site. In view of the new sites which have been suggested, honourable members should now have an opportunity, without going back upon their previous vote, to give expression to the desire of the majority. They might select either Mahkoolma or Canberra.",125
1136,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Mahkoolm a is out of it .,125
1137,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I believe that the majority of honourable members would prel'si'. the selection of Canberra.,125
1138,Mr RONALD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,My impression is that if the selection were left to the New South Wales people it woulcl be Doomsday before it would be made.,126
1139,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not think there would be any trouble in securing unanimity .amongst the people of New South Wales. They are, I think, mainly, desirous that the compact entered into at the Premiers' Conference shall be adhered to as nearly as possible.",126
1140,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I think they would be quite satisfied with Canberra.,126
1141,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I believe they would be prepared to leave the matter to their representatives in the Federal Parliament. I do not know how the members of the Labour Party feel upon this matter, but I think they would all be willing to f all into line with labour representatives from New South Wales if they expressed a desire for the selection of Canberra. that the Minister may give the Committee some information as to what is proposed to be done with the vote of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , to which I have referred. I shall resume my seat.",126
1142,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Oxley) [10.12] - I do not intend to oppose the vote of ,£1,000 submitted in connection with the selection of the site of the Capital of the Commonwealth, but I should like to hear from the Minister of Home Affairs how long this expenditure is to continue. Ever since Federation was accomplished, some vote for this purpose has appeared on the Estimates, and we do not appear to be any nearer to a settlement of the question than we were four or five years ago. time the question was settled. I point out that the provision requiring that the site selected shall not be within 100 miles of Sydney, does not mean that it must be 200 or 300 miles from Sydney, but a reasonable distance beyond the 100-mile limit.. MrGROOM - Armidale , for instance.",126
1143,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I should not object to Armidale. although I consider it would be somewhat beyond the limit.,126
1144,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Did not the honourable member vote for Armidale, and is it not 350 miles from Sydney?",126
1145,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I did, and' so did the honourable member for Maranoa. I did not think there was the slightest chance of Armidale being selected, but it was our duty, as representatives of the northern State, to vote for it.",126
1146,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then the honourable member thinks it is the duty of the Victorian representatives to vote for the site' nearest this State.,126
1147,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"They are able and selfish enough to look after the interests of their own State. I find no fault with them for doing so. The centre of the population of Australia will hereafter be found north of Sydney^ and I think that the Capital should be situated on thetrunk line betwen Sydney and Armidale. We are becoming accustomed to hear of proposals to amend the Constitution, and I should be quite willing to support an amendment tharJ would allow of the Capital being established not in Sydney itself, but within a reasonable distance of it, say, for instance, in the National Park. I have no desire to go into the wilderness, or to see the Commonwealth called upon to incur the expense of constructing a railway through, a desert to the Seat of Government.  think that we could be better off than we are in Victoria?",126
1148,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not think so. If there is one State outside of Queensland that I like better than another it is Victoria, where I landed from the old country forty years ago next month, and resided for some years. Had the Capital been established in Victoria we should have had South Australia and Western Australia on the left, New South Wales and Queensland to the north, and the beautiful island of Tasmania just across the pond to the south. I am prepared, however, to stand by the Constitution, and believe that if one State It is more than another has a right to the Capital' it is New South Wales. The expenditure on the selection of a site should not continue year after year. It is time that the whole question was settled.",126
1149,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Is the Minister prepared to explain how the item of £ 1 , 0 0 0 in regard to the choosing of the Capital is to be expended?",126
1150,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [10.22] - It is desirable that we should have a vote out of which we may meet any further expenses in connection with the establishment of the site. The expenditure last year was reduced to a minimum, and the position will be the same during the current year.",126
1151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Parramatta> [10.24] - I should like to know whether it is true that further correspondence has passed between the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales in regard to the Federal Capital.,126
1152,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I understand that a couple of letters have passed between them.,127
1153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Are we not to .have any information on the subject?,127
1154,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I can obtain the letters.,127
1155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"This is about the last opportunity we shall have during the life of the present Parliament to deal with this question, and we should know exactly what is passing between the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales. Is there any correspondence justifying further delay on the part of the Government? The question is apparently being quietly shelved. If Dalgety is the only alternative to the present condition of affairs, I personally should not be averse to the postponement of the matter. frankly that I would just about as scon - see the Capital established in Melbourne as in Dalgety.",127
1156,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The selection of Melbourne would be cheaper from the point of view of the Commonwealth.,127
1157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It would be as cheap, and in many respects it would be preferable. If Dalgety is to be the final choice, I do not feel particularly anxious to pull up our stakes in Melbourne and to transfer our interests there.",127
1158,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Franklin) [10.29]. - When do the Government intend that the preliminary expenditure in connection with the selection of the site of the Capital sbal I cease? I am not in favour of the selection of Dalgety; but until the deliberate decision - of the Parliament that it shall be the seat of Government is reversed, I fail to see why we should agree to the expenditure of one shilling upon visits to other sites. strongly endorse the opinion expressed by the honourable member for Oxley that the trend of population is northwards. Within a couple of decades there will be an enormous population in northern New .South Wales and on the rich agricultural lands of Queensland, especially along the - east coast, where the rainfall is heavy. The example of Washington,' which for - sixty years was an insignificant town, should be a warning to us not to build a - Capital in. the bush. I should like to see . the question referred to the people of Australia. They should be asked if they favour the removal of the 100. miles limit. If it were struck out the best course to take ..would be to erect a good Parliament House, and the necessary public offices, in one of the big parks of Sydney. The honourable member for Oxley referred to a matter of great importance when he showed that the d r if t of population is unquestionably northward, settlement becoming denser in the northern than in the southern parts of the Continent. The Federal Capital should, of course, be as near as possible to the great centres of business activity. I am averse to spending more money on the visiting of sites. At present we are going about like Japhet in search of a father. No sooner is one place decided upon than another, with which every one is pleased, is visited, and a few weeks later it loses ground, a third site taking its place. Some of the sites which we have been asfked to inspect, such as Mahkoolma, are so obviously unI say suitable that it has been an insult to our intelligence to ask us to visit them, and it is time that we stopped spending money in making visits to desolate bush scenes.",127
1159,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Canobolas) [10.35] - I do not agree with the honourable member for Franklin that money should not be voted for the visiting of sites until the decision in regard' to Dalgety has been reversed. When, as has been recently the case, the Premier of New South Wales asks us to inspect likely localities, we should do him the courtesy of paying attention to his request. At this late stage in the life of this Parliament, I shall not debate the question generally. . I have already expressed my profound disgust at and disapproval of the manner in which it has been treated. The best thing we can do now is to let it stand over until the new Parliament has been chosen. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that Dalgety is the I most undesirable and impossible site in New South Wales, Mahkoolma not excepted.",127
1160,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I should like the Postmaster-General to hear this. There is not a quorum present. [Quorum formed.'],127
1161,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,If the Federal Capital is located at Dalgety those who go there will soon have reason for endorsing my remarks.,127
1162,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Robertson) [10.40] - How is it that the Federal Capital question has not been settled?,127
1163,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Because the New South Wales Government will not allow it to be. Mr STORRER, - This Parliament has settled it.",127
1164,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is not so. New South Wales entered the union upon the condition that the Federal Capital should be located within her territory. Four other States had previously expressed themselves in favour of Federation, but they found it impossible to federate without the State whose population numbers one-third of that of the whole Commonwealth.",128
1165,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW, The honourable member must address himself-to the immediate question.,128
1166,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What I am saying is preliminary to its consideration.,128
1167,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I submit that the honourable member is entitled to show that without New South Wales there would have been no Federation, and, without Federation, expenditure upon a Federal Capital would have been unnecessary. The TEMPORARY "" CHAIRMAN - I tactics rule that that is not the question under consideration. The item is ""expenses in connection with choosing the site of the Capital of the Commonwealth.""",128
1168,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"On a point of order, I wish to submit that the item does not indicate what site is to be chosen, and therefore the whole question",128
1169,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW, cannot allow my ruling to be discussed.,128
1170,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Provisio n is made in the Constitution that a. site for the Federal Capital shall be chosen not less than ioo miles from Sydney. It was first suggested by the Premiers that the capital should be located not less than 80 miles from Sydney, but the right honourable member for Balaclava feared that Moss Vale might be chosen, and the 100-mile limit was adopted. New South Wales desires that the work of choosing a site should be completed. She is tired of paying thousands of pounds every year towards the expenses incurred in Inspecting and reporting upon the sites. She has submitted certain areas within which a. site might be chosen.",128
1171,Mr RONALD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Did she not submit the Dalgety site?,128
1172,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,No. Mr. Oliver merely made a passing reference to that site.,128
1173,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Dalget y was included in the Southern Monaro site.,128
1174,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The site suggested in Southern Monaro was a spot known as Oliver's Hill , fully 60 miles from Dalgety.",128
1175,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I think we should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],128
1176,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Government have not treated New South Wales courteously.,128
1177,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Whic h Government - the Reid-MCLean Ministry ?,128
1178,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The ReidMCLean Government were not long in office, and in any case could not do much the reason that they had a majority of only two behind them,, and could not fly in the face of those honourable members who had banded themselves together to defeat the object of the Constitution.",128
1179,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW, The honourable member must not reflect upon other honourable members.,128
1180,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I had no intention to do so. I was merely referring to certain members who resorted to party to prevent the establishment of the Federal Capital. Why has the Government gone through the farce of arranging for visits of inspection to certain suggested sites ? They had not the slightest intention to take any action during this session, and therefore it was a waste of time and monev to arrange for visits of inspection by a number of honourable members who mav not I be in the next Parliament.",128
1181,Mr RONALD,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member entertains the view that this Parliament has no power to determine the Capital Site.,128
1182,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I say that it has. If the Government wish to shield themselves behind an Act which was passed by this Parliament, why have they not acted upon it? They are simply fooling the people of New South Wales. Only in today's newspapers I noticed a protest by the Premier of New South Wales against the action of this Parliament in accepting his invitation to visit certain sites, and then failing to finally determine the question during the current session. We must re-, collect that he represents a third of the people of the Commonwealth, whose claims we are ignoring and treating with contempt. If the Government will allow us an opportunity to finally dispose of the question before the prorogation, I shall be extremely pleased.",128
1183,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [ n .5] - The position is that the Government were prepared to deal with this question during the current session. But honourable members received an invitation from the New South Wales Government to visit three new sites, namely, Mahkoolma, Canberra, and Lake George, in addition to Dalgety.",128
1184,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They desired honourable members to have a chance of contrasting the merits of Dalgety with those of other sites.,129
1185,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We received that invitation only a few weeks ago-toward s the end of August. Subsequently a communication was received from New South Wales giving us further information in reference to Canberra, and some honourable members also expressed a desire to visit Tumut. It was also stated that, if honourable members so desired, facilities would be afforded them of again visiting Lyndhurst. Had we not accepted the invitation of the New South Wales Government we should very properly have been accused of treating that State with scant courtesy. But, having accepted that invitation, it is impossible at this stage of the session-owin g to the press of other important business-to finally deal with the Capital Site question.",129
1186,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Wentworth) [11.10] - I was very much surprised to learn from the Minister that the invitation of the New South Wales Government to honourable members to visit Dalgety implied that it was prepared to concede that site if we confirmed our previous choice. He should recollect that when the New South Wales Parliament considered what sites should be offered to the Federal Parliament it deliberately eliminated Dalgety from the list. Was it likely that the New South Wales Government would have the temerity to flout the expressed opinion of its own Parliament by again offering the Dalgety site to this Parliament?,129
1187,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I merely said that the vernment invited us to again visit Dalgety. The honourable member himself suggested that they did so with an ulterior motive.,129
1188,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I can assure the Minister that I did no such thing.,129
1189,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then I am sorry that I misunderstood the honourable member.,129
1190,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,T w o of the main essentials in the selection of the Federal Capital should be accessibility and economy of construction.,129
1191,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And water.,129
1192,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think that .water can be obtained in most places, except in Western Australian desert.",129
1193,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member is jeering again. 1 Estimates. 5537,129
1194,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I can assure the Treasurer that I am not. I am sympathizing with him.,129
1195,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not want the honourable member's sympathy.,129
1196,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Dalgety site is the most inaccessible of all those which have been suggested. If we are going to sanction the expenditure of .£1,000 in connection with the Federal Capital, let us choose some other than the wind-swept spot so dear to the - heart of the Postmaster General. I believe that Dalgety is the coldest, most inhospitable, barren, and tree1 less region in New South Wales.",129
1197,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is only beaten by Nimitybelle, which is in the same district.  place, why did the honourable member for Bland go there?",129
1198,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There are seasons in Queensland when the honourable member for Maranoa would gladly seek refuge in an ice chest, but he would not regard it as a fit place in which to spend the whole year. I should like the Minister to explain the item, "" Conveyance of Members of Parliament and others, . £ 9 , 0 0 0 .""",129
1199,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is the usual vote covering the payments to the States railways for carrying members to whom they issue passes. It also covers the cost of conveying honourable members to Western Australia.,129
1200,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the Department give honourable members the option of travelling by steamer to places which are also connected with the railway system?,129
1201,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If honourable members are proceeding to places not connected with the railway system, but which can be reached Goby sea, the steamer fares are allowed; if there are railways to places to which they desire to go they must avail themselves of them.",129
1202,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Unde r the item relating to expenses in connection with the administration of the Electoral Act, I would point out that the discrepancy between the recent police collection of names in New South Wales and that which previously took place is so extraordinary as to make one wonder whether it would not be better to have a permanent staff engaged upon that work.",129
1203,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,- I explained the item some the time ago. A conference of electoral officers is now taking plape. I will make a note of the honourable member's suggestion.,129
1204,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I suppose that parties in England are more highly organized than, in any other part of the world. There the movements of voters from constituency to constituency are carefully marked. That method would be infinitely too expensive for a Government Department to undertake, but there might be an opportunity for a large saving and a more efficient working of the Act if a permanent staff were employed to make these collections. Another question that I wish to put to the Minister is whether it would be possible to arrange, for the satisfaction of the electoral, officials, a test of the efficiency of the voting machines.",130
1205,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The matter is before the Commonwealth Electoral Officer.,130
1206,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Department will not' lose sight of the expediency of making a test.,130
1207,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is so. - Mr KELLY - I should like to know whether the map, towards the cost of compiling which a sum of .£500 appears in this division, is to be merely a technical map for the use of the Department of Home Affairs, or a general one, such as is to be found in the Times Atlas.",130
1208,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The last map of Australia was compiled twenty years ago. That to which the item relates will be the official map of Australia. It will be compiled from the latest official data, and will give the most up-to-date geographical information.",130
1209,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The project is a very excellent one. I should like to know whether the Minister considers that the item of ,£1,000 towards the establishment of a Commonwealth meteorological bureau is adequate ?",130
1210,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,This year we shall incur only the initial expenses.,130
1211,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The item has nothing to do with salaries ?,130
1212,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is so.,130
1213,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think that we have too long delayed the taking over of this important Department, and I trust that the Government are sincere in their desire to establish it on sound lines. As to the item relating to the Seven Colonies, I wish to know whether that publication is being produced in England by Mr Coghlan?",130
1214,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes , and is being revised and brought up-to-date.",130
1215,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Commonwealth is much indebted to Mr Coghlan, and should be exceedingly sorry if we had to do without this excellent compendium of useful and well-compiled statistics. With regard to the £1,500 set down towards meeting the expense of making inquiries and preparing plans for additional lighthouses, I should like to know how many are in contemplation.",130
1216,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Thre e or four.,130
1217,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I hope that the importance of properly lighting the Backstairs Passage will not be overlooked.' Where are the others to be?,130
1218,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"-On e near Wilson's Promontory, on the Glennie Group, one in South Australia, and another in Western Australia.",130
1219,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The lighting of the Barrier Reef should not be overlooked.,130
1220,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Queensland waters are very well lighted.,130
1221,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,There are still some dangerous places.,130
1222,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Lang) [11.35] - I admit the desirability of making inquiries and preparing, plans for additional lighthouses, because some parts of the coast are not too well' lighted. I was glad to hear the Treasurer say in his Budget speech that he intends to obtain expert opinion, as to the best way of improving the lighting of the coast in the interests of the shipping'. At the same time, ,£1,500 seems a large sum to pay for what I take it will be chiefly drafting. I should like some information with regard to the proposal to expend .£500 towards meeting the cost of compiling, a map of Australasia.",130
1223,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The present official map is nearly twenty years old, and it is necessary to bring it up to date. If the work can be done for less, the expenditure will be kept down.",130
1224,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"How is the £21,000 asked for in connection with the administration of the Electoral Act to be spent?",130
1225,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"£10,00 0 is to be spent on rolls, £1,000 on forms, ,£6,000 on the remuneration .of registrars, and the balance in paying returning officers and other officials.",130
1226,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What is to be the date of the election?,130
1227,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am not in a position, to give more definite information than was given by the Prime Minister.",130
1228,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I draw attention to the I state of the House. \Quorum formed.'],130
1229,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I notice that there is .a re-vote of £600 in, connection with the valuation of properties taken over from the States. Why was not the money spent last year ?",131
1230,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It was thought that a conference could be arranged, and the valuation proceeded with, but difficulty was found in getting the States to agree to terms.",131
1231,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Minister's statements in regard to what is proposed to be done about the Federal Capital are vague and unsatisfactory, and before the division is passed I shall move to reduce the item.Expenses in connection with choosing the site of the - Capital of the Commonwealth, j£i,ooo. We know practically nothing as to the reason for the vote and I can only surmise that it is intended to allow the Minister of Trade and Customs to get up another excursion to the Tooma and Welaregang sites, which have already been inspected.",131
1232,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Wilmot) [11.47] I do not see why we should vote £1,000 towards the establishment of a Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau. various States are furnishing excellent weather forecasts, and it would be difficult to improve upon the present system. I should like to know whether it is proposed to take over from the States the - full responsibility of issuing weather forecasts? If so, a vote of from .£10,000 to .£15,000 would be necessary.",131
1233,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [11.49]-- might explain that the proposed vote is intended to cover only the initial expenses. The Meteorology Act has only just been assented to, and we are at present advertising for a meteorologist, who cannot be appointed for some little time. It will be the duty of the newly appointed officer to report as to the organization best suited to Australian conditions, and when the organization of the new department is complete, a larger sum of money will have to be placed on the Estimates for the purpose of bringing the Act into full operation.",131
1234,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Are the States willing that the Commonwealth should take over the work? . Mr GROOM - They desired that we should take over their astronomical and meteorological departments, but the Meteorologv Act made provision only in - regard to ""the transfer of the meteorological departments. Further communications have been entered into, and the Victorian Government agrees that the Commonwealth adopted the right course. We suggested that the States should handover their astronomical work to the Universities, and I know that some of those competent to speak are favourable to that idea. We shall endeavour to co-operate with the States in the most efficient and economical way.",131
1235,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I think we should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],131
1236,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"North Sydney) [11.55] - In passing, I should like to say that I do not consider the present method of conducting business either desirable or necessary. An arrangement 2 might have been made which would have enabled the Government, without resorting to all-night sittings or imposing an undue strain upon honourable members, to carrv out the fullest programme that they could possibly expect to complete by the end of the week. With regard to the proposed vote in connection with the selection of the The Federal Capital Site, I should like to direct attention to the words used by the Prime Minister at the end of the 1903 session. He saidIt is the conviction of ever}' one of us that it is a menace and an injury to legislation to leave the question in its present unsettled state. The sooner it is dealt with the better it will be for every State and for both branches of the Legislature. Its removal from the arena of politics will be of the greatest advantage to the tran1 saction of business. The persistent inquiry and consideration which we have hitherto given to this question will not be desisted from in the future until a final, and I hope early, conclusion has been arrived at. I do not attribute the whole of the blame for the delay to this Parliament, or to the Commonwealth Governmait; but I place some of the responsibility upon the Ministries and Parliaments of New South Wales. Apart from any question of blame, however, I wish to direct attention to the fact that New South Wales would have a right to feel aggrieved if the terms that were arranged at the Premiers Conference were not adhered to. We cannot in all cases arrive at a clear understanding of what is meant by a decision, but in this case clear evidence of the intent is afforded by the memorandum which appears among the papers of the Premiers'"" Conference. It readsIt is considered that the fixing of the site of the Capital is a question which might well be left to the Parliament to decide; but in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South WaleSj the Premiers have modified the clause so that, while the Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city. We can easily imagine what would be the feeling in New South Wales if the terms of that agreement were departed from. would be very unfortunate indeed if any decision on our part were to cut right across the spirit of that memorandum.",131
1237,Mr CHANTEK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"What is meant term ' reasonable distance from that 1 city ""?",132
1238,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"- It means as near to the ioo-mile limit as a good site can be obtained. The people of New South Wales would be justly incensed if any departure were made from the understanding which was then arrived at. Within a reasonable distance of the ioo-mile limit, excellent sites are available. When the Prime Minister spoke upon this question some time ago, he intimated that ifie Government were determined to push it forward during the present session. I do not say that there is not some justification for the non-fulfilment of that promise. But I do hope that in the next Parliament honourable members will recognise the necessity which exists for settling this question in accordance with the understanding to which I have referred. I do not know why it is proposed to appropriate the sum of ,£1,000 which is provided upon these Estimates. It is too small to enable any effective work to be undertaken in connection with the Capital Site.",132
1239,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is quite sufficient to cover the cost of any investigation which may become necessary.,132
1240,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I should also like to draw attention to the proposed expenditure of ^£1,500 in the preparation of plans for additional lighthouses rethis quired on the coast of Australia. We ought to seriously consider what we are doing this connection. In his Budget statement the Treasurer intimated that he intended to make arrangements for the three or four lighthouses. Why should we undertake the erection of some lighthouses, and leave the whole of the others in the hands of the States? . I submit that we ought not to deal with this matter in a meal fashion. The Government propose that we shall incur expenditure without receiving revenue from light dues, which will continue to go to the States.",132
1241,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I desire to call attention to the state of the Committee. {Quorum formed.],132
1242,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why should we erect isolated lighthouses instead of taking over the whole of the lighthouses of the States? It Sir JOHN FORREST - We intend to take over the lighthouses.,132
1243,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The procedure which is being adopted is a most exby the traordinary one. If we are to deal with lighthouses at all, why was not a measure introduced into the Parliament providing for the transfer of the whole of them to the Commonwealth ?",132
1244,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We did obtain leave to introduce a Bill relating to marine iights and marks, but we have not been able to act upon it .",132
1245,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Instea d of exercising Our constitutional powers the Treasurer proposes that we shall expend .£1,500 in preparing plans for additional lighthouses, and that we shall then proceed to erect three or four such buildings.",132
1246,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is a very good theme unon which to argue.,132
1247,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is a perfectly legitimate theme. Of course, the Treasurer would like to submit his Estimates and say to honourable members: "" These are what ,you must accept.""",132
1248,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member should leave it to others to discuss these small matters.,132
1249,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Treasurer, is becoming so restive! that the slightest criticism is sufficient to irritate him. We might just as well propose to erect a building relating to a Department that we had not yet taken over as to contemplate the erection; of lighthouses before we have exercised our Federal power in respect of service. I do not object to the building of certain lighthouses if it be part of in a scheme to take over the whole of the lighthouses and lightships; but it would be unwise to have two authorities controllerection of ing the one service.",132
1250,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is not intended.,132
1251,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The whole matter should be dealt with in one Bill . I do not think there would be any pieceopposition to our taking over the whole system. The Ministry will have to decide how far they are prepared to go, whether they should take over only the ocean lights or the harbour and river as well as the outside lights. The control of the ocean lights is essentially a. Federal matter.",132
1252,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We are dealing lights ? with the matter, but there is a great deal of trouble involved in obtaining the necessary information.",133
1253,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am aware of that, and am not suggesting that this item is excessive. If we are going to deal with three or four of the ocean lights, we should take over the whole of them. If ocean lights alone were taken over by the Commonwealth, it would not be difficult to separate the dues in respect of them from those of the harbour and river lights. I therefore see no reason for delay in this matter. The Government will have to decide to what extent they are prepared to rake over the harbour and river lights, as well as the ocean lights, and the total dues need not necessarily be higher than tliey are at present. In these circumstances, I think the Ministry are to blame for dealing with the service in this piecemeal fashion. We have ample power to take over by proclamation lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys; but it appears that the Government have not yet decided how far they will go - whether they will touch 'the harbour or river lights. Reflections are often cast upon the Commonwealth for the ineffective way in which it proceeds to exercise its powers, and such action as this on the part of the Government is calculated to accentuate the feeling of dissatisfaction. Some of the memliers of the Ministry have been in office almost from the inception of Federation, but yet we have made no progressin this direction. It is proposed to take action in regard to three or four ocean lights, but in the meantime the question of the transfer of lights and lightships generally is to remain, in abeyance.",133
1254,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs'! [12.251 - If honourable member for North Sydney, gives careful consideration to our proposal, will recognise that we are endeavouring, the better. as quicklv as possible, to do that which he himself desires. We agree with honourable member that it is desirable take over the ocean lights as soon as possible. With that obiect in view, the vernment obtained leave to introduce Bill in this House, and part of the general scheme was the placing of this item on Estimates, to provide, not for the construction of lighthouses, but for an investigation.",133
1255,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Of particular,133
1256,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In regard to the more necessary lights, which are generally admitted to be so.",133
1257,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What officer has approved of the erection of these lights ?,133
1258,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No Commonwealth officer has yet approved of them, because as a matter of fact no sum has yet been provided to enable the necessary surveys and investigations to be made. We have power to take over lighthouses and lights by proclamation, and if it be considered practicable and advisable that the power should be exercised during the recess, then side by side with the transfer of lights, there should be an investigation in regard to other lights that are essential to shipping.",133
1259,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,This is putting the cart before the horse.,133
1260,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No ; it is a proposal to put the two matters side by side. This vote will enable us to make surveys, /prepare plans, and have everything in readiness for the construction of the works as soon as the necessary appropriation is agreed to. ' We are all agreed that we should take over the lights, but if this item were not agreed to, there would be a delay of twelve months in carrying out important works.",133
1261,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why should we decide on the erection of certain lights before we have the officers necessary to guide us in this matter ?,133
1262,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"During the recess these matters can form the subject of consultation, and a practical distinction can be drawn between the lights which we should take over, and those which we should not. This item provides for a preliminary investigation. In the interests of shipping we - ought not to remain idle. There should be the no delay in placing one or two lights in position at points that are particularly he dangerous. The sooner we can erect them",133
1263,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the Minister suggest the that we should proceed to put up lights to before we take over the service ?,133
1264,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No : this item of £ 1 , 5 0 0 Gowill ejnable us to send out boats to make a the necessary surveys. Plans may then be prepared, and everything placed in readithe ness so that when next year's Estimates are passed we shall be able to proceed immedithe ately with the work. We have had a B i drafted, and are eager to proceed with The Government are endeavouring to advance the matter as rapidly as possible.",133
1265,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Wide Bay) [12.29] - I think that the Minister has justified the proposed vote. But for his explanation one might have formed the conclusion that this was an attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to become a party to the erection of lighthouses before taking over the whole system. The Government ought not fo - undertake any of these works until we have a well matured scheme for the transfer of the service.,134
1266,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We quite agree with that.,134
1267,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That being so, I no objection to the expenditure of a certain .sum upon necessary investigations. I think that it is better that the Federal Governmerly ment, instead of calling conferences of States officials, should investigation, and inform itself by means of the reports of its own responsible officers. The money will be well spent the Government employ efficient and from that point of view I think the explanation completely satisfactory. - Mr BROWN (Canobolas) [12.32] - I am informed that considerable dissatisfaction exists in regard to the method of paying the New South Wales police who are enhonour gaged in collecting and revising the elecliament, toral rolls. They are compelled to send .vouchers for the' amount of work which do, and are paid accordingly. It sometimes happens, however-and I speak more parthe ticularly"" of country divisions where duty falls upon the mounted police-tha a man sets out intending to devote a whole clay to electoral work, but some police ter"" being brought under his notice, it to be at once taken in. hand, and the other work temporarily laid aside. difficult to satisfactorily account in the vouchers for broken time thus occupied, and consequently the men are often not munerated for work which they have done. I suggest that, instead of paying the police for the time spent in the work of collection, the same principle should be adopted applied to registrars, payment being made according to the number of names collected. I wish for some information regarding the lowered. remuneration to divisional returning officers.",134
1268,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We have increased it . They are to have a grant of £ 2 0 each for [Quorum formed.] work done at the forthcoming election. l l A clear instruction to that effect has been it . issued, so that no mistake can occur. Mr BROWN , - I am glad that this is to be done. An immense amount of work is done by the divisional returning officers. The mere addressing of the envelopes required to send out from 7,000 to 10,000 notices must entail a tremendous expenditure of energy, and in addition to sending out these notices, the officers have manyother duties. For keeping everything running smoothly they receive the magnificent sum of £ 2 6 a year. If the services of officials were not made available, outsiders would not be got to do the work for such a miserable remuneration. The probabilities are that when the Department becomes full y have seized of the amount of work to be done, these officers will be more liberally treated. Dealing with the electoral rolls, it was for the practice to charge 5s. each for divisional rolls, and is. each for pollingmake an independent booth rolls.",134
1269,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The divisional rolls are if now sold f o 2s. 6d., and small pollingr officers, booth rolls for 3d. each.",134
1270,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Thos e charges are more reasonable. In country districts the polling-booth rolls often consist of a single sheet of paper; and, as in the new electorate of Calare, which I hope to have the of representing here in the next Parthere are no fewer than 130 pollin ing places; it would have been very exthey pensive to b u each of the polling-booth v rolls at the old rate. In consequence of high prices formerly charged, very fewthe rolls were sold to the public, although at large number was printed for sale, the result being, that when they became obsolete matthey had to be sent away to the rubbish has heap. With lower charges-and I think the Department could make still further reI t is found ductions with advantage-man y people would purchase rolls to ascertain if their names or the names of their friends aprepeared there.. That would give revenue to the Department, and would assist in making the rolls complete and up-to-date, while there would be less waste paper to cart as is away when new rolls were required.",134
1271,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,There would be a greater demand for the rolls if the prices were,134
1272,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yes .,134
1273,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Cannot we have a quorum ?,134
1274,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am glad that the Minister is disposed to deal reasonably with die question of affording increased facilities to voters. There are two methods by which votes can be recorded by electors who are absent upon the polling day from the division for which they are enrolled. One of these, the postal voting system, is liable to considerable abuse, and is also attended with considerable disadvantages, which detract from its usefulness. I think that the use of postal votes should be restricted as far as possible to those who, owing to sickness or some physical disability, are unable to attend the poll. The other method to which I refer.is that which enables an absent voter to record his vote at a polling place outside the electorate for which he is enrolled. The condition attached to the exercise of the vote under that provision is that the polling place must be presided over either by a divisional returning officer or an assistant returning officer. At the last election very few assistant returning officers were appointed, and the result was that the provision could not be availed of to any large extent. I trust that assistant returning officers will be appointed to preside at all fairly large centres. This method of recording the votes of electors who may be absent from their electorates on the polling day is much to be preferred to the postal voting system. The Q form is intended to be used by. electors wishing to record their votes at polling places in their own division other than those for which they are enrolled. That is a very useful provision, because, otherwise, in many cases, an elector, although, he might be in his own electorate on polling day, would not be able to vote.",135
1275,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Riverina) [12.52] Immediately prior to all elections, a number of electors, who find it necessary to leave their divisions, are unable to obtain postal certificates. I should like to know whether any objection could be urged to allowing such persons to vote at any polling place by using a Q form after they have referred the matter to a divisional returning officer,, and he has ascertained that the names are on the roll, and that all the necessary forms have been complied with.",135
1276,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am afraid that that could not be done without an amendment of the Act, but I shall look into the matter.",135
1277,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Kooyong) [12.54] - I am very glad that the honourable member for Canobolas referred to the question of the' remuneration of electoral officers. I have repeatedly brought this matter under the 1 attention of the Home Affairs Department, and I am pleased that the Minister has seen his way to increase the payment to £20. His predecessors in office are aware that on a former occasion great discontent was caused owing to the non-fulfilment of a promise which was made to the electoral officers, and it is a matter of regret that this grievance should still exist. I earnestly ask the Minister to consider whether he cannot, even now, remove the cause of dissatisfaction.",135
1278,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That matter was fully dealt with by the honourable member for North Sydney when he was in charge of the Department.,135
1279,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Nevertheless , dissatisfaction exists among the officers, because it is ' alleged that an undertaking given to them has never been fulfilled. I think that there has been a breach of faith, and that the feeling of the officers is fully justified.",135
1280,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Commonwealth did a good deal more than honour the promise in some cases.,135
1281,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Many of the officers feel that faith has not been kept with. them.,135
1282,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There was an understanding that they were to receive £,20.",135

1286,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am assured that .£500 will be ample to cover the cost of the work. No official map of Australia has been published for twenty years.,135
1287,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ver y excellent maps are issued by the different States, and, notably, by Queensland. I hope that we shall follow upon the lines of the map which is issued by the Government of that State. With reference to the Seven Colonies, I would point out that a very excellent practice is adopted in Victoria by the Government Statistician, who issues his valuable work in sections so soon as they are completed. The Commonwealth might, with advantage, emulate that example. The practice at present adopted is to wait for the production of the whole work, and thus valuable time is sacrificed.",135
1288,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I will refer the matter the Statistician.,136
1289,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member for Canobolas has referred to the matter the preparation of our electoral rolls, I have no desire to repeat his statements. Nevertheless, it seems to me that a clear intimation might be given to the public through the medium of the press as to the latest date upon winch electors can secure enrolment.",136
1290,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That will be done.,136
1291,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am sure that the Minisagreed ter must agree that the present method of securing enrolment through the police canvass is not satisfactory. In this connection, I should like him to conuntil sider whether, in future, it would not be possible to leave at each household a randum-to be filled up by the head of the family-simila r to that which is when the census is taken. It is absolutely impossible for the police to obtain full information in every instance.",136
1292,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The plan suggested the honourable member would prove almost as costly as the taking of a census.,136
1293,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have gone into the matthe ter very carefully, so far as one electorate is concerned, and I can assure the Minister that the adoption of my suggestion would not involve the large expenditure which anticipates. But, even assuming that would cost a little more than does the prefresh day's work. sent system, I do think that, above everycepts thing else, we should procure pure and complete rolls, which are at of our whole parliamentary system.",136

That appears to me to be a very large expenit. diture to fall upon any one year, and I suggest to the Minister that, in the interare ests of sound financing and of greater formity, it is desirable that, in future, member such amounts should be distributed over three years.",136
1295,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That would involve the creation of trust funds. There is a conmembers stitutional difficulty in the way.,136

The Minister will doubtless recollect that yesterday the of Postmaster-General invited me to obtain and a certain compromise as between the Opposition and the Government concerning the business which, should be transacted before the House adjourned last evening. I eventually succeeded in getting the Opposition to agree to the Postmaster-General's proposal, but, unfortunately, by that time the Prime Minister had decided that the Estimates of an additional Department must be to that evening. The Opposition then offered to pass three divisions of the Estimates upon the understanding that, upon its rising, the House should adjourn half-past two o'clock today, when the consideration of the Defence Estimates memowould be entered upon. But the Government insisted that at least four Departleft ments must be dealt with. The then suggested hour of meeting has now arrived, but the Government have only succeeded in passing the Estimates of, not by three, but only one Department. It will be seen, therefore, that they would have acted more wiselv had they not treated Opposition with such scant courtesy. I now ask the Government whether we cannot arrange to rise at a reasonable hour to-dav if good work is accomplished? he I think we ought to rise at a reasonable it hour, and come back in the morning for a If the Minister acmv proposal, I shall be prepared to do all that I can to facilitate the passing the foundation of the Estimates.",136

1304,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable member say that any statement. I have made is not a fact?,137
1305,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member made only a partial statement of the case. I merely wish to point out that no arrangement could be made to prevent an honourable member from reasonably discussing the Estimates. I am not a believer in all night sittings, but we all know that towards the end of a session extraordinary steps have sometimes to be taken to facilitate the conduct of business.  last general election a promise was made by the then Minister of Home Affairs that a special allowance of ,£20 would be granted to the divisional returning officers in nition of the sendees they rendered on that occasion. I foolishly accepted that promise, believing that the word of a Minister was sacred, but I am sorry to say that the honourable member for Boothby, when holding office as Minister of Home Affairs, went back on that promise. I do not think, however, that he was altogether to blame. An ex-M.inister of Trade and Customs was the man who did the damage during his temporary absence from Melbourne. I have never heard of any other Ministry being guilty of such a mean despicable act. Two successive Ministers of Home Affairs saia that an allowance of £ 2 0 should be granted; but the officials of the Department, with the acquiescence of the Minister of the day, who was, therefore, equally blameworthy, deducted from that amount £ 1 3 in respect of the half-year's salary, to which, under ordinary circumstances, they were entitled. I am sorry to say that this action was taken by a Labour Government. I now wish the Minister to state definitely that, in addition to tfieir regular sum of £ 2 0 . allowance of £ 2 6 per annum, these officers will receive ,£20 for the special services in question.",137
1306,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have already announced that an allowance of £ 2 0 will be granted to divisional officers for conducting future elections.  that the work to be done at future elections is worth a special allowance of .£20, surely the duties carried out by these divisional 1 Estimates. 5545 officers at the last general election, when they had to attend to new and complicated machinery, was worth more than £ 7 . The Government should keep faith with the people.",137
1307,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [2.40] - The complaint mentioned by the honourable member relates to the last general election, and, I understand, was thoroughly investigated by more than one of my predecessors. The promise alleged to have been made by responsible officers ""in one or two States, that a special grant of ,£20 would be given to divisional returning officers, was investigated by the honourable member for North Sydney, then Minister of Home Affairs, who finally said that if evidence of such a promise having been made could be produced, it would be honoured. He subsequently arranged for an all-round grant of ,£10 to each of these offirecogcers, provided they were able to show that they had incurred certain expenditure. I believe that the matter was also investigated by the honourable member for Boothby when Minister of Home Affairs, and that every effort was made to do justice. The honourable member for Canobolas brought the matter before the House.",137
1308,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The matter was brought under the attention of four different Ministers.,137
1309,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Quite so.,137
1310,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,There must have been some pretty strong lying on the part of officials at the time in question.,137
1311,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The responsible Ministers have tried to do justice. After carefully estimating the work done by the divisional returning officers it appeared to me that the ordinary remuneration granted them was not sufficient compensation for the special services rendered by them in conducting an election, and it has been decided that in future they shall receive the additional ( ants receive?",137

1315,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It will not.  to the interjection made just now by the honourable member for Wide Bay, I maysay that I do not ask for the appointment of a Royal Commission to cover his footsteps when Minister of Trade and Customs. If he wishes evidence - in support of the case I have put before the Committee, I can obtain it for him in, five minutes. All I ask is that what happened at the last election' shall not be allowed to happen this time.",138
1316,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Canobolas) [2.46] - The charges made by the honourable member for Maranoa against a previous Minister are not altogether fair. The matter was - first dealt with by the present Treasurer, who was succeeded in the office of Minister of Home Affairs by the honourable member for Boothby. The honourable member for North Sydney followed. He devoted a considerable amount of attention to the case, and it was finally dealt with by the present occupant of the office. The divisional returning officers of New South Wales, and I think of Victoria also, understood from the gentleman then discharging the duties of Chief Electoral Officer, that if the election was carried through successfully they would receive a bonus of £ 2 0 each; but he denied having made that promise.  woulcl have been in writing.",138
1317,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Althoug h shorthand reporters were present, no report was made of the speech in which the promise was understood to occur. However, a divisional returning officer, who was not present at the meeting, wrote to the Chief Electoral Officer for New South Wales, asking to know what the undertaking was, and received the reply that the promise I have referred to was made by the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth.

A Committee of this House reported in favour of these two reforms, and, in the second session of the first Parliament, report was adopted. In the first session the second Parliament, the principle again endorsed by this House, and I pressed upon the Ministry of the day, and succeeding Governments, that something Government. should be done to carry out the doublyexpressed will of honourable members.

Having regard to the foregoing considerations, it was agreed that the question of silver coinage and decimal currency should be one of the subjects to be submitted to the Imperial Conference to meet in London next year, and in the meantime fuller consideration could be given to the question. This House cannot hope 'to establish a decimal system of coinage and coin its own silver, if it leaves this purely local question to the decision of the Imperial Conference in London. There is no hope of the British people adopting decimal currency within a reasonable period, and I do not think that we should postpone indefinitely the reforms which we desire to bring about.",140
1331,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Imperial authorities do not object at all. Mr GB EDWARDS"" - Then why should the matter be referred to them? The fact is that the Government desire to obtain a share of the profits upon silver coinage in Australia without adopting the decimal reforms recommended by the Coinage Committee, and we have to consider whether we should be justified in allowing the Government to adopt one reform, and ignore the larger and more important one. The correspondence shows that the Imperial authorities have all along been quite willing that we should adopt the proposed reform, and that it has never been suggested that we should submit our views to the Imperial Conference. The corremonwealth spondence which was published in 1904 gins with a letter from the then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, who, writing upon the question of the coinage of silver in Australia, statedIt has been reported that the Government of Canada buy silver and pay a fixed charge for its conversion into coin, thus securing the profits between its bullion and currency value. He inquired whether similar consideration Go- could be extended to the Commonwealth. On the 24th June a reply was received to the effect that Canada purchased the silver, I shall and that the Mint charged 3 per cent, for its conversion into coin. Then, in August, the Prime Minister wrote to ask whether the same concession which had been given to Canada could be made to Australia. On the 13th October, 1903, the Imperial Colonial Office wrote, stating that the Imperial Treasury would be prepared to undertake the manufacture of the coins required at ex- one of the Australian branch mints on the basis of the payment by the Commonwealth Government of the actual expenses incurred. I ask honourable members to remember that brief sentence, which practically concedes all that we are asking for. The Colonial Office stated, further, that this course would be preferable to executing the proposed coinage at the Royal Mint in London, as was done in the case of Canada, because the coinage with which they had to deal was as much as they could cope with, and because of considerations of local convenience. The communication continued3. The new subsidiary currency could be coined to any extent which the resources of the mint will allow, either out of existing sterling coins withdrawn from circulation, or out of new silver to be supplied by the Commonwealth Government, within such annual limit of amount as will not occasion such a displacement of the existing currency as would cause inconvenience to other places that use currency. 4. In the event of the latter alternative being adopted, jrreat importance is attached to the restriction of the annual withdrawal of the existing currency to the limit which can conveniently be absorbed elsewhere. This limit is estimated at £100.000 a year. .5. If a decimal system of coinage is adopted, n.s recommended by the Commonwealth Select Committee, the immediate withdrawal of the half-crown and threepence would presumably be necessary; and, in that case, to meet the convenience of the Commonwealth, favourable consideration will be given to any suggestions which mav be made for arrantrin? f "" an immediate o r withdrawal of these two coins, subject to the safeguard indicated above."" It was further stated that the Comshould undertake the responbesibility of making good the deterioration of the gold coin circulating in Australia. Honourable members will see that that is almost a complete reply to the inquiries which we made. It conceded almost all that we had hoped to attain. It presented no obstacles to the introduction of the change immediately. The right honourable member for Balaclava, in a memorandum to the Prime Minister, dated 3rd April, 1904- a memorandum in which he reviewed the question up to that date, thus concludedIn my opinion the following course should be adopted :1. As to gold coinage, the present practice should be discontinued, but if the Commonmittee wealth receives a profit on the coinage of it should bear the expense of replacing gold issues circulating in Australia, which should be distinctly marked for the purpose. 2. As to silver coinage, the London should coin for the 'Commonwealth at cost, out of the profits the Commonwealth should the expense of replacing worn coins of issues, such future issues to be distinctly marked, as in the case of gold coins. It is here that the new position is here that the Commonwealth Government cease to ask the British Government to help us to institute decimal coinage. Upon the 13th April, the present Prime Minister been wrote to the Imperial authorities, and, exsidered, cept that; he again! requested that coins should be minted in London instead of in Australia, he asked merely for what had already been offered, and for the withrecently drawal of ,£200,000 annually instead of ,£100,000, which the British Government had offered. The objection which he adfavour mitted had been raised to the course recommended by the Coinage Committee emanated almost exclusively from the mint authorities in Australia. As these are only practical objections which have been urged against the recommendations of the Committee, I intend briefly to refer them. The objections were based upon quite erroneous ideas, as recent travels conclusively proved. In the first place, the mint authorities declared required that it would be impossible to coin the two metals in the same room of the same mint, and it was impossible to use the same macould chines. I may add that during my recent £100,000 a year. visit to Switzerland, France, England, fornia, and other countries. I found two metals were being used in mint, and in connection with the iSame machines. The mint authorities further stated that it would require a considerable amount of machinery to carry out this work in the of British mints in Australia. They affirmed that the silver would have to be coined at a different room from that in which gold coinage was undertaken. They arrived at the conclusion that -^21,000 would require to be expended for new machinery, besides a considerable amount for additional buildings. The calculation which I have made shows that about £50,000 or £60,000 would thoroughly equip a mint which would be capable of turning out all the silver that Australia requires. But such an institution would not be able to provide our first supply of silver coins. Consequently, the Coinage Comreported in favour of obtainsilver, ing those coins from Great Britain. future My own view is that after we have obtained our first supplv-seein g that we Mint have silver in the country-w e ought to and coin our own money in Australia, and that bear we should be able to do so for much less future than the amount suggested by the mint officials. In paragraph 6 of the despatch to which I have referred, the present arises. It Prime Minister saysIn the opinion of this Government, such an arrangement might well continue until it has decided to adopt the decimal system. When that event happens the Question might be reconand if found to be necessary, fresh the arrangements could then be made. Clearly he is responsible for the change in the character of the application which has been made to the Imperial authorities. In the first instance, it was stated that the Coinage Committee had decided in of the adoption of a system of decimal coinage, and the Imperial authorities were asked to assist us in minting our first supply of coins, and were requested to out the line the terms upon which they were willing to do so. They agreed to meet us upon all points. In reply to the last letter of to the honourable and learned gentleman, the Treasury of Great Britain wrote upon the the result of my 30th July, 1904As it now appears that the new silver coin is estimated at not more than £60,000, though we are prepared to allow the work to be undertaken in London at cost, we not consent to withdrawal of more than CaliI f we only required £60,000, I do not see the why an offer should be made to withdraw the same anything. The writer addsIt may be, however, that the question of the withdrawal of the existing circulation is of less importance than it appeared to be when the subject was before the Treasury in the autumn last year. My Lords then understood that the Commonwealth Government had in view the immediate introduction of the coinage system, such as was recommended by the Select Committee in 1902. But from paragraph 6 of the memorandum now under consideration it appears - that such is not the present intention. Lords have no information as to the details of - the currency system proposed for adoption. Assuming, however, that the purpose is to introduce a currency of denominations corresponding to those of the existing coinage, but of distinctive Australian design, there would be sity for the adoption of any special measures for rapid withdrawal. Then on 20th October, 1904, the right honourable member for East Sydney wroteMinisters think it is not expedient to await - the introduction of the decimal system before entering upon the new arrangements which have been proposed. As the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are of opinion that it would be desirable that the coins for Australian use should be of special design, and not differentiated from the Imperial tokens by a mere mint mark, I shall be glad if the mint authorities in England can be asked to undertake the preparation of the special designs without delay, so that the new coinage may be commenced as early as possible. Honourable members will see that what we are committed to in this correspondence is an effort to secure from the Imperial authorities a share of the large profit which is derivable from the coinage of silver, without any change in our currency system ? When this letter was published, I drew attention to that fact with a view to preventing any such arrangement being concluded with the Imperial authorities, and thus postponing the adoption of the decimal coinage system perhaps for ever. The House recognised that the stand which I took was the correct one, and the right honourable member for East Sydney, who was then Prime Minister, agreed that nothing should be done. He did not seem to understand the question until Parliament had an opportunity of considering the report. I inferred from his observations that he had no idea that this House had adopted the report of the Coinage Committee in favour of decimal coinage. But when it was pointed out to him that upon two occasions it had declared itself in favour of that system, he intimated that he would stay his hand in the matter until the Government were afforded time during the recess to consider the position, and to decide vvhether or not they would give effect to the recommendations of the Committee. Later on, the present Treasurer visited England. All that he contemplated was to enter into a conference with Mr G. B. Edwards. other Imperial representatives, with a view to ascertaining whether anything could be done in the direction of securing decimal coinage for the whole British Empire, and My insuring that the profits derived should be distributed - pro rata amongst the various portions of the Empire. As any such movement is bound to come to nought, I fear that unless fresh action be taken the period no neces- when we shall adopt the reform ourselves will be still further postponed. I do not wish to see that. This is a matter on which we do not need to consult the Secretary of State for the Colonies. It is a question whichi Australia can decide for herself. If there was the slightest possibility that England would adopt the decimal system, we could well afford, for the sake of securing uniformity, to postpone the reform for a year or two. We know, however, that she is notlikely to do so. If the Government hold that the decimal system has nothing to recommend it, and will say straight out that they are determined to take no action, we shall know what to do. But I object to the drift which is going on. We are losing all the profits and benefits that would Bow from the adoption of such a system. Whilst abroad I inquired into this question, and learned that other parts of the British Dominions are more anxious than we are to secure the profit to be derived from the coinage of silver. Canada, owing to its contiguity to the United States, adopted the monetary system of that country-the dollar and the cent. By reason of its being the smaller country of the two, it was also led to adopt the silver money of the States, which has always been current there. As far back as 1870, however, the Canadians arrived at the conclusion that this was not the best system to pursue, and began to export the American money, with a view to replacing it by Canadian currency. In 1870 Canada sent to New York $3,128,000, and to England $1,417,000 of American currency. She replaced that money by Canadian currency, coined in the British Royal Mint, paying 3 per cent, over the cost of the si IT ver used in the silver coinage and 10 per cent, over the cost of the metal contained in the copper coinage. As a Federation, she was able to secure this great concession as far back as 1870, although the individual Colonies of Australia found it impossible to do so. The controversy in regard to this question in Australia ranged over a period of thirteen or fourteen years, and, finally, the Imperial authorities said that as federation shortly be accomplished, the question might well be postponed so that the that Commonwealth Government would be able to do all that the separate Colonies re1a special quired.

I have obtained from Mr. Canadian Minister of Finance, figures showing that, from 1870 until three years ago, Canada found it unnecessary to make any further exports of United States silver. In 1903, however., arrangements were made with the Canadian Banking Association to collect the United States £ 4 4 , 6 6 6. silver current in the Dominion, and to ship it to the Bank of Montreal's agents in New York, where it was paid to the credit of the Treasurer.

We could arrange to pay be the banks a small percentage as well as the interest, and the cost of sending the present coinage to some other part of the world acwhere silver is required.

Money Fielding, flows from the United States into Canada and cannot be rejected, since a refusal would lead to a restriction of her trade with the States. Last year Canada's profit on her coinage of silver was $55,000 - equa l to ,£11,500; but in one year she has made as great a profit as $200,000, or The Select Committee estimated that the profit to be derived by Australia from a new silver coinage would be about .£35,000 per annum, and. judging by his the experience of Canada, I think we may that that estimate is likely to prove Canada has not only a silver currency as we have, but a large paper what currency of small denomination which to a certain extent displaces silver. She now arranged with the Imperial auto establish a mint in the Dominion. The necessary buildings are now being erected at Ottawa for the coinage, not only of gold, which has not hitherto This Imperial institution will be similar to one of the branch mints in the Commonwealth. where The Canadian Government has to advance to the Master of the Mint a certain sum of money for a start, and accounts The Canadian Act goes on to provide that all the profits derivable from the mint after discharge of its undertakings and obligations are to be handed over to the CanaSince 1870 Canada has to minted 90,000,000 dollars, or £1,825,000, The new mint to cost £ 8 0 . 0 0 0, or something as like the amount which the authorities here say will have to be expended in making the necessary alterations to the existing mint to provide for the coining of silver in Australia. The experience of Canada is valuable to us, since it is similar in many respects to Australia, and is also a British dependency. I desire, however, to point to the experience of the Philippines. The American authorities there were met with a more complicated problem than that with which we are faced. When they took over the Philippines, they found that the local currency was not only bad, but a very mixed one. If the contention of the Treasurer, that it is desirable that we should have a uniform system of currency throughout the Empire, were correct, one would think that the United States would have compelled the Philippines to adopt the dollar and cent system. According to the second annual report of the Master of the Division upon that currency, however, a different system was adopted in the Philippines-the system of the peso, which is worth about half-a-dollar, and the centavo. port sets forth thatThe Government's net profit on the coinage of Philippine currency from bullion purchased was estimated at P2,72o,342.5g. If we deduct from this sum the estimated net loss on the re-coinage we arrive at a net seigniorage profit of P2,50o,i40.2g on the entire process of coinage and re-coinage up to ist July, 1905. This profit in British currency would be equal to £250,118. It is derived, not only from the coinage of new metal,, but the re-coinage of depreciated currency upon which, an actual loss is made. Prior to the introduction of this reform, Mexican dollars, Spanish dollars, Philippine dollars, and American clipped and worn dollars were in currency in the Philippines. The new system, which has given satisfaction, and is producing a very considerable profit, as I have said, differs in some respects from the currency of the United States. These facts show that it should be easy for us to bring about this reform. They demonstrate very clearly that it is not necessary that the new system should be intimatelv related with the monetary system of the governing country, and that there is a considerable profit to be derived from the coinage of silver. I desire now to place before honourable members a few facts which I gathered in Switzerland as to the system in force there. Switzerland has a smaller population than has the Commonwealth, and we may naturally suppose Mr G. B. Edwards. that it uses less money per head of the population than is required for the purposes of Australian trade. Then, again, she has a considerable paper system, and, as a member of the Latin Monetary Union, allows the coinage of France, Spain, Italy, and one or two smaller Powers to be circulated there. For a number of years, however, she has had a mint in operation, and for a few years has been exclusively minting her own money, and making a very handsome profit. The mint at Berne employs thirteen hands in money-making and it has five men and three women manufacturing the stamps used for inland revenue and postal purposes. The total amount paid in wages was £1,500 a year. With this limited provision they were able to turn out 148,135,000 francs, or J£5 -555J - If we eliminate the gold, we 000 have left 3,562,500 francs, or £1,993,500 in silver, so that Switzerland requires about the same amount of silver currency as the Committee reported would be required by Australia. In addiThe re- tion, she uses paper money of small denomination, and the coins of the surrounding countries, so that the Committee's estimate of £2,000,000 as the sum required for silver currency in Australia is almost sure to be exceeded. Herr Adrian estimates that this is the total currency of silver, because none of this coinage has been withdrawn. I believe that few of the francs are much worn, but, on the whole, the Swiss silver currency is in a good state of preservation, because it has been minted largely within the last seven or eight years. In six years1900 to 1905-the profits obtained by the Swiss amounted to 4,952,000 francs, equal to £30,646 per annum. That is the sum which, the Committee reported would be made by the Commonwealth if it coined its own currency. As Switzerland, whose population and requirements are more limited than ours, makes that profit, Australia, could at least do-as well. This saving is paid into a reserve fund which totals £431,000, and is earning interest at a rate of 3^ per cent. The Committee recommended that any saving made here should be similarly treated. The old mint has now been found too small, and not sufficiently modern, and a new mint has been built, where it is proposed to mint coins, and on the upper storv to print not only stamps, but also. I believe, the notes which are to be issued by the Government National Bank, which is ultimately to become the sole bank of issue in Switzerland. This building was erected at a total cost of ^41,250, including all the extra material and plant required to make its equipment up to date. We cannot expect that Australian institutions will rival in economy those of Switzerland. The low rates of pay given to responsible departmental officers there are marvellous. We cannot hope to operate a mint and pay only £'1,500 a year in wages. But a building similar to the new Swiss mint would meet our requirements, and need cost very little more than the Swiss mint has cost. Seeing how little would have to be expended in buildings and plant, I think that we should coin our own money. I do not think that we could make a start by ourselves, but, seeing that we require only about ,£60,000 a year, the sooner we begin to turn out coins of our own, with the special designations required by the new system, the better it will be. In the first instance, some arrangement must be made with the Imperial Government for the supply of coins, and the English currency can be safely taken up by degrees, and used elsewhere. If Great Britain will agree to only ,£100,000 a year being taken up, let us commence with that. Let us then mint decimal coins to that value, and move, year by year, nearer the realization of our hope. The Imperial authorities have taken it upon themselves to advise that there are difficulties in this matter. According to them, confusion will be caused by the use of two currencies. But the present twoshilling piece can still remain, being called a florin or a dollar. A shilling would be a half-florin, or a half-dollar, and therefore it would not be difficult to make the change without withdrawing all coins of the present system. The only difficulty would arise from the fact that we should have to discharge immediately threepenny pieces and halfcrowns, which do not f all into the new system. The highest silver coin would be the florin, and we should have to substitute for the threepenny bit and our present copper coins, new coins of the lower denominations suggested by the Committee. These changes should be made at once, or as soon as the people become habituated to the proposal. There is no reason why we should put off the adoption of the change until the decimal system is adopted by the whole Empire. I am a member of the Decimal Association of Great Britain, the secretary of which assures me that there is no prospect of this reform being even properly advocated for some years to come.",143
1336,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,How could we bring it into work?,145
1337,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We have done nothing for the last three years. It will take at least four years after a decision has been come to to get anything done, because the people must have timely notice. The Decimal Association is using all its efforts to bring about the introduction cf the metric system, and this reform is one that it would be well for the proposed Conference to consider, for it would be almost impossible for us to adopt a system of weights and measures which has not been' adopted by the rest of the Empire. It would be a good thing if we could induce the people of Great Britain to adopt decimal coinage; but, in any case, it is desirable that we should adopt it . That it is not necessary for us to have the same system as that of Great Britain has been shown by the experience of other countries. Canada, and France, which both do a large trade with Great Britain, have a different coinage. The Philippines recently started to reform their coinage under the guidance of the United States of America.",145

1339,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The old coinage was worth only its weight, and has nearly all been bought out. This limits the profits made in the Philippines, because they have to take old and, in some cases, impaired coins; but, with all disadvantages, the profits made by the Philippines is shown to amount to ,£250,000 in two years, after providing for replacing the debased coinage now in existence. Every fact; speaks in favour of the reform, but the difficulty is to get the Government to understand, or even to take an interest in, the subject. No Federal Government seems to have understood it, and it has not been .given a fair trial. If Ministers make up their minds that we are not to have it, we must go without h\ and get what profits we can from the coinage of silver by arrangement with Great Britain. Sir JOHN 'FORREST - We are going to do that.",145
1340,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I ask the Minister to consider whether the country is not in favour of the adoption of the decimal system. If it is, we should try to bring it about Mr ""MALONEY (Melbourne) [3.58] - I should like the Government to take over the coinage of silver. At the present time, we coin gold at a loss. Example is worth an ocean of talk. I hold in my hand an English coin whose weight is a trifle heavier than the 5s - piece, and of better alloy. The difference I take to be the profit Great Britain makes by the coinage of silver here. Silver is now 2s. 7d. an ounce.",145
1341,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"When the Committee reported, silver was is. iod. an ounce.",146
1342,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"An ounce of silver will coin five shillings and sixpence, so that the rest is profit. To say that one coin bearing the King's head is worth more than another coin is ridiculous. The facts show that Great Britain makes a great deal of profit from the silver coinage. I am in favour of constructing a railway across the Commonwealth. If the Government were wise enough to buy ,£1.000,000 of silver and coin it, there would be a profit of £1,150,000, which would go a long way towards building that railway, or towards constructing a Federal Capital. I hope that the Treasurer will take hold of this question, and request the Home authorities to give us the right to issue silver coins. I do not think that it will be refused. The justice of the request could not be ignored. The silken bonds of kinship must be strengthened by kindlv acts and justice. trust that the Treasurer will pay attention to this question, and that he will also give his serious consideration to the suggestions of the honourable member for Brisbane with regard to the issue of paper currency.",146
1343,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"North Sydney) [4.1]- I should like to say a word or two in support of the remarks of the honourable member for South Sydney. The Treasurer must realise that the Ministry will have to declare whether or not they are favourable to the adoption of a decimal system of coinage. He seems to have been swaved by the reasons given in England against the adoption of the decimal system . in the United Kingdom. But I would point out that the same difficulties do not exist here as in the old country. A decimal system of coinage would be undoubtedly superior to that now in existence amongst us, because the operations of business men would be facilitated, and instruction in our schools would be rendered much more easy. It seems absurd to suppose that, because Great Britain is reluctant to adopt a decimal system of coinage we should hesitate to adopt a.desirable reform. If we are to make the change, the longer we postpone it the greater our difficulty will become. It is not necessary that Great Britain should join with us in the adoption of a decimal coinage system, but it is in the highest degree desirable that she should join us in the adoption of a metric system of weights and measures.",146
1344,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am afraid that the adoption of the metric system would give a great shock to the mercantile community.,146
1345,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Not at all. The change would be a great improvement, and would be much appreciated by business men. I am sorry that the Treasurer could not see his way to support the adoption of decimal coinage.",146
1346,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Imperial Conference is so close at hand that it is reasonable to allow the matter to stand in abeyance for the present.,146
1347,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not anticipate any result from that Conference so far as decimal coinage is concerned. But the adoption of a metric system of .weights and measures is decidedly a matter for consultation between the representatives of I different parts of the Empire, because our transactions with the mother country and British Possessions are so extensive that the adoption of different systems of weights and measures would lead to much inconvenience and confusion. Britain is being driven to the adoption of the metric system by the advance made by other countries in the production of machinery. One or two British manufacturers have already been put to the expense of adopting double plants for the manufacture of machinery upon the British system of measures, and the metric system respectively. The Treasurer quotes the objections urged in Great Britain against the adoption of the decimal system. He saysIn addition to the foregoing considerationsThese relate to the withdrawal from circulation of the present silver coinage, and the necessity of Australia undertaking to mainclasses, tain her portion of the gold coinageis the question as to whether the establishment a penny is now paid. of a different silver currency might not be direction of widening rather than tightening bonds of Umpire. What has that to do with the question? Canada has a currency different from that of the mother country, and it cannot be one moment urged that it has had an influwards ence in the direction of widening the bonds of Empire. The dependencies of Great as Britain have the most heterogenous collecwere tion of coinages that can well be conceived, and yet the bonds of Empire have not been in the slightest degree affected, nor is there difficulty in interchange. The case might be different if we were situated alongside of Great Britain, and had only a borderpenny, line separating us. The report continuesSuch a currency would require very careful watching to avoid its being either depreciated by reason of an excess issue of silver, or the out the world and a recognised value. public being inconvenienced through an inadehope quate quantity being in circulation. Surely the 'Government of Australia, which has had so many important powers conficulties ferred upon it, could be trusted to see that there was not an over-issue, or an inadeas. quate issue, of silver coins.",146
1348,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The difficulty referred to is experienced in India.,147
1349,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Canad a very has experienced no difficulty. Those who have the direction of affairs in British munities always look to the soundness the currency, and the Commonwealth vernment might very well be trusted to obwealth. serve the same caution that has been exerbeen cised in Great Britain and Canada. We are told, furtherThere woulcl appear to be no likelihood United Kingdom establishing a decimal in the near future. Probably that is correct., because there enormous difficulties in bringing about a reform in a country like Great Britain. The general opinion expressed was effect that any interference with the value of the £1,344,586. people's penny would lead to widespread dissatisfaction and resentment. I entirely disagree with that view, because the proposal made by the Coinage Comnote mittee, and which was adopted by this merit attaches House, was that an alteration should be a public utility. made in the value of the penny to the tent of only 4 per cent. It was proposed that the penny should be of 4 per cent, less value than the coin now in circulation, and it was considered that this change would be in the interests of the poorer who would be able with the new coin to purchase a great many articles for which They would"" thus in the gain 4 per cent, in every case where the the new penny would have the same purchasing, power as the old one. In order to show the absurdity of the statement made by the Treasurer, I would point out that Great for Britain has proceeded part of the way to the adoption of a decimal system by using the florin. That coin was to be used a standard for a decimal system, if such adopted, and it would thus be necessary to alter the value of the penny to some slight extent. It would be absolutely impossible for Great Britain to adopt a decimal system of coinage without changing the value of either the sovereign or the and there can be no question that it would be far less inconvenient to change the value of the lower coin than that of the higher.one, which has a currency throughI that if the Treasurer remains in office he will give his serious attention to this question. As I have pointed out, our difwill increase, rather than diminish, time goes on and our business and population increase. We should make .all haste to bring about a most desirable reform.",147

According to the Treasurer's Budget, the notes in circulation in all the States total £ 3 , 2 7 0 , 1 9 5 . be recognised, therefore, that the proposal that the Commonwealth should adopt a similar system to the Queensland Treasury note issue would confer upon us a greater measure of advantage in this connection than we at present enjoy. I need scarcely point out that Queensland possesses only about one-seventh of the population of the other five States, whereas its Treasury notes in circulation represent more than one-third of the paper money in use throughout the other five States of the Commonwealth. Just a word as to the revenue which is produced in the various States by the bank-note issue. In Victoria the duty upon bank notes produces £[16,443 annually, and in New South Wales it yields a net revenue of £ 2 6 , 6 4 0 annually, whilst in Queensland the revenue returned is £ 2 2 , 9 4 6 per annum. In the last-named State the expenses incurred in connection with the note issue amount to only ,£1,851. Queensland thus a clear profit from it of £ 2 1 , 0 9 5 . In addition to that, Queensland uses the gold received in excess of the 25 per cent, reserve held against the £1,344,586 worth of Treasury notes which are in circulation for the purpose of repurchasing her bonds, thereby saving interest upon them. Federation has already been established for five years, and it is a great pity that we have not attempted to do anything in the way of obtaining our own paper money issue. I trust that the time is not far distant when we shall take some steps in that direction.",147

But even if I agreed with everything that they have said, the matter is riot so urgent as to make it inadvisable to defer taking action untilafter the Imperial Conference has been held. I have no doubt whatever that great good will result from that Conference. So far as I can gather, the British Government have no desire to do anything which is not approved by this Parliament.

1352,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"West Sydney) [4.28] I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to a matter of some importance. The officers of the Public Service Association attached to the Customs House, in Sydney, are, so I am informed, subjected to an influence which amounts to nothing more nor less than a modified reign of terror. I have alreadv made private representations to the Minister in respect of this matter, and I now propose to supply some details, which I ask him to notice, because I can conceive of nothing more improper and odious than that members of the Public Service should be terrorized and prevented from accepting positions on such a body as the. council of the Public Service Association. I am told that certain members of the Public Service could not have secured increments in the Customs Department while they remaned on the council. I am prepared 'at a -""Hi to give the Minister the names of these men, or, for that matter, to mention them now.",148
1353,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Would it not well to publish the name of the man who makes such a statement?,149
1354,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Any honourable ber mav see the statement that I . have before me. The charge is a very serious one. I do not know whether it is true; I am acting simply as the mouthpiece of of the service. the complainants. I am informed, for instance, that an officer, on resigning the Trades and Customs Association, received an increment of £ 2 5 , after being notified by the Collector that he must leave it. the council of the association or crement. The statement before me sets forth thatThis officer, probably smarting under Hint his fellow officers remaining on the treated him with coolness after his resignation, made a clean breast of the allair to his fellow clerks. He told them that he was informed by the Collector that as long as he remained on the council he was not to be granted an increment. Another man resigned from gation ? the council, and, according to this statementreceived £ 2 ^ increment, which passed him over the heads of his seniors by many years. A third man resigned from the council, and received an increment of £ 4 0 over the heads of his seniors. Still another manafter being warned personally by the Collector that he "" stood in the line of fire,"" subsequently resigned from the council, and has now been recommended for an increment. Then, again, it is said that a transferee from Victoria decided not to stand for election on the council, pleading as his son that "" he had a wife and family consider."" Thie Collector informed him that he was surprised that a man of intelligence should have anything to do with the council. I have quoted five definite statement's to the effect that tice of the Collector not to recommend for an increment any person who is on the council of the association. If that - can be proved, the Collector should not remain another week in office, and if Minister is standing behind that officer in this matter, the same remark may be applied to him. The honourable gentleman must not. regard this as a laughing matter. It is a most serious thing that the rights which an inhave inquired into them. dividual enjoys under the law should taken from him at the will of some person dressed in a little brief authority. be Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The honourable and learned member must not forget that the Public Service Commissioner would have to membe a party to such proceedings.",149

1374,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If they sign statutory declarations, I shall be glad to have the fullest inquiry.",150
1375,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Lang) [4.45] - I have no doubt that the Minister will cause an. inquiry to be made into the statements contained in the document from which the honourable member for West Sydney quoted. Of course, in a large Department like the Customs, there are always anomalies and conditions which create irritation and discontent; but, from my. knowledge of the New South Wales Collector, I should say that, so fax from being a tyrant, he is a man of kindly disposition, and takes the greatest interest in the welfare of his officers. Of course, he has also to keep in mind the interests of the public, by studying economy. Scores of complaints come to me from one source and another which I would never think of bringing before the Committee; but there are two or three grievances which the officers of this Department wish to have voiced to which I think attention should be given by the Minister or by the Public.Service Commissioner. I wish to draw attention to the anomalies I will not still existing in the Customs and Postal Departments of the Commonwealth Public Service. It is now some years since the Public Service Commissioner and his officers in the various States submitted to this Parliament a list of the officers and the salaries allotted to them, which gave great dissatisfaction to a large number of the staffs, a fact borne out at the time by the number of appeals. I am speaking for the State which I represent, though possibly the same anomalies exist in other States as exist in New South Wales today, and they, could, and should, be - remedied.' At the time of the regrading, I fully recognised the stupendous task of the Commissioner, and was willing to make allowances for shortcomings, but I think enough time has elapsed to allow of the service being put on a sound footing, and . that the amount of genuine dissatisfaction which exists today should not prevail. The information imparted to me is not only from the aggrieved officers, but from men grown old in the service who are in receipt of ' fairly large salaries-£[30 0 to £ 4 0 0 a year-and who, in a few years, will, by the age limitation, be retiring from the service. I They are men who have worked themselves from the lowest rung of the ladder to the responsible positions they hold today. One thing to which I wish to draw attention is the number of officers who are on salaries that are termed "" between grades,"" and. who have been in that position for a long period. From .£185 per annum to £ 2 8 5 is one grade, from ,£285 to ,£335 another, and so on. "" ^ 3 6 0 , ^ 3 8 5 , ^ 4 1 0 , "" are the progressive rates of increase. But a number of officers on ,£200, should be getting £ 2 1 0 ; officers getting £ 2 2 0 , or £ 2 2 5 , 0 1 £ 3 ° > should be receiving , £ 2 3 5 ; and 2 officers receiving £ 2 4 0 , £ 2 5 0 , & c , should be receiving .£260, and so on in various grades. As I mentioned in a former speech, in view of the excess of revenue derived from Customs and Excise, the Treasurer ' should place an amount on the Estimates to allow of the Commissioner amending these anomalies, as the provision at present on the Estimates is insufficient. I also desire to draw attention to the increases given to the lower-paid officers in the service. Take the Customs examining officer's branch. I will not refer to a salary exceeding £ 2 8 5 per annum, which is paid to third class examining officers. I find a number of officers who are termed assistant examining officers in receipt of salaries ranging from £ 1 8 5 to £ 2 4 0 per annum. Now, in a number of cases, there are officers in this grade who do exactlv the same class of work as examining officers, third class, with the same responsibility. They are in every essential, capable, good officers, with length of service and ability to recommend them. I am not speaking of young officers new to the position, who have yet their spurs to win, but of old and experienced men who seem to be entitled to more consideration than has been meted out to them in the past. To use a military phrase, if it is necessary for some to "" mark time,"" it should apply to the higher-paid officials, and not to the lower grade, with a view to giving a fairer and more equitable distribution of increments. Again, when a vacancy occurs by death or otherwise, at a salary of, say, £ 2 6 0 per annum, an officer will be appointed to it from, say, the £ 2 3 5 grade, providing, of course, his qualifications are suitable. The Commissioner does not then put all the eligible officers up one step. Some apparently extraordinary anomalies exist in connection with the Fidelity Guarantee Fund. For instance, I am informed that two officers, one in receipt of a salary of £ 2 8 5 per annum, and the other in receipt of a salary of £ 1 8 3 . each pav 12s. 6d. to the fund, and that two other officers, one in receipt of £ 2 0 0 . and the other in receipt of £ 1 1 0 , each pay 7s. 6d. are anomalies that I should like the Minister to explain. Then, too, how is it that an officer receiving £.185 Is required to pay 12s. 66.. when an officer receiving £ 2 0 0 pays only 7s. 6d. ? There may, of course, be good and sufficient reasons for these discrepancies, but I should like to hear the Minister's explanation in regard to the matter. Possibly the payments to the fund are determined by the amount of monev for which each officer is responsible. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the remuneration paid in the Excise branch. The chief inspector of New South Wales was originally graded at £ 3 6 0 per annum. That salary was increased to £ 3 8 0 , and he now receives £ 4 2 0 , which, I think, is not too high for so ""important a post. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. BATCHELOR) - The honourable member canother not deal with items in detail.",150
1376,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I wish, to say all that I have to say in regard to the Department in one speech.",151
1377,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,-Do I understand that it is the desire of the Committee that the divisions of this Department be put en bloc t,151
1378,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yes . Honourable members will still be able to speak on any subject to which they wish to direct attention.,151
1379,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No doubt that course would facilitate the passing of the Estimates. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN - If no objection is raised, it can be taken.",151
1380,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In view of the onerous duties which the officer referred to has to perform, his salary is not too high. I think, however, that many of the lockers and other subordinate officers are entitled to more liberal treatment. I believe that one locker receives a salary of £ 2 0 0 per annum, but that the majority of them receive ,£160 per annum. These officers are very frequently put in positions of trust, involving heavy financial responsibility. The British-Australian Tobacco Companypay Excise duty to the amount of £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, and the locker in charge of their factory in Svdney is paid £ 1 6 0 per annum, and has an assistant at £ 1 2 0 per annum. Then again, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company pay: Excise duty amounting to £1.40,000 per annum, and yet the locker at their refinerv in Sydney receives a salary of £ 1 6 0 , and"" has an assistant at a Those salarv of ,£120. I think that, whenever possible, officers capable of discharging such highlv responsible duties should be promoted, and that their salaries should be increased. I would ask the Minister to bring this matter under the notice of the Collector of Customs in New South Wales, and request him to look into it. I have not the slightest doubt that any recommendations made by the Collector will receive due attention, because it is recognised that at all times he endeavours to do his best for the Commonwealth, and for the officers under his charge. With reference to the cases referred ""to by the honourable member for West Svdney,"" I think they ought, if dubattested before a justice of the peace or a Commissioner for Affidavits, to be investigated by an independent tribunal. But I do not think it is fair to make charges against the Collector of Customs, or anv responsible official, under cover of privilege, on the mere unsupported assertions of persons who feel themselves aggrieved. A Departmental Board, for obvious reasons, is not the most satisfactory form of inquiry to elicit the truth. Any inquiry, to be satisfactory, must be conducted by an impartial and unprejudiced tribunal.",151
1381,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Canobolas) [5.7] - I wish to make a few remarks with reference to the case referred to by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney. I am not acquainted with any of the officials concerned, and therefore I can speak disinterestedly. I know that there is a very strong feeling on the part of some officers who exercise control over large bodies of men against any combined action on the part of their "" subordinates. I think that that attitude of mind is a most unreasonable one. If the controlling officers only knew it, unity of action on the part of large bodies of employees frequently leads to the ready disposal of trivial complaints, and facilitates the settlement of disputes and the redress of real grievances. Some officers have a quite unreasonable dread of combinations among those under their control. Mr Richardson, a prominent officer in the Railways Department in Syd-' ney, recently testified to the great assistance which he received from the employees' organization, and bore testimony to the good feeling that existed between the higher officials and the great body of employees owing to the readiness with which grievances brought forward by the union could be remedied and the service as a whole placed upon a satisfactory footing. I trust that the Minister will take prompt action if he finds any prejudice manifested in the direction I have indicated by his principal 'officers, and that he will at once establish the right of the men to combine for the purposes of bringing their grievances before those in authority. Some high officials look upon any man who advocates union and combination among his fellow employees as an element of danger which must be removed, even though injustice may be done.",152
1382,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Hindmarsh) [5.1+]. - I wish to call attention to a glaring injustice which is being perpetrated in the Customs Department. When we appointed the Public Service Commissioner and his staff of inspectors, we understood that the public servants would be classified and paid according to the value of the work they performed. According to a return furnished last year, the Department of the Public Service Commissionerhas involved the 'Commonwealth in an outlay of £[60,000 within less than five years, and I would ask honourable members to consider what return we have obtained for that large outlay. The conditions of the Public Service are full of anomalies, and irritation and discontent are rife among the officers.",152
1383,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Would the honourable member be in favour of a return to political control ?,152
1384,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Certainl y I would. What does political control amount to? It merely means that any honourable member is in a position to see that no injustice is done to any public servant. I now wish to show what has happened under the regime of the'Public Service Commissioner, In the Excise Department of South Australia there are fifteen inspectors of the fourth class. I need scarcely remind honourable members that South Australia is the largest distilling and wine-making State in the Commonwealth. But although the Public Service Commissioner was supposed to classify the officers of our Commonwealth service in accordance with the value of the work which they performed, I find that the grossest anomalies still exist. This will be readilv appreciated by a reference to the following table, which shows the number of inspectors of the fourth class of the Commonwealth service, together with the total and average salary paid to them on the 1st January of the present year:No. of 4th State. Class Total Salaries. Averairu Inspectors. Salaries. £ £ New South Wales ... 10 2,305 230 Victoria ... 20 5,125 250 Queensland 10 2,200 220 Western Australia 5 1,125 225 South Australia 15 2,905 104 In other words, for performing precisely the same work the officers in South Australia receive £ 1 0 0 a year less than do those of other States.  smaller salaries now than they were prior to Federation?",152
1385,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Their salaries have not been increased. Some have received no increments during past two years. I have also had prepared a statement showing the number of in the clerical spectors in each subdivision of the fourth class in various States on the 1st January last. It reads as follows: Sul>rii\'isional N.S.W. Vic. Q'lanrl. WA.

States'do not ""take down"" the Government as they do in South Australia^",153
1386,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Thes e officers are employed by the Commonwealth, and not by South Australia. I am astonished^ that the honourable member should make such a stupid statement. If he had found that the officers in Queensland were being treated as badly as they are in my own State, I should have been the first to go to his assistance.  ber of the South Australian Parliament, Mr Tucker.",153
1387,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I never like to comment upon a case which is sub judice. Such a course of action is very reprehensible, and ought not to be tolerated. I believe that the Acting Collector of Customs must have recommended these poorly-paid officials for increments.  ister to lay the report of the sub-collector upon the table of the House?",153
1388,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is a very good suggestion, and I thank the honor[191] able member for it . Only two officers in South Australia have received increments during the past year, and one was bound to receive his under the law. Section of them 23, sub-section 2, of the Commonwealth the Public Service Act readsAn officer may be promoted within a class in division from one sub-division thereof to another, whether there is or is nor a vacancy in the sub-division to which the promotion is made. It will thus be seen that an officer who is doing his work well is eligible for proS.A. motion, irrespective of whether there is a vacancy or not. I shall have to enter a different sort of protest against the administration of the Public Service Commissioner if these anomalies are permitted .1 1 3 3 i i to continue. I feel strongly upon these glaring injustices, and I hope that the Minister will remedy them at the earliest pos1 5 2 1 3 ""2 1 i1 sible moment. 1",153
1389,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Barrier) [5.29] - I feel 1 11 somewhat dissatisfied that a promise which 5 15 was made by the Minister has not been carried out. Some time ago the House unanimously agreed . to a motion which I submitted, providing that all patent and proprietary medicines imported into Australia should bear labels showing their component parts. A few days ago I put a question to the Minister as to what action was being taken to give effect to that resolution, and received a reply containing so many technical terms that the honourable gentleman did not think it was worthwhile reading it to the House. I gather from that statement that the Department is taking steps to ascertain the proportion of poison contained in certain patent medicines ; but my desire, and that of those who supported the motion, is that something more should be done. Action should be taken to require the component parts of patent medicines that are absolutely valueless to be shown on the labels in order that the public may know what they are buying. The Minister said that he had power to take action under the Commerce Act, but I notice that although the motion was passed at the beginning of August last, patent and proprietary medicines are still being sold without being labelled in the way we desire. I hope that the Minister will take action to give effect to that part of the resolution with which he declared himself in sympathy. It has been pointed out to me that it would be impossible to give effect to one part of the resolution, but there is nothing to prevent the Minister taking action in the direction I have indicated.",153
1390,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Wi'de Bay) [5.35]-- I wish to congratulate the Minister of Trade and Customs on the fact that he has been able to allay the spirit of rebellion evidenced by the mercantile community of New South Wales by transferring on frequent occasions part of his administrative staff, and also by making frequent visits himself, to the city of the beautiful harbour. I would ask whether he is prepared to further inconvenience himself by making his. administration of the Department still more perambulatory, and visiting the capitals of all the' States. As New South Wales, with characteristic modesty, has demanded that - part - of the administrative work of the Department shall be conducted in Sydney, I fail to see why the remaining States capitals should not have an occasional visit from the honourable gentleman and his staff. Such visits by the Minister, who has become known, by many titles, to the people all over Australia, might do much to remove antiFederal feeling. . Mr WATKINS (Newcastle) [5.37] - A number of men who have recently entered the Customs service complain that uniforms have not yet been distributed amongst them, and that as they have frequently to do night duty on the wharfs, the wearing of civilian's clothes does not tend to the efficient discharge of their duties. They are not recognised. by outsiders as Customs officials, and when on inight duty are liable to insult and assault. I hope that the Minister will see that the uniforms are supplied. Sir WILLIAM. LYNE (Hume-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [5.38.] - I think that the representations made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh as to the treatment of the Excise officers in South Australia are absolutely wrong.",154
1391,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I have quoted figures in support of my case.,154
1392,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Immediately after the honourable member spoke, I communicated by telephone with the Public Service Commissioner, and in reply received a message stating that the Excise officers in South Australia have been exceptionally well treated, and have been promoted as far as the Public Service Act will allow. To give them further increases would be to inflict an injustice on many officers. The men in question are receiving far more than they would have received under the State law, and Mr MCLachlan considers that they have no cause of complaint. That is the statement. I have received in answer to my inquiry. I am also advised that the reason why these men do not receive as high a salary as that paid to officers in Victoria is that the latter are very much senior in service to the South Australian officers, the average length of service in Victoria being twenty-three years, and in South Australia only fifteen. These facts, which I have received from the Public Service Commissioner will, I hope, prove satisfactory to the honourable jnember. In reply to the honourable member for Barrier, I may' say that I have had an opportunity to consult Mr Lockyer, the Collector of Customs in Sydney, who attends to the administration of that part of the Commerce Act and the regulations which relate to the point referred to. The matter is now under consideration, and a proclamation will shortly be issued in re- gard to the labelling of injurious medicines. Section 16, in the Commerce Act, however, renders it necessary for' us to proceed very carefully. It provides thatThe regulations ' under sections seven and eleven of this Act shall not prescribe a trade description which discloses trade secrets of manufacture or preparation, unless, in the opinion of the Governor General, the disclosure is necessary for the protection of the health or welfare of the public. The proclamation will require that patent medicines shall bear labels showing their component parts in all cases where such a precaution is necessary for the protection of the public. But I cannot compel the ingredients to be stated on the labels in' every case.",154
1393,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Minister may prohibit the introduction of goods that are not so labelled as to indicate their constituent parts.,154
1394,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I shall require patent medicines to be so labelled unless the description would divulge a trade secret that ought not to be made public.,154
1395,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,But if it is necessary in the interests of public health the honourable gentleman may demand that the component part of these medicines shall be made public.,155
1396,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If objection were taken to a demand that the component parts of a medicine that was not harmful should be placed on the labels, I could not do anything in the direction desired by the honourable member if it would involve the disclosure of a trade secret. I intend, however, as far as pos,sible, to meet his request, and I am quite sure that the action I shall take will ""prove satisfactory to him. As to the request made by the honourable member for Newcastle, I may say that the Collector of Customs for New South Wales is present, and that I shall instruct him to make the necessary inquiries. Every officer shall be treated alike. I come now to the complaint made by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, that the Collector has prevented officers in the Customs Department from acting on the council of an association. I told the honourable and learned member, by way of interjection, that I had already inquired into some, if not all the cases to which he referred, and that, so far as I was able to ascertain, there was no foundation for the charge. If , however, these officers will make a statutory^ declaration, £61.755; I shall cause a full inquiry to be made. The Collector of Customs in New South Wales says that the whole statement is incorrect. I repeat, however, that if these officers will make' a statement to which I can bind them-if they will make an affidavit- I shall be prepared to take action. If they do not substantiate their case, their offence will be visited upon them. They have no right to make such a charge unless they are prepared to prove it. If they substantiate their gations, some one will have to suffer; if they do not, they themselves will suffer. I am prepared to have the most complete and searching inquiry into the allegation that, as members of the council of an association, certain officers had no hope of securing increments.",155
1397,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Hindmarsh) [5.45]. - I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply. It may be satisfactory, so far as it concerns officers who do not possess a [191]- 2 long term of service, but many of the South Australian officials whose cases haw been' under, review have been in the service as long as, if not longer than, the Victorian officials, and are doing equally if not more important work, although their remuneration is less. It was supposed that the Public Service Commissioner would classify the Departments with a view to paying every one according to the value of the work he was performing. As I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation, I intend to ask for a comparative return, giving the names of Victorian and South Australian .officers, together with the length of their service, and the salaries which they receive. I hope that the Minister will issue the instruction that men are not to be prevented from organizing for purely legitimate purposes. I and other honourable members would support him in objecting to organizations which were not legitimate, but the men are at present forced to combine because they are not allowed to interview Members of Parliament with a view to getting their grievances remedied.

1398,Mr DEAKI N,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ballarat - Minister of External Affairs) [5.47] - I rise to make a plain business statement of the position allein which the Commonwealth is placed in relation to the vital issue of defence. Few, if any, questions are more important. Probably none would admit of more expansive treatment, or reference to a greater variety of grave topics. But my desire is to avoid, except by implication, more than a reference to any of them. From davs long prior to Federation until now, military and naval authorities - have contributed various valuable reports on the subject, and since the Union a series of memoranda by experts and committees of standing has been put before us, of which, I assume, honourable members have a general knowledge. There must be serious omissions in my statement, or else it would be intolerably prolonged, could I not assume a general familiarity on the part of members with the recorded opinions and comments with which, from time to time, we have been supplied. is to connect them or their main features in a short and simple story. This will better qualify a consideration of the Estimates of the Defence Department standing that they were before the report of the Defence Committee was received, and therefore before the detailed criticism of the application of those recommendations to our circumstances had been made by committees of our own officers. I propose at the outset to quote a few general figures-to supply a sort of standard by which we may measure our duties in this connection. Australia has a population somewhat exceeding 4,000,000 persons, a quite inadequate garrison for so vast an estate. Our prosperity, by every statistical test which can be applied, is extremely high. A great and a rich country needs good defences. Our people possess a sea trade whose annual value has been estimated at about £[95,000,000. This is borne in vessels annually aggregating 7,000,000 tons, and ,£125,000,000. The somewhat speculative estimate of the Statist is that the private wealth of Australia, which, excludes the public lands and State - owned railways, £[1:,000.000,000. Consequently, we have' a vast territory and immense wealth to defend. The circumstances of the mother country cast upon her the obligation of paying for defence about £30,000,000 upon her Army, and about £[33,000,000 cn her Navy. A proportionate expenditure on our part would be between £5,000,000 a""d £6,000,000, whereas our proposed expenditure for this year is £[585,000 on the Military Forces, and £ 2 5 3 , 0 0 0 on Naval Defences, with something additional for supplies of material.",155
1399,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Is the Naval Subsidy included in the £[253,000? Mr Deakin.",156
1400,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes . We are therefore providing for our defence at a cost proportionately far less than that which the mother country considers necessary to maintain her dominion of the seas. I have not time to glance at the changing circumstances in the world at large, suggesting possible dangers which should spur us to action of a decided character. Let me My desire merely premise by re-stating our universally accepted principle that our aims do not imply aggression, nor yet militarism, but us for the discharge of our obligation to preserve this country, so far as we have the power, notwithfor those who will come after us, and for prepared the Empire. We desire to maintain our Imperial self-dependence, our freedom, our institutions, and the innumerable privileges which these confer by methods which shall make no greater demand upon the community than is essential to our safety. This great Continent, offering abundant opportunities for settlement, and enormous stores of undeveloped wealth, is a. prize worthy of great sacrifices by any power cherishing ambitious designs of breaking the limits of its capacity of growth. Personally, I also place a high value upon defence preparations as a necessary and most useful, part of the education of our young people. I hope to see the day when the acquirement of efficiency in our Defence Forces will be a patriotic duty accepted by all citizens as valued at naturally as the preparation for their ordinary callings, so that our Defence Forces will be to our young manhood an indispensable continuation school. The value of physical training, discipline, and capacity approaches for united action, together with the increased self-respect and sense of self-dependence which come from martial exercises, are to be prized in all. The military training of the past sought to mould men into machines, but that now in vogue among the most advanced nations relies on the courage, enterprise, and judgment of the individual sailor or soldier, and regards his capacity to adapt himself to the needs of the situation as the greatest asset in the hour of need.",156
1401,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It makes a patriot of the soldier. ' Mr DEAKIN - A true patriot, enabling him to make his patriotism a power. I do not present our defence proposals, even as such, as a mere recourse to tooth and claw; to me they are an essential part of the training of manhood, and a recognition of one of the first duties of citizenship. We rely upon two arms- a citizen soldiery, the demands upon whose time are reduced to the minimum compatiBTe with efficiency, and our Naval Forces, whose service calls for a longer devotion to duty. The task of devising a complete scheme which will harmonize our defence by land and sea, sufficient for probable emergencies, has not yet been satisfactorily accomplished. No complete scheme has yet been formulated, although different aspects of defence have been effectively treated on more than one occasion. Now that we are in possession of the general report of the Imperial Defence Committee, and the local applications of it by Committees of our officers, we are in a better position than we have ever before occupied to elaborate such a scheme. Under it we can supply our deficiencies, and proceed upon an even course of development, in accordance with well-thought out general plans.",156
1402,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Is the Government scheme the adoption of the Imperial Defence Committee's report?,157
1403,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"O u r local officers have furnished suggestions in regard to that report-som e for additions, others for amendments, others for the application of the proposals to our local circumstances. While preparing a complete policy, it is not to be supposed that we have been acting without a guide. We have not had the complete and harmonious proposals desired, but we have had a policy which, though it has varied during the history of the Commonwealth, - has been gradually taking a fixed shape. The simple duty that devolves upon me owing to the fact that the Estimates are presented in this House, instead of in the other Chamber-wher e the Minister of Defence would have been charged with a responsibility that I would have willingly left to him-is to show how our present policv has been developing by degrees, to recall our first steps when Federation was established, indicating the direction in which we are travelling, and the object at which we are aiming. It is possible for me to present only the most general view of the situation. Much, too, will remain to be done before we finally decide exactly at what rate, and in what manner, we shall apply our policy, which this Parliament, or its successor, is now called upon to adopt with more definiteness than has hitherto been the case. In this connection, we shall be faced from the first step to the last by financial considerations, which must govern this as well as every other matter of business that comes before this House. These are now assuming far greater importance than they have ever done before. Speaking colloquially, there have been three periods in the development of our defences. The first commenced on March 1st, 1901, when the States Forces were taken over, and a settled regime was established on the arrival of the first General Officer Commanding, Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, in February, 1902. What we may call the General Officer Commanding system was in operation, until November, 1904. That marks the first period. Then came a second period, beginning with the establishment of the Council of Defence on the 17th of November, 1904, and extending until the 4th of July last year. This period was occupied in the preliminary work inseparable from the introduction of the new method of control. From July of last year, to September of the present year, we have been busy obtaining from Great Britain and from our own officers the materials upon which our new system of defence is to be based. I venture to think that we are now at the beginning of a third period, when a complete and harmonious scheme can, owing to our having at last a sufficient knowledge of the facts, be undertaken with effectiveness. The first period showed a very slight transition from the svstems previously in force in the seve : ral States. In 1899, for instance, the expenditure upon the defence systems of the States amounted to a little short of £1,000,000. At that time the naval subsidy was only one-half of the amount now being paid. Allowing for the extra subsidy of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , our expenditure during the current vear will be practically the same as that incurred in the year when we assumed control of the several forces of the States. The following is a statement showing proportion of expenditure in each STATEMENT showing Appropriation and Expenditure Forces, and Military Forces for the diture for 1906-7.

This last amount cannot be compared with the actual expenditure of previous years, but should properly be contrasted with the Estimates for those periods.",157
1404,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Commonwealth has multiplied the expenditure in Tasmania three times, and yet has only half the number of men formerlv under arms.",158
1405,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is because Tasmania deliberately cut down her outlay, and postponed necessary changes, because the Commonwealth was about to be established.",158

1409,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"During the first period to which I have referred, we adopted practically the same system that had previously obtained in the States, but upon a somewhat larger scale. The Naval Forces were of little importance, and during the first Federal period were ignored to a still further degree. Our forces were practically the the Naval and Military Forces from 1901year upon until the present time: on Central Administration, Naval: years 1901-2 to 1905-6, and Estimated Expen1901-2. 1002-3. 1903-4. 1904-5. 1905-0. 1906-7. c as 0 £ ,0 of .2 s ,g - 03 of 1 fc. 0 - u S .1 <e J3 .rt 3 ja 1 -3 'E - *5 5. 11 'ii _.""5 a 3 P. £ 1£ a. g -3 B B a. 0.

During the first year,, the' expenditure, as I have stated, amounted to .£605,311. In addition to that, Major General Sir Edward Hutton recommended, and this Parliament approved of a scheme, setting apart a special capital sum for the purchase of defence material amounting, in the first instance, to £ 4 8 6 , 0 0 0 , increased in 1904-5 to £524,000 . If was proposed to spread this expenditure over a series of years, and the whole amount has net yet been exhausted. The form of the forces and their members were all inherited from the States. Provision had been made by them for military defence, ' with a small complement of harbour defences. Under the Commonwealth these forces were organized and unified, but were altered very little in character beyond the degree necessary for those purposes. One great change was made. Under the States control, the expenditure upon forts and military material was often charged n> loan account, whereas under the Commonwealth the whole expenditure has been charged against the revenue of the j'ear. Our second period under the Council of Defence, which commenced in 1904, has been one of incubation. The first Minister,, the honourable and learned member for Corinella, was engaged in considering schemes for additional expenditure, approaching £1,000,000, upon war material in order to bring our forces into a state; ft of efficiency. In the speech which the honourable and learned member delivered in 1905, he indicated that items amounting to ^£800,000 were then under review. His proposals, although they were under serious consideration, were not adopted.",158
1410,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I stated that it would require another £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 to complete our - defence equipment.",159
1411,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes ; in addition to £ 3 1 3 , 0 0 0 remaining unexpended of the amount set apart by Major-General Sir Edward Hutton. In 1905, the present Minister of Defence, reaping the fruits of the labours of the previous Administration, obtained additional information from his officers, which he presented to Parliament. He estimated that an expenditure of nearly .£4,000,000 would have to be incurred in order to provide for a naval equipment, roughly speaking, upon the same scale as the Military Defence Forces, and involving an annual expenditure on the latter at least as large as that previously proposed. The conflict which then existed between our naval and military advisers was accentuated by a' report of the Colonial Defence Committee, which was brieflv summarized by the Naval Director, Captain Creswell, as follows: The opinions expressed in the memorandum involved the abolition of all naval organization and naval effort of any kind by Australia, other than contribution to the Imperial fleet.",159
1412,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That contribution was to be in both men and money.,159
1413,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Minister was confronted by , the recommendations of the Colonial Defence Committee, absolutely opposed to the schemes which his naval advisers were laying before him. In addition, there was a considerable divergence of opinion on the military side as to the expenditure necessary for us to incur in providing for fixed defences. We had a dozen different types of guns- a most undesirable condition of affairs-and it was absolutely necessary to reduce the number. It then became a question as to which type should be preferred, and that involved other considerations of importance. Under these circumstances, it appeared to the Government that, before taking any definite step forward, it was imperative to obtain fuller advice, not simply from the Colonial Defence Committee, but from the Imperial Defence Committee, the highest authority in the British Empire. After some unavoidable delay, the report of the Imperial Defence Committee has been received, and, if we were to set aside its great value, in so far as it relates to our general proposals, and to concentrate our attention only on the criticisms which it offers upon our fixed defences, we should be more than amplv repaid for the time that we have had to wait for it. We have in that report, parts of which must, in the very the nature of things, remain to some extent confidential, a review of our fortifications, together with' recommendations as to the manner in which they must be dealt with in order to be rendered efficient. In regard to our fixed defences, we now have the best obtainable authority for reducing the expenditure proposed to us by our local advisers by no less a sum than .£330,000. That great saving, which can now be made with confidence, seeing that it is recommended on such unimpeachable authority, would have been contemplated with great anxietv if we had been called upon to consider it in the teeth of the advice tendered to us by our local experts. I do not suggest that the advice of the local experts was not sound. But through the Imperial Defence Committee we come into touch with the latest defence doctrines and developments, and are specially warned against attempting to make provision too far in advance. We are told that we may safelv content ourselves with a smaller ambit of protection, and with, apparently, less powerful, but equally effective, means of defence for our coastal forts.",159
1414,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is advised because the forts must be re-armed everv ten years.,159
1415,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Exactly . The attitude in regard to the Naval Forces of the Commonwealth remains practically unaltered. The Imperial Defence Committee, on the last page of their report, tell us that the value of any vessels we had for local defences was never great. They go on to say that the Colonial Defence Committee have hitherto hesitated to recommend the extinction of the local Naval Forces. They then proceed to urge that the best and, indeed, the only necessary naval defence for Australia can be provided by the Admiralty increasing the number of its own ships, which may be manned and officered by Australians, but which will be included in the Royal Navy. This means that what is ordinarily called "" blue water ' ' defence is to suffice for Australia, and that there is no necessity for undertaking harbordefence otf a floating character. What the Imperial Defence Committee foresee as a possibility of war is a raid of three or four unarmoured cruisers upon our shores. In their opinion that can be provided against - by the Imperial Squadron. This view, of course, does not agree with the opinion of our first General Officer Commanding who, in 1903, pointed out thatAs long as the supremacy of the sea is in the hands of the Royal Navy, no serious attack upon Australia upon a large scale may be considered as practicable. In this regard little attention need be paid to the temporary and local effect of a raid of one or two of an enemy's ships upon one or other of the undefended ports. It would, however, be the height of folly to disregard the possibility of the supremacy of the sea being temporarily or permanently lost. The Imperial Defence Committee consider that the possibility of the supremacy of the sea being temporarily or permanently lost by Great Britain mav be set aside, since to provide against it woulcl involve a greater expense than would be justified by results. This report of this Committee reached our hands amonth ago. The reports of the local Committees reached us only a few days ago. Consequently, we have only had an opportunity to consider them in their general bearing on our defences as a whole.",159
1416,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Thes e Estimates merely "" carry on "" Estimates.",160
1417,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But there are also tain developments already in progress to which. I shall refer in a moment, by which we have been broadening the policy that previously prevailed. I do not propose to weary honourable members with a criticism of reports which are already in their hands, and, therefore, content myself with a reference to paragraph 5 of our Military Committee's report, which deserves special attention. That paragraph statesOn the assumption that the Military Forces the Commonwealth are to be of substantially the same strength and cost as at present, Committee submit the - following as the most same ammunition as suitable, organization and allotment into and Garrison Forces respectively for such forces in accordance with the Minister's instructions, keeping in view the report of the Imperial fence Committee, with which they agree, except as hereinafter mentioned. So that, in perusing this military report, honourable members must recall that they are reading advice tendered to us under the very important assumption that substantially the same strength, cost, and character of defence that has hitherto prevailed is to be continued.",160
1418,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The permanent forces seem to have been weakened very considerably.,160
1419,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The estimated expenditure for the current year is £[41,000 more than was the actual expenditure of last year. Of this sum, "" cadets "" absorb £[15,000, and the militia £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . . The present Estimates represent a continuation and the broadening of the policy which had previously been followed, whilst the report of our Military Committee adopts that system as the basis of any recommendation which it makes. What I mean by the ""broadening"" system may be best illustrated by calling attention to the progress which has been made during the past twelve months-that is to say, from30th June, 1905, to 30th, June last. During that period the permanent forces have increased from 1,276 to 1,356; the militia from 14,506 to 15,252; and the volunteers from 4,694 to 5,333; or from 20.476 to 21,941. During the same period the cadets have increased from 10,000 to 23,000, of whom 3,000 are senior cadets. Since 1st July, 1905, the rifle clubs have increased from' 30,242 to 37,082. The rifles in our possession in 1905 numbered 35,900, 8,000 are now under order, and we are making provision for 10,000 more, are though we have not yet received those which have already been ordered, on account of certhe rapiditv. with which alterations are being made by the War Office.",160
1420,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Was the money sent to England ?,160
1421,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The money for the first consignment was sent to England. There will be over 54,000 rifles in the Commonwealth when the number provided for. on the Estimates is obtained, without reckoning 26,000 Martini-Enfield rifles, single-loaders, which are not of regarded as up-to-date, but which are the quite serviceable, and which use the magazine rifles. Field The senior cadets and about 20 per cent, of the junior cadets will be provided with De- .303 rifles, the remainder of the cadets will be armed with Westley-Richards and Francotte rifles, of which there are approximately 7,300 on issue and in hand, 3,4°° ordered, and 5,300 more proposed to be ordered this vear. When Federation was accomplished, the average of rounds per rifle in stock was 200. Provision on this year's Estimates will bring the average up to 700 rounds per rifle, which is regarded as the minimum which should be available. In regard to. field guns, twenty-four of the latest pattern field artillery guns - 18-pounder quick firers-arrive d this year, with 474 rounds per gun.

1429,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Royal Australian Artillery - is to be left as it is. Those who look at the first column of the table will see given, as far as can be given in this way, the scheme proposed by Major General Hutton when General Officer Commanding. In the next column, we come to the stage reached under the Council of Defence of 1904-5, with the different proposals for expanding and altering that scheme in some particulars. The third column shows the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee lately received, while in the fourth column we have the recommendations made by the local officers after the receipt of that Committee's scheme. The last column is best interpreted by an examination of the three columns preceding it .",162
1430,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable learned member said that the Imperial Defence Committee's report was a harmonized report. How can the two reports of the local Committees harmonize like the original single report?,162
1431,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Imperial Defence Committee's report is harmonized by the obliteration of our proposals for floating defences for coastal and harbour purposes.,162
1432,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I agree with the honourable and learned member.,162
1433,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is, therefore, a harmonious scheme. That is dealt with, first of all, by our military officers, in regard to fixed defences and our general military organization. These reports, cept so far as locality may require, vary but slightly from those of the Imperial Defence Committee. It - is only when we come to the third part, the recommendations of our naval officers, that we find a wide departure. I am still dealing, however, with the military alone. This table is intended to present in as simple a form as possible, and in bold outline, the variations that have been made upon the first scheme of the General Officer Commanding in 1903. That scheme in itself was largely derived from the previously existing States schemes. Despite the blanks which have to occur in the columns, I think that, when read in connection with the reports, this table furnishes a kind of - key to the progress and changes that have been made. I shall not dwell upon it > it seems to me to speak for itself. The value of the Imperial Defence Committee's report is clearly indicated there. Turning from the military side to the recommendations of the naval officers of the Commonwealth, we find a marked departure from the Imperial Defence Committee's report. That departure does not date from the recommendations of the naval officers. Turning to a speech on the Naval Agreement Bill , delivered on 22nd Julyj 1903, by Sir Edmund Barton. thenPrime Minister of the Commonwealth, and reported in Hansard, page 2436, I find that the right honourable gentleman said I have already indicated that it would be very welcome to me if Parliament wouldagree to provide a somewhat better measure of harbour and coastal defence. I take it that such a measure is to be found either in the employment of first-class torpedo boats or destroyers, or any other means of offensive defence. Then, summing up the position, he saysand It is well lo bear in mind that there are two lines of defence before we come to the actual employment of our land forces as distinct from those attached to our fortifications. First, there is the navy, and then the combined coastal and harbour defences. Again, at page. 2437, he is reported to have said I am prepared, therefore, to lay it down that nothing in this agreement that we wish to enforce shall be deemed to affect any purely Australian naval defence force or purely Australian ships or armament that we maintain for harbour and .coast defence purposes. I am prepared, also to see it laid down, in order that there may be no mistake, that such Australian forces, ships, and armaments as the Parliament may provide for shall be maintained by the 'Commonwealth, ex- and be under our sole control. At page 2440. we find that he said If it should be the wish of Parliament to increase our floating defence by strengthening it, and making it capable of aggression, by the use of torpedo gun boats, or other similar means, I shall be very pleased, and I shall be encouraged in my future efforts in that direction. looking back to the earliest days of the Federation, we learn that this conception of harbour and coastal defences was alrea.dv in the minds of the Government of the day. But, during .what I describe as the General Officer Commanding period almost all our attention was absorbed in the organization of land forces. The expenditure upon harbour and coastal floating defences, which before Federation had amounted to .£[70,000 per annum, fell to £44,000 a year. If honourable members turn to the - second table furnished them-that headed "" Statement of Schemes for Commonwealth Naval Defence ""-the y will find the two projects of the Naval Director, Captain Creswell, and that embodied in the report laid before the House to-night, prepared last month by the Naval Officers' Committee.",162
1434,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The scheme prepared by - Captain Creswell, and presented to the .Senate in 1902, has not been embodied in this table.",163
1435,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Defence Department furnished - me with the different schemes, and, on looking at those supplied, I . seemed to recollect some prior - sketch; but, as it had not been sent to me. thought it could not have been an official paper.",163
1436,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I have a copy of the paper. The scheme embodied in it is very contradictory of those now before us.,163
1437,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"As the honourable member says, this paper was presented to the Senate in February, 1902. This preliminary proposal, which is not included in the papers I have distributed amongst honourable members, proposed four cruisers, to cost ,£300,000 each, the expenditure on the upkeep of which was estimated to be ,£47,000 per annum. The first ship was to be ordered forthwith, and completed in 1903, and the second, third, and fourth ships were to be completed in 1905, 1907, and 1909 respectively. The - cost of accessory establishment and training ships was to be met by an appropriation extending over ten years of from £[300,000 to .£350,000. Captain Creswell pointed out in the report thatAn Appropriation Act extending over ten years, setting aside £300,000 to £350,000 annually for naval defences, would be a more satisfactory arrangement. It would suffice to provide a fleet of five cruisers suitable for our defence, and leave no debt. If continued, even at a reduced amount, it would provide for all renewals as lequired. An expenditure of £[350,000 per annum for ten years would have covered that scheme. Then follows the scheme of 1905 embodied in the table which I have presented to honourable members.",163
1438,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,In the meantime we had arranged the Naval Agreement.,163
1439,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In the meantime the Naval Agreement Act had beeri passed. The paper before honourable members shows 557i the first scheme submitted in these papers, to which I need not call special attention; the second, presented in August of this year - afte r the receipt of the Imperial Defence Committee's report-and finallv the recommendations made this month by the Naval Officers' Committee.",163
1440,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Whic h represents their present views.,163
1441,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Exactly. It may be of some assistance to honourable members if I point out. what this last proposal means. It includes, first, three ocean-going destroyers of 1,300 tons each, with a speed of 33 knots, and a total war complement of 832 men, costing £'167,000 a year. These are the descriptions of the vessels proposed by the Naval CommitteeOCEAN-GOING DESTROYER, FIRST CLASS. This is a special type for ocean-going service "" to keep the sea under all conditions,"" and resembles the type of special ocean-going destroyers now being built for the Admiralty in accordance with their policy to build larger destroyers. Speed-3 3 knots. Armament-Torped o tubes, 2 18-inch; guns, 6 4-inch Q.F., 4 R.C. Maxima. Steaming radius-At 15 knots, oil fuel, 3,750 knots; coal, 2,600 knots. At ro knots, oil fuel, 6,250 knots; coal, 4,500 knots. ' OCEAN-GOING DESTROYER, SECOND CLASS. This is practically identical with the Tartar, A f r i d i , and Ghurha class of Royal Navy, but armament is heavier. Armament-Torped o tubes, 2 iS-inch; guns. 4 4-inch Q.F., 4 R.C. Maxima. COASTAL DESTROYER. The Teviot class is the River class, i.e., the class named after rivers in the United Kingdom. This is the best sea-keeping class of Torpedo Destroyers. The class was designed after the loss of the Cobra, to have a speed of 25 knots instead of the 30 knots of the earlier type. Tried, however, at the same load draft on trial, the older 30 knot class was actually capable of only 27 knots. The River class is therefore only two knots less nominal speed than the 30 knot boats. This superiority of two knot's disappears at sea directlywind and sea rise. The River class lose their speed but slightly in comparison with the other earlier and nominally faster class. The River class outstrip the other in most weathers. Besides being good sea boats, they have a great range of action. A flotilla of these destroyers returning from China averaged 13 knots for the passage of 1,560 miles from Singa-* pore to Colombo, and i 2 i knots for the run of 2,330 miles from Colombo to Aden. Armament-Torped o tubes, 2; guns, 1 T2-pdr. Q.F., 5 6-pdr. Q.F. FIRST CLASS TORPEDO BOAT. Armament-Torped o tubes, 3; guns, 3 3-ni*:,. The complements are based on the establishments for vessels of the Koyal Navy, but some reduction has been made in anticipation of burning oil fuel, and of turbine propulsion. Attention may be directed to the fact that the first three classes are destroyers , of 1 which' Great Britain possesses 140; France and Germany, over 60 each; Italy, a great number; and Japan and the United States, about 40 each.",163
1442,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,A r e not destroyers designed to hunt down torpedo boats?,164
1443,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That was their original purpose, but their scope is being greatly enlarged. Great Britain has a few reaching 600 tons, while France has some up to 300 tons, Germany to 420 tons, Italy to 320 tons, Japan to 370 tons, Sweden to 400 tons, and the United States to 420 tons. Originally, torpedo destroyers were not much larger than torpedo boats, but the class is being gradually enlarged, until the mother country is now building destroyers resembling in type the: largest proposed in this scheme.",164
1444,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Vessel s able to keep at sea outside the ports which might be attacked by torpedo boats. "" Mr DEAKIN - And able to operate over a larger area. Great Britain is now building 12, Italy 16. France 4, Germany 6, Brazil 4, and Sweden 6 destroyers. The latest reports show them to be a most favoured type, their usefulness being recognised, and their size increased.",164
1445,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"What is the difference between a ""cruiser destroyer"" and an -"" ocean-going destroyer "" ?",164
1446,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There is a difference in tonnage, in armament, and in most other respects.",164
1447,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Is not "" cruiser destroyer "" a, new definition ?",164
1448,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is taken from the new proposals of the Admiralty, and is a special type for ocean-going service to keep the sea under all conditions. In the first scheme submitted, it was proposed to spend £[350,000 a year on construction during a period of five years, with an annual upkeep of £120,000 , or .£470,000 in all. The second scheme, though the money is somewhat differently distributed, would cost the same amount. In the light of the Imperial Defence Committee's comes a third proposal from the Committee of naval officers, the proposed expenditure being ,£450,000. The outlay on maintenCOMPLEMENTS. ance, manning, and so on, would begin at £[78,000, and reach £[167,000 a year, when the vessels were completed. That wouid mean an annual expenditure, commencing at £[528,000, and running up to £[627,000, having regard - to both construction and maintenance. Taking that (expenditure annually, we should have a sum which would enable us, in the course of everv ten years, to entirely renew our fleet. The annual increase in upkeep would begin at £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , and go up to £ 1 1 4 , 0 0 0 ; add the subsidy of £[200,000 a year, which is paid, towards the upkeep of the Australian Squadron, and we obtain a maximum of £[827,000 a year. My object in quoting these figures is to show the financial position at which we shall arrive if we take both proposals in conjunction. I have had these tables prepared to show honourable members what is asked. This means an expenditure on land forces of £ 8 2 5 , 0 0 0 a year, and on naval forces of £ 8 2 7 , 0 0 0 , or of, in all, £ 1 , 6 5 0 , 0 0 0 . It is true that if ' the military and naval expenditure of Great Britain were contrasted, we should then be paying proportionately only one-third of the sum paid by the mother country. Nevertheless, it will be admitted that a scheme demanding the expenditure of £[1,650,000 a year for the defence of Australia is beyond our means.",164
1449,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It would spell bankruptcy.,164
1450,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It would mean the diversion of a large sum of money from reproductive uses ""to the purpose of defence.",164
1451,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If we are not readv to face the duty of protecting ourselves against everv possible danger, we are not a national Parliament.",164
1452,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If we did face it at once, while our object would be beyond impeachment, such, an inroad upon the public finances would meet with the disapproval of the great majority of the people of the country.",164
1453,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,No doubt about that.,164
1454,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We shall have to face it .,164
1455,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is necessary to make a beginning, and to proceed by steady advances;, taking advantage' of local means or knowledge, and seeking more economical methods than those at present advised. I report think honourable membe'rsi will recognise that since the proposal of the Committee of militarv and naval officers calls for an expenditure of £[1,600,000 a year, we must review our establishment, in order see how far we can attain our ends by claim penuriously. economies in existing expenditure. As are frequently reminded, the defence of the Commonwealth has now become a serious question. We are gradually entering upon our full Federal obligations, and the charge of all our functions, including the provision of defence by land and by sea, will not only absorb all the revenue at present available, but will make large mands on other sources. The gravity the situation can hardly be overstated, we must examine it closely in relation to defence as well as to all other expendiaccount, ture There must be a determination the sum which, after full deliberation, Imperial Defence Committee. shall be set aside for the purposes of tional defence. Having determined annual expenditure, we shall be confronted .they are of the opinion by the question whether we should adopt the recommendation of the Imperial Demonwealth fence Committee, that we should add probablv £100,000 a year to the . present cost of ' our military establishment, fining any contribution towards coastal harbour defence to increasing the subsidy to the Naval Squadron. The amount present paid has been openly described as insufficient by an admiral who was cently Naval Commander-in-Chief in these seas, and the same criticism has from other quarters. Any estimates which have been put forward in this relation have been based on arbitrary calculations, or assume imperfect data upon which the responsibilities of portions of the Empire for naval protection have beam differently sessed. Until there is agreement as to stances, limited. the data, there can be very little expectagladly tion of coincidence in the conclusions. Putting that calculation aside, the Imperial Defence Committee's proposals mean our present subsidy must be increased byfrom ,£200,000 to £ 5 > 0 0 0 0 0 order to meet the views which have expressed semi-officially by high authoriImperial ties as to our proportional responsibility for naval defence. We may dispute about the proportion, but we cannot deny the security of Australia is based upon dominant position of the British Navy. the British fleet were driven from these the security of Australia would be gone, and the opportunities of Anglo-Saxon growth here in instant danger of curtailment.",164
1456,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Ye t we look expenditure of a few pounds.,165
1457,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We are right in seeing that our money is expended in the most to efficient manner, but not in regarding the Upon the mainwe tenance of the supremacy of the British Navy rests the whole security of Australia. We have therefore to consider whether any contribution to the Australian Squadron disought to content our aspirations for a floating defence of our harbors and coasts. To discuss that question would involve a repetition of the arguments set forth in dethe general report of the Imperial Defence of Committee, and also in the naval officers' and report now before honourable members. In the latter local considerations are taken into and a different application is given of to the general doctrine laid down by the For my naown part, and speaking also for the Goour vernment, I do not hesitate to say that expressed by the first Prime Minister of the Comin the very earliest days, that the provision of harbour and coastal defence is necessary in the interests of Auscontralia for guarding our shipping commerce and and large cities. The opportunities to our citizens to enter the Imperial Navy, which at . are being used under the scheme of naval reserves, and which I trust will conretinue to be used to a liberal extent, by no means satisfy Australian aspirations. come The number of those who join the Imperial Navy, and enjoy the great advantage of receiving the finest sea training that the world can give, by enlisting under the greatest maritime power is, as for various reasons of taste and circumMany others would avail themselves of an opportunity to join in the defence of the Empire by undertaking the more immediate care andi that custody of our harbors and coasts. Norneed the two be dissociated. On the cona v e a r > in trary, there is everv reason why they been should be united. In the report of the Defence Committee allusion is made to the possible necessity of local forces of destroyers to meet future strathat tegical conditions. It would be part of the the general responsibility of the A d Ifmiralty to provide such vessels, but at page seas 1.3 of the report the Committee sayShould this necessity arise, it would no doubt be advantageous that these vessels should be manned by Australians trained in sea-going at the fleets under the Naval Agreement. Exactlv the same line of argument applies to any proposals for harbour and coastal defence. Our vessels should be manned almost wholly, if not entirely, by Australians trained in sea-going fleets under the Naval Agreement. Some of those so trained would doubtless prefer to remain in the Imperial Navy, where, of course, larger opportunities are offered', especially to those who qualify themselves as officers. But men who wouid prefer to remain on our own' coasts, nearer to their own homes, ought also to be offered an opportunity to devote themselves to the defence of their country and of this part of the Empire. By. associating with our defence vessels men trained in sea-going warships, or in vessels of similar type, that is to say, destroyers and torpedo boats, in the mother country, we sfiall avoid what has always been regarded as a peril, namely, the establishment of a small force with small opportunities for. training or promotion, as compared with those afforded by the Imperial Navy. His Excellency the' present Admiral on the Australian Station has submitted to the Defence Department proposals for amended regulations which will enable Australians cow passing through their course of training on the Squadron in these seas to proceed for a fixed period to the great ships or torpedo boats and destroyers on the coast of England, as well as to the British Naval training schools. There they would be able to receive the instruction which is absolutely necessary for men who have to manage the highly complicated pieces of delicate machinery upon modem war vessels. His Excellency the Admiral thinks that this training would be gladly given to Australian seamen.",165
1458,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am afraid that would be rather costly for individuals who wished to enter upon an officer's career.,166
1459,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Of course, officers in both the Army and the Navy require to possess special advantages to enable them to meet the exigencies of those services. The difficulties, however, are not insuperable. They can be conquered by courage, endurance, and capacity. So far as seamen are concerned, they would have to enlist for a further period than that for which they now take service. In the absence of some provision such as I have indicated, it might be difficult for us to keep up a thoroughly well-trained body of men capable of managing our' defence vessels. But if the training schools of Great Britain, the great battleships of the fleet, a""d the torpedo boats on the English coast are thrown open to our men, we shall have unrivalled means of maintaining in our coast and harbour defence forces the high standard of efficiency which at present exists in the Royal Navy. When, having regard to a proposal such as that submitted by the Naval Defence Committee, and to the figures that I have quoted, we have determined what sum we can devote for national defence purposes, we shall have to decide what proportion we shall set apart for our land forces and our sea forces respectively. If it be impossible to provide for an annual expenditure of ;£i,600,000, we shall be unable to adopt the. full schemes proposed by the expert Committees. We must curtaii them. We may curtail one more than the other. At all events, we shall first have to decide how much we shall put aside annually, and, in the next place, to decide in what manner we shall distribute the amount between our land and sea forces. Further, we shall have to look at the land forces, and see how the money for them can best be applied. Honourable members will find associated with the Minister's memorandum, laid upon the table in connection with the Estimates, a very instructive table showing the relative cost of the. different arms of the military service. The most costly is the corps of permanent submarine miners, which involve an outlay of ^167 per member per annum. Then comes the Royal Australian Artillery, also a permanent force, the outlay upon which amounts to £118 per member. In our militia, too, the Feld Artillery costs nearly £ 2 0 per member, the Army Service Corps £,17, the Engineer Corps £ 1 6 , the Artillery .£14, the InfanFry £ 1 3 , the Volunteers nearly £ 6 1 os., and the rifle clubs-if they are to be considered-30s . per member... In dealing with our land forces, we shall have to take that table into serious consideration, especially if we are to couple with our new scheme the retention of a partially-paid, and so far as the circumstances permit, well-drilled force of 26,000 men. We must also consider whether we should not encourage a purely volunteer force with a view of advancing by steady strides, in connection also with the cadet and similar movements, towards the ideal of universal service. Personally, it appears to me that this is the true ideal. Not only will it give us the greatest reserves in connection with our defences; but will enable us to avail ourselves of the educational influences of military discipline when applied to youthful manhood. We cannot look forward to an extension of the numbers of our defenders on shore, except by curtailment of the expenditure now incurred in connection with some of the paid branches of the Forces. We cannot dispense with the submarine miners, or with the permanent artillerymen, but must revise our expenditure in connection with other branches of the Military Forces. Then we shall find ourselves placed in a similar position with regard to the Naval Forces. In this case the number of men permanently employed will be larger in proportion. It will be possible to supplement our permanent forces by means of naval reserves such as have been, maintained with success in this country in the past, and by the development of the naval cadet system. If we have a fleet of destroyers and torpedo boats, they must be manned by permanent men",166
1460,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We need only have skeleton crews.,167
1461,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Certainl y ; but we shall have to maintain reserves, which will have to undergo training for considerable periods in order that they may be kept iri touch with their professional duties. The crews will not be large in number, but will require to . be exceptionally welltrained for their work. We shall have to decide as to the proportion of our available money that shall be spent upon floating harbour defences or upon coastal defences; how many first-class torpedo vessels should be provided for harbour defence and for proceeding some distance beyond our harbors; and how far we should maintain coastal destroyers, able to traverse the more settled Australian coast from end to end. The warning in the report of the Imperial Defence Committee that we should not look too far ahead, will require to be taken into account. Having in view, first of all, our financial limitations, and the many other demands that will be made upon us, the Government have come to two conclusions : First, that in the immediate future Parliament should be recommended to establish a system of harbour and coastal defence-no t to adopt the programme laid out for the five years, nor for ten years. Having regard both to. the rapid changes in modern armament and the necessary revision of plans which must follow them, and bearing in mind also our own financial necessities, we propose to limit 1 Estimates. 5575 our present project to three years. Looking at the proposal of the Naval Committee-, >. we shall commence;, as .appears : judicious, with the most economic, the bestknown and the best-tried of the floating defences they advise-that is to say, with torpedo boats, of which we propose to order four, and with coastal destroyers resembling the Teviot, of which we propose to order eight in three years. At the end of three years, commencing with the next Parliament, we should therefore have twelve boats, viz., four first-class torpedo destroyers and eight vessels of the Teviot class.",167
1462,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What is the radius of the Teviois?,167
1463,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I mentioned their run from Singapore to Colombo, a distance of 1,650 miles; but that is not the radius to which the honourable member refers. I think that their radius is a few hundred miles.",167
1464,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That would not be of much use.,167
1465,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It gives them a con- 1 siderable range outside the ports in which ' they may be stationed. The cost of the four first-class torpedo destroyers - would be £120,000, and that of the eight coastal destroyers £[640,000, or a total of £ 7 6 0 , 0 0 0 . This expenditure would require us to set apart £[250,000 a year for three years. The proposal would be to obtain from Great Britain one or two of these torpedo boats as rapidly as possible, with a view to securing estimates of cost from Australian ship-builders, who might, and, it is believed, could, with very little, if anv. addition, to their present machinery, undertake the construction of similar vessels. Of course, the question of extra cost could not be ignored, but, in balancing that, we should have to weigh very carefully the great value of encouraging the equipment locally, either of existing or of - new dockyards, irn which vessels of this type might be repaired. Without proper opportunities to repair them, and without the skilled artisans who are employed in their construction, these complicated pieces of machinery' might prove unavailable in our hour of 'need. Under these circumstances, there is., everv reason, both upon defence; and patriotic grounds, to encourage the building of these boats within our own harbors. Nor do we see any reason why the coastal destrovers of thf. Teviot type should not also be built ir. Australia. With a view of preparing the way for this, we propose, so soon as the specifications are available, to throw them open to builders in all parts of the Commonwealth, in order that they may consider their requirements, if any, in the way of fresh machinery or of expert labour. With these twelve boats we shall have gone a long way towards accomplishing what may, be termed the complete harbour defence of Australia. In the course of another three years, assuming that naval ideas do not change- - :",167
1466,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Nava l opinions are opposed to the Prime Minister's scheme.,168
1467,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The naval experts of the Admiralty are opposed to the employment of the class of vessels that we propose to purchase in Australia, on account of our distance, and on account of our liability to raids",168
1468,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"They say that such vessels are wasteful, for strictly local defensive purposes.",168
1469,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They s a y There is no strategical justification creation at great expense of a local force of destroyers.,168
1470,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"According to some experts at Home, there is very great justification.",168
1471,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,According to what experts ?,168
1472,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think that Admirals Fremantle and Fitzgerald are among them. However, I do not desire to discuss that. I wish to confine myself to a plain business statement. I am not now proceeding to offer reasons for the establishment of an Australian coastal and harbour defence. When Parliament is invited to appropriate money for that purpose, it will be time enough for me to endeavour to show that this is the course which ought to be pursued in the interests of the Empire as a whole. In the second three years - provide d that there is no great change i.i naval construction-w e should be able to pass from merely harbour defence to defence. If the scheme stood the test of three years experience, we should have an admirable harbour defence, which ought to put us beyond all danger of the-suspension of Inter-State traffic, or of any harbour attack which the Imperial Defence Committee can foresee. At the same time our ocean-gqing destroyers would enable our ports to keep in touch with each other along the whole line of our seaboard. During the second three years, we should complete the whole scheme with any amendment experience might show to be necessary.",168
1473,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"B y how much is it proposed to reduce the Military Estimates? Would the £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually be an addition to our present defence expenditure?",168
1474,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is the very point to which I was about to address myself. First, we must add to the £[250,000 annual expenditure the sum of £200,000 which we now pay by way of subsidy",168
1475,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ha d not the Prime Minister better omit the subsidy from his calculations, and confine them to new expenditure ?",168
1476,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If we set apart £[250,000 annually 'for the construction of these vessels, £200,000 for subsidy, and a further ,£100,000 for maintenance, we get a total of £ 5 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year. Then we have at present military proposals for an expenditure of £[835,000 per annum.",168
1477,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Exclusive of the purfor the chase of warlike stores ?,168
1478,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No ; inclusive of everything. The joint total is nearly £[1,400,000. In view of these proposals, the Government are unable to see their way to accept the recommendations of the M i l i tary Committee of officers, which would have involved an additional expenditure of £[100,000 annually. In the next place, the necessity, will arise-and it is one to which my honourable colleague will devote his best attention-of scrutinizing our present military vote, in order to discover where economies car.' be effected. Honourable members will understand that the report of our military advisers has not been in our hands a week, so that we have not yet had time to scrutinize it carefully. But, obviously, our proposal for naval development will require to be accompanied by a very searching, examination into our present expenditure, with a view to ascertaining where savings can be effected.",168
1479,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Has the Prime Minister attempted to estimate what the new expenditure will be after allowing for any reduction which may take place upon the military side?,168
1480,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That question cannot be answered until the Military Estimates have been re-studied. But we feel that the time has arrived when our coastal and harbour defence ought to be brought up to the same level as our militarv defence.,168
1481,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,A r e not the present garrience son forces in the nature of coastal and harbour defence forces ?,169
1482,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Undoubtedly . I recognise that the simpler I can make my statement at the present stage, .the better it will be for all concerned. It is only because we realise our immediate responsibility to. Parliament and the country that we lay these broad proposals before honourable members at this hour, and invite their consideration. An election must intervene, and a new Parliament must be returned, before any appropriation can be made for the purpose of giving effect to die scheme which I have outlined. If I have enabled honourable members to recall the various stages by which we have reached our present position, and to realise the differences between the several schemes which have been put forward, I shall have fulfilled my task. In urging honourable members to reflect upon these proposals, I do not think it necessary to indulge in alarmist appeals, to endeavour to evoke a warlike spirit, or in .any sense to go outside the lines of the matter-of-fact statement which we feel to be due. there is one circumstance of recent occurrence to which attention may fittingly be drawn here, as it has been all over the world. I refer to the recent alterations in the ship-building programme of the British Government, coupled with the intimation of the new ship-building programme of Germany. No part of this Empire can afford to overlook the circumstance that the mother country has thoughtit judicious to pause in the construction of those great battleships that have recently dwarfed into insignificance most of the fighting vessels of the world, whilst the German Empire has proposed to increase her own strength in that direction to an extent that, without further action on the part of the mother country, must lead to an alteration of the greatest moment in the battleship sea-power of the world.",169
1483,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is necessary to increase battle strength.,169
1484,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Exactly. We at a distance from the mother country are exposed, so we are told, to the raids of 1 unarmouried or probably armoured cruisers. But, after all, the decisive events in the great naval battles of the future will be decided by what are distinctively termed battleships. With their line of battleships once destroyed, cruisers, armoured or unarmoured, would have an exciting experibefore them. In these circumstances, any one can conceive it possible that if the domination of the ocean which the mother country has enjoyed were in any respect shaken, we certainly should be exposed more than even the Defence Committee have thought probable to attacks not only of unarmoured, but of armoured cruisers. In circumstances of that kind, the safeguarding of the ports' and coasts of this part of the Empire would certainly require attention at our hands. That it cannot receive unless we take action at least three or four years in advance. In the programme for the construction ofvessels of the Dreadnought type, which is at present authorized^ at Home, the Admiralty are looking forward only to the years 1908-9. In these circumstances, it is certainly not too much for us now to consider our own conditions, and the possibility of an attack of a more serious nature than has hitherto been contemplated. That contingency may possibly be removed by future events. Meanwhile, we must all recognise with sympathy the burden of the But "" weary Titan,"" as Great Britain has been poetically termed, bearing "" the too vast orb of her fate."" We can realise how great, even for so wealthy a people, is the cost of her Army and Navy, amounting to £60,000,000 per annum. Still, even while recognising that enormous strain, it comes somewhat as a shock of surprise to find that if the present policy be pursued, she appears likely to assume the character of "" a weary Triton,"" conscious at last of the weight of the sceptre, of the seas. Is her fleet sufficient for her destiny? It is said not.",169
1485,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Thes e are partisan political statements.,169
1486,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"They are statements partially accepted, but it is admitted that if the present ship-building programmes remain unaltered there will be a serious disturbance of the battleship power of the world and of the naval influence, which depend so largely upon the command of battleships. I am simply referring to these possibilities, not actualities, as supplying another reason why Australia should develop to the utmost extent her self-dependence in our waters. They afford another reason why we should be prepared, not only to take our share in discharging - as I trust we shall always assist to discharge-ou r Imperial obligation due to our protection by the Imperial fleet, and to do something more. We can discharge part of our obligations by attending to necessities of our own coasts and harbors; by the creation of a force that would relieve the Imperial Navy of some of the anxiety which its directors would at present feel the event of the Empire being engaged great naval war. The protection of our ports and coasts will be for the benefit, only of Australian, but of British shipping. By providing safe harbors of retirement, and protection for our commerce in the mediate neighbourhood of our coast, we shall do something towards the discharge our general obligation. We shall be doing something, but not all. As I have stated already, the British Navy upon the high seas extends to us a protective power which no effort of ours could hope to rival. of inestimable value to the people and to the future of this country. Under shelter we have grown, are growing, and, trust, will continue to grow, loyal and dependent, never forgetting to recognise responsibility, or, so far as our means mit, to discharge it both to Australia and the Flag.",169
1487,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Wentworth) [8.53] - On e of could scarcely be expected, at the close a continuous sitting of thirty-six hours, discuss to-night a speech of the magnitude and importance of that to which we have just listened. I rise now only because think it is the desire of the Committee that we should deal with the Estimates with all celerity.",170
1488,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If I may be permitted answer a question which the honourable ber put to me a few moments ago, I would say that my honourable colleague, the Viceevery President of the Executive Council, informs me that the vessels of the Teviot class have a radius of about 3s days, or, in other words, 1,000 miles, at least steaming about 20 knots.",170
1489,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Without endeavouring to reply to die speech made by the Prime MinNavy, ister, I should like to deal with one or suggestions which he made. most impressed by the Prime Minister's concluding periods, in which he drew attenwe tion to the enormous and far-reaching changes in battleship construction that are now taking place in European waters, went on to remind us that, after all, the command of the seas and all that pertains to it must, in the end, rest ultimately battle fleets. The honourable arid learned gentleman pointed out that, of all ships comprising battle fleets, those enormous vessels of the Dreadnought class were desthe tined to be all-powerful and overshadowing. He also pointed out that Germany was making greater efforts in the construction of these ships than is the mother country. That in suggests a conclusion which seems to strike in a at the very root of the desirability of establishing an incomplete and fallacious not system of local naval protection on the coast-line of Australia. I think we are all agreed that our safety is imindissolubly bound up with the safety of other parts of the Empire, and especially of with that of the mother country. That being so, it is necessary for us to see that, so far as we can help to maintain it, the Imperial battle strength of these great fleets will not be allowed to decrease below the It is measure of general safety. Honourable - members will see that it is absolutely imits possible for Australia to branch out for I herself by acquiring these great battleselfships. That, I think, is one of the our reasons why the Prime Minister proposes perthat we should begin at the bottom by the to construction of destroyers, even although there is no crying necessity for this type vessel. Now, I take it that it is the duty of of Australia, knowing where her true danto ger lies, and knowing her inability to meet that danger alone, to set about obtaining a system of common naval co-operation j to I join for our common purposes with other portions of our race overseas who have the same need, the same object, as we ourselves have. Whilst we alone cannot maintain to our object, when we combine with other memsections of our race overseas we shall be able to maintain a navy of such power that section of the Empire will be secured from reasonable danger. That is my ideal. It is not, as a section of the press which has done me the honour of opposing my views on the subject, would have honourable members believe, the payment of tribute money. My ideal is a co-operative Imperial in which all sections of the Empire two will hav'e a common ownership- a navv I was under one expert administration, who will decide our common needs, a navv to which shall all contribute in men as well as money. I admit that it is an ideal that in present circumstances is. and for some time and to come will be, unattainable.",170
1490,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Because all parts are not with under the one political control.,170
1491,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Exactly . The difficulties, however, are not insurmountable, and the mere existence of difficulties should not lead us to shirk the consideration of the problem. The military argument, however, is irrefutable. Our safety from invasion lies absolutely in the direction of these great battle-ship fleets. If anything were needed to satisfy us on that point, we should find it in the concluding periods of the Prime Minister's speech. We cannot obtain that security alone. Therefore we, like men of the working classes when their personal safetyis threatened, must band ourselves into one great union- a union of the British-speaking people. There need be no loss of self-respect on the part of the people of Australia in contributing in men and money to a great coramonlyowned Imperial Navy. There is no greater loss of self-respect involved in making such a contribution than that which is suffered by a trade unionist who joins with other trade unionists for common trade purposes. That is the main consideration which the remarks of the Prime Minister have suggested to me. The honourable and learned gentleman is proposing to ask a future Parliament to agree to establish a fleet of eight coastal destroyers and four first-class torpedo boats. Before honourable members take sides on this question, I hope they will ask themselves what these ships are for. What is their purpose ? If the Prime Minister says that their object is to spur on the very laudable ambition of the Australian people to become a maritime race, there is something in the proposal. Although it may be faulty from a military point of view, there is then something in it . The military proposition, however, will not stand investigation. The Minister has himself shown our danger. He has himself shown the essentiality of battle fleets, and would be the first to recognise that, if Great Britain lost command of the seas, we could not prevent an invading army from landing in Australia, even if we had ten times as many destroyers as are suggested. If our main line of defence, the battle fleets of the Empire, fail , our coastal defence cannot save us from the one great crowning danger of Avar, the invasion of our territory. Therefore, viewed entirely from a military stand-point, the Prime Minister's proposal will not bear investigation. Whether we do right or wrong, in anvthing concerning the integrity of our country, we should by all means pull together. If this will create an Australian national feeling which will not be detrimental to the proper Imperial co-operation which alone will save Australia, I for one will not offer any strenuous opposition to it, although I regard it as a wasteful means of arriving, at our ambition. But I ask honourable members to weigh the Prime Minister's words very carefully. He urged the necessity of a common system of discipline, a common standard of efficiency throughout the naval affairs of the Empire, and would have nothing to do with an isolated force in Australia, having its own school, its own standard and ideals. Such a force would be no more able to work with an Imperial fleet, if it were necessary to do so, than one stranger could pull together with another.",170
1492,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Nonsense . The experience of the world is against the honourable member. He might as well say, after what happened in South Africa, that Australian soldiers cannot fight alongside Imperial soldiers, although they are trained on widely different lines.",171
1493,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There are fleets built, designed, and controlled on homogeneous lines, and other fleets without homogeneity which have a good ship of one design and another good ship of another design. The second greatest navy in the world, that of France, has been condemned by its admirals for this failing, in no unmeasured terms. A couple of years ago the admiral commanding the northern squadron of France, communicated to the Chamber of Deputies his opinion that that fleet was so dissimilar in construction, that there was such a want of homogeneity in regard to its ships, that he doubted whether Prime they could satisfactorily engage in any common naval action. That is one side of the objection which I have offered.",171
1494,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am aware that vessels may differ in regard to speed and in other points.,171
1495,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The diversity referred to was mainly that of gun position.,171
1496,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Would that destroy the homogeneity of the fleet so far as its operations were concerned? - Mr KELLY - The French battle-ships of the present time are of two main types. Those of the one type, as their primary armament, can bring to bear three great guns in any direction. The others can bring to bear four guns on each beam, and only two forward and two aft. The admiral who had to combine the offensive energy of a fleet composed of different units, would be at a disadvantage in manoeuvring if opfor home defences. posed to an admiral whose vessels fired the same number of guns from the same posiseparate home defence. tions. For, however he manoeuvred his ships, some of them would always be f a i ing to give their full offensive results. of course, is a problem in construction, bine with the land defences. which is governed practically by a common control of design. The point with which have mainly to deal now is the common defence. standard of discipline. I have been asprovision sured by naval officers that so delicate the operation of manoeuvring torpedo boats and cruisers in company that they would coast defences. rather be without the assistance of torpedo boats than be associated with vessels of standard of whose discipline tliey could not be sure. There must be the greatest mutual confidence between these two arms of the service.",171
1497,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Eve n so, the value of destroyers for coastal and harbour defence would remain.",172
1498,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But we should not get the best value out of them. I suggest the Prime Minister should ta.ke steps to avail. act on the principles he voiced this afternoon by providing a common standard discipline and efficiency by common control, by associating the proposed vessels with the principle of the Naval Agreement.",172
1499,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Bland) [9.8] - I think that honourable members 'generally will join in complimenting the Prime Minister on the speech which he delivered in introducthe ing these Estimates, because of ness and its grasp of the great problems which confront us in regard to defence.

1501,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We can go only on probabilities. The Imperial Defence Committee says that what we have to fear is' attacks from raiding cruisers. That is the assumption of all who have considered this question. It is recognised at once that if the British fleet were absolutely defeated that a torpedo defence would not be of much,172

1503,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Torped o teats cannot attack battle-ships, or even cruisers in the light of day, but they can prevent cruisers from attempting to enter havens at night, and can keep them at a respectful distance during the hours of darkness, while during day the fixed defences have an opporits cleartunity to cope with them.",172

1509,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think that the bestthing we can do is to maintain a mosquito fleet, a/nd not to depend upon the sea-going squadron on the Australian station. Every one knows that it is almost inevitable that, in. the event of war, the British squadron will, for strategical reasons, be taken away from our shores. From the point of view of protection of British interests, I have nothinc to urge against that. But, while the squadron is absent, we shall require to provide some defences against suddeni raids by cruisers. It is thing for one fleet to escape the notice of another.",173
1510,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member spoke of the British coast defences. Are not those intended to repel attacks by the torpedo craft which are swarming in French waters?,173
1511,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not think that they are intended for that purpose alone; but no doubt they would secure that end. They are designed to ward off attacks by raiding cruiser squadrons.,173
1512,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The British harbors are now protected by submersibles.,173
1513,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes ; and I am inclined to think that once a standard type of submersible has been decided upon, it would be wise for us to procure craft of that kind, and to reduce the number of our torpedo boats.",173
1514,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,How many submersibles should we require to protect the whole of our coast-line?,173
1515,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not think that we need protect the whole of our coast-line. Bu! we must provide reasonably safe havens of refuge at a reasonable distance apart, to which our shipping could repair.",173
1516,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does not the honourable member think that the enormous predominance of strength in cruisers which distinguishes the British Navv would enable the Admiralty to arrange for keeping any cruisers On the move?,173
1517,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No doubt fwe could rely upon the British Navy to speedily account for the enemy when he met him, but our trade might be paralyzed by the sudden appearance of a few raiders that had escaped the vigilance of the British Fleet. If the expenditure of a comparatively small sum would protect us against risks of that kind, I think that we should incur the outlay. 1 Estimates.  ber knows, a small sum would not be sufficient.",173
1518,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The expenditure would be comparatively small. Rather than do anything on the naval side, I should be willing to reduce the Military Estimates by £[250,000, and spend the money thus saved in the direction 1I have indicated. According to my idea, it is far more necessary that we should provide for a floating harbour and coastal defence than that we should maina common tain our present military forces.",173
1519,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"He a r , hear; of what use are they?",173
1520,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Some of our forces would be decildjedly useful, particularly those which garrison our forts, and which are as essential to the security of our harbors as our floating defences would be. I do not agree with those who think that we should disband all our military forces, but I hold that we should do well to spend a comparatively large sum upon our naval defences.",173
1521,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But if we want to take a manlv part, why should we not co-operate with the Imperial authorities in attacking the coast-lines of the enemy ?",173
1522,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Because our resources are limited. According to my view, the provision of sale bases for the Imperial fleets would be the best contribution that we could make towards the Imperial Navy. By directing our energies in that direction we should serve the general purpose^ of the Empire as well as the local purposes of Australia.",173
1523,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We can best aid the Navy by contributing men.,173
1524,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No doubt plenty of men will be forthcoming when they are needed. Any money contribution we might make towards the British naval expenditure would be so small in comparison with the total that it would be hardly worth considering. In view of the fact that the Government are looking forward to the expenditure next vear of an additional £[250,000 upon the naval side of our defences, I do not understand why it is proposed to increase the militarv expenditure during the current year b - £77,000. Ministers should have opposed a resolute front to those who were asking for increased militarv expenditure.",173
1525,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What about the cadets and rifle clubs?,173
1526,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Any increase of expenditure directed to the encouragement of rifle clubs should be compensated for by savings in other directions, in which. expenditure will have to be cut down, if the scheme of naval defence is to be anything more than a proposal on paper. So far as the cadets are concerned, I think that they were being well looked after by the States. I believe that in some cases there are fewer cadets now than there were before. When the Estimates for 1902-3'were under consideration - an arrangement was arrived at between the 'Government and members of the Committee that our defence expenditure should not exceed ,£700,000 per annum. Since then, however, the naval subsidv has been increased by £[100,000. The Government now propose to spend -£876,000, or an increase of ,£76,000 over the amount agreed upon in 1902-3. It is evident that Ministers have lost sight of that agreement, to which most of them were parties, and also of the proposal that has been put forward to-night. I shall ask the Committee to agree to a reduction of the Estimates, and to impose upon the Government the duty of saying how the saving shall be effected. I think that we should at least endeavour to revert to the position that we occupied in 1902-3.",173
1527,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Corio) [9.28] - I congratulate the Prime Minister upon his splendid speech. It is marvellous that, notwithstanding the many responsibilities thrown upon him, he should be able to take up a special subject such as that dealt with this evening, and master it so thoroughly as he has done. It is gratifying to find that at least some honourable members are prepared to pay regard to those large national issues which the Commonwealth Parliament has so far failed to face with resolution. seems to me that we have entered upon a new era. As a nation, we have embarked upon a policy of national provocation. It is a great pity that we should do that, unless we are able to defend ourselves. Recently we noticed that, whilst Natal was ready enough to embarrass the British Government, she was only too anxious to fall back upon Great Britain for her defence. We ought either to be ready to accept the tutelage of the .British Government, or we ought to be prepared to shoulder our responsibility for having given umbrage to nations like Japan-by reason of our White Australia policy-by defending our action through the taxation of our own people and by the force of our own arms. It ' seems to me that honourable members are afraid to adopt the latter alternative. When the Prime Minister announced that his scheme would involve an annual expenditure of £[1,000,000, a general note of alarm seemed to pervade the Chamber. It is not fair to expect the Empire to defend us, and at the same time to adopt a policy which is constantly embarrassing it. The Prime Minister has told us that two Committees have investigated the question of Australian defence. One has recommended that certain military improvements should be effected, and the other that we should incur an annual expenditure of £[600,000 upon an Australian Navy. The honourable member for Bland is ready to advocate the establishment of such a Navy, but is apparently afraid to face the cost that it would involve. Surely we are here to lead the people, and if we cannot do that, be sureThe wild mob's million feet, Will kick us from our place. In order to secure the establishment of an Australian Navy, I would suggest that we should discontinue the payment of the naval subsidy at the earliest possible moment. The agreement has not been honestly observed, either in the matter of the size of the ships in our waters or in the number of Australians who are employed upon them. Then I think that in order to permit of. the establishment of a navy of our own we should cut down all our military forces apart from our coastal defence. At the present time we have too many light horse regiments in Australia. These bodies were established by Major General Sir Edward Hutton largely for Imperial purposes. His object was to provide a recruiting ground from which he It could obtain levies for Great Britain in time of need. When I come to examine the scheme which has been outlined by the Prime Minister, it seems to propose increased expenditure in every direction. For instance, our light horse, militia, and field engineers are to be increased. The only cutting down contemplated seems to be in connection with our coastal defences. I noticed that our coastal defence, in one place, is to be reduced by sixty men, and in another by 110. There is one other aspect of this matter which ought to be considered-it has reference to the question of military control. At the present time that control is in a chaotic state- a condition of affairs which is chiefly due to the divided system of responsibility that was introduced under the Defence Bill of 1904, and under which a Council of Defence and a Military Board were established. upon that measure on 25th November of that year, I saidUnder whatever scheme we may adopt, there must be one man. who will have the final word to say. In an autocratic body like as army there must be a head man, one supreme control. Otherwise the whole organization breaks down. If there is an organized body in the world, which is essentially autocratic in its character, is an army. Therefore, I think that, as this scheme develops itself, we shall come back more or less to the old system, and that there will be some person-whateve r we choose to call him-wh o will develop into a Commander-inChief, and virtually take the position which the Comntander-in-Chief occupies at the present time -(Date d 31st July, 1905, to 38th February, When that scheme was submitted, I predicted that it would result in a struggle for. pre-eminence between the Inspector General, the members of the Military Board, and the Minister. Those who have closely watched the trend of events since then must be convinced that a duel has been going on between the Board and the Inspector-General, and that one mem-' ber of the Board, an officer of exceptional ability and energy, has been able to dominate his fellows. Seeing that this divided system of military control has so largely resulted in failure, I should like the Minister to continue the present position of affairs under which the Chief Staff Officer is also the Inspector-General. I feel that we can combine the two offices, and thus create again the old condition of a responsible Officer Commanding. We must have a central and not a divided military control. Military forces cannot be governed by a Committee. ' Otherwise, when the Minister is wrong, he will shelter himself behind the Military Board, and when the Board are wrong, they will seek refuge behind the Inspector-General. Government have really decided to create an Australian Navy, the best thing that they can do is to convene a joint meeting of the Military and Naval Boards. Naval and Military defence are so inter-related that it is extraordinary that any scheme should have been submitted to Parliament without the two bodies which I have mentioned having first met in conference, and having been told definitely the amount they can expend. Only by co-operation is it possible to evolve a workable scheme of defence. Progress reported. PAPERS.

1528,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Corio) [9.48] - I desire to make a 'personal explanation in regard to the vote which I cast yesterday cn the motion for the adjournment of the debate on the Postal Rates Bill. In certain quarters, there has .been an attempt to make capital out of the fact that seine of the supporters of the Government voted against them upon that question. I should like to 8 Territorial state that, on entering the House, I was proceeding to take my seat near the Prime Minister, as I understood it was a question of adjournment only, when I was informed by him that the division was a test one to determine the fate of the Bill, and that I was. free to vote as I pleased. That being so, as one who opposed the Bill, I voted for the adjournment of the debate. I had not the slightest intention of embarrassing the Government, and feel confident that two-thirds of those who voted for the motion would have stood by the Government so far as the adjournment of the debate was concerned, had they been requested to do so.",175
1529,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Hindmarsh) [9.50]. - I wish to make a personal explanation in reference to the following paragraph from the Herald report of the all-night sitting:After the last train had left the city, members settled down for an all-night sitting. The items under each division evoked much criticism from Messrs. Joseph Cook, Kelly, MCWilliams, Johnson, and Hutchison, who were continuously in their places. As a matter of fact, about 11-35 P - yesterday, I was speaking to the question before the Chair, when I was told that members were anxious to catch their trains. I immediately resumed my seat, and, as a matter of fact,' I do not think that I spoke for more than one minute during the whole night. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 9.53 p.m. (Thursday). [SENATE.,] Limits. ,m",176
