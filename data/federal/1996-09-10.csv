1,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Nebl) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and read prayers. NA Unemployment",13
2,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, yesterday you refused to nominate a jobs target. Are you aware of advice from the employment department to your incoming government that Labor was on track to achieve its five per cent target? Are you aware that that advice projected 'an average annual growth rate of 2.2 per cent for total employment which is considered to be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down to five per cent'? Against that advice, doesn't the NILS document which you refused to table yesterday state that, under a growth scenario more closely linked to your budget projections, unemployment could be as high as 8.1 per cent? Is that your employment target? I seek leave to table the document. Leave not granted.",13
3,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Tomorrow will mark precisely six months since the new coalition government was sworn in. In that six months we have begun to lay the foundations forMr Melbam-It seems like six years.,13
4,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I tell you what: there are many more years to come. I can assure the honourable members for Holt and Banks that we are not suffering any government fatigue syndrome. We certainly intend to be around for a long time.,13
5,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,13
6,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Settle down!,13
7,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me make it very plain to the Leader of the Opposition, who has asked me this question about unemployment: the last group of people in Australia who have any credibility asking questions about unemployment is the Australian Labor Party. For 13V2 years you talked long and loud about unemployment. For 13V2 years you failed the Australian people. Your former Prime Minister, your former Treasurer, your former finance minister and now Leader of the Opposition lifted the unemployment rate of this country to the worse levels since the Great Depression. Opposition members-You! You! You!",13
8,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have no moral authority whatsoever. I can only repeat what I said yesterday on the subject of the unemployment target.,13
9,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your target?,13
10,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Denison! Before I call the next questioner, I might comment to the House that everybody seems very chirpy today and very active. If you are in so much need of exercise, I can provide it. Families",13
11,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that the government is committed to strengthening the central role of families in Australian society, what steps has it taken in its recently very well received budget to prevent and overcome family crises?",13
12,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for MCPherson, and indeed all members of the House, will be aware of the central elements of the budget which included the delivery over a period of four years of a $4 billion family tax initiative precisely in accordance with the commitment that I made on behalf of the coalition during the election campaign. They will also be aware of the commitments in relation to private health insurance. In addition to that, there are a number of very important initiatives that those who are interested in the welfare of families in difficulty and in crisis will be both interested in and concerned to hear about. To start with, I am very happy to say that in the last budget, in the first coalition budget, the Liberal-National Party government has exactly doubled the amount of money going to marriage and relationship education. We have exactly doubled the amount. As all of us who go around the country are constantly told, large amounts of money are properly available if families disintegrate and perhaps a little more money ought to be made available to prevent families from disintegrating. I know that the members of the opposition are not interested to hear about this; they are not interested to hear about a $4.3 million program that is going to go to organisations like the Salvation Army, the Society of St Vincent de Paul, the Sydney City Mission, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Smith Family. You are not interested to hear about that, are you? I think you ought to sit and listen. I know you always get very angry when it is pointed out that you do not have a monopoly on compassion. You get very angry about that. You think you have a monopoly on concern for the less privileged in our community.",13
13,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,14
14,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are for the first time-and I repeat it above the noisy interjections of the front-bench of the Labor Partyputting a sum of $4.3 million into a parenting education program that will be designed in part to attack some of the root causes of child abuse in our community. This money will be made available to organisations like the Salvation Army and the Society of St Vincent de Paul in order to provide programs to help. In addition, the high rate of youth suicide which touches so many families",14
15,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,14
16,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I know the Labor Party is not interested in these valuable social welfare measures.,14
17,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,14
18,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I think everybody, particularly on my left, had better calm down. The volume of noise, the amount of interjection, is not acceptable. It is not acceptable to this parliament, I am sure it is not acceptable to the people of Australia and, if you think about it, you will find it is not acceptable to you.",14
19,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not only do we have the new parenting education program, not only do we have a doubling of marriage and relationship education funding but, in addition, we are going to provide $19 million over three years through the national youth suicide strategy-and I am sure that all members of the House would recognise its importance, given the alarmingly high rate of youth suicide particularly amongst rural males in Australia. As I announced in my address to the Council of Social Services in October last year as Leader of the Opposition, we were going to inaugurate a youth homeless pilot program. The pilot study has already been completed by the youth homelessness task force that was chaired by Captain David Eldridge of the Salvation Army who, in fact, was commended to me by the member for Hotham as being somebody very learned and very understanding and quite expert in this area. I certainly share the view of the member for Hotham about the capacity of this man to make a contribution in this very important area. Mr Crean-Yes, he is very good. I appointed him first. You are not too flash in the nomination stakes.",14
20,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham!,14
21,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As promised, we have allocated $8.1 million to the youth homelessness pilot project. In addition, we will be allocating other funds to deal with the levels of violence and crime within our community. Finally, I know that all members of the House do recognise the important work of agencies such as the Salvation Army, the Smith Family, the various capital city missions and many other organisations of that kind. There is an emergency relief program, which has been running at about $16 million to $18 million over the past few years. In the recent budget, we have increased the base funding of that program by $5 million, and we have also promised to review the indexation factor for the increased funding because, according to the advice I received directly from a number of those agencies, the indexation factor provided by the former government was resulting in a steady decline in the funds that were being made available to those organisations. So we have done two things: we have increased the base funding by $5 million on a one-off basis, and we are going to introduce a new indexation factorMrs Crosio-Who are you kidding?",14
22,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Prospect!,15
23,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to make certain that the resources available to these organisations properly keep pace with need within our community. I know the Labor Party squirms and is embarrassed whenever those opposite are reminded of these sorts of programs, and I know they go absolutely ballistical and tropical about it. But I can tell you: you are going to hear a lot more about the broadly based social welfare support measures of the coalition government. Health Insurance",15
24,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is a great shame that we did not hear about the trebling of the fees for Family Court marriage counselling.,15
25,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will get to the question.,15
26,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, my question is addressed to you. It concerns your contretemps with your colleague in the health portfolio. Do you recall your interview on 2UE on 30 August 1996 when you said, among other things: The department should have told him. Now, I'm not trying to payout on the department. It's happened, it's happened. But it really is something as important to the Government, and known to be important to the Government and to the Australian public that these increases weren't told ... If I had known, if I had been told about these increases, I would have requested that they be announced publicly and openly before the budget was brought down ... And do you recall the minister for health saying in this House yesterday: . . . I should say that on budget night I was aware that National Mutualthat is HBAwould be increasing their premiums ... Has the minister caused you to mislead the Australian public?",15
27,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Budget 1996-97,15
28,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr Acting Speaker,15
29,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,15
30,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left will be quiet.,15
31,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of the public statements expressing concern and opposition to recent proposals to block billions of dollars of debt and deficit reduction in the budget? What would be the consequences for interest rates, job growth and the cost of servicing debt if those opposing $19 billion worth of deficit reduction were to succeed?",15
32,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is obvious that the Labor Party has been stunned by the widely welcomed fair and responsible budget that was brought down by this government. As I said yesterday, its position before the budget was that it should be balanced over three years. That is what this budget does-one, two, three years. It is just that the Labor Party opposes every single measure to get there. We now have a party with no responsible economic strategy at all, the worse in a generation-a policy of sabotage. Not only did you create this problem, you refuse to cooperate in the solving of it-absolute irresponsibility. I am aware that the Australian public now is beginning to realise the absolute irresponsibility of the Labor Party in relation to this. Yesterday, the President of the Busia lapse for ness Council of Australia said: You can be pretty certain that if the savings side of the budget doesn't get up that's going to put pressure on interest rates. The President of the National Farmers Federation said: I share the Prime Minister's concern that interest rates will not be as low as they should be if the budget's down . The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry noted: This year's budget marks a turning point in the management of the Australian economy. It is a budget whose aim is to regenerate growth, encourage employment, and to do so by reducing the level of public sector spending. This was the appropriate budget and it is a good one. And it is a good one-a very good one! All of the business leaders came to Parliament House yesterday-and they did not organise a riot, either. No riot! They were able to come in and put their views. Let me tell the oppositionMrs Crosio interjecting",15
33,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Prospect! Government members-Throw her out!,16
34,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right are not helping.,16
35,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Perhaps the members of the New South Wales Right would like this quote: More debt now simply means bigger interest bills in the future and fewer dollars to spend on hospitainable tals, schools, roads, and all of our other key priorities. The New South Wales Treasurer, Michael Egan-that's what he said! He's looking up there in Sydney at this Jurassic Park of people over there who have no economic responsibility at all. They are sitting around saying, 'We're in favour of balancing the budget; we're just going to oppose $19 billion that gets it there.' You have nothing but a strategy of deficit and debt into the next century. You have a policy to burden future Australians with debt. You want less to be spent on their schools and their hospitals. You are without any responsibility whatsoever. Not only was the budget fair and received widely and respected, but it has within itMr Crean-We have a blood pressure bill ready.",16
36,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham had better take it.,16
37,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Be easy on him, Mr Acting Speaker; he is going for the job of deputy leader and shadow Treasurer. What happened after the shadow Treasurer complained that he was suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome? The member for Hotham could not get out onto the airwaves quick enough. 'I'm not suffering from it,' he said. What did he say? Laurie Oakes asked, 'Are you suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome in opposition?' 'Oh, no, I'm not,' he said, 'I'm not. I'm actually quite enjoying it.' You certainly are. I thought it was so deft-right in the back! And, of course, you would have been the deputy leader if the member for Holt had not done the deal with the New South Wales Right. We can always rely on them at crucial times. We always can. We thank the New South Wales Right for putting him there-and we would like you to keep him there! Mr Acting Speaker, in relation to the budget, not only was it widely received and widely respected, but it is also a budget that puts in place a future for Australia-a budget that has already put our rating on a positive note, a budget which lays the basis for susgrowth, a budget that lays the basis for investment, a budget that lays the basis for a fiscal improvement, a budget that has a plan for Australia, as opposed to an opposition that has nothing to offer. Budget 1996-97",16
38,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think my question follows directly from that answer that we have just heard, Mr Acting Speaker, and it goes to a quote, which I will see if I can test",16
39,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,To whom is your question addressed?,16
40,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,the Prime Minister's memory on at the time when they were following up their opposition to $10 billion worth of budget cuts.,16
41,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the question to the Prime Minister? Mr BEAZLEYI ask it of the Prime Minister. Do you recollect this quote that you gave to Fran Kelly on the PM program on 26 June 1995: I mean, even Kim Beazley himself acknowledged that last year, and Peter Costello pointed it out in the House today, that the link between the size of the budget deficit or the surplus and the level of interest rates can be greatly exaggerated. The interest rate level, Fran, is currency driven and current account deficit driven far more than anything else, and any economist worth his or her salt out there listening to me would nod their agreement. Do you recollect that?",16
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do.,17
43,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Do you still agree with yourself?,17
44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do and, Mr Acting Speaker, could I say three things to the Leader of the Opposition: yes, I do remember that interview; do I agree with myself-yes, I do; and do I believe that interest rates are current account deficit driven-yes, I do. Do you know one of the best ways of getting Australia'sMr Tanner-Ah, the twin deficit theory. Let's hear about the twin deficit theory.",17
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hang on; you wanted the answer. You know the best way to get Australia's current account deficit under control, and that is to do something about our savings problem. If you do something about our savings problem, you will not only get the current account down, you will also get interest rates down. So I agree 100 per cent with what I said then. And if you agreed 100 per cent with what we are proposing in this budget we would all be a lot better off, mate. NA",17
46,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! Before I call the next question, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan in Pakistan. On behalf of the House, I send a very warm welcome to our visitors. NA Miss JACKIE KELLY-My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of alternative policies for the privatisation of Telstra? Is the Prime Minister aware of the claim by the chief executive of Telstra, Frank Blount, that a still very active former senior Labor minister told him in the early 1990s that Telstra would be privati sed? head in Has the Leader of the Opposition denied categorically being the senior Labor minister who told Mr Blount that Telstra would be privatised?",17
47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, we always knew-certainly, since the publication of his book called Whatever It Takes-by courtesy of Graham Richardson that the former Prime Minister Paul Keating was in favour of flogging off 100 per cent of Telstra-although he presumably would have happily connived in writing to all of the employees of Telstra before the election and assuring them that that was not their plan, the way they had deceitfully written to all the members of the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association before the 1990 election, promising then that they were not going to flog off any of the Commonwealth Bank. But we now have, courtesy of an interview in the Melbourne Herald-Sun, a very interesting revelation from the managing director of Telstra, Frank Blount, about a man that he describes as a-listen to the words-still very active former minister in the Labor Party. I was irreverent enough yesterday to suggest that it might be the Leader of the Opposition. What is very interesting is the rather tortuous Clayton's non-denial that we have had from the Leader of the Opposition. Apparently Mr Beazley was interviewed by Niki Savva after I made that comment, and he has admitted in an interview with the Age that he had 'many conversations with Mr Blount', which is fair enough. I do not think there is anything peculiar about that. It is very interesting that, whilst this interview goes on for about eight or 10 paragraphs, at no stage does he categorically deny the allegation. He says things like, 'If Mr Blount has had that impression, then I don't think he could have got it from me.' I repeat: 'I don't think he could Telstra have got it from me'. Either you do believe it or you do not. The Leader of the Opposition was the person who masterminded, as Minister for Finance, the final repudiation of the Labor Party's 95-year commitment to public ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. This is the institution that Bob Hawke and Paul Keating said that, if it were sold, if it were privati sed, by a Liberal government, Ben Chifley would tum in his grave, the gumtree would suffer a sort of automatic combustion and everything that was dear and holy to the Australian way of life would be brought to an end. You are the fellow who presided over that. The truth of the matter is that, if the former government, by misadventure, had been returned to power at the last election, it would now be advocating the sale of 100 per cent of Telstra. Just as you went back on your commitments in relation to the Commonwealth Bank, in relation to Qantas and in relation to Australian Airlines, you have been hypocritical to the extreme on this issue. We put our cards on the table as long ago as 1985. The Liberal and National parties were courageous enough to champion the cause of privatisation. We paid some electoral price for doing so through the mid-1980s. You fed off it politically. You fomented every conceivable scare campaign. You lied to the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank. You lied to the trade union employees of the Commonwealth Bank. You misled the Australian people about Telstra. Why don't you be honest enough and man enough to stand up and say that what we are now doing is only a third of what you would have done if you had won the last election?",17
48,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,18
49,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on both sides of the House. Health Insurance,18
50,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, you confirmed yesterday that you were aware of the National Mutual, HBA and Australian Unity premium increases in budget week. When precisely did you inform the Prime Minister that you knew of each of these increases? In particular, did you inform the Prime Minister before his interview on the John Stanley program on 30 August? If you did not inform the Prime Minister, why not? Mr Martin Ferguson-Don't shake today.",18
51,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I have managed to calm down a bit. National Mutual and HBA are in fact the same health fund, so that is one. In relation to the second one, Australian Unity, I did not know before the budget. They informed me by letter on the 22nd. As to HBA, I found out because it was in the newspaper, as I said, and mailed to 200,000 contributors. I did not inform the Prime Minister that I had read in the Herald-Sun that the premiums were going up. It would be patently stupid to do so. Higher Education",18
52,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of comments made by the Leader of the Opposition supporting the government's funding strategy for higher education? Can the minister inform the House what the effect on university funding will be should the Senate not provide for changes to the higher education contribution scheme?",18
53,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know he has had a long interest in this area. I am aware of comments by the Leader of the Opposition. Members of this House will recall the attempt by the Labor Party to stir up hysteria before the budget over the government's higher education funding decisions, and they were totally wrong. Now that the government has brought down a set of reasonable, fair and responsible decisions seeking, amongst other things, to provide universities with the flexibility to improve their resourcing, it is not surprising that across the university sector there is strong support for the government's measures and advocacy that they should be passed through the Senate. This applies to old universities and new universities. The Vice-Chancellor of Ballarat University, Professor David James-this is a regional university-has said, 'The best thing they can do is leave the package alone.' Professor Alan Gilbert has described the views of the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats as being based on a 'dangerous delusion' and has said that 'the package has provided the Government with the chance to stabilise the funding base of Australian universities over the long term'. Professor Gavin Brown, the ViceChancellor of the University of Adelaide, has also called on the Labor Party and the Democrats not to block the government's higher education measures in the budget. The Leader of the Opposition knows that the government has acted responsibly. How do we know that? Because in 1993 he advocated a precisely similar strategy. On 18 October 1993 he said to this House: From time to time, when we have such a huge proportion of the budget going to higher education and when a savings target has been set, we must expect a deal of government attention to a savings target. I do not think anybody would disagree with the reasonableness of that proposition. When the government announces a savings target and when the government applies a savings target to the universities, you come out and say that that is no longer your view; you do not have a view like that any longer. In government you can express one view; in opposition you put a totally different view. Why is it that, when you spoke about the government's budget strategy, you said the government should get the budget balanced within three years? You told the universities that they were going to suffer as a result of this. Now you are telling the vice-chancellors that they do not know their business. The fact is that you cannot stick with a consistent line on policy. You have no policy. All you are about is spoiling the measures which will get this country out of debt and start getting jobs back for Australians. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition is too weak to drive this. He knows what is reasonable in this area, but he is too weak. He thinks Telstra should be privatised, but he is opposing it in the Senate. He thinks the budget should be brought back into balance, but he is opposing it in the Senate. He is too weak to drive this policy. Who is driving it? Is it the shadow Treasurer? No, he is suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome. Who is pushing this confrontational, spoiling policy on the opposition? Perhaps the answer is the member for Hotham-Simon Crean, the $2 billion man, the big spender. Simon Crean equals big spending, equals big deficits, equals Labor's strategy. That is where the drive is coming from. He is one of the biggest spoilers since Douglas Jardine. That is the problem you have. The Leader of the Opposition has to pull you into line; he has to make you support the sorts of policies that he supported in government. Why don't you get your policies right on higher education and start supporting those policies which will give Australian universities the chance to get the resources they need to offer an excellent education to young Australians over the next decade. Health Insurance",18
54,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that he intervened and made public statements about private health insurance on 28, 29 and 30 August. On how many occasions between budget week and 30 August did you or your staff speak with the office of the Minister for Health and Family Services or with the Minister for Health and Family Services? In any of those communications, did they inform you that the minister was aware of two funds having had approval to increase their rates? Did they inform you that the minister was aware in budget week that both funds had had increases?",19
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am sorry; would you mind repeating the last bit? I did not hear it.,19
56,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Did the minister in any of those,19
57,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, before that.",19
58,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Do you want me to go right to the very beginning?,19
59,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No.,19
60,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the Prime Minister that on 28, 29 and 30 August he publicly intervened and made statements about private health insurance. On how many occasions did you or your office communicate with the office of the Minister for Health and Family Services or with the Minister for Health and Family Services about health insurance? During those conversations, did the minister or his office advise you that the minister had been aware in budget week that two health funds had had approval for increases? Do you agree with the minister that it would have been patently stupid for him or his office to have advised you of those fund increases?",19
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot, I am sorry, answer all of those questions without checking with my office. Mr Lee-Can you take them on notice?",20
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Would you like me to take them on notice? Thank you, yes, I will. Small Business",20
63,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY - Mr Acting Speaker Mr Lee- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order is that you called the member for Dawson before she was on her feet.",20
64,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,She was rising.,20
65,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-My question is directed to the Treasurer. Our small businesses have suffered 13 years of the deficit and debt addicts on the other side of the House. My seat of Dawson is a regional centre and is dependent on small business. Treasurer, what plan do you have to give confidence and incentive to our small businesses?",20
66,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I appreciate the fact that she does ask questions about Treasury matters, because you do not get them from the shadow Treasurer-still, he is having clinical treatment for relevance deprivation syndrome. Mr Acting Speaker, you would be aware that, as part of the budget, the government announced significant improvements for rollover relief for small business in relation the capital gains tax. The rollover relief will encourage small and medium sized enterprises to continue to expand by increasing the size of their businesses and by allowing the rollover of assets. The features of the rollover relief announced in the budget are specifically targeted to small business. Rollover relief will be provided where the disposal and acquisition of some or all of the assets are for use in the same or another like kind business; where the proceeds from the disposal of an asset are reinvested within 12 months in the same or a like kind business; and where the taxpayer's tot-l net business assets, including passive and actIve assets, do not exceed $5 million. Taxpayers will be eligible to claim rollover relief once every five years. This is a long overdue tax reform. After it is introduced, it is expected to relieve small business of up to $150 million in taxation. To allow sufficient time for consultation with the tax professions and small business on the operation of the measure, the rollover relief provisions will apply from 1 July 1997. The consultation process is already under way. In addition to that, the government announced provisions to allow small business to rollover their savings into retirement. There are many small business proprietors who invest every dollar they have in their business, and they have the opportunity to use that not only as their livelihood but also as their savings. The relief of capital gains tax will also give them the opportunity to treat their business as part of their retirement planning. It is clear that these reforms are well overdue. It is clear that they underline a commitment to the small business sector by the coalition government. They are welcome reforms; they will be of strong benefit to small business. It is part of the government's plan to grow small businesses bigger and to create employment and to encourage business in this country. Health Insurance",20
67,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. to Mini-ter, were you or any member of your staff mformed by health funds, the Australian Health Insurance Association or your department that funds had applied for increased premiums? If so, which funds, when were you advised and by whom?",20
68,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will answer that question in stages. Was I advised by the department? No. I have had the department check, and they informed me that on no occ-sion, formally or. informally, had they adVIsed me about prIvate health insurance increases. Mr Lee-Applications?",20
69,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As to applications, I was told in the most general of terms that there was pressure in the system. I would say I said this publicly on at least two occasions. I said on the Channel 7 news on 28 May, on a Face to Face interview on 16 June, and at a post budget briefing to at least a dozen journalists that there was pressure in the system, predominantly relating to things that you had done in government. While I was aware in general terms that there were pressures in the system-and I had been absolutely open and honest about that I was not informed that applications were being made at any particular point in time. I found out, as the Prime Minister said, as a matter of courtesy after the decision had been made. Mr Lee-Applications?",21
70,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not know what you are going on about applications for. The department does not inform me. I have saidand it is there in black and white-that two health funds wrote to me after the event in recent times to tell me that it had been granted. As to what happened before,21

Speaker Halverson has developed a record and a precedent that, before he allows a supplementary question and determines whether or not he will allow it, he hears the supplementary question.

The Deputy Prime Minister would be aware of the serious economic difficulties being faced by families, small businesses and exporters in my electorate of Wannon and in many other parts of regional and rural Australia. Can the Deputy Prime Minister tell the House what the government is doing to assist rural and regional Australians and boost exports?",21

89,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The level of conversation is far too high.,22
90,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As this government completes its first six months in office-and with many more to come-history will show that we have turned away from the big deficits, the big federal government borrowings, which were the legacy of Labor. This budget not only reduces the deficit by some $7.2 billion in the course of two years but also, within that very challenging framework, moves forward on a range of key fronts for provincial Australia, for rural and regional Australia, to boost exports in the electorate the member for Wannon, and many other country electorates, to Asia and beyond. In that regard, the decision made by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, and others with respect to the diesel fuel rebate scheme was absolutely correct in the interests of the export effort of the nation. In that regard, $ I 50 million in capital gains tax rollover is the way to get small business back on its feet. The sooner the unfair dismissal law of Labor is abolished the better it will be for all small business. The reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor for small business from eight to six per cent is another big boost for provincial Australia. As for infrastructure, the Pacific way package has been delivered and the black spots road program reintroduced. The John Flynn scholarships and a boost for doctors in country areas have also been delivered. I would just add that there was another great agony created by the legacy of Labor; that is, the increasing gap in the educational opportunities of children beyond the capital cities with regard to primary education, secondary education and tertiary education. This budget increases the boarding allowance, it increases the primary correspondence allowance and it increases the secondary correspondence allowance. This budget, in short, delivers for all Australians, including country Australians. In respect of trade, it retains a better focused export market development grants scheme which will boost our exports to Asia and beyond. Health Insurance",22
91,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, now that you have had time to think, I ask you again: first, were you informed or was any member of your staff informed by health funds or the Australian Health Insurance Association that funds had applied for increased premiums? Secondly, how many health funds in the last month have lodged applications for increases and how many of those are still being considered by the government? Under the new administrative arrangements, have you informed the of Prime Minister of this information? If you haven't informed the Prime Minister, why haven't you?",22
92,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I gave a very detailed answer before. To that I will add that I am not informed of applications. As to my staff, I would have to check with them but I doubt that they would be either. As for future applications, we have changed that so we will be informed. Off the top of my head I can't tell you how many have applied in the last month but I can tell you that there have been two applications since 29 August, one under the old regime and one under the new regime. They are being processed in the normal manner and have not yet come to me for Highdecision. They have gone to the Private Health Insurance Advisory Council for advice on statutory reserves. Mr Lee-Have you told the Prime wise Minister?",22
93,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I haven't told the Prime Minister because I was only instructed, formed of it this morning by my department.

Every bit of intelligence I can get, every bit of feedback from my colleagues, everything I get from my own electorate and every other piece of informanitpick tion that I can possibly get my hands on tells me that what we are on here is an absolute winner. The fact is that we are dealing with sometake thing that is of mainstream interest to Australian population. You have never been able to come to grips with this issue. It put very succinctly by former health minister Graham Richardson who said the Australian Labor Party has always been a bit biased against private health insurance. Let me tell you what you did when you were in government: you made four changes that whacked private health insurance preAugust.' miums up. The first is that you changed the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. The second thing is you took away reinsurance pool.

You took all those away. You took away the Commonwealth's contribution to that; and the direct result is private premiums 39 per cent higher every one of than they need to be. You can knock, you can whinge, you can all you like but it is very interesting to have a look at the changed words of the Leader of the Opposition. Back on 8 August he was all hairy chested and saying, 'We will a very jaundiced view on this. We are the not going to implement something that is universally canned.' Yet on 6 September he was was saying, 'Oh, it's probably necessary to support the health insurance incentives.' What changed in a month?

Nuclear Testing",23
96,Mr HICKS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to for Foreign Affairs. What initialike tives has the government pursued in order to end nuclear testing? Can the minister confirm that Australia's efforts in this respect are about to come to a successful conclusion?,23
97,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question about an extremely issue, that of the future of the test ban treaty. As honourable members know, the government is strongly opposed to nuclear testing, not just because of the damage that nuclear testing can do but also because of the implications of a continuation of nuclear testing for nuclear proliferation. With that in mind, the government has taken a strong stand against nuclear testing where, in particular, China most recently has conducted nuclear tests. We have been delighted that China has brought its nuclear testing program to an end. The government also played an active role for a long time in the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Throughout that process, which lasted about 2Y2 years, Australia always played a constructive role. It was then a matter of great disappointment to us that the Conference on Disarmament was unable to reach the appropriate consensus on the text for a comprehensive test ban treaty, and there was a general view that the lack of consensus would lead to failure of the treaty to be concluded. We took the judgment that we should not allow 2'12 years of work and overwhelming international support for the text that was negotiated in the Conference on Disarmament simply to be wasted. As a result, the government took the initiative of taking that text to the General Assembly in New York and, over the last couple of weeks, we have been attempting to gain support-not just support but also co-sponsorship--for an Australian resolution in the General Assembly to open the comprehensive test ban treaty text for signature. I am glad to be able to report to the House that we have been able to get 126 co-sponsors for the Australian resolution, which is an extraordinary number and is slightly more than two-thirds of the members of the United Nations. This Australian resolution will be voted on in the next 24 hours-I assume early tomorrow morning Australia time-in New York, and obviously I am very confident that we will be successful in salvaging the comprehensive test ban treaty. This is a very important contribution that Australia has been able to make to the cause of banning nuclear testing. We have the support now of all five nuclear weapon states for the Australian resolution. We have all five nuclear weapon states now committed to signing the treaty and committed to the termination of nuclear testing. As a result of Australia's initiative and indeed the work that has been done over quite some years by the Australian delegations in Geneva and in New York, we have made a very valuable contribution to something I know all Australians regard as important-that is, bringing to an end the process of nuclear testing. We will await tomorrow but, as I said already, I am very confident that the Australian resolution will be supported and that as a result of that we will have made a very substantial contribution to the process of nuclear non-proliferation. Reef Tax Mr GARETH EV ANS-I ask a question of the Treasurer. Are you aware by now of the disastrous consequences for marine tour operators up and down the North Queensland coast of the 500 per cent increase in the reef tax announced in the budget? Did you consult with anyone in the industry or with your own industry minister or tourism minister before deciding to massively increase this tax, or was this breach of pre-election promise entirely your own work? Are you now going to back down on this decision?",23
98,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am surprised that we could have waitec so long and he could have brought forth so little. In relation to the Great Barrier Reef the government announced that it would be recovering costs involved in managing the reef. At $6 the user levy does not even recover the costs of management, and it is a question of cost recovery, which I would have thought would be plainly sensible and in the interests of those who use the reef, which is unquestionably a great natural asset and one that we on this side of the House want to preserve at all costs. Mr GARETH EV ANS-I wish to ask a supplementary question, Mr Acting Speaker.",24
99,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Could I hear the question?,24
100,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I assume from that that there will be no inquiry, no review and no backdown? Mr Reith-I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker.",25
101,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There was no point of order. Do you wish to raise a point of order? Mr Reith-Yes, I want to raise a point of order. We do have quite clear guidelines. You have said that you want to rely upon the directions of the Speaker in a letter from him at the end of May in which he said, firstly, that supplementary questions would be an irregular occurrence and furthermore that they ought to arise from the minister's response and would be regarded as part of the one question. This is simply an attempt to add a second question.",25
102,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am aware of that and I do not propose to accept that supplementary question.,25
103,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Given the fact that this government came to office with a very strong mandate from Australian families, what action has been taken to end the 13 years of neglect that they endured under Labor? Would the minister inform the House what initiatives are in the budget to help strengthen Australian families?",25
104,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"During the International Year of the Family it was revealed in Australia that seven out of 10 people considered that family life is the source of their greatest satisfaction. And yet under Labor the needs of families were ignored or forgotten. High interest rates, unemployment and the recession that we had to have caused terrible pain and agony for many Australian families, particularly in rural and regional Australia. In the lead-up to the election this government recognised and acknowledged the difficulties that Australian families faced. was further acknowledged in the budget and the problems that have been created in Australia for families, the tensions that have been created through a tax system that was not helpful to the raising of children and did not recognise the difficulties of raising a family were addressed. The budget will help families in a number of ways. The family tax initiative will be delivered on time and in full. The family tax initiative recognises the tensions and the difficulties that Australian families face in a financial sense. It is the most significant and the most comprehensive tax package that has ever been delivered to Australian families. There are some on the other side of the House who have been putting about in the community that the family tax initiative will not help working women in Australia. But I would just like to remind the House that there are 300,000 sole parent families in Australia, the majority of whom are women. For those women, the family tax initiative will give them a significant boost to family income. In addition to that, many Australian women work part time. We know that the majority of part-time jobs are occupied by women. Many of those women will also receive the benefit Families of the family tax initiative. Apart from the family tax initiative, there has been a significant boost to emergency relief funding. We know that the pressures on Australian families through the recession that we had to have have caused a crisis in some areas. When I visited Townsville recently and I met with the community aid groups in Townsville, I learned that they have had a 600 per cent increase in crisis for families. That has put considerable pressure on them. We have addressed that problem. We have recognised the pressure on aid delivery to Australian families in crisis. There has also been great concern in the Australian community in relation to the abuse and neglect of children. This has been exacerbated by the recent findings of the Wood royal commission in New South Wales. The difficulty in this area is that there is a growing number of children who are suffering from abuse and neglect in the community. In This recognition of that, the government has allocated funding for parent support and parent education programs. This is crucial: if we are going to be a compassionate society, a strong and cohesive society, we have to give due recognition to our children and to their care. In that respect, we have to deal with the problem of serious abuse and neglect of our young children. In relation to young people, we have the youth homeless pilot program which recognises that there are far too many young children out there-some 12,000 young people every night-who do not have a home to go to and who are considered homeless. These young people are also the most vulnerable in terms of abuse and neglect in the community. The Prime Minister, in recognition of that, has set up the youth homeless pilot program under the direction of Captain David Eldridge. We have in Australia today one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the Western world. This is often linked to their unemployment and to the recessions particularly in Australia where the problem is very acute. This government has addressed this problem by setting aside funding for a program in youth suicide that will support and sustain communities, help them to recognise the signals and make sure that young people in the community are supported and sustained. The supported accommodation program also helps those in our community who are homeless and, as I said, there are many thousands of young people who are homeless in our community. The supported accommodation program is also vital to women who are subjected to domestic violence-again, a growing problem in our community. Also in recognition of families, we have introduced marriage and relationship education and a national campaign against violence and crimes in recognition of the deep concern that the Australian community has for a growing number of people subjected to crime in the community.",25

107,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, the re-evaluation of the government's attitude toward family and the elevation of its status is long overdue in this community.

115,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. It is a serious question. Mr MCGauran-Oh, yeah! Like to try to convince us?",26
116,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Would you like to wait and hear it? Has the minister seen a report of comments by Mr Bob Officer, the Chairman of the government's National Commission of Audit, in which he describes the harsh budget measure to introduce an up-front fee for nursing home patients in the following terms: 'It's not a death tax. Instead of a pay as you go, it's a pay after you go (tax).' Does the minister support Mr Officer's description of that terrible budget measure?",26
117,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much for the question. I was getting a bit worried that the shadow minister was not going to get to ask me a question. It is usually the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who ask me the questions. I do not accept that proposition at all. We had inherited an age care system that was in total disrepair. It was in decline. The Labor government when it was in office was told three years ago that it needed to inject a considerable amount of capital into the nursing home sector. It failed to take that advice. In fact, I understand that the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, was a consultant to the former government in this respect. I wonder whether the government chose to ignore the advice or whether the advice was simply never given. But the fact is that we have an age care system that, as I said, was in decline. There was a serious problem for many residents of nursing homes. We inherited the problem. We have the responsibility to fix it. We will fix the problem. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme: Betaferon",26
118,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister confirm that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has recommended the listing of the multiple sclerosis drug Betaferon on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme? What is the minister's response to the committee's recommendation? What benefits will listing the drug have for thousands of Australians afflicted with multiple sclerosis, including young women like Trish Mifsud from Wallan in my electorate, who has highlighted the problems of MS sufferers?",27
119,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCEwen for her question. I would like to acknowledge the very large number of representations she has made on behalf of Mrs Mifsud and others. To be fair, representations have been made by a large number of honourable members from both sides of the House. In Australia, high cost drugs come onto the pharmaceutical benefits scheme after approval by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. This is not a political process; it is an expert scientific process that relies heavily on cost-effectiveness. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has considered Betaferon on five occasions-three under the previous government and two under this government. What has happened recently is that the drug company Schering has agreed to drop the price of the drug very substantially and has also agreed to pay the cost of monitoring and testing people on the drug to make sure it is effective. This has meant that, at the last meeting over last weekend, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee was able to recommend to the government that it list Betaferon on the PBS. Betaferon is a trade name for Beta Interferon, which offers some hope to people with mUltiple sclerosis. This is important because this illness up till now has had very little treatment-the only treatment being steroids. It reduces the number of relapses that people with mUltiple sclerosis have, but it has yet to be shown to actually reduce life expectancy in multiple sclerosis. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has recommended that Betaferon be made available to people with remitting relapsing multiple sclerosis where there have been two documented attacks over two years and this has been proved on magnetic resonance imaging scanning. A second authority will be given only to people who do not show progression of the illness once they have taken Betaferon and who have shown that they can comply with and tolerate therapy. Third and subsequent authorities will be given only if people have not been shown to develop antibodies or a type of resistance to the therapy. That will be on the basis of tests that the drug company will apply for. I have to personally see the recommendation, but the cost over a full year for this narrow group of people will be about $7 million. On receiving the advice, I am very well disposed towards approving it. Normally, this would come into effect from I February very 1997-and this has been the PBAC's recommendation. I am seeing whether there is any possible way that we could bring that forward and make it available earlier. Nursing Homes",27

125,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It really is very interesting that the shadow minister not only today but as she has been going around the country since the budget was announced keeps playing on this sick and frail aspect because it was the Labor government when it was in office that recognised that many older Australians as they become frail enter nursing homes and that those homes are to produce a homelike environment. We have recognised that a significant number-about 50 per cent-of residents entering nursing homes are there for a stay of less than six months. In recognition of that, we have excluded them from paying an entry contribution fee. We will not allow proprietors of nursing homes to charge an entry contribution fee for people entering into a nursing home for a stay of less than six months. Ms Macklin-What will they have to pay?",28
126,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They will not pay if they are there for a stay of less than six months. The entry contribution fee policy is not a compulsory policy. It is not under the hostel system. Ms Macklin-You are going to raise $130 million.,28
127,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow minister knows very well, as a consultant to the government, that this policy worked extremely effectively in the hostel sector. She is quite right in that it does have the capacity to raise $130 million a year. That is based on figures that are well known in the hostel sector today.",28

147,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Minister, how will apprenticeships assist the significant number of secondary school students who do not go on to tertiary education find employment?",29
148,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the great contrasts between the government and the opposition in our policies for young people is that we believe in getting young people into real jobs. One of the great historic pathways into real jobs has been the apprenticeship system. One of the tragedies of the previous government is that it virtually abandoned the apprenticeship system. It allowed it to wither on the vine. It did nothing to modernise it. It did nothing to expand opportunities in apprenticeships. As a consequence of this, in 1995, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest it had been for three decades. It is because of the apprenticeship decisions in this budget that this budget can truly claim to be a budget for young Australians. Over the next four years, this government will be putting some $200 million into the modernisation of the apprenticeship and training system. This money will be used to produce new apprenticeships in new industries, in information industries, service industries, and multimedia. It will be used to modernise the traditional apprenticeship system. It will encourage flexible hiring arrangements and multiple workplace placements for apprentices through the group training companies. One of the key innovations-and I think one of the most exciting innovations that has got tremendous public support-is that it will be used to develop school based apprenticeships. A young person can be in employment for a couple of days a week and spend three days a week in school studying for the offthe-job component. As outlined in the budget, over the next four years the government will be putting $187 million into the development of vocational education in schools. Over the last two weeks, as I have been visiting high schools around the country and talking to students, teachers and principals, I have found tremendous support for this initiative of the government. I draw the attention of the House to the reaction, first of all, of the Australian Secondary Principals Association who have strongly welcomed the government's decisions in this regard.

They know that the 30 per cent of students who drop out before year 12, for whom you provided essentially nothing except the unemployment queuesMr MCClelland- Mr Acting Speaker, on a point of order: with respect to the minister, 'you' had absolutely no role or purpose to provide any jobs. The honourable minister should have directed",30
153,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, I know the standing orders. The minister will direct his remarks through the chair.",30
154,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, Mr Acting Speaker. Let me draw the attention of the House also to the reaction of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry which represents many tens of thousands of small businesses around this country which will be party to the school based apprenticeships. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the following: We believe the Modem Australian Apprenticeship and Traineeship System (MAATS) will put greater emphasis on providing opportunities for the 75 per cent of secondary school leavers who do not go to university. MAATS will deliver the means for business to provide real employment opportunities for young Australians. Mr Acting Speaker, you could not get anything stronger than that. The fact is the government has heard young Australians. They were sick of being churned through the unemployment queues and put onto mickey mouse training programs. They want real jobs, real opportunities-and that is what this government will deliver.",30
155,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. We have had 20 questions today and it is 25 minutes after 3. It makes the last 13 years absolutely pitifUl. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Health Insurance",30
156,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I seek the chair's indulgence to add to an answer by has the Minister for Health and Family Services.",30
157,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"You have the chair's indulgence, Prime Minister.",30
158,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Reference was made in the course of a question asked by the member for Dobell and the answer given by the minister about knowledge of applications since, I think, 29 August. It is absolutely trueMr Lee--Since a month ago; it was a month ago.",30
159,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"You asked me about 29 AugustMr Lee--No, I asked you 'last month'.",30
160,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I am talking of 29 August, which is the question you asked me yesterday. Anyway, in the context of those recent applications it is true, as the minister said, he did not tell me of them. That is true. But I have checked with my staff and I understand that the minister's very efficient staff informed my equally efficient staff of them this morning.",30
161,Unknown,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Opposition members interjecting,30
162,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"They just told me. Mr Lee-I seek your indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker.",30
163,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"No, you don't have a go. You have had your go.",30
164,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,No. Resume your seat.,30
165,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Acting Speaker, on a point of order: do you have independence in your chair, or do you just operate on the orders of the Prime Minister? He has been shouting at you that there should be no indulgence. Indulgence is within your discretion and, traditionally, you are entitled to exercise that discretion without interference from the Prime Minister on a matter which has been raised by an honourable member in the form of a question which then provokes an additional answer. The tradition is that you then give indulgence to the other person to speak. Mr Reith- Mr Acting Speaker, on a point of order",30
166,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,It is up to him. You are ordering him not to.,31
167,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"No, I am not. Mr Reith- Mr Acting Speaker, the excited remarks of the Leader of the Opposition clearly a reflection on the chair basis, he should be asked to withdraw. Mr Lee- Mr Acting Speaker, on the point of order: you know the issue I wish to raise on indulgence. I believe that you have a responsibility to allow me to raise that point on indulgence.",31
168,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I have,31
169,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,You can seek leave.,31
170,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"No, just a Opposition moment. The chair has the ability and the discretion to grant indulgence to anybody. It is true that the member for Dobell consulted me earlier and said that he wished to seek indulgence. I reflected on what he told me and it seemed, on reflection, that he was motion. going to ask another question and that was inappropriate. I would suggest that, if he wished to, he could put a question on notice. Mr Lee- Mr Acting Speaker, on a further point of order: I was seeking an assurance from the Prime Minister that he would give us an answer in writing to the question he took on notice by the time the House rose. That is what we are asking for.",31
171,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I am happy to respond that. When I took,31
172,Unknown,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Opposition members interjecting,31
173,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,He did not instruct the Acting Speaker to sit him down! Mr Leo MCLeay-Have you given him the call or not? You are hopeless.,31
174,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Order! The member for Watson! Return to your seat!,31
175,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,If the member for Dobell is seeking to know when I will respondMr Lee-By the end of today.,31
176,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Hang on. I'll decide when I respond, not you. If the member for Dobell wants to know, I can inform him that, after I said I would take the question on notice, I spoke to my staff and I said that we should endeavour to provide that answer to you this afternoon and I will certainly endeavour to do that. I cannot give a categorical assurance that I will but I will endeavour to to the best of my ability. I had, an hour and a quarter ago, are set arrangements in train to provide that and, on that answer by this afternoon. Mr Reith-I put the point of order to you again, Mr Acting Speaker: the fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition implied that you were subject to direction by the Prime Minister. That is clearly wrong. That is clearly a reflection on the chair, and he should be asked to withdraw it.",31
177,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I certainly take the point that I believe the Leader of the did reflect on the chair. I ask him to withdraw or move a substantive motion.,31
178,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I am not going to have a quarrel with the chair on this.",31
179,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Go on then. Move a,31
180,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,If you take offence,31
181,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I do.,31
182,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"If you take offence at anything that I have done, then I withdraw. But I might say, Mr Acting Speaker",31
183,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I wouldn't say it.,31
184,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Then I will ask for an indulgence. Will you grant the Leader of the to Opposition an indulgence?,31
185,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"If you are asking, yes.",31
186,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"On indulgence, then, Mr Acting Speaker, it is obvious to all members of the House that during that particular interchange which led me to make that accusation, and you have assured me that you were not in any way influenced by it",31
187,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I was not.,32
188,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I have accepted that, and I have withdrawn on the basis of that. But, right through that period of time up to you making that determination on a reasonable proposition of giving advance notice by the honourable member for Dobell-a question, I might say, which he sought to ask under indulgence, which the Prime Minister subsequently answered but was not given indulgence to-the Prime Minister was screaming orders at you. He was screaming at you repeatedly, ordering you to not act in that fashion. Mr Reith-I take a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. I raised originally a point of order on the basis that there was a reflection on the chair. That reflection has been withdrawn. The Leader of the Opposition then sought indulgence. He is not entitled to take the indulgence and repeat the accusation which led to the matter being raised and the withdrawal being made. On that basis, Mr Acting Speaker, my point of order is that the Leader of the Opposition has now chosen to go beyond the indulgence that you provided and simply used your generous discretion and the use of your office to repeat the allegation that he first made. On that basis, he should required to sit down.",32
189,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"On that point of order, Mr Acting Speaker, I was not repeating the accusation that your determination, which led to my withdrawal, had been based on screamed instructions from the Prime Minister. I was not repeating the accusation. What I was pointing out was that the Prime Minister was nevertheless screaming such instructions. And if it is a reflection on the chair to draw a link between the two, it is a pretty poor reflection on the chair to think that you need assistance from him.",32
190,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"On indulgence, Mr Acting SpeakerOpposition members-Apologise! Apologise!",32
191,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I have risen on indulgence to reject the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition that I was 'screaming instructions' at you. I was certainly expressing my views very directly to the Leader of the Opposition, and I certainly don't apologise for that. Mr Martin Ferguson-You have a short memory.",32
192,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,We don't move on your orders.,32
193,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,The Leader of the Opposition does not have the call.,32
194,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I tell you what,32
195,Unknown,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Opposition members interjecting Mr Reith-We give him leave.,32
196,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Yes, he can have leave. NA NA Standing Orders  Acting Speaker. Mr Speaker has been in the habit of responding to members about different points that arise about his particular interpretation of standing orders, which generally I would commend. However, it places all members at the disadvantage that they are not be in receipt of or do not benefit from his particular view about those standing orders and, if the political parties in this chamber are so informed, I am sure the Independents would be left in the dark. Could you raise with Mr Speaker Mr Andren-They usually are.  rightly so.' Mr Acting Speaker, could you raise with Mr Speaker on his return whether or not a system could be developed so that all members may have the benefit of his wisdom in relation to standing and sessional orders rather than the recipient of his particular letter?",32
197,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I will certainly consult with the Speaker on his return. I see no reason why there should be any secrets in terms of those rulings. Member for Hotham,32
198,Mr RANDALL,SPEAKER,"Mr Acting Speaker, when the member for Hotham was removed from the chamber earlier today, did I observe him speaking tersely to you as he left? If he did, did you hear it and, if you heard it, what do you intend to do about it?",33
199,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I thank the honourable member for Swan for his question. I am aware that the member for Hotham said one or two things as he left. I took no offence at what he said. It is at my discretion to take offence or not. Questions on Notice,33
200,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,SPEAKER,"Pursuant to standing order 150, I would request that you write to the Minister for Health and Family Services seeking reasons for the delay in answering a question on notice to him, which I lodged on 26 June, concerning Medicare services in the electoral division question No. 478, which I would have thought he had an interest in answering.",33
201,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I will certainly do so. Newspaper Distribution,33
202,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SPEAKER,"In view of the Minister for Health and Family Services advising the House earlier today that the way for members to stay informed was read the stories he gets in the newspapers from the health funds, will you reconsider the decision of your superior, the Speaker, to reduce the number of newspapers members get so that we can all stay as well informed as the minister for health expects us to?",33
203,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I thank the Chief Opposition Whip for his question. I point out that the decision was one of the Presiding Officers because of the financial exigencies. But I also advise him and all other members that, if they can get their little pinkies working on their keyboards, they have the full AAP news service available, which is probably a better source of news than anyone paper.

205,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Dobell proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The consequences for the Australian people who will not receive the full benefit of the tax rebate for private health insurance in their pockets despite the assurance of the Minister for Health on night that they would do so. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",34
206,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have two accusations to make against the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). First, he has misled the Australian people and he has also misled his leader about what has happened with this entire debacle. That is the first accusation we against you, Minister. The second accusation we make is that contributors will not get the full benefit of the tax rebate, as you promised them on budget night. They are the two accusations that we are going to pursue in this debate this afternoon, in question time tomorassured row and throughout every day-until you, Minister, come clean and until this govern this ment and this Prime Minister (Mr Howard) come clean with us and tell us exactly what has been happening about these increases private health insurance. For 13 years while in opposition, the eral and National parties have been working on a health policy which they say will address the problems that are out there in the comhe munity. The only solution they came up with in those 13 years in the wilderness was a magic wand that would give people a tax rebate for their private health insurance. After 13 years of work in the wilderness, it is tax rebate for private health insurance that will solve all of the problems. And what do we find after only six This government's $1.7 biIIion carrot, $1.7 billion in tax rebates for private health insurinquiries ance, is virtually stolen away through increases in the premiums of the private health insurance funds. Mr Leo MCLeay-And he knew about it.",34
207,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And, as the Chief Opposition Whip interjects, we want to know, Minister, when you knew . You have told the parliament that you knew in budget week that two funds had approval from your department to increase their premiums. We asked you yesterBudget day and today how many other funds had advised you that they had applied for increases. We note with interest that you have taken a few things on notice this afternoon, and we will be reading veryDr Wooldridge interjecting",34
208,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You told me· that you were going to check with your staff about whether they were advised by the health funds. Dr Wooldridge interjecting,34
209,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Sorry, you would check, but you did not say you would tell me; is that what you have just said? Is that what you have make said: that you would check but that you would not necessarily tell me? Dr Wooldridge interjecting",34
210,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"A minister of the Crown says across the table in a debate on an MPI that he the House of Representatives that he would check with his staff-and then he tells House that he will not necessarily advise the House of the outcome of those inquiries. Remember the new standards of accountain bility that Prime Minister Howard was going to establish for the Australian parliament? The Libnew standards of accountability in the Australian parliament are exposed before us this afternoon. The minister assures the House that will check with his staff and he will tell us whether his staff were told by the health funds that they had applied for the increases. The minister assures the House that he will investigate this question that is raised by the the opposition-and today on the MPI, when the press gallery is almost empty, he makes it clear that he is not actually going to tell us months? the outcome of the inquiries. Minister, what is the point of making the if you do not tell anyone? Were you intending to tell the Prime Minister or the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or any of your other colleagues about the outcome of your inquiries? Is it only the opposition and the press who were not going to find out about the outcome of the inquiries you are going to make? Minister, we are determined to find out to what extent you knew about these increases before budget week, before the week you were running around the country on radio, on television, giving briefings to the health journalists, telling people that this government would ensure that the contributors would get the full value of those tax rebates. That is what you were saying. You would ensure that the full benefit of those tax rebates ended up in the contributors' pockets. Minister, what has happened in the couple of weeks you have been overseas? What has happened is that we have had Australian Unity and HBA increase their rates. A couple with Australian Unity have lost $187 a year of their tax rebate; with HBA, they have lost $126. People who have family private health insurance with Manchester Unity have lost $323. For a couple, the tax rebate is only worth $250-and the rate has gone up $323. So those family couples are $73 a week worse off-yet the tax rebate does not cut in until next July. Minister, what are you going to do to ensure that those couples get the full benefit of the tax rebate? What do you intend to do to ensure that the full benefit of that tax rebate ends up in their pockets? Minister, we know that you knew all along that these increases were going to take place. You knew all along that they were going to take placeand you did nothing. You did not ask your department to sit down with the funds. You did not try to extract some guarantee from the funds in return for this $1,700 million tax rebate. You did not seek some assurance from the funds that they would moderate the increases in their premiums. You were not prepared to ask them to wait until 1 July when the tax rebate was meant to make a difference to the viability of the funds. No, you completely gave away the $1.7 billion tax carrot without getting any assurances or guarantees from the funds in return. We are entitled to ask: is this $1.7 billion being well spent? Think how many public hospitals you could have built with $1.7 billion. Think how many extra operations could have been performed in public and private hospitals around the country with the $1.7 billion. Minister, why didn't you try to extract those assurances from the health funds before you simply gave it away? What really happened is that the government offered the money with the tax carrot and the health funds turned it into a lemon. They snatched away that $1.7 billion. That means that the money will not end up in the contributors' pockets. To every member of the public in the gallery today, to every Australian who will feel the increases in the premiums taking away the benefits of the tax rebate, I say: this is the man to blame-Dr Michael Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Human Services-who took no action when he knew that these premium increases were going to flow through. This is the person who did not direct his department to intervene and take some action. John Howard's minister for health failed to act when it was necessary to make sure that John Howard's government could keep the promises made on budget night and have the benefit stay in the pocket of the contributors. But it was not just in budget week that the government was shooting its mouth off. The Prime Minister, as late as 28 August, made this promise to the Australian people: However you look at it, people will get the full value, the full measure, the full benefit of the tax rebate that was announced in the budget. That was the Prime Minister on 28 August after this minister had known for three weeks that one fund was increasing its premiums and had known for at least 10 days that a second fund, Australian Unity, was increasing its premiums. Here is the Prime Minister saying to the contributors that they would get the 'full value, the full measure, the full benefit' of the tax rebate. It is clear that the government has failed to keep even the commitments made by the Prime Minister as late as 28 August. One of the things we will keep probing is what this minister told the Prime Minister before 28 August. Minister, we want to know: did you or your office tell the Prime Minister or his staff that you knew about the increases that were coming through? We also want to know how many of the other funds advised you that they had applied for increases. Sure, you have told us about the two funds which had approval from the department, but how many other funds had told you that they had applied? And did you tell the Prime Minister that these increases were also in the pipeline? There are so many contradictions in this whole debate. We had the Prime Minister saying, 'If I had been told about these increases I would have requested that they be announced publicly and openly.' If that was good enough for the Prime Minister why was it not good enough for you? Why is it not good enough for the minister for health in the Prime Minister's government to announce publicly and openly before the budget was brought down that the increases were coming? Minister, we want to know whether you have misled not only the Australian people but also the Prime Minister, and whether you have caused the Prime Minister to mislead the Australian people. As recently as last Monday, your own parliamentary secretary, Dr Bob Woods, said on the Witness programMr Leo MCLeay-He wants the job.",34
211,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He definitely does want the job, you can be sure of that-or Dr Brendan does; either one. On the Witness program the minister's own parliamentary secretary said: But Minister Wooldridge didn't know about the fee rises which were actually in the pipeline at the time. Your own parliamentary secretary said that to the Australian public three or four weeks after you knew that the increases were coming through. He misled the viewers of the Witness program. How do you explain that? How do you explain the fact that your representative in the Senate, Senator Newman-who had been the acting minister for health during the time you were away-said in the Senate yesterday about the letters you got from the funds: I understand that the minister's office did receive correspondence from health funds as a courtesy but that that information was not translated or transferred to the minister. Minister, you came into the House yesterday and said that you were aware, while your, own representative in the Senate, almost at the same time, was telling the Senate that your office had received the correspondence but you had not seen it. We also know that your office told the media that you were not aware. I quote the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 August: A spokesman for Dr Wooldridge said the Government had no knowledge of the increases but that if it had, it would have made no difference. We all know that the journalists in the press gaIlery who look after the health round were told by the minister's office that he was not aware of the fact that the increases were coming through. Yet yesterday in this parliament the minister told us that he had known about the HBA increases for three weeks before the budget. The minister told the House yesterday that he did know about Australian Unity getting approval to increase their premiums in budget week. Yet, minister, your office was telling the Sydney Morning Herald and all the other journalists that they had it wrong. Minister, what has happened? Why do you not know what is happening in your office? Why was your office handing out misleading information to journalists and, indirectly, to the Australian people? These are the sorts of questions we want you to answer because we are determined to hold you accountable. The minister was off overseas, the Prime Minister got an explosive public reaction to the fact that people were losing their tax rebate, and what happened? The Prime Minister intervened, determining that in future he, the Treasurer and the minister for health would make decisions on future increases. What a vote of no confidence in this minister for health that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer had to intervene in this issue. It is not as though this minister is not aware of this sort of behaviour in the past. On the Sunday program in March the minister talked about this. He was asked by Laurie Oakes about whether he had learned anything from his MBA thesis on the Fraser government's debacle with health policy. He said that in those days: ... the people deciding the policy were separate from the people implementing the policy; and second, there was a complete breakdown between the Health Minister and his department, and the Government and the department. So they're two mistakes that won't be made again. Minister, after only six months it is clear that it has already happened again in your time. Laurie Oakes went on to ask you about who was deciding policy in the Fraser years. You said in reply: In the 1970s, it was the Prime Minister's department and Treasury, but things are quite different today. Minister, after only six months we have the Prime Minister intervening, allegedly with your support, and we are going to have the Prime Minister and Treasurer working with you in the future to approve future increases. Laurie Oakes then asked him-wait for this; this is the killer: . .. John Howard's promised less interference anyway. Do you think he realises the same mistakeand Michael Wooldridge said in reply: I'm sure he does. John Howard wants his Ministers to govern and I think that's going to be a real challenge for us and very exciting. It has been very exciting for us at question time, and it is very clear that what the minister said would never happen-he said we would never get a repeat of the Fraser years with John Howard, Treasurer, and Malcolm Fraser, Prime Minister, interfering with the health minister-we have got after only six months. We have got John Howard, Prime Minister, and Peter Costello, Treasurer, interfering with the way you do your job-the very thing you promised us would not happen. You said that in the 1970s it was the Prime Minister's department and Treasury deciding policy but that things are very different today. Minister, we certainly know what is different today. We know that you have misled the public. We suspect you have misled your leader. We suspect you caused your leader to mislead the public. We will make sure that you are held accountable for the fact that contributors will not get the full benefit that you promised. We will hold you accountable for the fact that contributors will not get in their pockets the full benefit of that tax rebate, because we are determined to make sure that this government and this minister are held accountable for the con they have pulled on the Australian public over health insurance.",36
212,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (3.54 p.m.)I am delighted to be able to reply to this. I will say categorically: I have not misled the public; and I will say categorically: I have not misled my leader. It may take you on the other side a while to get used to this but, unlike my immediate predecessor in the health portfolio, I do not tell fibs. The fact is this is a monumental beat-up. It is unbelievable that you have been able to take this as far as you have. But I am very happy for you to do so because every day you draw attention to private health insurance rebates, every day you show your irrelevance and the reason why you are in opposition. Let me just go through the chronology of this so that I can make the situation utterly clear. When we came into government we kept going a procedure that had been in place at least since Neal Blewett issued a delegation in 1984 but probably for 20 years. We kept in place your system. It is true that since then there have been 23 increases from Australian health funds and these ones were in the pipeline anyway. They would have happened whether the Labor Party had been returned to government or whether the coalition was in government. These have nothing to do with the health insurance rebates we are offering but everything to do with your mismanagement of private health insurance because of your ideological blinkers. Mr Bevis-It was just a terrible coincidence!",37
213,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is hardly a coincidence that funds put their fees up. It has been happening for 12 years, and the rate of increase is no different from anything that you had during the past 12 years. So you cannot put a case at all. If anything, the rate of increase has been less than what you managed during the last four years. Mr Leo MCLeay-Look! She could only get one! Opposition members-Ha, hal",37
214,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You can stay over there, happy and laughing, as long as you like. What was followed in my department is what has been followed, as I said, for a decade, and that is these increases are applied for and approved by the department. I was not informed by my department that these were in the pipeline. So, when my parliamentary secretary, Senator Woods, said that I did not know about the fee increase in the pipeline, he was absolutely correct. I did not know that the fees were coming through because I was not informed until after the event. Mr Leo MCLeay-You're pretty hopeless, then, aren't you.",38
215,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, I am merely doing what you instituted. It is your system. You cannot seem to get that through your thick skull. It is your system. Mr Leo MCLeay-You let the budget get compromised.",38
216,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Watson will cease interjecting.,38
217,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If we made a mistake, it was that we allowed the system that you had been going under for 12 years to continue. Secondly, when Senator Newman said the minister's office received correspondenceOpposition member interjecting",38
218,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It is in no way different from what I said. The fact is that Senator Newman said I did not know before the increases were approved.,38
219,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,38
220,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! Those on my left will cease interjecting. Mr Leo MCLeay-We are trying to help.,38
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,No. The honourable member for Watson knows that he should not be interjecting. He is not in his place.,38
222,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Nothing that Senator Woods has said as my parliamentary secretary and nothing that Senator Newman has said as my representative in the other place is in any way out of keeping with the fact that I did not know about any of these approvals before they were made by the department. What the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said while I was overseas was that I was informed as a matter of courtesy after the event happened, and that is true. I have said that I was informed as a matter of courtesy by National Mutual-the letter is date stamped 26 Julyand I was informed by Australian Unity in a letter after the budget, on 22 August. These were both after the department made the decision. Mr Kerr interjecting",38
223,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The honourable member for Denison has made a considerable contribution to this debate, but he will cease from doing so.",38
224,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As for the budget and the other allegations that are made about the full benefit, you have to look at the context in which that was made. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was quoted as saying prior to the budget, on 8 August, on the ABC, 'The health funds will simply increase their premiums to absorb the rebate.' He is trying to scare people that the premiums will go up because of the rebate. It was because of that that on budget night we made the funds report to PHIAC as to their reserves, and we would make sure that we would not do anything other than what was necessary for the prudential management of the funds. Quite simply there are two separate issues here that you cannot seem to grasp. One is the ongoing problem of health fund increases and the second is the benefit that might come from the rebates. Let me tell you first about the problem that health funds are facing, because that was what the honourable member interjected about. The crisis in private health is quite simple. In government, you whacked costs onto the private health insurance industry that were equal to a 39 per cent increase in premiums. That made younger, fitter people and families drop out and older people stay in the funds. So the age group is being increasingly skewed towards older people and you have a spiral where older people stay in and fit, young people drop out. The difficulty with this is that when you were in government you effectively destroyed community rating. You would talk about it. But in relation to all your actions-the actions that were underpinning Medicare when it was designed-you needed to have a viable private sector to complement a viable public sector. So we designed our privilte health insurance incentives very specifically to try to bring back in the people who were dropping out, such as families, and that is why they got the added benefit. At no stage did I ever say that health funds would stop increasing their premiums. It is patently absurd to think that all of a sudden health funds are going to be able to say, 'We have put our premiums up once a year because costs keep going up. All of a sudden we are going to stop doing it.' There have been rumours of nine funds putting up their premiums. I cannot find which nine funds these rumours are supposed to refer to, but there is a document from the Private Health Insurance Advisory Council that lists 10 funds so I think this must be the one that is being mentioned. The majority of those funds that have put up their premiums in recent times have done so because they have dropped below the statutory reserves. What you said in your debate before was that somehow I should have said, 'No, wait until 1 July next year.' That is patently ridiculous. The result of that would be for me to cause the collapse of health funds. That is what you are suggesting by saying that somehow I shouldn't have approved these. Of two other funds that increased their premiums, one did so because it had not increased premiums for four years and the other did so because it had not increased premiums for 2Y2 years. Two other funds that increased their premiums did so to try to cope with the 100 per cent cover that you introduced last year. The direct result of your policy last year was to make two funds put up their premiums-two others increased premiums because they had not done so for up to four years and all the rest did so to meet statutory obligations. So what on earth are you suggesting I do-say to funds, 'You cannot stay under statutory requirements'? That is clearly absurd. There is also this suggestion going around that I knew about something and that I should have said it. The fact is that I did. You can look at anything I have said publicly, and I gave two examples in question time, or you can look to what I said at a briefing of journalists after the budget. I have been open, honest and frank about the problems in the private health insurance industry. I have said quite specifically that there have been premium rises coming through and I have never walked away from that. You have tried to pretend that somehow what is happening will gobble up the benefit. I have news for you: even with the premium increases taken into account, the average benefit to families in Australia will be a 20 per cent reduction in health insurance premiums, and many will be up to 30 per cent. So this will still be of enormous benefit to Australian families. The shadow minister, the member for Dobell C Mr Lee), is prattling on, 'What about Manchester Unity?' Again, this is indicative of the selective understanding he has of the problem. What he has chosen to do is to try to portray the top increase of every fund as the increase applying across all funds. Manchester Unity's increase was substantial on its top table and not substantial on its basic table. As far as I can see, they got the top table wrong because they mis-priced your promise of 100 per cent cover. A lot of the problems of the very large increases-there have been some, and we would have much preferred them not to have happened-relate to the promises and expectations raised by the previous health minister, Dr Lawrence, when she introduced her so called 100 per cent cover in 1995. The fact is that many funds did get it wrong and did have to reprice it. This is interesting, because the previous health minister was saying, 'This 100 per cent cover is actually going to lead to a drop in premiums.' Wrong; it has led to up to a 20 per cent increase in some premiums. But, across the whole range of premiums, the rate of increase is less than when you lot were in government. So it is hard to see, quite frankly, what you are on about. Again, there is the notion that the Australian public is not getting the full benefit of the private health insurance rebates. The fact is that on 1 July next year they will drop by $450 at least for a family with an income under $70,000. They will get the full benefit. What will happen between now and then is that some more people will drop out of private health insurance, and that was patently clear in our budget documents. The second thing that will happen is that premiums will go up, and we have always been quite open about it. But to say that $450 has virtually been stolen away, when you pick the worse possible example and try to pretend that applies across the board, is simply untrue, because the average premium increase of the 23 funds that have increased their premium is 6.1 per cent. That is not 6.1 per cent across 48 funds; that is 6.1 per cent across 23 funds. Mr Lee-Which table?",38
225,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is 6.1 per cent on the basic table, across the lot. Mr Lee-What about the top table?",40
226,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Top table is about nine per cent. The top table you can take directly back to your introduction of 100 per cent cover. If you increase it across the whole of the health funds, it is still quite a deal than what you did. The only massive increase in premiums that has occurred in recent years was in 1991-92. When you were in government, there was a 17 per cent increase in premiums in one year. You cannot get away from that. You have said to me that somehow I knew all along that this was happening and that I should have stopped it. I did not know all along that funds were applying for increases. I knew all along that there was pressure because of long standing problems that you had introduced, but I did not know the scope, the size or the details of any of the increases until after they had happened. So to say that I am somehow to blame for increases in private health fund premiums is ridiculous. If anyone is to blame, it is the previous Labor Party, which whacked an extra 39 per cent in costs onto the health funds. To say that I took no action is only to say that I was following a procedure that had been in place certainly for 12 years and probably for 20 years. To say that I misled the public is quite incorrect. I have been open and frank with the public, as demonstrated by the fact that I have been prepared to acknowledge that there were pressures in the system. To say that I misled the leader is completely incorrect because the leader's comments have been exactly spot on. The leader's comments were that at the time. I did not know of the increases and I was not informed until after the event. The simple fact is that you are showing that you do not understand why you lost government. You can knock, you can come up with no alternative and you can nitpick, but in the end this is an issue that is relevant to mainstream Australia and we will introduce these premiums with pride. They will be of substantial assistance to families who need help and who would get nothing under you. (Time expired)",40
227,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The ability of governments to deliver on election promises competently is always a matter of public importance. Prior to the election, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) sang the praises of less his policy which he promised would get more Australians back into private health insurance. At the same time, he gave absolute commitments that Medicare would be preserved in its entirety. But, six months later, the health minister's grand plans have turned to dust. The great hope of the Liberal Party wets, the former deputy leader, has bombed out and, in doing so, has caused his own leader collateral damage. This minister might know how to spend in excess of $200,000 getting himself elected, he might know a bit about push polling, but this afternoon we are going to have a look at his record as Minister for Health and Family Services and as the member for Chisholm. I think the last thing anyone would want to have said about them after their time in this place would be that they let down and sold out their own electorate-the very people who put their trust in them, the very people who put them here - of Labor's great This minister's six months in office have been absolutely extraordinary. We have had the closure of the Clayton Medicare office; we have had the loss of the dental health program, which serviced, in the last year, over 4,000 Chisholm constituents; we have had a blow-out of the number of people waiting on trolleys at the Monash Medical C't!ntre; and we have had the breaking of promises' on health funding made to Box Hill people. You would think this minister had a margin of 20 per cent, not a margin of 2Y2 per cent. Firstly, we have the health insurance premium increases. The minister told us all that he would ensure the value of the coalition's private health insurance rebate stayed in the pockets of Australians. Did he not realise that the rebate was simply going to be soaked up by premium increases, that it has amounted to nothing more than a pay-off of private health funds, that it was simply a gift to those private health insurers? Yesterday, and indeed this afternoon, the minister stressed the modesty of premium increases by private health insurers under the coalition, claiming that there is a 6.1 per average increase. It is a bit difficult to tell that to our own constituents. For example, in my electorate Mr and Mrs Hayward of Pascoe Vale, who are members of Australian Unity, have just been advised that their premium will increase by some $36 a month to $444 a year. Mr Lee-How much?",40
228,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"To $444 a year. In percentage terms, that is not 6.1 per cent. That is not even 12 per cent. It is a massive 18 per cent. So the value of the rebate has effectively been wiped out a year before it comes into effect. How is that supposed to act as an incentive for the Hayward family to remain in private health insurance? The unpleasant reality for the minister is that across Australia there are REPRESENTATIVES 3845 thousands of families like the Haywards who have been hit by very substantial increases and for whom the coalition's rebate has done absolutely nothing to make private health insurance more affordable. Secondly, we have seen the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program. One successes in its last term was this program. The value of the program should not be underestimated. In the minister's own electorate of Chisholm, 4,298 concession card holders and pensioners were treated last year. There are almost 30,000 concession card holders in Chisholm for whom that dental health program was a valuable service. We have received as recently as today information from the Victorian dental hospital saying that waiting lists for dental care will blowout from six months to 11 years if this government's budget goes through. In February, the minister, as a candidate, happily put out fliers assuring pensioners that all of their entitlements would be preserved, that concessional card holders had nothing whatsoever to worry about. Very shortly after the election, he put on his Expenditure Review Committee hat and declared that the program had achieved its goals and could be scrapped. So the 30,000 Chisholm voters were shamefully misled by the health minister as he pedalled the coalition's hollow promises. For them, this decision comes as a cruel blow. cent When he was asked about the future of the program earlier this year he said: It's particularly important when people get into a nursing home too, because you might have someone who has put a lot of effort into dental care over the years and once they get into a nursing home there's no alternative. The minister has discovered the solution to this problem: you simply prevent people from entering nursing homes in the first place by hitting them with a $30,000 entry contribution. Who is going to worry about their teeth when they are slugged with a $30,000 bill? Thirdly, we have had the closure of Medicare offices. In December last year, the minister made a solemn declaration, 'The coalition provides an absolute commitment to keep Medicare in its entirety.' What the minister hid from his electorate was the plan to close Medicare offices-84 of them. The Medicare offices closed include the Clayton office, which provided a vital service to people in his own electorate. Try telling the elderly pensioners in Clayton that they will have to line up in a pharmacy or take a train and bus to Chadstone shopping centre to get a Medicare refund and see if they believe the minister has honoured the coalition's commitment. Fourthly, you have the issue of hospital funding for the states, another solemn coalition commitment, 'We will not cut public hospital funding.' But what do the budget papers reveal? Hospital funding for the states is to be slashed by $800 million-just what Victorian hospitals need, I can tell you! Let me take the minister back to his local paper. On 20 February it stated: ... if voters gave him the chance he would address the problems in the states hospitals ... it desire to do something about the pain and suffering he saw in hospitals that led him into politics. Voters gave him that chance-and how has he repaid them? This week we read of a doubling in the number of patients forced to wait on trolleys for more than 12 hours at St Vincent's and the Royal Melbourne Hospital over the past year. There were 400 patients on trolleys at the Royal Melbourne in June-up 98 per cent on last year. At St Vincent's there were 124 patients waiting on trolleys for more than 12 hours in August and almost 40 were left for more than a day. It is little wonder that the St Vincent's Director of Emergency Care, Dr Andrew Dent, described these delays as inhuman. What has the minister done since his re-election to make Victorian hospitals betteras he promised he would? He has done absolutely nothing. The Premiers Conference saw his not so good mate the Treasurer (Mr Costello) knock off $1.5 biIIion in grants to the states, a third of which could have gone into health funding-and the budget was even worse. There was $800 million to be pulled out. The only conclusion one can draw is that the minister, through his silence, endorses the way Jeff Kennett is destroying the public health system in Victoria. Even when Premier Kennett plans to close the Burwood Hospital in the minister's own electorate, we hear nothing. This is a minister who, sadly, won't stand up to the Premier because he needs his support at pre-selection time, to keep the Treasurer at bay. So what we conclude is that we have a minister who is asleep at the wheel. As an example of his confusion, let me remind the House of the minister's declaration yesterday that he was on top of absolutely everything to the exact detail. This came immediately after he told the House that anyone who had read the Herald-Sun on 23 July would have seen an advertisement from National Mutual about higher premiums. Unfortunately for the minister, there is no such National Mutual advertisement in the Herald-Sun edition of that day. There was an advertisement some days later, but not on the 23rd. He needs to was his look at that before he regards himself as someone on top of absolutely everything to the exact detail. I want to remind the minister of his can dour when speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald earlier this year. It reported him saying that if the coalition's health policy is a flop his constituents will almost certainly vote him out. Well, the coalition's health policy can be nothing other than a flop because the minister responsible for it is a flop. On budget night he gave the Australian people an assurance that they would receive the benefit of the tax rebate for private health insurance, but like everything else he has promised over the past six months he has failed to deliver. In particular, he has let down his own constituents in Chisholm with the closure of the Clayton Medicare office, loss of the dental health program which serves over 4,000 Chisholm constituents, a blow-out in the number of people waiting on trolleys at the Monash Medical Centre and the breaking of promises on health funding to Box Hill people. It is a shameful record and one which deserves the censure of the House.",41
229,Dr SOUTHCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Boothby) (4.19 p.m.)I don't know where the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) has been, but he might have caught up with the fact that Medicare is being retained, as well as bulk-billing and community rating-the sham of community rating that the previous government left us with. In addition, this government has addressed the issue of cost shifting which the shadow minister did not understand last monthperhaps he understands it this month. The whole debate that we have heard today has had an almost Orwellian overtone. If I might summarise: the ALP were part of a government which saw privati sed health cover drop from 65 per cent to 33.6 per cent in June. Direct government actions contributed to a 39 per cent increase over the course of that government in the cost of premiums. During the period of government they showed no commitment to private health. This government, which are trying to address the issue of the fall-out in private health insurance and which are trying to offer people incentives to stay in private health cover, are doing that, but the ALP are now portraying themselves as the defenders of those with private health insurance. That is something they never did while in government. The shadow minister has been on a fishing expedition, looking for some evidence that in some way there is some impropriety in the premium increases of private health funds and that there are some problems for the government in that. In actual fact, during the whole period of the 13 years of the HawkeKeating government there were 174 increases in health premiums. The debate today is all about politics; very little to do with policy. The secret health fund increase was heralded in the Herald-Sun and it was also notified to the 200,000 policy holders of National Mutual. So this whole matter of public importance today has been a beat-up. It is very important to separate the issue of the private health tax incentives which are being offered to lower and middle income earners and the issue of insurance premium rises. They are two separate issues: insurance premium rises will always occur. There were 174 such increases during the 13year reign of the last government. As the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has pointed out, the largest increase occurred in the period when Brian Howe, that failed health minister of the Hawke and Keating government, was in charge. There was a 17 per cent blow-out in the period 1991 to 1992. You might remember that the rest of the country was in recession at that time and inflation was not terribly high, yet there was a 17 per cent blow-out during the period of the last government. The ALP have never shown a commitment to private health insurance. They don't believe in private health insurance. Some of them believe in self-insurance. That is all right if you are a former Prime Minister or a former health minister. I would imagine that if Paul Keating or his family required surgery they wouldn't go down to Westmead or St George's. They might go to St Vincent's, but I don't imagine they would go to the public part of St Vincent's; it would be more the exclusive clinic. I don't imagine that Carmen Lawrence, if she required surgery, would go to the local Fremantle Hospital, Sir Charles Gairdner or Royal Perth. It is all right for those former ministers and former prime ministers to self-insure, to decide to contribute to expenses in private hospitals and so on by just paying out-ofpocket expenses. What about lowerand middle-income earners who take out private health insurance? They need some sort of commitment. There were 174 increases in health insurance premiums during the period of the Hawke and Keating governments, and how it has many were opposed by the ALP? Not one. You have to go back to 1974, a year which probably saw the highest inflation ever in Australia, to find a rejection of a health insurance premium increase. They do occur. During that period of 13 years, the ALP witnessed a decline in private health insurance from 65 per cent to almost 33.6 per cent in June 1996. Labor focused on Medicare and neglected private health insurance. They never realised that private health cover acts to complement the public health system. It has been estimated that a two per cent drop in private health cover costs this nation the equivalent of 325,000 bed days. That is the equivalent of two major teaching hospitals. The shadow minister raised the question of how many hospitals you could buy with the private health incentives, but Labor witnessed, in the course of those last failed Hawke and Keating governments, a decline of over 30 per cent in private health insurance. That is the equivalent of 30 teaching hospitals that has been put onto the public purse. It is only by getting more people into private health that we can reduce the strain on public hospitals, that we can start looking at reducing the waiting lists which were Labor's legacy. Labor contributed to the decline in private health insurance directly by such initiatives as changing the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. They also removed the reinsurance pool and neglected the whole issue of cost shifting, something that the shadow minister did not understand back in August-I wonder if he understands it now. They also removed the Commonwealth bed day subsidy. All those actions contributed over that period to a 39 per cent increase in premiums. The tax incentives that this government has announced are directed to lowerand middleincome people, and about five million people will be eligible for those incentives. The previous government thought that incentives for private health insurance were not necessary. Their response was Carmen Lawrence's managed care legislation. Since the introduction of that legislation in May last year what we have seen is a continuing decline in private health insurance membership. That legislation did not achieve its aim of stemming the haemorrhage from private health cover. The main problem is that young and healthy people have left the funds, which has set up a vicious circle whereby the young and healthy who have left have made premiums rise, contributing to more young and healthy people deciding to leave. The reasons for the latest increase in premiums were prudentialto respond to falling health fund reserves. Laurie Oakes's article in the Bulletin two weeks ago had Russell Schneider telling a meeting of the Australian Health Insurance Association: There is no way in the world the incentives can be transferred to your bottom line. The minister has also instructed the department not to approve price increases if they are used to increase the reserves above what is needed for prudential requirements. What we need is to encourage young, fit and healthy people to get back into private health insurance and to have the greater access, choice and quality that are available in the private sector. The private sector contributes something like 50 per cent of all surgical procedures in Australia. Private hospitals now provide almost any service which is currently available in the public sector but the fewer members have led to higher premiums. In the 1996 federal election campaign, Graham Richardson said: Unfortunately, Labor aren't recognising the big problem. It is still a huge problem ... that people are deserting private health insurance at the rate they are. It isn't a problem any of you will worry about tomorrow, but in 10 years time it will be huge. Sadly, there is no-one in the Labor ranks who realises the problem that we have seen with the decline in private health insurance. In so many ways in this budget period Labor want it both ways. They do not believe in private health insurance but they want to portray themselves now as the defenders of people with private health insurance. What they are trying to do today is undermine confidence in the private health system. Is the Labor Party seriously suggesting that we should never see another increase in insurance premiums; that we should never see another increase in insurance premiums that does not have some political overtones? About 780,000 people are on incomes below $20,000. These people are holding private health insurance, they are depending on these incentives, they are hanging on-and these incentives will be delivered. Of course health insurance premiums will be kept to a minimum, but we do need private health insurance to complement both Medicare and the public hospital system.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1996-97 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 September, on motion by Mr Costello: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that: (1) the Budget betrays the Australian promise of working towards a more fair, just, inclusive and united society; (2) the Budget is both mindless and heartless, and its prescriptions are not what the Australian economy needs at present; (3) the Budget will have a savagely contractionary impact on economic growth and make impossible the job creation necessary to reduce Australia's still unacceptably high level of unemployment; (4) with stronger economic growth the Budget could be restored to underlying balance over the life of this Parliament through a much more moderate program of fiscal consolidation; (5) the spending cuts and tax increases contained in the Budget are, on the evidence of the Government's own Budget Papers, not necessary to reduce the Commonwealth Government's debt-to-GDP ratio and will not produce a significant improvement in the current account deficit; (6) the Budget not only offers no hope to the unemployed but actively harms their prospects of finding a job by cutting labour market programs and privati sing the previously publicly provided employment service function of the CES; (7) the Budget will have unfair and unjust consequences for the struggling and disadvantaged in our midst-the poor, the old, the sick, indigenous Australians and newly-arrived migrants; (8) the many spending cuts concerned with education and training, research and development, trade development (including breaches of promise with respect to EMDG, ITES and lAMP), production bounties, and other business support, will be counter-productive in their longer term consequences; (9) there is deception involved in the family tax package contained in the Budget, whereby what the Prime Minister appears to be putting into one pocket is for most middle Australian families being taken right out of the other by the Treasurer in higher education fees, Austudy changes, higher nursing home charges, higher fees and charges; (10) there are many breaches of Coalition election promises contained in this Budget, which amount to over $17 billion over four years, and which will cause hardship, insecurity, and dismay for millions of Australians; (11) the Budget involves a massive betrayal of regional Australia through the abolition of the $150 million regional development programme, large cuts to road funding, the closure of regional Government offices such as Medicare and CES offices, and the cuts to the ABC and university funding; (12) the mean-spirited decision to introduce large, up-front entry fees and massively increased daily fees for nursing homes, and increase user-charges will harm elderly Australians; (13) the abolition of Childcare Operational Subsidies will impact heavily upon community based child care centres; (14) the reduction of $800 million over four years in public hospital funding will cause longer waiting lists for the sick and reduce the quality of hospital and medical assistance for millions of people; (15) the Budget involves a breaking of the Government's so called 'core' commitment to maintain Medicare in its entirety through cuts to rebates for numerous items under Medicare; (16) the cruel decision to abolish the Commonwealth Dental Health Programme will cause serious problems for the less well off; (17) harsh and promise-breaking decisions will force Australian families to pay substantially (29) more for the cost of their prescription medicines; (18) the massive funding cuts to education, the increased HECS charges and AUSTUDY changes will penalise the less well-off; (19) the Budget's comprehensive and ideological assault on the public sector will cost 10,500 jobs in 1996-97 alone; (20) the Government has failed to honour its election commitment to maintain the environment budget and to provide an additional $84 million in the 1996-97 Budget, instead cutting by 13 per cent the environmental budget and forward estimates; (21) the reckless decision to reduce funding for the National Highway by $622 million over four years, breaches a clear Coalition election commitment at the 1996 election, and with other decisions will reduce the level of public infrastructure investment, especially in regional Australia; (22) the decision to impose a 500 per cent increase in the taxation arrangements for visits to the Great Barrier Reef will discourage tourism and cost jobs in Queensland; (23) the Government has failed to honour its promise to not cut Australia's foreign aid beyond the election commitment to abolish the DIFF program, and in doing so will allow the estimated ODA/GDP ratio for Australia in 1996-97 to fall to 0.29 per cent; (24) the Government has failed to honour its election promise that Defence expenditure would not be cut, whilst cutting $165 million from the 1995 Defence Budget estimates for 1996-97, and reducing Defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP to its lowest level since 1939; (25) the mean-spirited and discriminatory approach to migrants and ethnic communities will harm outworkers, hurt newly-arrived migrants and refugees, cut humanitarian aid and penalise asylum seekers; (26) the substantial cuts to ATSIC and to indigenous-related Commonwealth programs represent a massive setback to the process of reconciliation in Australia; (27) the savage cuts to the ABC, of $209 million over four years, are in complete breach of the Coalition's solemn election promise to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC; (28) the Budget has failed to honour the promise to maintain levels of arts funding and spend an additional $60 million over three years; and the Government's plan to substantially increase Commonwealth court and tribunal fees, coupled with deep cuts to legal aid, will result in a severe curtailment of access to justice by many Australians.",45
231,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"In continuation of my remarks on the budget, in the few remaining minutes I have left I would like to address the topic of Aboriginal affairs. This coming financial year we will be allocating some $1,600 million to Aboriginal programs. This will be the second highest amount on record, superseded only by the abnormal amount that was spent last year. In fact, in the next four years we will be spending, in current dollars, $429 million more on Aboriginal affairs than the previous government spent in its last four years. As you move around the country, the main areas that taxpayers and, indeed, Aborigines want to see funds spent on in Aboriginal affairs are health, housing, education, employment and training. In all those areas we will be spending more. In health, we will be spending 28 per cent more in real terms over the next four years compared with the previous four years-an extra $97 million. Indeed, we will be opening up 23 extra Aboriginal medical services around the country in remote areas, areas that have never been serviced before. In housing, we will be spending $26 million more over the next four years-a total of $1,323 million. What is more important, on top of that, is that we will be aiming to ensure that we get better value for the dollar. I know that, in the town of WiIcannia in my own electorate, four houses were built there within the last two or three years for $212,000 each. They are not particularly outstanding houses. I think we can get better value for the dollar in the housing area. If you listen to the critics, you would think that the community development employment program was being wiped out. Only in the Australian newspaper this morning, there was a letter signed by about a dozen or so people, including a professor or two, virtually implying that the program would be wiped out. The situation is that there are 262 projects in Australia encompassing 28,300 participants. What are we doing? We are keeping all of those on. In fact, we will be spending $337 million more in CDEP projects over the next four years. Not only will we retain what is there now but we will be opening up about another 54 places each month. In the DEETY A area, we will be spending $147 million more over the next four years on education and training compared with the previous four years-a 12 per cent increase in real terms, which I think is pretty handsome indeed. In the native title area, we will be spending $172 million more over the next four years. In addition, I think we should remember that Aborigines themselves will benefit more than average from a range of mainstream budget initiatives, such as the family tax initiative, simply because Aboriginal people tend to be overrepresented in the target groups of family, youth, unemployment and those living in regional Australia. ATSIC are squealing about the cuts, but the cuts are coming off very inflated forward estimates. We have to remember that ATSIC underspent their own budget by $58 million last year, $78 million the previous year and $51 million the year before that. Perhaps they could look to their own budget of $12Y2 million on travel and $136.4 million on running costs. In the region that takes in Dubbo in my electorate, ATSIC have slashed that regional budget by $45 million. I cannot see why it is necessary to slash it by that much. There is a 100 per cent cut to CATARAC, which provides accountancy training, and a 100 per cent cut to the domestic violence unit-a decision by ATSIC themselves-which does marvellous work not only in the Dubbo region but also in all of country New South Wales. It is in these sorts of areas that we should be providing 100 per cent of the outcome levels rather than cutting them by 100 per cent as A TSIC have done when they have arranged their priorities. I do think that this area could be looked at. Sure, there are some cuts in the ATSIC area, but overall they are still being treated very generously indeed. Aboriginal funding will remain a priority of this government over the next term of this parliament.",47
232,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Let there be no misunderstanding about the nature of the most recent federal budget: that budget has proved to be one of the most fraudulent and cynical fiscal exercises ever undertaken in Australia. It represents an act of violence against the welfare system, against aged Australians, against Australian families, against Aboriginal Australians, against the unemployed, against the universities and against the ABC. Other areas that are being hit include child care, the disabled, national roads and foreign aid-the list seems almost endless. But the remarkable thing-and I give credit to the government for this-was the way in which that budget was initially marketed. You will recall, Madam Deputy Speaker, that before the budget came down on 20 August a list had been released of possible budget cuts equal to $20,000 million. That was just part of the softening-up process. Budget outlays did not need to be, and would never have been, cut by $20,000 million. In fact, the government's target, as we all recall, was indicated to be a total of $8 billion over the first two years. The purpose of that exercise being undertaken in that way was so that, when the budget was finally announced and people looked to see how their interests, their concerns, their children, their families and their neighbours were affected by it, they would utter a sigh of relief and say, 'It wasn't really as bad as it could've been.' So it was a very successful marketing exercise. In fact, it was so successful that we had people like Malcolm Farr, a very highly regarded political reporter for the Daily Telegraph, heading his front page report on the budget in the Daily Telegraph on the following day as 'A hlir go'. There are three elements of the budget to which Mr Farr drew attention and they were highlighted at the top of that article. The one was tax cuts of $200 a child for middle income families. That was part of the family tax package announced in the budget. The second one was tax incentives to encourage private health insurance. The third one was the 15 per cent surcharge on the super contributions for high income earners. The only one of those three items which has survived is the 15 per cent surcharge on super contributions for high income earners. The family tax cuts have been more than absorbed by the other impositions which have been made as a result of that budget. Various estimates have been made for middle income families where both the husband and the wife work with a combined income of $35,000 to $40,000 and have two children. The additional weekly cost to those families is between $35 and $40. So the first item referred to by Mr Farrand I am not criticising him-of tax cuts of $200 a child for middle income families, in the budget which he referred to as a fair go, disappears. The second one he referred to was tax incentives to encourage private health insurance. We have already heard enough of that. The tax incentives to encourage private health insurance have already been absorbed by the private health funds and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) knew when that announcement was made that that was what was going to happen. Those benefits to assist families and to compensate them for undertaking private health insurance amount to $l.7 billion every year. That was supposed to go, with a firm assurance from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), into the pockets of the workers and into the pockets of families. It went straight into the coffers of the private health funds-$1.7 billion. The third point that Mr Farr refers to is the 15 per cent surcharge on super contributions for high income earners. It is probably about time. That includes ourselves, Madam Deputy Speaker. One of the most profitable forms of investment for any people in Australia during their lives is to contribute to superannuation. The taxation benefits which have accrued to first them as a result of that have provided them with retirement incomes to which other people-ordinary wage plug Australian families-could never aspire. I notice the threat that many pensioners who will become patients of nursing homes will be required to sell their homes. Mrs Gash-That's rubbish!",48
233,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,The minister acknowledged it. Mrs Gash-Rubbish.,49
234,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I will give you the quote in a minute. You continue to say 'Rubbish' because you are accepting all of the nonsense that the people on the front-bench of your party have been feeding you. Why don't you look at the records and come up with your own arguments? I like intelligent interjections. I would seek then to respond to them. If you are going to throw out unintelligent, uninformed and simply false interjections, I will not respond to them-and that was one of them. I know that people who will become patients in nursing homes are going to be required to sell their homes in order to go into those nursing homes. But in regard to those people who in future may be paying a IS per cent surcharge on their super contributions, I have not seen any significant diminution in those homes that are being sold in the capital cities of Australia and elsewhere for literally millions of dollars-bought and sold by those people. I have seen no diminution in the number of those types of homes being available. I said that this budget was one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated against the Australian people, and increasingly the Australian people are coming to know and to understand the fraudulent nature of that budget. As a result of this budget, the Howard government has set in train a process of turning this country into a second-rate country. That is in connection with research and development, all of the assistance to industry and all of the encouragement that was being provided for initiatives under the previous government. All of that represented substantial improvements in Australia's capacity to be a competitive nation, to improve its technology, to penetrate those competitive markets of the world, and to do it increasingly. Even in electorates of the kind that I represent in the Newcastle area, small businesses are now in the process of growing as a result of the benefits that came to them because of industry policy, research and development grants, counselling, assistance and advice from the previous government. This government now has also set in train a process of destroying the delicate framework of social equity and individual opportunity, of reducing our capacity to develop the skills and intellectual capacities of the Australian people. We know that enrolments in university education will diminish substantially. This is the clever country. This is the of opportunities. But one thing I notice-and everybody needs to keep this in mind as well-is that, when the sons and daughters of ordinary working-class families in Australia who have the ability to go to university are not able to find a place, they will find that many of those places to which they aspired have been taken up by the rich, by the affluent, who will buy those places for their children. The HECS, the higher education contribution scheme, will be increased in amount. Repayment periods are to be brought forward and the period of time in which HECS is to be repaid will be compressed. If you are the son or daughter of a rich person who can pay your HECS contribution up front, you will get a 25 per cent discount. If you are the son or daughter in the homes of families like those I represent, and you cannot afford to pay it up front, you pay the lot. This government is reverting to the ugly days where people with wealth were able to buy for themselves and their children opportunities which were denied to more able, but poorer, children. This government is also representing a retreat by the Commonwealth from an effective involvement in the development of the great regional areas of Australia. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) was the one who announced the destruction within his department of the section dealing with that area. Previous government initiatives have developed and improved the great regions of Australia. In future, the government is going to tum its back on them. This government is replacing a balanced and coordinated approach to economic management and social policy with a mad and obsessive ideological commitment to economic fundamentalism and a renewed faith in discredited market processes. Increasingly, this government is recognised as being ideologically driven. The government has indicated that, over the next four years, it is going to chop $23 billion from outlays. I want to put this into context for the benefit of those people who do not do the thinking for themselves. The second land reading amendment that we have moved and the changes that we are seeking to make to the budget would bring back $7.3 billion of that $23 billion over the four-year period. That represents about $2 billion extra a year on average. That represents one half of one per cent of Australia's GDP. It is minuscule.",49
235,Dr NELSON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Ha, ha!",50
236,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"The honourable doctor laughs. The honourable doctor might be competent at medicine, but he might like to brush up his mathematics. That $7.3 billion over four years is $7.3 billion out of total Commonwealth outlays. If we assume, as we can, about $130 billion each year in Commonwealth outlays, over four years that represents a total of $520 billion. We are suggesting that an additional $7.3 billion would make it possible for the government to bring back all of the significant social programs, to restore equity, fairness and justice. It is $7.3 billion out of $520 billion. Let me put it in the context of Australia's gross domestic product, which was $450 billion last year. If we multiply that by four over the four-year period, it comes to $1,600 billion. The amount that we are suggesting should go back into the budget is $7.3 billion. That is in relation to a total cumulative gross domestic product over the four years of $1,600 billion. That puts those values, those aggregates, into context. This goes to the reason why I said that the government was madly and ideologically driven. We are talking about a minuscule amount of money. A number of claims were made by the government about some of the reasons why they had to pursue this objective. When we go to the next election-whenever that is and whatever the circumstances are-a swing against the government of less than four per cent will put the Labor Party back into government. A swing against the government of five per cent will put Labor back into government with a majority of 16 seats. So those people opposite who are so intent on defending the indefensible which is being fed to them by the foolish people on the government front bench need to start examining these things themselves a little more closely, a little more dispassionately, a little more selfishly. Your political future depends upon it. Just a few days before the election, the Australian Treasury said in its report: The economic outlook for 1996-97 able ... Early in May, a short time after the federal election, Ian Macfarlane, then the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, said: At the Reserve Bank, we are pretty happy with how things have turned out in Australia. Comments made by people who are competent give the lie to the claim that this budget was in some way necessary to repair the economy. The head of the economics department at the University of Newcastle, Mr Bill Mitchell, in referring to the circumstances in Australia, said: And that means that the Keating government left the Australian economy in quite good shape. Here is another comment about the economy inherited by the new government: The incoming Government inherited an Australian economy ... that was a little better than just good in parts ... We have had 19 quarters of positive economic growth ... low levels of inflation, and we continue to enjoy the benefits ... of very close geographic proximity to the fastest growing economic region in the world. Who said that? It was your leader, the Prime Minister. Mrs Elson interjecting",51
237,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"How foolish! How stupid! You are all as bad as one another. Let me repeat what your leader, the Prime Minister, said about the economy that you inherited: The incoming Government inherited an Australian economy ... that was a little better than just good in parts ... We have had 19 quarters of positive economic growth ... low levels of inflation, and we continue to enjoy the benefits ... of very close geographic proximity to the fastest growing economic region in the world. Comments of that kind confirm the nickname 'Honest John'. At his best he is an honest man. So, if it was not to repair any serious deficiencies in the economy, perhaps it was designed, as some people have claimed, to correct some deficiencies in Australia's fiscal performance. The Sydney Morning Herald--<;ertainly not the mouthpiece of the Australian Labor Party-in an editorial earlier this year referred to Mr Costello, now of course the federal remains favourTreasurer, and said: Mr Costello cannot play the fiscal innocent. Remember when they were talking about the 'Beazley black hole'. It was certainly a slogan which caught on. But the Sydney Morning Herald, referring to Mr Costello, went on to say: · . . most of the deterioration in the budgetary position has resulted from lower growth forecasts. What then have been the comments of some of the others? The Sydney Morning Herald on 30 May this year-that is the day it dealt with the expected higher growth disclosed by the March quarter national account figures-said: · .. the '$8 billion black hole' must now be seen as the political rhetoric it always was. Max Walsh, on 10 May this year, said: · .. the demonising of Kim Beazley and his black hole has, for me at least, a lack of credibility. Ross Gittins, on 13 May this year, in relation to the current state of the budget deficit and its impact on the current account deficit said, 'There is no crisis.' Gruen, Neville and Argy, in the Australian Financial Review in May, said: · .. it is neither necessary nor desirable to seek to reduce discretionary spending by $8 billion over the next two years ... If the economy is indeed slowing down, such a policy may well slow it down further and increase unemployment in the short term, while keeping neither the fiscal deficit nor the national saving rate. Those comments from reputable and respectable spokesmen and women writing for reputable newspapers give the lie to the claims that have been made by the present government. (Time expired)",51
238,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for North Sydney, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",52
239,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"North Sydney) (4.55 p.m.}-I am in Canberra today because I want to make a contribution to the future of Australia. This passion for the future comes about from the personal contact that I have with the past. It all happened around 80 years ago. On 31 October in 1917. One hour before sunset. Above the sounds of heavy artillery and machine-gun fire, you could hear the steady rhythm of horses hooves-800 tired and thirsty horses, ridden by 800 tired and thirsty men. This was the 4th Light Horse Regiment, hurtling through the smoke and dust towards the Turkish stronghold of Beersheba. Logic, instinct, and every hint of self-preservation would have suggested that this was madness. Armed only with single-shot rifles, bayonets and knives, 800 boys on horses were no match for a heavily fortified town armed with cannons and machine-guns. Our leader, General Harry Chauvel, must have had this same thought. However, he had no choice but to infuse these young men with the belief that - the future of the free world lay in their hands. You know the rest of the story. Against impossible odds, 800 young Australians helped change the course of the First World War. Their charge was more than courage. It was more than defiance against oppression. It was an act of pure faith in the future-and perhaps our finest illustration of that quality that we call the Australian spirit. The former Australian Prime Minister, George Reid, aptly described that spirit in this House in 1909 when he said: There is no country in the world where the people are less paralysed by reverence to the past. There are no people in the world who have fewer fears for the future. One might ask what relevance that charge on Beersheba has on the Australians of today. I feel proud to be able to stand here and tell you that its spirit can still be touched by every Australian. I feel proud to think that future generations can have that same defiant spirit surging through their veins. And I am proud to be able to tell you that my grandfather recognised that spirit too. You se"" he was in Beersheba not as an Australian, not even as a soldier, but as the deputy district commissioner rebuilding the town after the Turks had been driven out. In many ways, Beersheba defines what it is like to be an Australian. To believe in yourself, to believe in the seemingly insurmountable, and to challenge the future. Mr Acting Speaker, that future is all around us. The new millennium is approaching at a bliJ.1ding pace and change is occurring exponei'rtially. I suppose it is understandable for many that this change might be accompanied by growing uncertainty and angst. After all, family life is under increasing social pressure. Long accepted practices and traditions are constantly being questioned. And the tools we use in our everyday lives are becoming more complex. When you see toddlers playing hide and seek not in their backyards but on an Apple Mac and five-year-old schoolchildren with their feet swinging off the ground thumping away at the keyboard communicating with their friends by the Internet, you realise that things are no longer what they used to be. Perhaps many of us have forgotten the lesson of Beersheba. That is why I come to this parliament with the inherent belief that the answers to the challenges of the future lie in modem liberalism. In an age where closely held beliefs and political ideology are frequently scoffed at, I wish to place on record the principles of modem liberalism that I hold dear. These include, firstly, the recognition of the inalienable rights of the individual; secondly, a belief in parliamentary democracy; thirdly, a commitment to improve our society through reform; and, finally, equality of opportunity for all of our citizens. The first principle which recognises the rights of the individual was expressed in 1689 by the father of liberalism, John Locke. He wrote that the very substance of government should be the protection of individual rights, including specifically the rights of life, liberty and property. The government's role was to be the custodian for those rights and to protect the individuals in our community. This right to individual growth manifests itself today in our free market economy and in our community's respect for individual attitudes. For example, as a nation we encourage the creation of wealth and we respect free speech, freedom of expression and association. However, along with these individual rights come some community responsibilities. Despite the work of liberal and social philosophers such as Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill and Jean Jacques Rousseau, it was not until the end of the 19th century that the concept of social justice was introduced by John Dewey. He wrote that liberty is that secure release and fulfilment of personal potentialities which take place only in wide and manifold association with others. As part of the privilege of enjoying our individual rights, we have an obligation to protect and enhance our community. That includes helping the disadvantaged, caring for the sick, speaking for the voiceless and protecting the weak. The second principle of modem liberalism is a belief in parliamentary democracy. Although historically liberalism and democracy were never close bedfellows, modem liberals do have a genuine commitment to the parliamentary systems. We believe in the Westminster system and all that comes with it, including making the executive more accountable to this parliament. A very good example of this is one of the first decisions of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard): that he, along with all other ministers, should attend every question time in this House. No more part-time responsibility; that is modem liberalism at work. The third principle of modem liberalism is our belief in reform. Liberalism has traditionally steered a course between the extremism of the far Left and the reactionary conservatism of the far Right. Liberalism is most comfortable when it is developing new ideas and setting new goals. It encourages us to nurture expression in areas like the theatre, music, dance and cinema. It encourages us to excel in sport through better training techniques and improved fitness. It encourages us to succeed in business with better work practices and innovative products. Liberalism has a reformist zeal: to reach higher, to move faster and to grow stronger. This will deliver a society that the greatest Australian Liberal, Sir Robert Menzies, described as a community of lifters and not leaners. The final finger on the hand of modem liberalism is the classic doctrine of equality of opportunity. In our society status consideration should be irrelevant in determining how successful an individual can be. As political historian Professor Mark Hagopian wrote, in a liberal society achievement criteria such as talent, industry and creativity rather than the ascriptive criteria such as birth should mainly determine one's social position. In an Australian context this is a formula that is as important a motivation for our workplace reform legislation as it is for us to deny a privilege based on birth right. I reject any born to rule mentality, because it flies in the face of one of our country's most sacrosanct beliefs that we as a people must determine our own future and that we as individuals must shape our own destiny. We cannot afford in our modem and complicated world to tie the hands of our children before they are born, because discrimination from the cradle will lead to discrimination until the grave. Equality of opportunity is a part of modem liberalism that will be most aggressively defended by my Liberal Party. It is the reason why so many of my colleagues in the class of 1996 are here from all parts of Australia. That is what I believe in; that is modem liberalism. A true Liberal was described by Sir John Carrick in 1967 as someone who was always concerned about the welfare of the individual, for the creation of opportunities, for the preservation of human dignity and the development of human personality. I have no doubt that these modem Liberal principles will benefit all Australians in the days ahead. Most particularly, I want to ensure that the electoring, ate of North Sydney has a prominent role in defining that future. When the First Fleet landed across the harbour, it shattered the peace of the local Cameraigal tribe. In the days ahead, the thickly wooded shores of my electorate were slowly transformed by whaling, agriculture, industry and transport. Today North Sydney's 32 suburbs thrive in a bustling 42 square kilometres of Sydney Harbour foreshore. Old Neutral Bay whalers cottages, sturdy 1920s bungalows, federation homes, Victorian terraces and modem units all compete for harbour views. North Sydney people are creative. May Gibbs, Henry Lawson, Brett Whitely, Conrad Martens, D.H. Lawrence, Lloyd Rees and Paul Wilson are just a few of the creative and wild souls who have chosen to live or spend time on our beautiful shores. North Sydney people are peace loving. They supported in their thousands this government's leadership in the call for tougher national gun control laws. North Sydney people are enterprising. They live in the dappled shadows of Australia's third largest business district and they own or are employed by over 25,000 local small businesses. North Sydney people are diverse. By the year 2000, 15 per cent of my electorate will be of Chinese origin, and it currently has the highest population of Armenians in the country-a community I am very proud to say I have a special relationship with. With Australia's highest number of working women and highest number of people with qualifications, and with a deceptive unemployment rate and a large number of people living alone at home, the electorate of North Sydney really is diverse. North Sydney people are passionate about their community. They have the greatest rugby league club in the world, the mighty North Sydney Bears; two of the great Australian rugby clubs, Gordon and Northern Suburbs; the home ground of one of the greatest Australian cricketers, Victor Trumper; as well as some of the most successful netball, saillawn bowls, squash and tennis clubs in the nation. We also have strong Rotary, Apex, Lions and ex-servicemen's clubs that make a contribution not only to our local community but also to the broader Sydney community. However, the thing that the people of North Sydney are most passionate about is Australia's future. They are prepared to answer the challenges for our nation. One of these challenges is in the way our community continues to treat women. We should abandon the politically correct platitudes about equality, and honestly acknowledge that there remain entrenched societal and institutional impediments to women's equal and active participation in either or both the home or work communities. For example, three times more women than men are setting up their own small businesses. This is as much a reflection on the entrepreneurial spirit and creativity of women as it is on the fact that they are now finally fed up with trying to break through the ceiling in medium and larger businesses. Another challenge that the people of North Sydney are passionate about is our environment. Our reefs and waterways in particular are under threat, and our near shore reefs are being degraded by tourism, recreation and land run-off. Associated fish life is increasingly threatened by sometimes uncontrolled fishing. One of our future environmental priorities must be to improve our waterways, and the Natural Heritage Trust is a significant step in the right direction. Finally, the people of North Sydney appreciate that one of the most significant challenges to Australia's future is rebuilding the nation's accounts. The 1996 budget-and I compliment the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), who is here-makes significant inroads into paring back government expenditure. However, I will support even further savings through increased use of co-payments, commercialisation and the contracting and market testing of more government services. From a revenue perspective, I join the growing cry of support for taxation reform. Our fairest taxes are the broadest based taxes. Yet over the last 30 years, a plethora of tax changes have made paying tax more of a burden than the tax itself. Perhaps the most significant reform can occur in Commonwealth-state relations. Apart from the many flaws associated with specific purpose payments, areas of overlap--such as education, health care, environmental management and community and family servicessuffer from gross duplication, confused goals and poorly monitored outcomes. Modem liberal values borne by a courageous Howard government can combine to address these Issues. Each person lives their life in the shadows of others, and I would not be here without the support of some very special people. My greatest thankyou is to my wife, Melissa. She will walk with me through the highs and lows of this life, and she will continue to be my daily source of inspiration. Melissa is my enthusiasm, my soul and my confidante, and I thank her for all the contributions she has made and the sacrifices she will make in the future. My parents, Richard and Beverley, are very special people. No language can truly describe my feelings for them. They have given me their values, their spirit and, despite some tough times, many opportunities for which I am forever grateful. To my brothers, sister, sister-in-law and their families, to the Babbage family and the many friends I have, I thank you. My extended family is also extraordinarymost of whom are here. To Barbara Elliott, Sirenne Gould, Erica Wylie, Bill Tafe, Moir Alexander, my campaign director Robert Orrell, Dick White, and all the other many, many community Liberals in North Sydney who have worked tirelessly and kept the flame alive during some tough times, I thank you. There are others, including Tony Nutt and John Burston, Jacquie, Meriana and Rox, Hamish and Tim, who have lent their expertise and energy. Their talent and dedication is inspiring. I also want to thank all the people of North Sydney, for they have bestowed on me a very great honour. They have asked me to carry the torch for a magnificent electorate that has made a significant contribution to this House since Federation. For I follow in the steps of eight other members, including Billy Hughes, the legendary Silent Billy Jack, Bruce Graham and John Spender. My predecessor, Ted Mack, made a lasting contribution to our local community, particularly in local government. Ted voiced his opinion with vigour and determination. He has left his footprint on our electorate. I would also like to acknowledge the Prime Minister, who for most of his career represented the Lane Cove region in my electorate. Every constituent seems to .cite the Prime Minister as a family friend through local schools, the local neighbourhood or as an avid cricket fan-and I can tell you, they keep me on the straight and narrow. He remains a revered figure in my local community. There have been others who have helped me to learn and develop as an individual. My now deceased mentors Bevan Bradbury and Bob Falkingham taught me some salient lessons in life. The Jesuits have taught me the value of community service and the spirit of giving. My previous employers Nick Greiner, George Souris, Peter Collins, and my colleague and good friend the Minister for Finance, John Fahey, have given me the opportunity to be at the cutting edge of policy reform in New South Wales during the great Australian public sector reform period. And my friends and legal colleagues at COITS Chambers Westgarth have taught me the lessons of professionalism, intellectual discipline and sheer hard work. I am very excited about Australia's future. I feel passionately about my country and its rightful place in the order of the world. I am also very humble about my obligations as a representative of the people in this House. Over the days of my career I am sure that the principles I hold dear-such as integrity, honesty and loyalty-will at times be sorely tested. But, at those times, I will recall the deeds of the men of Beersheba. I will recall their courage and their fortitude. I will recall the sacrifices that they made for our nation. And I will recall that great Australian fighting spirit. Together with the support and encouragement of my colleagues and the inspiration and direction of modem liberalism, we will all begin our journey . We will charge our Beershebas and we will rebuild them-and this we will do for our children and for the generations of Australians ahead. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",52
240,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Before I call the honourable member fqr Oxley, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",56
241,Ms HANSON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Acting Speaker, in making my first speech in this place, I congratulate you on your election and wish to say how proud I am to be here as the Independent member for Oxley. I come here not as a polished politician but as a woman who has had her fair share of life's knocks. My view on issues is based on common sense, and my experience as a mother of four children, as a sole parent, and as a businesswoman running a fish and chip shop. I won the seat of Oxley largely on an issue that has resulted in me being called a racist. That issue related to my comment that Aboriginals received more benefits than non-Aboriginals. We now have a situation where a type of reverse racism is applied to mainstream Australians by those who promote political correctness and those who control the various taxpayer funded 'industries' that flourish in our society servicing Aboriginals, multiculturalists and a host of other minority groups. In response to my call for equality for all Australians, the most noisy criticism came from the fat cats, bureaucrats and the dogooders. They screamed the loudest because they stand to lose the most-their power, money and position, all funded by ordinary Australian taxpayers. Present governments are encouraging separatism in Australia by providing opportunities, land, moneys and facilities available only to Aboriginals. Along with millions of Australians, I am fed up to the back teeth with the inequalities that are being promoted by the government and paid for by the taxpayer under the assumption that Aboriginals are the most disadvantaged people in Australia. I do not believe that the colour of one's skin determines whether you are disadvantaged. As Paul Hasluck said in parliament in October 1955 when he was Minister for Territories: The distinction I make is this. A social problem is one that concerns the way in which people live together in one society. A racial problem is a problem which confronts two different races who live in two separate societies, even if those societies are side by side. We do not want a society in Australia in which one group enjoy one set of privileges and another group enjoy another set of privileges. Hasluck's vision was of a single society in which racial emphases were rejected and social issues addressed. I totally agree with him, and so would the majority of Australians. But, remember, when he gave his speech he was talking about the privileges that white Australians were seen to be enjoying over Aboriginals. Today, 41 years later, I talk about the exact opposite-the privileges Aboriginals enjoy over other Australians. I have done research on benefits available only to Aboriginals and challenge anyone to tell me how Aboriginals are disadvantaged when they can obtain three and five per cent housing loans denied to non-Aboriginals. This nation is being divided into black and white, and the present system encourages this. I am fed up with being told, 'This is our land.' Well, where the hell do I go? I was born here, and so were my parents and children. I will work beside anyone and they will be my equal but I draw the line when told I must pay and continue paying for something that happened over 200 years ago. Like most Australians, I worked for my land; no-one gave it to me. Apart from the $40 million spent so far since Mabo on native title claims, the government has made available $1 billion for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders as compensation for land they cannot claim under native title. Bear in mind that the $40 million spent so far in native title has gone into the pockets of grateful lawyers and consultants. Not one native title has been granted as I speak. The majority of Aboriginals do not want handouts because they realise that welfare is killing them. This quote says it all: 'If you give a man a fish you feed him for a day. If you teach him how to fish you feed him for a lifetime.' Those who feed off the Aboriginal industry do not want to see things changed. Look at the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Members receive $290 a day sitting allowance and $320 a day travelling allowance, and most of these people also hold other very well paid positions. No wonder they did not want to resign recently! Reconciliation is everyone recognising and treating each other as equals, and everyone must be responsible for their own actions. This is why I am calling for ATSIC to be abolished. It is a failed, hypocritical and discriminatory organisation that has failed dismally the people it was meant to serve. It will take more than Senator Herron's surgical skills to correct the terminal mess it is in. Anyone with a criminal record can, and does, hold a position with ATSIC. I cannot hold my position as a politician if I have a criminal record---once again, two sets of rules. If politicians continue to promote separatism in Australia, they should not continue to hold their seats in this parliament. They are not truly representing all Australians, and I call on the people to throw them out. To survive in peace and harmony, united and strong, we must have one people, one nation, one flag. The greatest cause of family breakdown is unemployment. This country of ours has the richest mineral deposits in the world and vast rich lands for agriculture and is surrounded by oceans that provide a wealth of seafood, yet we are $190 billion in debt with an interest bill that is strangling us. Youth unemployment between the ages of 15 to 24 runs at 25 per cent and is even higher in my electorate of Oxley. Statistics, by cooking the books, say that Australia's unemployment is at 8.6 per cent, or just under one million people. If we disregard that one hour's work a week classifies a person as employed, then the figure is really between 1.5 million and, 1.9 million unemployed. This is a crisis that recent governments have ignored because of a lack of will. We are regarded as a Third World country with First World living conditions. We have one of the highest interest rates in the world, and we owe more money per capita than any other country. All we need is a nail hole in the bottom of the boat and we're sunk. In real dollar terms, our standard of living has dropped over the past 10 years. In the I 960s, our wages increase ran at three per cent and unemployment at two per cent. Today, not only is there no wage increase, we have gone backwards and unemployment is officially 8.6 per cent. The real figure must be close to 12 to 13 per cent. I wish to comment briefly on some social and legal problems encountered by many of my constituents-problems not restricted to just my electorate of Oxley. I refer to the social and family upheaval created by the Family Law Act and the ramifications of that act embodied in the child support scheme. The Family Law Act, which was the child of the disgraceful Senator Lionel Murphy, should be repealed. It has brought death, misery and heartache to countless thousands of Australians. Children are treated like pawns in some crazy game of chess. The child support scheme has become unworkable, very unfair and one sided. Custodial parents can often profit handsomely at the expense of a parent paying child support, and in many cases the non-custodial parent simply gives up employment to escape the, in many cases, heavy and punitive financial demands. Governments must give to all those who have hit life's hurdles the chance to rebuild and have a future. We have lost all our big Australian industries and icons, including Qantas when it sold 25 per cent of its shares and a controlling interest to British Airways. Now this government want to sell Telstra, a company that made a $1.2 billion profit last year and will make a $2 billion profit this year. But, first, they want to sack 54,000 employees to show better profits and share prices. Anyone with business sense knows that you do not sell off your assets especially when they are making money. I may be only 'a fish and chip shop lady', but some of these economists need to get their heads out of the textbooks and get a job in the real world. I would not even let one of them handle my grocery shopping. Immigration and multiculturalism are issues that this government is trying to address, but for far too long ordinary Australians have been kept out of any debate by the major parties. I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate. Of course, I will be called racist but, I can invite whom I want into my home, then I should have the right to have a say in who comes into my country. A truly multicultural country can never be strong or united. The world is full of failed and tragic examples, ranging from Ireland to Bosnia to Africa and, closer to home, Papua New Guinea. America and Great Britain are currently paying the price. Arthur Calwell was a great Australian and Labor leader, and it is a pity that there are not men of his stature sitting on the opposition benches today. Arthur Calwell said: Japan, India, Burma, Ceylon and every new African nation are fiercely anti-white and anti one another. Do we want or need any of these people here? I am one red-blooded Australian who says no and who speaks for 90% of Australians. I have no hesitation in echoing the words of Arthur Calwell. There is light at the end of the tunnel and there are solutions. If this government wants to be fair dinkum, then it must stop kowtowing to financial markets, international organisations, world bankers, investment companies and big business people. The Howard government must become visionary and be prepared to act, even at the risk of making mistakes. In this financial year we will be spending at least $1.5 billion on foreign aid and we cannot be sure that this money will be properly spent, as corruption and mismanagement in many of the recipient countries are legend. Australia must review its membership and funding of the UN, as it is a little like ATSIC on a grander scale, with huge tax-free American dollar salaries, duty-free luxury cars and diplomatic status. The World Health Organisation has a lot of its medical experts sitting in Geneva while hospitals in Africa have no drugs and desperate patients are forced to seek medication on the black market. I am going to find out how many treaties we have signed with the UN, have them exposed and then call for their repudiation. The g<;lVernment should cease all foreign aid immediately and apply the savings to generate employment here at home. Abolishing the policy of multiculturalism will save billions of dollars and allow those if from ethnic backgrounds to join mainstream Australia, paving the way to a strong, united country. Immigration must be halted in the short term so that our dole queues are not added to by, in many cases, unskilled migrants not fluent in the English language. This would be one positive step to rescue many young and older Australians from a predicament which has become a national disgrace and crisis. I must stress at this stage that I do not consider those people from ethnic backgrounds currently living in Australia anything but first-class citizens, ed of course that they give this country their full, undivided loyalty. The government must be imaginative enough to become involved, in the short term at least, in job creating projects that will help establish the foundation for a resurgence of national development and enterprise. Such schemes would be the building of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line, new roads and ports, water conservation, reafforestation and other sensible and practical environmental projects. Therefore I call for the introduction of national service for a period of 12 months, compulsory for males and females upon finishing year 12 or reaching 18 years of age. This could be a civil service with a touch of military training, because I do not feel we can go on living in a dream world forever and a day believing that war will never touch our lives again. The government must do all it can to help reduce interest rates for business. How can we compete with Japan, Germany and Singapore, which enjoy rates of two per cent, 5.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively? Reduced tariffs on foreign goods that compete with local products seem only to cost Australians their jobs. We must look after our own before lining the pockets of overseas countries and investors at the expense of our living standards and future. Time is running out. We may have only 10 to 15 years left to tum things around. Because of our resources and our position in the world, we will not have a say because neighbouring countries such as Japan, with 125 million people; China, with 1.2 billion people; India, with 846 million people; Indonesia, with 178 million people; and Malaysia, with 20 million people are well aware of our resources and potential. Wake up, Australia, before it is too late. Australians need and - an- leaders who can inspire and give hope In dIfficult times. Now is the time for the Howard government to accept the challenge. Everything I have said is relevant to my electorate of Oxley, which is typical of mainstream Australia. I do have concerns for my country and I am going to do my best to provid- speak my mind and stand up for what I believe in. As an Independent I am confident that I can look after the needs of the people of Oxley and I will always be guided by their advice. It is refreshing to be able to express my views without having to toe a party line. It has got me into trouble on the odd occasion, but I am not going to stop saying what I think. I consider myself just an ordinary Australian who wants to keep this great country strong and independent, and my greatest desire is to see all Australians treat each other as equals as we travel together towards the new century. I will fight hard to keep my seat in this place, but that will depend on the people who sent me here. Mr Acting Speaker, I thank you for your attention and trust that you will not think me presumptuous if I dedicate this speech to the people of Oxley and those Australians who have supported me. I salute them all. Miss JACK,E KELLY (Lindsay) (5.35 p.m.)-I rise tonight in support of the 199697 budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). I must support it because it is in line with what the voters of Lindsay wanted when they voted for me and the Liberal Party on 2 March. The seat of Lindsay is made up of a lot of hard working young families. Sixty per cent of our labour force commutes out of the electorate to work. We have a few large businesses, such as Boral, BHP, ACI and Panasonic, but largely our businesses are owner operated retail, automotive and specialty businesses. Our large number of PAYE wage earners, with children from the first, second and sometimes third marriages, are working hard to get ahead to pay off a mortgage and to provide a future for their children. We have a number of single parent families working hard. The one thing that is important to these young people who are busy raising a family is a future-a future for themselves and a future for their children, and that is what this budget provides. It provides a responsible, controlled restraint of government expenditure with the ultimate goal of getting Australia of debt by the year 2000. The people of Lindsay do not want their representatives dancing around to the tune of noisy minorities; they want their representatives in mainstream Australia. They want to be represented by people who truly seek to serve and to protect the future of Australia and its children. They do not want people caught up in their desire to stay in power at all costs, no matter what lies it takes, what money is spent or what debt is accrued. I think it is apt to remind people of the reason why there was such a massive defection in the heartland of Labor in the seat of Lindsay. In the 1995-96 budget, Labor tried to tax the family home with the builders' hardware tax. It was defeated by the Liberal Party. Under the Fraser coalition government, home loan repayments were 19 per cent of the median monthly family income in 1983. Under Labor, they rose to 27 per cent. Under Labor, 24 per cent of all families had no family member employed and more than 600,000 children under 14 were living in families where no-one had a job. In the 1991 recession-the recession we 'had to have'; 'things do not get better than this'-over 400,000 people lost their jobs. By the 1996 election, a similar number of people got their jobs back in full-time employment. Although the Labor Party might crow about continuous quarters of growth, for the people of Lindsay walking around the markets, walking around the shops and going to spend their wage it has meant very little. What this budget means to me and the people of Lindsay is that the government will take in $130 billion of revenue from the Australian people-and they will spend every last cent of it on Australians and Australian programs-yet the opposition want to oppose $19 billion worth of savings in the across-the board cuts that have been made by the Treasurer and the cabinet. This budget is carefully thought out and comes as a package. It is like when you save for Christmas. You know how much you have to spend on Christmas. You know that you have $30 to spend on mum, but you have a terrific mum and you would like to spend $50 out on her. You know that if you spend $50 on mum you are going to have less to spend on dad and less to spend on your brother and sister. No matter what you do, if you overspend your budget in any area it blows it out and, come Christmas Day, certain sections of your family will ultimately be disappointed. Our budget is fair, it is reasonable, it is across the board. The Australian public has received it as such, and the people of Lindsay agree. If you have made a budget and it balances, then you have to stick to it. By sticking to this budget and the cuts that have been made through 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, we will come out the other end into the black. We will gradually pay off that bankcard debt. We all know that bankcard rates are 20 per cent and that going loans are 10 per cent. That is basically what happened to Australia when we lost our triple A credit rating-we went from an ordinary loan at 10 per cent to having to pay bankcard rates of 20 per cent. The key link between the interest rates the government is paying on its loans and the amount of debt that the government is carrying-the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) pointed out that we do have the highest per capita level of debt-is that, when you are trying to pay back that sort of debt, your housing interest rates are similarly high. An across-the-board cut in interest rates would benefit the people of Lindsay more than anything else and 'vould be exceptionally fair. The electorate of Lindsay has a young area and a number of new subdivisions. A number of people from disadvantaged backgrounds have worked exceptionally hard to get ahead, to pay for a better future for themselves and their children-only to see it eaten away by way of mortgage repayments. They just cannot maintain an adequate standard of living. The best we can give them is a drop in interest rates. That is why the people of Lindsay voted for the Liberal Party on 2 March. They had had enough of the extravagant spending of Labor. It gave everyone a nice warm, fuzzy headline but at the end of the day it put us in debt-a debt that our children will have to pay off. This budget is the start of a long haul out of debt. We will not be back in the black until the year 2000, and it does mean having a government with the courage to bite the bullet and stick with it. Over time, people will see a future. That is exceptionally important to the youth of Lindsay. I could give you a lot of statistics, but all you really have to do is walk around my electorate and talk to the young kids, to the people at the clubs, at the front of the CES and at the markets and you will realise that they do not see much of a future for Australia. That concerns me greatly. We have a nation where someone like me who is not exceptionally wealthy, who is not well connected, who is not related to anyone exceptionally famous or influential can make it into parliament. I stood up along with thousands of members of Lindsay who came out in their droves to help me as I was struggling along with my pamphlet distribution and telling people what the Liberal Party was going to offer. They told me, 'We are fed up. We know where the Labor Party are goingwe have followed them for 13 years. Let's go in a different direction. Let's try it. Let's Let's see where we are going to head.' And they did. They said, 'Anything is better than the direction in which we are heading.' We have come down with this budget which has met with resounding acclamation as responsible and fair, and a step in the right direction. So what is it in this budget that is of specific relevance to the people of Lindsay? We have had a number of very good initiatives that will help the greater western Sydney area. As I have mentioned before in this place, I head up the Greater Western Sydney Task Force. It is made up of a number of Liberal members of parliament in greater western Sydney. It has a lot of political unity, a lot of common drives and a lot of common desire to get proper representation for the people of greater western Sydney. It is something that the divisive, factionalised, split-up, self-interested Labor members in the area have ignored for so long. The reconstruction of vital infrastructure in Lindsay was ignored at the expense of Liverpool and in other areas, where possible, the people of Lindsay were simply ignored and forgotten. They have risen up in droves; they have created a very marginal seat; and their vote counts. They are not going to go back to being taken for granted. They want their share of the cake. They don't want to be overlooked. They want to stand up and be taken into account when any government decisions are made. This Greater Western Sydney Task Force I am heading up does exactly that: it has five MPs who are going to stand up and say, 'Hey, what about greater western Sydney?' As the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett), who is in the chamber, will testify-he is the secretary on this task force-he is concerned to see that our area continues to get the representation it deserves and the attention that is warranted by 1.8 million people living in the greater western area of Sydney. We are tired of the New South Wales Labor government's attitude to local health services, its broken promises on removing the tolls on the M4 and its irresponsible promises that it has no intention of keeping-as well as the former Labor members' promise to remove go. the trunk dialling charges to Sydney. These are just some examples of Labor making a promise with no intention of keeping it and not really worrying about it when it was not kept. All I am asking for the people of Lindsay is a fair go to stand up and get on with the job---:-give us a chance. The direction in which we were going was not appropriate. We all agreed with that. There was a massive defection from Labor's heartland to the Liberal Party. Mr Bevis-It surprised you, didn't it? Mr MCDougall-it surprised you, too. Miss JACKIE KELLY-I was surprised; I'll admit that. I was really surprised at the level of defection from people who had always voted Labor; it was no longer the Labor Party that they knew. The level of defection was not just that they voted for Jackie, it was a matter of coming out and actively helping me. They said, 'I'm a memout ber of the ALP but I will help you because I reckon our leadership has really lost the plot. It's the same old guys, the same being taken for granted, and the same feathering your nest and padding yourself.' The atmosphere in the electorate during that campaign was almost tangible. I don't ever want that area to be taken for granted again. It has unique features in Australia and, for a rower, the Nepean River is obviously one of them. I have done a lot in terms of conservation of that river and protecting it as a very valuable recreation area for the local people and community groups. With the help of a few rowers, kay akers and triathletes we have weeded that river back and we have a number of plans in line down the track to put a permanent feature on the Hawkesbury-Nepean in terms of dealing with blue-green algae and the weed problem. Lindsay also has a large defence area. It is surprising how much defence happens out in greater western Sydney and how many defence people there are who have retired into the area from defence. There is an extra $1.7 million in this budget to further develop local defence facilities. That is important because under Labor defence spending was reduced quite severely from nearly 2.3 per cent of GDP down to l.9 per cent of GDP currently. A lot of allegations have been made that defence did not get cut but in real terms the defence budget has been reduced by 0.5 per cent-but there is hope of maintaining that level of defence funding. That is incredibly essential if Australia wants to ever stand alone as a self-reliant military power. Despite Labor's announcement last year of the cut in its funding for education, I am pleased to announce that the Howard government saw fit to do otherwise. It is continuing its funding for the Greater Western Sydney Education Centre. Labour market programs are very important to western Sydney. We will be spending $5.4 billion in the next four years on labour market programs, which is, in fact, more than Labor's $4.9 billion in the last four years-that was immediately before Working Nation kicked in. Our expenditure of this money will be directed at achieving real jobs. That money will be paid when real jobs are created or people are seriously employed. That has an immense effect on the people in my electorate. I can list several people I know personally and anecdotal evidence of numerous people who have been through three, four or five different labour market training programs and still do not have a job. Mr MCDougall-They would never have got one. Miss JACKIE KELLY-Certainly not. When you look at tertiary education in my electorate, my electorate is not up to the Australian average in terms of tertiary qualified people; we have more tradespeople. With the absolute dwindling of apprenticeships this has been a major concern to the parents in my area. Where can their kids get an apprenticeship? This is where MAATS, the modem Australian apprenticeship and trainee scheme, comes in. It provides a number of vocational education and training arrangements within a workplace and provides a lot of incentive for industry to take on apprentices. That will surely help with the high levels of youth unemployment in my area. It is a significant improvement provided by this budget for the people and particularly the young kids in my area since apprenticeships available to them have become almost non-existent unless they know someone or their father is in a trade. It is a very much aspired-to career-a lot of our young people in Lindsay aspire to a career in one trade or another. The vocational education that they will receive in school, the MAATS initiative and a number of other initiatives in this budget will certainly help in that area. The biggest help that we can give those young kids is to reduce the budget deficit, lower interest rates, give business a fighting chance of getting ahead of the overheads and the mortgage repayments and give them an opportunity to grow and create jobs. As I have said before, governments do not create jobs; private industry does. It is only with the growth in private industry and jobs in that sector that we will be able to get out of the unemployment crisis that we are in. Otherwise it is simply a matter of borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, with the government employing people in labour market programs or in the government-and around and around we go while we tax fewer and fewer people in the private sector to pay for a growing public sector. The lowering of living standards in the last 10 years is another significant issue. They certainly have come down in my electorate. People just do not seem to be able to take vacations, and their living standards in terms of the lifestyle opportunities for their children have been grossly affected. I commend this bill to the House. The budget really has to go through in its entire form because, as you well know, Madam Deputy Speaker, you really cannot chop one thing and support another without taking from some other area. It really is the budget that is providing us with some direction, while the opposition has absolutely no direction to take us in, except where we were headed on 2 March.",56
242,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1). I intend in my remarks to talk about the broad parameters of the budget and some of the detail, but of course there will be other appropriation bills and legislation that afford the opportunity to talk in detail on particular portfolios. At the outset I wish to address some of the broader issues of the budget and the way in which it has been presented by the Liberal government. There is absolutely no doubt that the budget contains cuts which have hurt many Australians. That is not an issue which anyone on either side of the parliament could argue against, although those on the other side would argue that there are reasons for inflicting that pain on Australians. The Liberals have sought to justify the pain on the basis of what they would claim to be a poor budgetary situation that they inherited. That is a piece of false propaganda and it needs to be exposed. The Australian government's budget debt is small by any standard. It is in fact the third lowest in the OECD. There are only two countries in the OECD whose budget deficit is in a better position than the Australian government budget deficit, and they are Norway and Denmark. To suggest that the deficit inherited by this government on changeover of office earlier this year gives rise to the sort of pain they inflict upon ordinary Australians is a deception that is cruel to those they hurt in this budget. It is worth having a look at the Australian government's record over the years when it comes to balancing the budget. The simple fact is that since the Second World War we have only ever had four surplus budgets in this parliament-and it remains to be seen in 12 months what the bottom line of this budget will be. Looking back through the records, you find that those four budgets which were in surplus were in 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990-four Labor budgets. The only surplus budgets since the Second World War were delivered by Labor governments in the Hawke and Keating period. The Howard budget that he left the incoming government in 1983, his final budget in 1982-83, had a deficit which in 1996 terms would represent $24 billion to $26 billion. That is not a black hole in proportional terms; that is a black canyon. So, by international comparison, the budget deficit that this government confronts is one of the lowest. The economic position of the government is strong and the economy that it inherited is strong. The sort of situation the coalition left for Labor in 1983 was three times worse than the current one in relation to the budget deficit. It should not be forgotten either that, if you look at the last budget and the performance of the Liberal and National parties in this parliament at that time, some $2 billion of the deficit in the last financial year was directly attributable to the amendments to the budget measures that the Liberal Party forced through the Senate in the last parliament. The second excuse which the Liberal Party have sought to use to justify the pain they are inflicting upon ordinary Australians is that the pain has somehow been evenly spread; that all Australians are sharing in the burden of their cuts. That is another piece of cruel, cynical propaganda. The simple fact is high income earners face somewhat of an inconvenience through the possible extra charges for Medicare and higher taxes on superannuation. They are of nuisance value to those people on high incomes. For those people who receive low and middle incomes, the ordinary families of Australia, they face extra charges that are going to affect their lifestyle. We are not talking here about matters of convenience; we are talking about the very lifestyle that Australian families are going to be forced to take as a result of the budget measures. The budget will hurt their children's career choices; it will affect the frail parents and the care that they are able to get; it will hurt their children's child-care arrangements; it will hurt their access to job training opportunities; it will hurt their access to help if they are unemployed; and, most importantly, it will reduce their job security. This budget contains a forecast on economic growth for the year ahead of just 3Yz per cent. That is lower than the economic growth that we have had over the last four years. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) stands before the parliament and produces a budget which he claims to be proud of, which will produce for this nation the lowest level of economic growth that we have seen in five years. The Liberal Party want to take some comfort out of that. In fact, their own document, budget statement No.1, includes an interesting assessment of what they think is going to happen to ordinary Australians. When we look at private consumption-that is, the money which ordinary citizens will spend in the year ahead-the budget papers themselves say this: Private consumption growth is expected to moderate to 3 per cent in 1996-97, an outcome slightly below the average of the past twenty years. This government are introducing a budget with measures that they know will reduce the growth in people's spending power to a level which is lower than the average for the last 20 years; yet they are proud of that. The simple fact is that, over the course of the last couple of budgets, the Labor government was able to see the economy grow in excess of four per cent per year. This government seem content to wind the economy back and see a growth rate around 3Y2 per cent. Of course, with a growth rate around 3112 per cent, it is no surprise to find that the budget papers also contain gloomy news on the employment front. The government's own budget paper forecast unemployment to average 8.5 per cent in the year ahead. That is the same as last year. Given growth rates below four per cent, the expectation of maintaining unemployment at an unacceptably high level of 8Yz per cent is itself very optimistic. The simple fact of history and economics of the last decade would tell you that economic growth under four per cent is unlikely to effect any reduction at all on the unemployment rate. When you have economic growth at less than four per cent-and these people are talking about economic growth at 3Y2 per cent-you can be sure of one thing: you will not reduce the number of people who are unemployed; you will increase the number of people in Australia who are unemployed. That is what the budget papers show. Whilst the unemployment rate is expected to average 8Y2 per cent, the number of people that the budget papers expect to be unemployed does grow. They also anticipate that there is going to be a reduction in the participation rate. The expectation is that they are going to force people out of the labour market-that is the assumption contained in the budget papers. That prognosis in relation to employment excludes their ideologically driven policies to reduce the public sector, to sack some 30,000 public servants. It also does not include TeIstra where we are looking at the prospect of some 20,000 employees of Telstra going over the course of the next couple of years. So we have a government which is content to see economic growth slide back to 3Y2 per cent; a government which is content to see unemployment rise; a government which is content to see some 30,000 public servants lose their jobs-we have members of the government who stand here before the people of Australia and say that that is a good budget. The saddest thing about this budget is that jobs are clearly no longer a goal of the Australian government. The Liberal government does not see the creation of jobs as its goal in framing the budget, much less a priority. Indeed, it should be the first priority. Mr Anderson-It is.",63
243,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"The minister at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, says it is their priority. If it is indeed your priority, Minister, then you have failed dismally. You have failed dismally not on my assessment but on your own budget paper's assessment. If, as you say, it is your own No. 1 priority, your own budget papers tell you that you are going to have zero impact on it. You are not going to reduce the unemployment rate at all. So if you have nominated unemployment to still be the No. 1 priority, you had better reshape the budget because your own assessments indicate that you will fail to improve the situation at all. That is not all that surprising, given that the government and the responsible ministers have refused to set any target whatsoever in relation to unemployment reduction. What level of unemployment satisfies the government, they refuse to say. But if you look at the budget papers, it becomes clear that the government is quite happy to see the current situation continue; unlike the previous Labor government where we had in place substantial labour market programs to ensure long-term unemployed people gain the skills they required to re-enter the work force. This government has no such priority; it has no such goal. This budget cuts a whopping $l.8 billion out of the Labor government's job training schemes that we had in place-a whopping $1,800 million. The government have virtually destroyed the infrastructure that was in place to assist unemployed people to gain skills and to gain jobs. CES offices are closing. In fact, I have already had two close in my electorate. Last month two CES offices were shut in the federal electorate of Brisbane. One of them, I might say, was in South Brisbane in the heart of an area which has a higher than average level of unemployment. They closed the CES office there last month; they closed the CES office in the city. In the budget we have now learned that they intend to close every CES office and effectively privatise the role that the CES office once played. Along with that, they are quite happy to sack thousands of government workers. That is the greatest failure of this budget. There are other decisions that deserve condemnation and in the brief time available I wish to refer to some of them. The government's decision to cut child-care funding is going to add somewhere between $14 and $30 per child per week to a family'S child-care bill. This is a government with a Prime Minister who often tells us that family is important. Yet those people who have families and need child-care services are about to face a significant increase in the cost of child care. In this budget, the government have also cynically said that they are providing tax benefits for families. In some areas that is true, but I can tell you that what they give you with the left hand they take back plus a bit more with the right hand. If you happen to have children and require child-care services then you will, as a result of this budget, face an increase of a minimum of $14 and up to $30 a week. I am particularly annoyed and angry that the government has decided to single out community child-care centres for attack. Operational grants to community child-care centres are to be abolished by this budget. That will directly result in an extra charge for parents of at least $14 per child per week. If you have two children in a community childcare centre, the minimum cost to you will be $28 a week extra. I have had a number of meetings with parents and administrators in community child-care centres in my electorate. Their estimate is that it will be closer to $28 or $30 per child and not $14. If you have two children under five years of age in care it is more than likely that you will be faced with a bill of between $50 and $60 per week on top of the charges you currently face. Community child care is deliberately selected by many parents because it provides them with an opportunity to be directly involved in the administration of the care and the centre. It is an open environment. For ideological reasons this government has decided to single out community child care, to impose that burden upon them and to assist the private child-care providers in this process. That is a cruel decision. The cut in tertiary places is going to especially impact upon Queensland where growth places were to be provided. I found it a bit galling to hear some government members in Queensland claim as a great result the decision in this budget to fund some additional tertiary places in Queensland. It is true that additional tertiary places will be funded in Queensland, but there will be 3,000 fewer than we were going to fund-3,000 fewer than the forward estimates would have funded. The simple fact is that, no matter how the Liberal propagandists want to twist it and no matter what sort of spin the PR people want to put on it, next year in Queensland there will be 3,000 fewer student places for young Queensland school leavers. That is an attack on Queensland. It is ironic because there was no state in the country that swung more to the Liberal and National parties at the last election than Queensland. What reward did those Queensland voters get for that? They got a slit from ear to ear if they were looking to do tertiary education. There will be 3,000 fewer places for Queensland. That is the Liberal government's thank you to the Queensland electorate that overwhelmingly decided to vote conservative. Across-the-board HECS charges are to increase making it harder for lowand middle-income families to see their children go to university. The increase is bad enough-and other people have spoken about that; and I may comment on that in the debate when it comes up tomorrow-but I want to comment on the nasty twist in the way in which they have structured it. The government are for the first time introducing a graded basis for HECS that is simply elitist. They are determining to charge people extra money for doing particular courses. The charge rate is not based on the cost of the course you are doing, it is based on how much money you will make after you graduate. There can be nothing more elitist than that. The simple fact is that, what you are doing-it may not be wittingly, it may be unwittingly-is ensuring that access to training for wealthy occupations will be restricted to wealthy kids. To put it simply, if you want to become a lawyer or a doctor then you had better have a mummy or a daddy who is a lawyer or a doctor. They are the ones who will be able to afford to get you into those high income professions. It is elitist and wrong and the government should be condemned for it. One of the other more obscure decisions which I found intriguing with the tertiary sector is the cut to Austudy, but particularly the decision to increase the independent living age. It has been raised to 25 years in this budget-a retrograde step. That means that if you are 24 years of age and you want a tertiary education then the Liberal Party thinks that you should still be living with mummy and daddy and mummy and daddy should be able to pay. Your parents' income is going to continue to be assessed as the basis of your eligibility for Austudy. It gets worse. If you start a course below the age of 25 your parental income is assessed not just when you are 24, it is assessed for the remainder of that course of study. If at the age of 24 you enrol for law, medicine, arts, science or anything else, at the age of 27, when you are still at university, the Liberal Party thinks you should still be living with mummy and daddy. The parental income will still apply to you when you are 27 years old. That is not fanciful, particularly in relation to medicine. If, perchance, someone from a low-income family does manage to get into medicine-it is considered as a second degree course-it means that people will be commencing that course no earlier than 21 or 22 years of age and it is quite possible that people will be starting medicine at the age of 23 or 24. When they are 28 years old the Liberal Party says, 'No, you are not living independently, mummy and daddy are still paying your way.' That is fine if mummy and daddy happen to be rich. It is not too good if you come from an ordinary working class family. This budget, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said, is one for people who are not old, who are not sick, and who do not have children. It is contemptuously unfair. It helps the privileged become more privileged. Worse though, rather than leave just the less well-off alone, rather than ignore those in less Hollis, C. fortunate positions-wrong as that would be-it actually increases the burden on those ordinary Australians and on disadvantaged Australians. Much of these changes were not put to the people of Australia. They are not decisions that the government could claim any mandate for. What is more, there is no economic need for this harsh budget.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1996·97 Second Reading Debate resumed.,67
246,Mr MCARTHUR,COMMITTEE,"-The Howard government's first budget is strong and fair and spreads the burden of addressing the Beazley black hole of $10 billion inherited from the previous government. This year the government will spend nearly as much in interest payments on our government debt as we spend on the defence budget or on the education budget. Nearly $10 billion goes simply to pay interest on the national government credit card. This is a stark depiction of the situation facing our nation as we head towards the new century. Only six years ago the Commonwealth government debt stood at $17 billion. Today it stands at $96 billion. In one year as Treasurer and five years as Prime Minister, Paul Keating added $80 billion to the Commonwealth overdraft. If the Labor Party had their way, we would add to that figure, with the ongoing deficit, about $10 biIIion each year, such is the massive burden which future taxpayers must inevitably bear. It is the legacy of the Keating government: high deficit, spiralling debt, rubbery figures and unfunded generosity, where fiscal responsibility came a distant second to political patronage and payments to the noisiest interest groups. If ever there was a time for a fundamental rethink of the role and operation of the federal government in Australia, it is now. In the last 30 years the size and scope of the government in Australia has grown steadily. In 1960 the federal government's spending amounted to 17 per cent of GDP, whereas today the federal government's spending has risen to 27 per cent of GDP. More than one-third of that government spending is on welfare and social security. Australians are increasingly aware that bigger government has not found solutions to their lives in the suburbs or in rural Australia. In fact, it is part of the problem. Extensive government provision of goods and services has contributed to a culture of dependence and entitlement. The incentive for individuals to save and provide for the costs of health care, loss of employment, children's education, future retirement and even nursing home entry has been eroded by poorly targeted government assistance. Government generosity has allowed people to believe that these contingencies will be substantially funded by the taxpayer. Is it any wonder that household savings have fallen from 15 per cent of disposable income some 20 years ago to three per cent today? Is it any wonder that the proportion of Australians with private health insurance has fallen from 70 per cent in 1972 to under 39 per cent today? Should we be surprised that the cost of pharmaceutical subsidies to the Australian taxpayer has risen by nearly 10 per cent a year? Government outlays and Medicare benefits are rising by about four per cent a year in real terms, not just monetary terms. Our nation faces a challenge. It is a challenge which this government has chosen to confront head on in this budget. This budget reverses Labor's legacy of deficit and debt. There is nothing compassionate about spending money you do not have, as the Cain government found in Victoria. There is nothing clever or innovative about ignoring fundamental fiscal problems while they further deteriorate. The Howard government's plan will return the budget to surplus within three years without raising income tax, sales tax, petrol excise or company tax. Small business will gain from capital gains tax exemption when the business is sold to buy another similar enterprise or to provide for retirement. The provisional tax uplift factor has already been lowered to six per cent, giving a $180 million tax break to small businesses from July this year. The health system will gain from tax rebates up to $450 per year for families and $125 for singles who take out private health insurance to take the strain off public hospital waiting lists. Low and middle income families with young children will gain an extra $200 per child per year in tax rebates. Single income families with a child under five will gain an extra $500 per year in tax breaks. Up to $50 per fortnight will flow from the Commonwealth budget back into the family budget where it will be more wisely spent. This budget puts parents and individuals ahead of the bureaucracy. It will provide real and lasting benefits to a broad range of Australians, sustainable growth, low interest rates, greater job opportunities in small business and no new taxes as well as a real incentive for individuals to save to contribute to health care, tertiary education, pharmaceutical costs and nursing home entry. It will put an emphasis back on personal responsibility and on moving away from the culture of entitlement and dependency. The budget strengthens the family unit, sparks investor confidence and gets small business moving ahead and employing people. It has been made possible by spending cuts of $4.4 billion this year and a further $7.2 billion next year. Savings have been made in running costs, tightening the activity test for unemployment benefits, redirecting labour market programs and introducing a two-year waiting period for migrants to receive unemployment benefits. High income earners will contribute through a 15 per cent surcharge on superannuation contributions and a clampdown on tax avoidance. A Medicare surcharge for those high income earners who do not take out private health care will also be instituted. The need for these spending reductions is clearly illustrated by the sheer size of the recent deficits run by the former government. In 1995-96 the Labor government ran a $10.3 billion deficit. As a result of the Howard government's fiscal strategy the deficit will be reduced to $5.6 billion in 1996-97, and will move into surplus in two years time. Those in the ALP, the union movement and the compassion industry who oppose cuts to government spending implicitly support the policy of asking future generations to pay for our government benefits. As Alan Wood said in today's Australian: Social cohesion is . . . claimed to be threatened when almost any spending program or tax lurk is cut. The idea presumably is to build a coalition of vested interests that will oppose with indiscriminate vigour any threat to public spending. He goes on to say: What this is really about is seeking to form a coalition of privilege and preferment as part of a campaign to preserve the unwarranted and economically destructive monopoly privileges. One of the most important inputs into the budget debate has been the National Commission of Audit, which reported in June of this year. The commission was chaired by Professor Bob Officer and consisted of Elizabeth Alexander of Price Waterhouse, John Fraser of SBC Brinson and Maurice Newman of Bain and Co. The executive officer of the commission was Geoff Carmody of Access Economics. The commission imagined what government would look like if it truly worked for the people in the most efficient and cost effective way it could. It started from three basic principles: governments need to act efficiently; improving efficiency is preferable to cutting assistance to those in genuine need; and well managed government contributes to a more competitive economy. These are common sense principles with which all Australian taxpayers would agree. The simple fundamental questions which the commission asked each area of government activity were: is this a legitimate role for government; if so, which level of government; and is this activity being conducted in the most efficient manner? The commission pointed to policy areas where the role for government is highly questionable. In several areas they found government activities could be performed by the private sector and should be privatised or contracted out. In other areas there is extensive overlap and duplication between the federal and state governments. This has meant that the federal and state bureaucrats often duplicate effort in performing effectively the same function. It becomes difficult for citizens to know which level of government is responsible for particular decisions, which level of government deserves the credit or the blame for particular outcomes and which particular government has put up taxes or should take the credit for lowering taxes. There is widespread scope for cost shifting, such as in health where often the states find ways to transfer outpatient expenses onto Medicare. Across a whole range of areas, the commission advocated a handing over of responsibilities from the Commonwealth to the states. The commission further recommended that governments retreat from their role as service providers. They should concentrate on making policy decisions and funding services rather than actually providing them. For example, it suggested that university operating grants be given in the form of scholarships straight to students, who would then make a decision on which university they would attend. Universities would then be adaptable and responsive to student needs in a competitive market. This is not about ideology; it is simply about the efficiency that taxpayers are entitled to expect from government funded services. Governments will need to provide services with greater efficiency if they are to continue to provide them in the future. In some areas, the Commonwealth will have difficulty meeting the expectations of the community. The impact of the ageing population on expenditures in health, social security and aged care areas will be a major challenge. The commission observed: Action will be necessary to moderate expectations about what support the Commonwealth Government can reasonably be expected to provide and to strengthen incentives for self help by those who can afford it. The commission went on to estimate that spending on health care will increase from eight per cent of GDP to over 12 per cent of GDP in the next 50 years-equating it to a $15 billion increase. The age pension will be more difficult to fund for baby boomer retirees, who will make up 25 per cent of the population by the year 2041. The commission has also pointed to the extensive non-cash benefits which both pensioners and the unemployed receive and the potential disincentive which they produce for many to more actively seek employment. For example, the commission estimated that in 1993-94 the total of non-cash entitlements given to the unemployed was an average of $90 per week-and every member of this House would be fully aware of the impact of that non-cash estimate. This is aside from the $21,938 in cash benefits which the commission found would be paid to an unemployed family with young children. Those figures are most evident to members of this House who deal with that particular problem. These non-cash benefits add up to an extra $158 a week for sole parents. It is estimated that the value of non-cash benefits to sole parents actually outstrips the value of the main government pension paid. The real value of both cash and non-cash benefits has clearly risen in the last 10 years, according to the commission's analysis. The benefits available to pensioners and the unemployed represent a disincentive to find work or save for retirement. The National Commission of Audit is to be commended for its objective, rigorous assessment of the delivery of government services. It is pleasing that the government has decided to take up a number of its recommendations. The government will allow nursing homes to charge entry fees from those residents who are in a position to make a contribution to the capital standard of the nursing home. This will provide a much needed injection of private funds to a nursing home sector which is increasingly run down. Professor Bob Gregory, who was employed by the previous Labor government, estimated that it would require $500 million to bring nursing homes up to an acceptable standard. It is appropriate that those who can afford a capital contribution are asked to make one, subject to safeguards. These safeguards include a requirement that the home draw no more than $13,000 of the resident's contribution over a five-year period-and this is reasonable on any estimate. Pensioners who have not owned their own home in the last two years will pay no entry contribution whatsoever. In relation to health, the government has tackled the spiralling cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme in 1995-96 cost the taxpayers $2.6 billion. This figure will soar to $3.7 billion by the end of the decade, even despite the government's attempt to curb these costs. The concessional patient contribution to pharmaceuticals will rise to $3.20, a modest co-payment. The safety net of $166 will ensure that concessional patients pay no more than this for their medicines in anyone-year period. For other patients, the contribution will rise to $20 per script. It is sound economic and health policy to ensure that patients are not given an incentive to overuse pharmaceuticals. Cheap medicines and bulk-billed visits to the GP are often as an answer to health problems which preventive lifestyle measures would solve more effectively and permanently. Making expensive medicines available at token prices is always a sound public health policy, let alone a fiscally responsible one. Once again, responordinary sibility is eroded by the promise of cheap cure-aIls funded by the taxpayer. In higher education, students will be asked to pay a greater contribution to the cost of their university degrees. That payment can be deferred through the HECS system, so students pay it back when they are in a position to do so. Higher cost courses will attract a higher HECS contribution than lower cost courses, reflecting the relative size of the investment made by society in medical, dental and veterinary students. So-called tion is anything but free. It is paid for by the taxpayers, 85 per cent of whom have never had the benefit of a tertiary education. The Labor Party's opposition to the new HECS charges is surprising, given their claims to championing equity considerations. Even the present HECS system still results in a significant subsidy flowing from taxpayers to largely high and middle income recipients. Perhaps the ALP really has become the party of the intellectual elite rather than working Australians. Nursing homes, pharmaceuticals and higher education are all areas where Australians should be encouraged to make a greater contribution themselves rather than relying on the taxpayer. This is a budget which reverses the Labor legacy of deficit and debt, putting families, small business and individual responsibility first. It will see the deficit brought under control without the need to increase taxes in the Labor tradition. It will produce sustainable growth, low interest rates, attract people back to private health insurance and provide real job opportunities. It picks up on some of the valuable work done by the Commission of Audit, which sets guidelines for the way government ought to work. It will see a greater emphasis on individuals saving, taking responsibility and providing for themselves and their future. Any move to block aspects of this budget seen is symptomatic of a cynical view which says that the taxpayers of tomorrow should fund the extensive government entitlements we currently enjoy. When the Labor Party, not minority parties, trade unions and social commentators call their stance compassionate, Australians are entitled to reject their view.",68
247,Mr WILLIS,COMMITTEE,"Gellibrand) (8.18 p.m.}-This is a somewhat smaller audience than that for my last budget speech. I rise to support the amendment to Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1996-97 moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). The government has claimed three basic virtues for this budget: it is an exceptionally honest budget, it is an economically essential budget, and it is a fair budget. None of these contentions has free educa- any validity. With regard to budget honesty, I note that, although the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his speech made much of budget honesty, this is a most dishonest budget. The fundamental dishonesty is the basic presumption of this budget that, because the estimated underlying budget outcome for 1996-97 is $9 billion greater than was forecast in the 1995 budget, Australia has a major fiscal problem that was left by the previous government and which a responsible government must address by substantial fiscal tightening. That is a patently ludicrous proposition. The undeniable fact is that Australia's budgetary position is one of the best in the Western world. The latest GECD statistics for July show that Australia's budget deficit for 1995 was the equal third lowest of the top 20 GECD countries. For 1996-97 it was projected to be the equal second lowest, and that was before this budget was produced. So if we had a severe budget problem before this budget, the finance ministers in most of the other GECD countries should have been slashing their wrists. Likewise with government debt: even though it increased significantly in the first half of the 1990s as a result of the recession, it is still at very low levels compared with most other GECD countries. The latest GECD figures show that, of the 17 countries for which information is available, Australia's government debt is the fourth lowest. At 29 per cent of GDP, it is 18 per cent of GDP below the GECD average. Nor were we likely to increase our debt burden in the foreseeable future. The budget papers show that, without any of the fiscal tightening contained in this budget, Commonwealth government debt as a percentage of GDP would decline over the period to the end of the century. So we have a comparatively low level of government debt, and it is not on an increasing path. So much for the Treasurer's oft repeated claim that we were on a path of deficit and debt into the next century. The fact is that, by the standards set by the European Union for entry into its single currency arrangement, Australia passed the test of fiscal rectitude with flying colours. fiscal standard set by the European Union under the Maastricht treaty is for the budget deficit to be less than three per cent of GDP and the government debt to be less than 60 per cent of GDP. Currently, only tiny Luxembourg meets that standard-not Germany, not France, not Britain, certainly not Italy or any of the other 15 EU countries. But Australia easily met the standard before this budget. The Commonwealth budget deficit for 1996-97 on a no policy change basis was only $3.4 billion, or 0.6 per cent of GDP, compared with the Maastricht treaty target of three per cent. Even taking our underlying budget deficit, which is not the Maastricht concept, our no policy change deficit of 1.9 per cent of GDP for 1996-97 was comfortably within the Maastricht target, as was our level of government debt. So where is the drastic budgetary problem Australia is supposed to be facing according to this government? Clearly, by the standards of comparable countries we do not have a budgetary problem, and we do not have a government debt problem. For all this government's talk of increasing deficit and debt and budget black holes, the fact is that Labor left this country in good fiscal shape-much better than most other Western countries, and much better than that which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) left us in 1983 when the budget deficit he handed Labor was five per cent of GDP, or over $25 billion in today's dollars. The fact is the budget crisis that this government would have the electorate believe it is battling to overcome does not exist, but the government wants to generate a crisis mentality in the community so as to falsely denigrate the previous government and to give it the cover to do what it has always wanted to do; that is, to slash the public sector; to slash programs that assist people in need; to slash expenditure on various bodies that they have a special distaste for, like the ABC and ATSIC-in short, to give effect to the full panoply of conservative prejudices and predilections that were first paraded in Fightback. This is not a matter of economics; it is a matter of ideology. In relation to the presentation of the budget, The we see also more dishonesty. It has been altered in various ways to maximise the appearance of a budget problem. The budget papers for this year do not include the international comparisons of our budgetary and government debt positions that were included in previous years because, as I have already shown, they would contravene the government's attempts to portray Australia as having a serious budgetary problem. Also, the government falsely portrays the underlying budget outcome as the actual budget outcome, thus the Treasurer says on page 1 of his budget speech: The budget outcome for the past year was a deficit of $10.3 billion. If we took no corrective measures it would be $9.6 billion this year. These figures are not the budget outcome at all. The actual budget outcome for 1995-96 was a deficit of $5,045 million; that is, about half the figure given by the Treasurer. The forecast actual budget outcome for 1996-97 is not a deficit at all. It is a surplus of $464 million, which is forecast to grow to a surplus of $6,638 million in 1997-98. But these figures, of course, are not mentioned by the Treasurer in his speech because they would not fit with his fiscal crisis rhetoric. The figures the Treasurer gave were for the underlying budget outcome, which is the actual budget outcome minus net advances, which comprise principally proceeds of sales of government enterprises and repayments of debt by the states. This attempt to portray the underlying budget outcome as the budget outcome is most insidious. The underlying concept is no more than an analytical tool, as it is with the consumer price index. Treasury has long calculated an underlying CPI, but it is not portrayed as the CPI outcome. If it is misused in this way, then the underlying budget outcome will be seen as just the 'lying' budget outcome. Also, as part of this underhanded attempt to portray the underlying budget outcome as the budget outcome, the budget papers give little information on the actual budget outcome. Mostly they refer to the underlying balance with the actual or headline budget balance reduced to a memorandum item. Thus the budget outcome data for all the years back to 1960 is given in terms of the underlying balance with no detail given for the actual budget outcome, as has been done in previous years' budget papers. This, again, is a totally outrageous misuse of the underlying concept. This attempt to portray the underlying budget outcome as the budget outcome is not what other countries do, as the Secretary to the Treasury admitted in an address last week. Furthermore, there is no clear line between the actual outcome and the underlying outcome in terms of their impact on national savings, government debt or pressure on financial markets. For instance, the proceeds of asset sales do not add to national savings in the same way as most tax increases or expenditure cuts do. They do, nevertheless, reduce the government's borrowings, and so reduce pressure on financial markets from government borrowings, and also reduce the level of government debt below what it would otherwise be. But the government wants to claim the need for a tough budget to reduce government debt whilst ignoring the reduction of debt coming from asset sales. Furthermore, not all expenditure cuts or tax increases add to national savings, thus expenditure cuts to the states, which are $1.6 billion for general purpose payments, and further large cuts in specific purpose payments do not of themselves add to national savings. Also, increased taxes on superannuation do not add to national savings, yet this is worth another $1.5 billion in this budget. So the underlying budget balance does not give an accurate picture of the additions to savings flowing from the budget or of the impact on government debt. Therefore, to use this as the budget outcome to the exclusion of the actual budget outcome is to dishonestly present the budget outcome. In relation to broken promises, it is remarkable that in a budget which loudly proclaims the virtue of budget honesty there are myriad broken election promises. By the time the Treasurer finished his budget speech, he was knee deep in broken promises-in fact, $17 billion worth. It requires a particularly thick hide to simultaneously break promises on a wholesale scale and claim the virtue of unprecedented budget honesty. But this Treasurer has shown he has a hide of truly rhinoceros proportions. This utterly cynical approach to campaign promises has been made even more squalid by the post-election attempt to distinguish promises on the basis of their being core or non-core. However, in respect of one broken promise, the government does not justify it as being non-core. It just baldly denies it has been broken. I refer to the now Treasurer's oft repeated specific election promise on taxation, which was not to increase any tax or to introduce any new tax. This clear promise has been utterly and undeniably broken by the general increase in the Medicare levy, the increase in the Medicare levy for higher income earners, the increase in the sales tax on government-owned private-plated cars, the increase in tax on superannuation for higher income earners, the increase in tax on imported goods through a reduction in the tariff concession system and the policy by-law, and the increase in company tax for firms engaging in research and development through a reduction in the tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. These measures are worth $853 million this year and almost $5 billion over four years, yet this Treasurer keeps maintaining he has not broken his promise. Thus, on the ABC radio program PM on 29 August, the Treasurer, in claiming he had eschewed revenue measures in the budget, said that 'it was like the dog that didn't bark'--and the dog that did not bark was the tax dog. This is just blatant denial of the undeniable. Clearly, along with a lot of other canine utterances on budget night, we all heard the very loud bark of the tax dog. The supposed justification we have been given for this welter of broken promises is the difference of $9 biIIion in the current forecast for the underlying budget deficit for 1996-97 on a no policy change basis from that which was assessed at the time of the 1995 budget. But here again there is more budget dishonesty. No attempt has been made by the government to explain why there is this difference. All we are told is that increased outlays from decisions by the former government account for $0.6 billion of this difference and the is due to parameter and other variations. Surely, since s.o much is being made of this difference, the government had a responsibility to say why this had occurred. But what is clear is that a substantial factor in this difference is the lower rate of inflation that occurred in 1995-96, and is now forecast for 199697, compared with the forecast for inflation in the 1995 budget. But why should lower inflation require a tightening of budgetary policy? Lower inflation is a good economic outcome. It is not evidence of some policy failure; it is what we want to achieve. Also, lower inflation is of itself a positive for national savings. High inflation clearly has been a factor in Australia's poor private savings performance in the past. It is not some adverse development to have low inflation that requires corrective action. Likewise, reduced forecasts for employment growth, especially for this year, have meant that employment is now expected to be about 120,000 less in 1996-97 than was forecast in the 1995 budget. This means that outlays on unemployment benefits will be much higher than previously projected. But what sense does it make to react to lower employment by substantially tightening fiscal policy thereby further reducing employment growth, or by slashing expenditure on labour market programs, or by cutting unemployment benefit entitlements or other programs of great assistance to the unemployed? Instead of blaming and attacking the victims, what we need to redress higher unemployment is higher economic growth. That would create more jobs and reduce the budget deficit by increasing revenue and reducing expenditure on unemployment benefits. But this budget does the reverse. It reduces economic growth. The budget papers admit that, even allowing for questionable offsetting confidence effects, the effect of the budget is a small net contractionary impact on activity in 1996-97. So on its face this budget reduces economic growth and therefore increases unemployment above what it would otherwise be. The number of unemployment beneficiary recipients is expected to grow from 802,000 rest last year to 829,000 this year. Employment growth is expected to be only lY2 per cent, compared with 2V2 per cent last year. Indeed, what is absolutely clear from this budget is that this government has, at the first available opportunity, run up the white flag on unemployment. Its budget employment forecasts show that over the three years 199697 to 1998-99 there will be an employment growth of only 5.3 per cent, compared with a rise of 8.7 per cent in the three years up to 1995-96. They expect to create only 440,000 additional jobs in the next three years, compared with 666,000 additional jobs in the previous three years, which means they expect to create 226,000 fewer jobs in three years than were created in the previous three years under Labor's policies. What an admission! What an extraordinary up-front declaration of failure! What an abandonment of what the Prime Minister listed in his election policy speech as a major concern of a coalition government, which was to attack head-on the continuing national unemployment crisis, especially among younger Australians. Instead, what we have in their first economic statement is a head-on attack on the unemployed-not unemployment-and the admission that they expect to nowhere near match Labor's rate of job growth. So much for all the government's assertions about how we could expect a profusion of real jobs from their industrial relations legislation, from small business policies and from their fiscal policies. The promise of faster job growth was apparently a non-core promise which they have now jettisoned at the first available opportunity. It is much the same with economic growth. Their forecast for economic growth over the next three years is for markedly slower growth than Labor achieved in the three years to 1995-96. In those three years economic growth was over four per cent each year, for a combined increase of 12.9 per cent. For the three years 1996-97 to 1998-99 this budget forecasts economic growth which is never above 3Y2 per cent in a year and which amounts to only 10.6 per cent over the three years-that is, 2.3 per cent less than in the previous three years. So this budget is a declaration by the Howard government that they cannot match it with Labor. They cannot match it on economic growth. They cannot match it on employment growth. It is an absolute expose of all this government's rhetoric about how they would create a better economy. But in a stupendous, rhinoceros performance the Treasurer claimed in his budget speech that Labor's period in government represented a failure and his budget would set us on a winning course. So, according to this Treasurer, high economic and employment growth represents failure and low economic and employment growth represents a winning course. Can anyone take this man seriously? This government's economic strategy is also utterly perverse in that, whilst it claims a tough budget is needed to increase public savings to enhance national savings, it is clearly undermining national savings through its policy on private savings. The superannuation scheme that Labor put into place and proposed to dramatically expand in last year's budget provided a major boost to national savings of two per cent of GDP by the year 2000 and four per cent by the year 2020. This required the introduction of compulsory employee contributions and the payment of the second leg of the tax cuts as a matching government contribution to employee and self-employed contributions to superannuation. their But this government is apparently intent on sabotaging all that, because by legislating to remove superannuation as an award condition it is removing the mechanism for introducing compulsory employee superannuation contributions. So how are we to introduce compulsory employee contributions? The government is also clearly prevaricating about whether it will pay the second leg of the tax cuts as matching contributions to superannuation. On the 7.30 Report on 21 August, Mr Kerry O'Brien asked the Prime Minister: On the L-A-W law tax cuts that are now scheduled to be paid to individuals by the Government as a super contribution ... the Treasurer's comments in the Budget documents, and again today in his speech to the Press Club, suggests that you may not pay them as super. Is it now more likely that you would restore them as a tax cut? The Prime Minister replied: I, I, I, I think it's too early to say. So clearly the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are actively contemplating not paying the matching contribution to super at all but paying it as a normal tax cut, thereby breaking another election promise and causing a major loss of savings. Only a small percentage of the $4 billion or so would be saved if paid as a normal tax cut whereas, if paid as a matching contribution to super, all of it would be saved. So what an irony. Here we have the government breaking scores of promises, attacking people in need, destroying or impairing essential programs and ripping the heart out of Australia's already small public sector all in the supposed cause of increased national savings, while simultaneously sabotaging the greatest boost to private and national savings ever put in place in the history of this try. A responsible approach to this budget would have required fully costed promises at the last election, which Labor made but the coalition did not; a continuance of the process of fiscal consolidation, which Labor put in place despite the opposition's attempts to us; maintaining a pace of fiscal consolidation that did not impede economic or employment growth; taking a much tougher approach on tax avoidance, especially in relation to very wealthy people and people avoiding tax by contract employment arrangements and use of interposed entities; not slashing worthwhile programs or attacking people in need; and fully supporting the super arrangements announced last year. That would really have given us an honest, economically responsible and fair budget.",71
248,Mr MCDOUGALL,COMMITTEE,"Griffith) (8.38 p.m.)I rise tonight to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and all those who worked to create a budget which offers renewed hope for the people of Australia. I do not have to remind anyone in this chamber that the electoral thermometer is the telephone. We work on an old television network theory that one telephone call represents 500 people who had the same thought but who did not pick up the phone. In the days following the budget, the calls we had from the people of the Griffith electorate were positive and, in the main, were inquiries for more details rather than criticisms. The sad truth is that the economy we inherited was in such a state of disaster that few believed we could come up with a recipe for recovery without hitting everyone with even more tax. But here it is.",76
249,Dr LAWRENCE,COMMITTEE,We have just heard this repudiated.,76
250,Mr MCDOUGALL,COMMITTEE,"And you listen to this: no increase in income tax, no increase in general company taxes, no increase in wholesale sales tax rates and no increase in petrol, tobacco or alcohol taxes. With the pre-budget clamouring by union leaders, who appear to believe they have the mandate to set policy for all Australians, along with the cries of foul and poverty from coun- the opposition, my electorate office was geared for a flood of calls from alarmed constituents. But we did not start to get the calls of alarm until after the opposition had rifled through the budget documents searching desperately for something-anything-to hold up as a version of a disaster. Then I spoke stop with a tearful full-age pensioner who had been told that she would be charged an entry fee contribution to enter a nursing home. This disgraceful lie did not come from a member of the coalition. Sadly for this country, instead of an opposition which scrutinises government policy to come up with constructive criticism, all we have had is scaremongering and misrepresentation of the facts. This has been most evident in the nursing home reform, which, coupled with the minister's aged care structural reform package, has been well received in my electorate-and for good reason. As I had visited several nursing homes leading up to the budget, it came as no news to me that 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with four or more beds. Nor was I surprised to learn that 75 per cent of our nursing homes do not meet our most basic Australian building standards. But what was of greatest concern was the number of hostel beds being used for nursing home patients. These patients were having to do with unsatisfactory facilities-bathrooms not big enough to take wheelchairs, stairs instead of ramps and other similar inequities. The hostel proprietors in my electorate have worked hard caring for all their residents but are suffering from the results of the patch-up job of the last 13 years. While money has been thrown at the problem, not enough time or expertise has been spent resolving the cause. Following the budget, I met with several major hostels-and in one case the founder of one of the largest hostels in the region. I am pleased to report that they are more than happy with this budget initiative and are anxious to get the new programs under way. Hostel beds which have been vacant can finally be converted to desperately needed nursing home beds. The introduction of an entry contribution for those who can afford to pay will help towards creating a more economically viable nursing home system to support those who cannot pay. Let us get back to that vital telephone graph. Of major interest in my community was the school to work scheme. As it is such a new and innovative program, it did need some explaining. One of my first meetings was at the Balmoral State High School. The principal, Lesley Englert, is a woman of vision and a dedicated educator. She had honed in on our increase in funding and commitment to the literacy and numeracy strategy. Her first question was how she could tap into this to advance the program she already had up and running at her school. Her concern was that we did not forget the high school students who need help. We took a long hard look at the statistics. At some secondary schools in my electorate, an alarming 25 per cent of grade 10 students do not pass the standard literacy and numeracy test. This means that they cannot go on to take the Board of Secondary Study course-the precursor for tertiary education. It also means that they do not have adequate reading and writing skills to move easily into the business world and are destined for the unemployment circuit. Fortunately, 95 per cent of these students stay on to do year 11 and 12, and this is when principals like Lesley Englert work at improving their literacy and numeracy using T AFE literacy modules. I believe that we must expand our literacy and numeracy program to the high schools or we will continue to allow a forgotten generation to enter the work force without these basic skills, skills which are their educational birth right. The fact that Labor had made no provision to continue this program was a disgrace. We need to reassure the parents, teachers and the secondary school students themselves that, after 13 years of being ignored by the Labor government, help is on the way. As a result of our budget policy all students, primary and secondary, should be able to read, write, spell and communicate with ease and assurance. Besides our literacy and numeracy strategy, school principals I have spoken with are enthusiastic about the school to work strategy. Already, several have suggested we organise meetings with local business people and other relevant organisations to get the best advantage possible for students. Another response I had about the budget came from parents I met at Villanova College, a private school in my electorate. Breaking the mind-set that the unemployment benefit is a salary paid to school leavers was a point on which they were most vocal. After 13 years of welfare democracy, we now see a second generation of school leavers who expect to live on government welfare rather than income earned. There is a ground swell of belief in my electorate that this can be turned around only if we assist small business to recover and general employment. That brings us to this vital section of the community. We have put in place a 100-day action plan. We have abandoned Labor's proposal to force subcontractors into the PAYE net. We have created an economic benefit from the capital gains tax and we have reduced the provisional tax uplift factor. My electorate contains a wide range of small business. Many of these are in the retail trade and many in the service industry. A survey I completed prior to the budget showed that just over 50 per cent of all small business in the Griffith electorate are twoto five-person operations. On further investigation I found these were mainly a husband and wife team, who could not take a holiday together unless they closed up the shop. On even closer study I found that most of this large group in our community could not afford to take on a third employee and in every case-and I must repeat in every casewe were told this was partly because of the unfair dismissal law. It stands to reason that a small business just two people must be doing reasonably well to be able to employ a third person. it is also glaringly obvious that if this proves to be dishonest, dishonourable or disadvantage to that small business they cannot keep that person for the up to nine months it currently takes to go through the dismissal procedure. While there are many other elements of the new workplace bill be considered, this one I believe has the Australians. undivided support of the business community. I can only presume that those in the Senate who are blocking this legislation have not spent time with the small business operators in their community. I will be reminding the small business operators in my electorate that the coalition government in the lower house has passed the laws to make these changes. It is the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and a couple of Greens in the Senate who are saying no to the change. I can cite business after business coming to me asking for a way of avoiding the protractalready ed battle with unions and lawyers when they find themselves in the position of wanting retrench a staff member. One small business operator with a staff of more than 30 told she is still paying claims to two people she dismissed last year. They had been caught red-handed in a scam which had resulted the theft of more than $200,000 worth of goods from her business. Her profit for the first six months of this year has already been spent on defending the unfair dismissal case. This employer did not set out to treat her unfairly. She followed all the rules and guidelines set down by the unions and Industrial Relations Commission. But there is a serious indication that, no matter what advice she took, and regardless of how fairly she believed she had established her working place, she could never cover all the bases once an employee chose to use the unfair dismissal system. What we are seeing here are good, honest, hard workers being discriminated against because of the handful of dishonest members of the work force. We all know that the success of this budget lies in the strategy as a whole. Unlike the previous government, we of have not thrown cash at the problems, but we have prepared a strategy which will create But long-term security for all members of the person Australian community. It became obvious a within days of the Treasurer's budget speech that we had to get the truth out into the community to offset the innuendo and, in many cases, the straight-out lies being peddled by those who are not genuine in their to effort and their concern for the future of As a result we have had excellent feedback from schools, hostels, nursing homes and community organisations such as the Queensland Carers Association. This large welfare organisation came to me prior to the budget saying they believed they had received less than a fair deal under Labor. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) involved the Carers Association of Australia in its budget planning and, as a result, the Queensland Carers Association now has three programs undergoing trials. The first program, for residential respite, is under way. The second program, for a community and home booking service, is to about to be established and this will be followed by the introduction of an after-hours me emergency service. These additional vital programs for the carers in our community are a direct result of the work done by this in government in its budget planning. To be able to visit with such organisations in less than two weeks after the budget and see such positive action already in place gives staff a whole new meaning to my job representing the people of Griffith, which has been a the Labor seat for the past 18 years. It has been hard for the Labor lobbyists in my electorate to accept the fact that this budget helps the battler, the breadwinner and, most of all, the families in our community. For generations, Australia has been about fair play and for the first time in 13 years all Australians-and I stress all Australians-are back in the game.",76
251,Mr OCONNOR,COMMITTEE,"The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has betrayed regional Australia in this budget. The regional seats held by the Liberal and National Party members have become the forgotten electorates of this nation. When John Howard moved his office to Sydney the ominous signs were there that this government would govern primarily for metropolitan Australia, and this budget confirms that Australians living outside Sydney and other capital cities have become second-class citizens under this government, represented by absentee landlords, coalition landlords, who, like their leader, John Howard, believe that Australia stops at the outskirts of Sydney and other state capital cities. This betrayal of regional Australia was brazenly stated by the National Party Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in a press release announcing the axing of the regional development program when he said that there is no clear rational or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development. There have been few other statements in the House since the March election which rival Minister Sharp'S statement of betrayal. In one sentence he has demonstrated just how out of touch with regional Australia the Liberal and National parties have become in barely six months in office. The minister and the government see no clear rationale for a Commonwealth involvement in the economic development of the great regions of this nation. They can see no clear rationale for an involvement that will stimulate job growth in country towns. They can see no clear rationale for a Commonwealth involvement that stimulates the growth of small business in regional Australia. They can see no clear rationale for providing some hope for our young people in regional areas that they might find a productive job in an expanding regional economic base. And they can see no clear rationale for the Commonwealth joining in partnership with local governments and local communities to empower those communities to take advantage of their economic assets and to participate more fully in the expansion of global trade. Yes, the betrayal of Australia's regions in this budget has been both swift and comprehensive. The coalition has made great play on the floor of this House of the fact that it won many rural and regional seats at the last election. I do not deny that political reality. But what has come with that situation is a special political responsibility to the people in those regions, and it is those people who today feel betrayed and abandoned by this cynical government. One of the great myths that was cultivated by the Liberal and National parties is the portrayal of Labor in government as anti-rural and anti-region. With this Howard budget we have really our first chance to get beyond the rhetoric and compare the performance of Labor and the coalition in government. It is in that comparison that the lies and the broken promises of the Prime Minister are clearly exposed. It was Labor in government that provided hundreds of millions of dollars to labour market programs, that gave the long-term unemployed in regional areas a chance to acquire new skills and to get a job. It is the Howard government which has cut $1.8 billion out of those programs and denied young people in rural areas a real chance to improve their industrial skills. It was Labor in government that supported our great universal health system, Medicare, which provides quality health care to Australians in regional areas. It is the Howard government, not Labor, that is closing Medicare offices in the bush and has withdrawn some $800 million from the great public hospital system that delivers quality health care to those people. It was Labor that provided $150 million for the regional development program which empowered regional communities to stimulate economic growth and jobs in regional areas. It is the Howard government which has abandoned the program on the basis that there is no clear rationale for Commonwealth involvement in regional economic development. It was Labor which supported the network of public services and public employment in regional areas. It is the Howard government which has closed the Medicare offices, taxation offices, CES offices and DSS offices in regional areas. It was Labor that greatly expanded the opportunity of young students from country areas to attend universities and TAPEs. It is the Howard government which has slashed funding from those very universities and TAPEs, stopped assistance for students with disabilities from country areas and reduced funding to our secondary schools in regional areas. It was Labor-and cop this on the other side-which supported our great manufacturing exporters from the regions with programs such as the international trade enhancement scheme, the export market development grants scheme, research and development grants and the innovative agricultural marketing program. It is the coalition who slashed funding to these programs. It was a Labor Prime Minister who had the vision and the courage to commit the Commonwealth to a target to reduce unemployment in urban and regional areas. It is a weak-kneed Liberal Prime Minister who shies away from such a commitment like Dracula from the Cross. The final nail in the region's coffin is the Howard government's decision to cut $622 million over four years from the funding for the national highway system, those arteries that link the great regions of the country with one another and with their urban markets. This coalition budget will have a significant adverse impact on the great nonmetropolitan seat of Corio, which I represent in this parliament. Indeed, the strong partnerships that have been assiduously developed between the Geelong region and the Commonwealth have now been shattered by this budget. The importance of the public sector to the maintenance of job and economic growth in regional areas such as Geelong cannot be underestimated or understated. It has been estimated that around $1 million a day of Commonwealth money flows into the region through the wages and salaries of public sector employees, through the old labour market programs that Labor sponsored and through capital expenditure on social and economic infrastructure such as schools and roads. The essential point seems to be lost on this government that public sector employees spend their wages in private sector businesses in their local communities. When a decision is made to construct a piece of social or economic infrastructure, such as the Deakin wool stores and the Geelong manufacturing industry training centre, that work is invariably done by local private firms. The local employment gains are substantial, and the resultant increase in economic activity reverberates through many smaller private businesses in those local communities. It is these businesses that will ultimately pay the price of this government's budget of betrayal. In Geelong, the Howard government cuts have been most savage. They will leave long term scars on the local economy and on the disadvantaged in our community. The building better cities program has been abolished, cutting off vital access to Commonwealth funds to local projects such as the Whittington Link redevelopment and the refurbishment of the Geelong Botanical Gardens. There will be no more projects like the Deakin wool stores and the transport interchange which provided over 250 construction jobs and provided a much needed economic stimulus to local construction firms. The regional development program has been abolished. The Golden REDO, linking the great provincial cities of Geelong and Ballarat, will not be able to access vital infrastructure funds for projects of major economic significance such as the redevelopment of Avalon airport as a dedicated air freight centre. Deakin University in Geelong, which in 1995 was named Australian University of the Year, has had its funding slashed, with subsequent losses in jobs and a reduction in student places. Local secondary schools, which received essential funding to upgrade their capital assets, have that funding reduced in the first Howard budget. Labour market programs such as jobskills and new work opportunities, which have been extremely successful in Geelong in providing the long-term unemployed with new skills to assist them to find work, are to be terminated. Geelong businesses, which have been the users of these labour market programs and export development programs, will have their access to them terminated or curtailed. Those businesses will also suffer from reduced Commonwealth expenditure overall in the Geelong region. But it does not end there. Older people in Geelong will be badly affected by the introduction of up-front nursing home fees, increased charges for their home and community care service and the closure of the local Medicare offices in Corio. Older people in Corio and Norlane, along with the unemployed and disadvantaged, will be badly affected by the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program. The Corio community health centre has informed me that it has over 2,000 people on its waiting list for emergency dental treatment. Those people will now not have access to this dental program that offered them some hope of treatment, and they have John Howard to thank for that. If the budget was not enough, the Howard government is planning to introduce a Kennett-style industrial relations bill that away the wages, the conditions and the industrial rights of Geelong workers and unionists. But nowhere is the deep sense of betrayal more apparent at the first Howard budget and nowhere is it more keenly felt than by the youth of Geelong and by young people in rural and regional areas of Australia. The litany of broken promises by John Howard has left our young people with an acute sense of despair and disillusionment with the current political leadership of this country and with the political processes of our great nation. The devastating reality of this budget has confirmed the worse fears of our youth that they have been cynically manipulated by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer who seek to treat young voting adults as children by attempting to convince them that you can make a full promise at an election and deliver on half a promise at budget time. To young people, promises are promises. They are not divided by some semantic gymnastics of the Prime Minister into core and non-core promises. The tragedy of the first Howard budget is that it offers no hope to our young people that the economy will grow at a rate necessary to create the entry level jobs they so desperately seek. The Prime Minister admits in the budget papers that the economy will grow at only 3.5 per cent in coming years. That is not enough to absorb young new entrants to the work force or to dent the numbers of unemployed. The enormous restructuring that has gone on within Australian enterprises and the economy over the past two decades has meant that those entry level jobs into the work force for our young people have contracted considerably. Many young people in Geelong who have been out of work for long periods of time have come to rely on a range of labour market programs to assist them in obtaining the necessary work skills to make them competitive in the labour market. In Geelong, the previous Labor government had considerable success through LEAP and through jobs kills in preparing Geelong youth for the work force. Some 47 LEAPs involving strips over 600 long-term unemployed Geelong youth have been undertaken to upgrade community recreational assets and to protect the environment. Those projects included the Eastern Beach Reserve development, the Limeburners BayHovells Creek development, the Corio recycling and environment project, the Old Geelong Courthouse restoration, the Brisbane Ranges National Park project, the Geelong Cemetery, the Newtown community playground project, the Avalon coastal walk, the You Yangs walking track, Buckley Falls restoration and the Cowies Creek restoration. These are the types of valuable community programs that are now being terminated by this government. As for students in the Geelong region, they have been singled out for treatment by this government. Increases in HECS charges and changes to Austudy represent a direct attack on the less well-off students in our community. Massive cuts to funding for higher education will in the end mean fewer places, fewer staff and a tragic run-down of one of Australia's great economic and social assetsour tertiary education sector. But the bad news does not end there. The young unemployed, students and other young low income people in Geelong will not have access to essential dental care with the abolition of the dental health program at the Corio Community Health Centre and the Geelong and Bellarine hospitals. Disadvantaged at risk young people who have in the recent past received support through organisations such as St Augustines and its stasworks and newstart programs will have their opportunities curtailed by funding cuts to those programs that supported their activities. Young Geelong people who have accessed the successful jobskills programs run by the Brotherhood of St Laurence in Geelong, the City of Greater Geelong and skillshare to obtain valuable work experience and training will no longer be able to do so with the termination of these programs. As I stated, John Howard has cynically betrayed the hopes and the aspirations of Geelong's young people for a better deal from the Commonwealth in this budget. This is a flawed budget. It gives vent to the deep seated ideological prejudices of extreme elements in the coalition and it fails every equity and justice test that you want to put up. Regrettably, it is a budget that has betrayed regional Australia. Nowhere is the sense of betrayal more deeply felt than in those great regions which must now bear the full weight of John Howard's deceit. John Howard promised the unemployed in regional areas that he would maintain funding for labour market programs-he lied. John Howard promised he would not cut the number of university places at regional universities-he lied. John Howard promised to retain the regional development programhe lied. John Howard promised to retain funding for the ABC and its regional networks-he lied. John Howard promised to retain the export market development grants scheme for regional exporters-he lied. John Howard promised he would retain the Commonwealth dental health program and he broke that promise. John Howard promised that affordable quality child care would be availableMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-I call on the member for Corio to refer to the Prime Minister by his title.",79
252,Mr OCONNOR,COMMITTEE,"The Prime Minister, John Howard, promised that affordable quality child care would be available on an equal basis to all Australians in regional areas-he broke that promise again. The cuts to essential programs in this budget cannot be justified on economic grounds. They will increase inequalities in our society and punish those who are already disadvantaged. There are very good reasons why the Prime Minister, John Howard, wants a surplus on the budget so quickly. He wants to absolve his guilt from his previous time as Treasurer because he could never bring the Commonwealth budget into surplus. There is one solution to the budget deficit of the Commonwealth government at this time. It is within the hands of the government to achieve a consistent level of economic growth that over the next three years will see that deficit rectified. But, on the Prime Minister's own admission and in his own budget papers, the Australian economy will not grow enough to create the new jobs that are required to absorb the unemployed and to create the opportunities for young people and others who are coming into the labour market in future years. Let us put on the public record once and for all that no coalition government in the postwar era was ever able to deliver a Commonwealth budget surplus. So in one sense we ought to be grateful that this government, after so many years in government in the postwar era, has finally established this as an objective of its economic policies. The most cynical betrayal in this budget is of the unemployed. The Prime Minister made great play during the election campaign that he had a solution to the unemployment problem in this country and that was the removal of the unfair dismissal provisions in the industrial relations law. If that was an effective solution to our economic problem of unemployment, then why has the budget paper stated very clearly that the Australian economy will grow at only 3.5 per cent and that employment growth will not be substantial?

253,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEE,"I am delighted tonight to rise to address Appropriation Bill (No.1), the budget. The budget brought down by the new Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the first Howard government is a fair budget. It is a fair budget and, as the Treasurer says, it addresses deficit and debt. The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) is leaving in a great hurry. I sat here and listened to his contribution to this debate with, I must admit, some amazement and alacrity. The overblown hyperbole and the rhetoric was absolutely staggering. This was from a bloke who sat on this side of the House for 13 years while his political party was in government. He watched Treasurer after Treasurer come into this place and tell us how tomorrow would be full of nirvana. The world's problems were solved because the Treasurer had brought down another fantastic budget. What happened? Here we are, 13 years later, saddled with incredible international debt, with a current account that continues to flow on and on in deficit, year after year. Debt builds upon debt. The member for Corio seems to think that we will achieve national significance, that we will achieve a better lifestyle for all Australians, if we continue spend our children's pay cheques some time after the year 2000-perhaps even after the year 2010. It is long past the time that we should have got the household budget in order. When the federal government spends Australians' hard earned income, we make an assumption that we can do it better than they can. What a lot of rot! Whoever told you that you knew how better to spend another bloke's money than that bloke knew how to spend it? It is an absolute nonsense. I applaud the Expenditure Review Committee, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) for doing the responsible thing in finally bringing down a budget that gives some hope to Australia. Despite the overblown rhetoric of the member for Corio, I have to say that the Australian public has warmed to this budget. They are happy with the budget because, finally, someone is taking the lead to address our overspending problem. We hear a lot in this place about the current account. I am not sure that everybody in Australia knows what the current account deficit is. I doubt seriously that, if I talked to my two daughters and my son, they could tell me in technical terms what the current account deficit is. Here is just a little bit of layman's economics. There are two factors of the current account that affect us and that are relevant to the debate here tonight. The first is savings. If, year after year, the government spends more than it gains in income, it cannot balance its budget. Do you know what happens then? Say you have got a Visa card, a Diner's Club card, an American Express card or a Bankcard. If you spend this month the total sum of your income next month, you will have difficulty eating, will you not? It is difficult to draw a cheque to find the money to meet the bills next month. So what do you do? You incur debt. That means that you have to pay interest. That is what is happening to us. Part of the current account deficit problem is a savings problem. The Australian government is drawing on savings-private sector savings-it is eating up those savings, by to irresponsibly running into debt. So half of our current account problem is due to the fact that we have to pay interest year after year on our borrowings, with expenditure being greater than the amount we have coming in. The other half of the current account problem has to do with international trade. It was true for a very long time that Australia was a very wealthy country. For a long time we exported more than we imported. Those years were years where the international community was willing to pay relatively high prices for our commodities compared with the prices paid for manufactured goods or services. Unfortunately, Australia and other countries who are producers of primary commoditieswhether they be minerals from the ground or agricultural commodities makes no difference-earn less today than they did 10 or years ago relative to other items in the national traded economy. In recent times, we have been able to increase our exports of manufactured That has been very positive. But we still have this huge net trade deficit in the manufacturtrial ing sector, including industries which manuthe facture chemicals and plastics and petroleum products-process industries. You can only keep running those for so long, because you keep building up debt on debt on debt, and you have to pay the interest on the bill. The solution to our problems is twofold. Firstly, we should not draw on Australia's savings; we should spend only the money which the government receives. That is what this budget sets out to do. Secondly, we should encourage industry to develop so that we sell more of our services, more of our manufactured goods and more of our process industry goods overseas. The budget also addresses this issue. The first part of the savings issue is simple for most of us to understand. When the Treasurer brought down the budget, he was commonly.' trying to put us in balance three years from now. The second part is the balance of trade. On this side of the House we are attempting to provide solutions to the trade imbalance problem through several mechanisms, the first of which is reform of our antiquated, archaic industrial relations laws, which has been part of the agenda on this side of the House since, really, 1984. When I listen to the rhetoric of Bill Kelty and Jennie George of the ACTU, it reminds me of the overblown 1950s rhetoric of class division, warfare, deprivation, hardship and those things that this government through this modest industrial relations 'reform' or modnot ernisation proposal is hoping to tackle. need to bring Australia not just into the century but into the 21st century, and that is what the workplace reform bill attempts. We are trying to negotiate with the Australtime Ian Democrats in the Senate. It is hopeless trying to negotiate with the Australian Labor Party in the Senate; they have foreshadowed over 200 amendments-and the shadow rates minister for trade, the member for Canberra 20 (Mr MCMullan), is at the table now. Those interover 200 amendments simply mean that the Labor Party is, once again, bidding the dictates of the ACTU in saying, 'We oppose the goods. bill-full stop. We oppose change.' The Labor Party kept changing the indusrelations environment, it kept changing regulations and it kept changing the 1988 bill. But now, all of a sudden, it cannot be changed any more. Paul Keating, in 1993 after he won the unwinnable election, the one he should not have won, went down to Melbourne on 21 April and gave a speech to the Institute of Company Directors. He said, amongst other things, 'We have to modernise this system. We need to reduce this antiquated awards system from hundreds of thousands of provisions down to a few core, basic provisions, as a safety net, if you will, and let all the rest of the matters go to bargaining between companies and individuals or companies and their collective bargaining agents. We need to make it easier for people to work together to create solutions that are satisfactory to them, that do not treat all industry Commonality in terms of the Communist Party, in terms of socialism as a major agenda in eastern Europe, starting in the Soviet Union, flunked, didn't it? It did not work. Why? Because there were no incentives to drive it and because a few people at the top decided they knew better than everybody else. That is like going back to the beginning of my argument about this budget. Do you members of the Australian Labor Party who sit in this minute, insignificant, irrelevant opposition in this House of Representatives all really think you know better than I do how to spend my money? I do not think so. And I do think, deep at heart, you do either, but We you have to keep running the line because 20th you do not know what else to talk about. You know you were deficient in not addressing the budget deficit problem a long ago, after the recession we did not have to have-Paul Keating's recession we did not need. As we started coming out of that, the then Treasurer was very slow to move interest down to let the economy open up again. He forgot about the fact that perhaps he should start withdrawing some of the spending. The economy started to lift as productivity improved and the gross domestic product grew as we produced more, as we became more active and provided more jobs. But what did the government do? It spent more money quickly, as much and as fast as possible. Talk about irresponsible: look at the lead-up to this most recent election. The then Minister for Employment, Education and Training was so paranoid about trying to artificially reduce the level of unemployment in Australia that he went out and spent a whole year's blessed budget in less than nine months on Working Nation. And the Working Nation programs, I can tell you, were bloated and overblown to begin with. The Working Nation propositions simply said that we have a serious unemployment problem which we need to address, that we need to do something to bring down the numbers of long-term unemployed. Admirable sentiments. No disagreement from me ever. The long-term unemployed are some of the most disadvantaged people that we could have in this country. But international studies have shown that spending heaps of taxpayers' money, heaps of public money on programs, programs, programs to advantage the people who are disadvantaged, does not work. Read the OECD studies. Read all of the international studies. It has never worked anywhere in the world. The only thing that has ever worked is if you go and pay employers to hire people. That works to some extent; but all the other stuff does not. So the Working Nation budget was overblown to begin with. DEET was absolutely flush with money. Everywhere you went there was money for programs, initiatives or things you could tender on. It was so awash with money all over the place that it was an absolute embarrassment. And you expect us, knowing this from opposition, to sit here and continue to waste Australians' money in such a ridiculous fashion. I tel1 you what, there is no way known that I could be party to continuing such an absolute fraud on the Australian people. So we intend to change the industrial relations environment. We intend to continue to let it evolve, to let it go down the path that the former Prime Minister indeed set as a pathway for Australia and one with which we never disagreed. So the things that you argue about in the Senate and the things about which we are now trying to convince the Independents and the Democrats are naturally progressive items in the reform of our workplace relations in Australia. They are simply aimed at letting employers and employees themselves decide things that affect their companies away from the central planning regime that never worked. Another one of the catchcries of economists that we hear constantly in this place and which you read about in the press in Australia. I have never seen this in the press anywhere else in the world-is the concept of micro-economic reform. Do you know what that is, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio? Of course you do. We al1 know what microeconomic reform means because we have had it stamped onto our foreheads. It is something like a branding iron which says, 'Microeconomic-I'm for that.' Everybody is for it. How many people really know what it means? It is a pretty simple concept. It simply means that we need to improve the efficiency of our utilities such as the electricity, natural gas and water supplies. We need to improve the efficiency of our transport industry-road transport, rail transport and air transport. We need to improve the efficiency of our waterfront and our coastal shipping operations. Why do we need to improve these things? We are an island nation. We are down in the Pacific and we are dependent on the rest of the world. We are not really all alone down here. There are 18 mil1ion of us in this huge country. We are a we'althy nation, no fear. We are one of the most powerful nations on earth notwithstanding our very small population. Why? Because Australians have been wil1ing to work hard-it is true that we are hard workers-because we are intelligent, because we believe in education, because we believe in fairness and equity and because we are one of the world's greatest democracies. Democracy empowers the individual. Democracy gives the individual the chance to grow. It does, doesn't it? That is one reason it works. We have accepted onto our shores people from all over the world. I am an example of that. I accept that. I am a migrant. I took out Australian citizenship and became totally involved in this country. My heart, my soul, my life is now Australia. It no longer belongs to where I came from. I know that there is no-one in this place that would deny me my heritage or my birth right. I hope I have contributed to Australia. By the time. I go to God, I would like to have helped to bring Australia part of the way back to its former glory. I hope to help-not do it on my own; no-one does anything on their own. Australia is a great country with heaps of people and we can do so much for ourselves if we do not hold ourselves back. Part of not holding ourselves back is trying to hang on to the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. This is 1996 and we are headed into 1997. We are not far away from the turn of the century and the world is moving so fast. Did you read the front page of the Australthe Ian this morning? A young man, 23 years of age, has established a new business. According to reports, I believe he spent some two years trying to write a program to give people terrific access to the Internet. He did not do very well with that so he wrote one in 24 hours and it has been a world beater. It is so good that at the age of 23 he is going to float part of his company on the stock market to get capital to grow and to buy the hardware that he needs to give people access to this piece of software. It is selling all over the world like crazy. What a success story. Talk about opportunity. We have heaps of opportunity, but you do not get that kind of opportunity under centralpromises ised control constraints. The party will tell you that you cannot do it. The member for Corio, who spoke in the debate before me, stood opposite and said that the government that he represented and was part of before we won the election in March used to spend money on these programs therefore we must keep spending it or it is unfair. Why is it unfair? It is for one of two reasons. The first is that it continues to prop up this thing we call middle class welfare-that is, the government takes away from people in the middle income range money in the way of taxes. We say, 'We want some of your money.' The Commissioner of Taxation demands that you give it to him. Those in the middle ground, the PAYE employees, frequently do not have a lot of opportunity to evade the net of the Commissioner of Taxation. They pay their taxes, he takes their money and then we in this place turn around and give it back to them. How stupid are we? I ask you: how dumb is that? We take their money and we decide how it should be spent and then we give it back. It seems like a dumb proposition to me. All the Treasurer and the government have done in this budget is try to reduce spending. Why do we need to spend taxpayers' money? Why do we know better than they do how to spend their own earnings?

254,Mr MCMULLAN,COMMITTEE,"I rise in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) to support the amendment moved by Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). It is a very comprehensive critique of the budget. It lists a substantial number of concerns that various shadow ministers, members of caucus and members of the community are seeing emerge as the detail of this budget is being more critically scrutinised. I want to speak in this debate about some particular aspects of this budget. Of course I will not have time to cover all the matters included in the amendment because it is very comprehensive. My central approach is: this is a budget that will stall the economy, will divide society and will limit our sense of nationhood. Taken with the litany of broken in this budget, it constitutes a budget of deceit, despair and division. Let me go through those points in sequence. With regard to stalling the economy, I indicate that that point has been made effectively by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in their contributions in this debate. In one sense it is not even a matter of contention. The government in its own budget papers accepts that this is a budget that will have a contractionary effect. The economy will grow less than it otherwise would have as a direct consequence of this budget. I fear the assessment in the budget that the economy will grow by 31,4 per cent is over-optimistic. The government accepts, almost without mention in the speech by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), that by next June unemployment will still be 81,4 per cent. The budget papers appear to establish that it is expected that unemployment benefit recipients will be at approximately the same level or perhaps slightly above the current level until the middle of 1998 and then it is hoped things might start to improve. That is a very pessimistic prognosis. That is the government's outline of its estimates. It is not my analysis. My concern isalthough I do not wish to pursue it this evening-that the result might actually be worse: that the growth might be less than 31,4 per cent and that, therefore, it will have consequences for employment and unemployment. But let us not pursue that. Let us assume for the moment that the government's proposals are right with what they have established and claimed is a prescription for slowing the economy, for slowing growth, and in particular employment growth, in an economy with 8Y2 per cent unemployment. When you look at it, the only possible assessment of the macro-economic consequences of this budget is that, first and on the surface, it withdraws the stimulus by pulling money out of the economy which, by every element of any form of macro-economic analysis, will slow the rate of growth. The budget papers reflect that, and the Treasury analysis reflected in the budget papers reflects and accepts that. But indirectly the situation is worse-and this is why I am concerned that the growth might be even less than that forecast in the budget papers. The ways in which government has a capacity, apart from its macroeconomic management role, to have a positive effect on economic growth immediately, and more particularly in the medium term, is through the education and training of its citizens, particularly of the work force; through assistance to research and development, and in Australia particularly private sector research and development because that is where we have fallen short over the years; through assistance in exports; and through expenditure on infrastructure. And this is a budget with bad news on all those fronts. The message on education is crystal clear: having the opportunity to access the best tertiary education that Australia can offerthat access which Australians had come to accept as being available for their children, wherever they were born, whatever their parents' status-will no longer be the case; we are moving towards a two-tier education system. But that has been pretty well clearly established by a number of speakers. We have had the problem compounded by the absurd decisions made with regard to research and development in this budget with the slashing of private sector research and development in this country-the very opposite of the objective we should be seeking. We find no positive aspects with regard to Australian infrastructure and a substantial cut in road funding-quite contrary in all those three instances to election' promises. But for a moment I wish to focus on the fourth area that I mentioned with regard to the role of government in stimulating growthparticularly in Australia, when one of the keys to sustained growth is the way in which we cope with our current account deficit-and that is this budget's cuts to assistance for exporters. I spent the last two years seeking to develop policy and represent Australian business overseas in improving our export performance. In January of this year, I had the honour of presenting a report which showed that, under existing policies, the improved export performance that Australia had achieved, particularly in manufactures and services, had created a situation where we could sustain a rate of growth one per cent higher than previously possible without triggering the current account constraint-and this traditionally had been one of the two constraints on Australia's capacity to sustain growth. The other was inflation, which is substantially under control as a result of the very good policies of the previous government-and I suspect it will stay under control in the short term with this government, but I am somewhat apprehensive a little further out. Every element where the Commonwealth government plays a substantial role in assisting Australian companies to export-whether export market development grants, the international trade enhancement scheme, the innovative agricultural marketing program, the role of Austrade; any of the functions of the role that the Commonwealth has played that have helped Australian companies compete more successfully internationally-has been cut. In public it has been focused most upon the so-called DIFF scheme where I had the opportunity to negotiate, on behalf of the Australian government and Australian companies, access and opportunities for Australian companies to win projects internationally and create jobs in Australia-to see those projects dashed. It is not that those projects will not go ahead in the countries in question; it is not that they will not go ahead with government financial assistance. It is that they will go ahead in other countries, with financial assistthan ance from other countries--our competitorsand with jobs being created in other countries. Australian companies which could have succeeded will not succeed, and projects which could have gone ahead will not go ahead. What we have is the government in the face of unemployment, as a gesture of despair, essentially taking its hands off the wheel and saying, 'We cannot solve this problem, it will continue at the existing level even on our best estimate.' A statement of despair, too, on the current account deficit-the budget papers say it will still be four per cent of GDP at the of this financial year. I suspect, unless the economy slows more than we think, the adverse effect on exports is such that it might be worse than that. However, if the economy, as I fear, grows more slowly, that will have an impact on imports and it will probably mean that four per cent of GDP will not tum out to be a bad estimate. Four per cent of GDP at this time in the economic cycle is not a crisis, but it is certainly not a claim for victory because for the 1995-96 financial year the figure was 4.2 per cent. So for all this pain, we will move from 4.2 per cent to a target that we might get down to four per cent of GDP by the end of the year-and we can only succeed in doing this if we slow the economy. We are approaching this in entirely the wrong way. For any modem economy like ours, the key to long-term solution of our current account deficit is to improve our exports-not in some old fashion sort of mercantilist way that says 'everything you do that increases exports is good, and everything you do that impedes imports is good'. That is 200 years out of date and is not a policy strategy that is acceptable to any contemporary government trying to compete successfully internationally. But we have to export, and this budget is going in entirely the wrong direction by attacking everything that will assist our exports. I come back to my original thesis: this is a budget that consciously, or by accident, is designed to stall the economy and to divide our society. Others will speak on this more I in. 20 minutes-I cannot speak on this at length because I want to make some other points-but I want to say that in this budget we have emerging all the elements of a twotier health system, all the elements of a twotier education system, and, with the changes to industrial relations which are promoted in the related workplace relations bill, all the elements for the creation of an Australian underclass, the sort we see in some of the countries that have been pursuing the sorts of policies this government is advocating. In talking about a divided society, I want to choose one symbol, and I refer to the aboliend tion of the dental scheme. We hear the rhetoric from those who support this budget: 'We had to make all these cuts to get the budget back into surplus.' The budget papers make clear that the budget could be back in surplus without abolishing the dental scheme. If the $100 million was continued each year in the forward estimates, if the pain, suffering, loss and unfairness that will be created by the abolition of the dental scheme had not been implemented, we would still have a budget surplus in the out years-the third and fourth years in this budget. It is not a prerequisite to achieving the government's target; it is a conscious, wilful decision made as a result of a deliberate policy choice. It is very hard to understand why this policy choice has been made but you need only the most basic level of arithmetic to know that any government setting reasonable priorities could have said, 'We can achieve our surplus without this unfair and unreasonable measure.' I would be very interested to hear-I have not yet heard one from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) or anyone else-any objective explanation for this program being abolished. The explanation that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) gave in his policy speech was that it should be abolished because it has succeeded; it has achieved its purpose, therefore we should abolish it. It is not a unique conservative argument-I have heard it before-but it is an unwelcome one. It symbolises something else I want to refer to when I talk about this loss of a sense of nation, a sense of our common wealth, of our common purpose. It seems to me that one of the reasons this decision has been made is that this is a government which has no faith in our capacity as Australians to act together to solve our common problems. It is a government which says that we must each pursue our destiny individually and that, as a consequence-a social version of the hidden hand of Adam Smith-we will find the most desirable social outcomes. It ignores the possibility that there might be a role for us as Australian citizens acting collectively to assist not only our aged Australians but also other Australians in need with, in this particular instance, their dental problems-but the situation can be extrapolated a hundredfold. The government has no faith in our capacity to act and it is undermining that sense of common purpose, of common wealth, of common destiny by its lack of capacity to show national leadership without central control and stricture. That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about funding programs that can assist Australians in need. You see in this budget no sense of a national approach to solving our common problems of unemployment, health, industry or exports-areas on which I have already spoken-but also in those areas that give us a fresh view of ourselves, those areas that define what we are and outline what we might aspire to be. I am talking about arts funding, the funding of the ABC, the production fund for new programs for television, and the support for the great Australian film industry. These are successful industries that create jobs, lift our international profile and give us all a sense of pride. Mr Hollis-They have no vision.",86
255,Mr MCMULLAN,COMMITTEE,"That is so, and no sense of the fact that by acting collectively we can assist creative Australians who want to say, 'This is what Australia might be.' I do not always agree with the picture of Australia that our artists, writers and musicians are painting and portraying, but I recognise that we are a better country because they have the capacity to be out there doing it. I think it is a great tragedy that we are losing that great sense of common purpose, that faith in our capacity to act collectively to meet national challenges. It is not a uniquely Australian failing. It is common with conservative governments around the western world, most spectacularly with the governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Australia between 1983 and 1996 was an exception. We were able to maintain that level of common commitment, that level of vision and that role for government without creating big and overweening governments. We were able to achieve that while still having a level of public sector outlays, a level of deficit and a level of public sector debt that were some of the lowest in the OECD. We were able to achieve all that without high taxes or big government and without seeking in some way to control the destiny of people. We were able to act together to liberate the destiny of people. That is reflected in the industrial relations policy with which I spend most of my time dealing in this House and publicly. There also is a sense that there is no role for the institutions of the state in ameliorating the adverse impact of the unfair balance of power in the labour market; no role for the state in providing a balance between flexibility and fairness. I am not arguing that there is no need for more flexibility. The move in that direction is necessary, as is the move to create an Australian economy that is more internationally competitive and successful. But we do not have to give up on the national ambition for a fairer society in the pursuit of a more flexible labour market. In that area I think we do not need to be so selfeffacing or so self-critical. While there continues to be room for change and improvement in our labour market, as Ross Gittins, the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald said recently-quite accurately but quite unconventionally for a senior economic commentator-no part of our economy has changed more or more dramatically than the labour market, on both the supply side and the demand side. Who is working has changed, where they are working has changed, what sort of work they are doing has changed, what qualifications and training they bring to their workplace have changed, for whom they are working has changed and the hours those in employment are performing have changed. It has changed at both endsmore people are working part time and those in full-time work are working longer hours. It raises a very profound question about the distribution of work in our society. While we have an unacceptably high level of unemployment-in fact, some preliminary evidence tends to suggest the actual number of hours being worked per head of adult population is increasing in our society-what is changing is the distribution of that work. Those in work are working longer, while many people are not in work and a significant number of people in part-time work would seek more. Not all people in part-time work prefer fulItime employment-that is a bit of a mythbut a lot of people do. Fair distribution of work will be one of the great issues all members of this House will have to face up to into the next century. It is one of the equity issues which we all have to address. I do not pretend that I have all the answers to it; I know it is a very important issue. To conclude, the tragedy of this budget is not just that it is not fair-although that is bad enough-but that, even after paying a huge social price, the economic strategy in this budget will just not work. It will not solve our current account deficit, it will not increase growth, it will not reduce inflation and, worse of all, it will not solve unemployment.",89
256,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEE,"Lyne) (9.55 p.m.}-It certainly is an honour to speak this evening on Appropriation Bill (No.1), which is a budget bill for the first conservative coalition budget for 13 or 14 years and certainly a historical document. It was interesting to listen to the previous speaker, the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), talk about the collective good of Australia as a nation. When you talk to people in the community about the direction the former government were taking the collective nation of Australia as far as the national debt was concerned, you find that is what really did concern a lot of people and ultimately cost the Labor government the last election. They had had 13 years to deal with the chronic unemployment problem, they had had 13 years to deal with debt, they had had 13 years to deal with the deficit and bad balance of payments figures and they failed. When we talk about the common good of the Commonwealth of Australia and the people who live here, particularly the children, the Australians of the future, what better system can we leave them than a debt-free nation rather than saddling them with the debt and the spending habits of our generation and previous generations. So it has been interesting to listen to members from the Labor Party speak on this debate. The point that must continually be made in this debate and in looking at the decisions that the coalition government has had to take is that the problem was not of our making. We did not create the budget deficit. The budget brought down in 1995 was supposed to produce a $700 million-odd surplus-I cannot remember the exact figure. That, of course, factored in asset sales, some of which have not materialised for one reason or just another-but that is a side issue. There was supposed to be a $700 million surplus. Not only did that not materialise; after the election it seemed as though the outcome would be more like an $8 billion deficit and then, . the time we got the accurate figure at the of the financial year, it was higher still. They are the sorts of rubbery figures we have had to deal with. That is building on government's overdraft, on the Commoncurrent wealth's overdraft, all the time. We are servicing that debt. The cost of servicing debt is around $10 billion a year. Ten billion dollars of taxpayers' money is paid est-dead money. That is the interest bill on the $96 billion worth of federal government debt built up by Labor. Mr Hollis-It is not federal government debt.",90
257,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEE,"It is. That is what we are trying to service. Gross foreign debt is $180 billion to $190 billion. I know some of that belongs to the private sector, but the governthere ment is responsible for $96 billion of it. was built up to a large extent over the last years of the previous administration. The problem was not of our making, but we are prepared to fix it. This government came to power on the basis that it was going to sort out the structural problems with our economy, and that is what it is going to do. That is what this budget is all about and that is the majority of commentators throughout the length and breadth of Australia have acknowin ledged-that at least this government, the Howard-Fischer government, has been honest with the people of Australia from day one all policy areas. There were no smokescreens and no mirrors in the election campaign. was all laid out very clearly. Admittedly, a lot of the policy objectives that we laid out we had to base on the figures that were available from the 1995-96 budget that the previous government brought down. Why? Because nobody was prepared to let anybody else have a look at the books prior to the election campaign. The former Prime Minister, the former Treasurer and the former finance minister said nobody was allowed look at the books and nobody talk to Treasury or Finance about what the real situation was in the lead-up to the March election this year. We came into government and found ourselves in this diabolical situation with a by massive budget deficit. We have been running end high balance of payment deficits for the last couple of years and high current account deficits. It was just unacceptable. The previthe ous speaker said that we had one of the best account figures in the OECD. There was only one country with a higher current that account deficit than us, and that was Mexico, all through the last 12 or 18 months. That was in interwhat we were confronted with. The people of Australia are not stupid. They might be conservative about change, but not about politics. They need to understand and be confident about the changes that are going to take place. It was accepted by the people of Australia that this government was going to sort out the budgetary problems and the financial problems that this country was in. They knew before the election in March that were going to have to be some tough That decisions made. But they recognised that 13 those decisions were fair, and that was the headline the day after budget day: 'A fair go'. Mr Hollis-Oh!",91
258,Mr V AIL,COMMITTEE,"It was; it was a fair go. And that newspaper is not sympathetic to the coalition in a lot of cases. But the budget was what recognised as being a fair go because the people in the majority of the different sectors our community recognised that we needed to address a lot of the endemic problems that we inherited from the former Labor adminison tration in the management of our economy. We have just heard the usual Labor Party It mantra about Keynesian policies: 'We have to spend, the public sector has to spend here, there and everywhere, otherwise you withdraw out of the economy and it will collapse.' But what happened was that it just dismantled any element of public saving with the spending programs. Surely the programs that the former administration ran for so many years during its term in office must have proved to it that the programs were unsuccessful, but to the government kept on ploughing more was allowed to money into them. It was money that we did not have to 2 spend; it was money on the national bankcard. That is why total federal government debt is about $96 billion; we were spending money we had to borrow. The former speaker, the member for Canberra, wants to bequeath a debt like that to future Australians. We do not. We want to bequeath to future Australians a healthy economy-an economy in which people can operate, in which business can thrive and in which people can get jobs and the like. This budget we are debating tonight is a clear indication of the plan and vision that the coalition government has for the future of Australia. The fundamental objective of the government's fiscal strategy is to improve the level of national saving by raising public saving. This will raise long-term growth and take pressure off interest rates over time, which will benefit families and small business. That is the section of mainstream Australia that every member in this House should be concerned about. That is what we are trying to achieve with this budget. But what do we say about the opposition? What is the Gareth alternative? We have our plan out in the public arena, but where is Labor's plan? We have not seen one yet, apart from some massive cuts to and the hacking away at the deficit reduction strategy that we want to put together. Last week the ALP announced that they would oppose $7 billion worth of budget measures over four years. But the truth is that the figure is much higher; it amounts to about $19 billion over four years if you include ATSIC, the ABC and labour market programs. If you add the ALP's opposition to the one-third sale of Telstra, you find that it amounts to a total of $27 billion over four years. They want to rack up another $30 billion in debt over the next four years. That is the Labor Party's plan. They took us down this path over the last 13 years until we got to the situation we are in now. Their plan, as the alternative government of Australia, is to take us further outanother $30 billion worth of debt. They want to play with the future of young Australians by building up debt. Future Australians and the children of today will be paying for that. The only policy that the Labor Party have at the moment is more deficit and more debt into the tum of the century. That is where they want to take Australia. This budget we are debating tonight, the coalition's first budget in 13-odd years, seeks to tum around the ALP's pathway to deficit and debt. We want to give young Australians something to look forward to-a better Australia freed from the chains of deficit and debt that Labor still endorses by its opposition to this budget. What goes hand in hand with that is high interest rates-the high interest rates that we have experienced for so long under the Labor regime in this country; the high interest rates that developed out of the recession we had to have when the former Prime Minister was the Treasurer. We had to have the recession! Many small businesses were sent packing, many farmers were sent off their farms and families were sent out of their homes because of the high interest rate regime that was run by the former administration. They are the sorts of things we want to tum around by reducing debt, eliminating the budget deficit, increasing national savings and putting this nation on a lot stronger economic footing where we will experience and enjoy a much more stable interest rate regime for the benefit of small business, for the benefit of farmers, for the benefit of families and, most importantly, for the benefit of the children of the future. In the lead-up and the hype to the announcement of the budget there was a lot of comment made by the shadow Treasurer and former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), with regard to what would be a good idea. He was saying that we should not try to knock this deficit out in two years in two budgets but that we should ease the pain a little bit and take it out over three years. What has happened? That is exactly what the Treasurer has released. The underlying budget deficit is estimated at $5.6 billion in 1996-97, $1.5 billion in 1997-98 and, bingo, in the third year out it is balanced--exactly what Gareth was talking about. Since the release of the budget, Gareth has come out with a completely different story, a story where you are going to add $30 billion worth of debt over four years to the debt we already have. I go back to the point I was making a while ago with regard to the situation we walked straight into after the election. Prior to the election the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the then opposition leader, challenged the then Prime Minister, the then Treasurer and the then Minister for Finance. He said, 'Give us the true and accurate state of Australia's economy.' Treasury and Finance could have easily done it. I will guarantee that the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer had it. I will guarantee that they had it just before election; but they were not prepared to release it. They were more interested in playing politics with those figures. They thought, 'If we lose the election, we'll have something to argue about with these blokes because we maintain they won't be able to introduce their entire platform from the election.' One of the key elements that absolutely struck a chord with the people across the length and breadth of Australia was the proposition of the charter of budget honesty. It has happened in other countries around the world, it has been spoken about in states in Australia and it is going to happen in the Commonwealth. Prior to forthcoming elections, there will be a statement of account as to where the Commonwealth's economy is up to. It will not be signed off on by the government or politicians of the day but signed off -:m by the heads of Treasury and Finance-the mdependent bureaucrats in charge of those departments. So the opposition of the day, whoever that m-y be in t-e future, can be assured that they ""':111 be. settmg the parameters for their cIes gomg into an election campaign based on accurate figures of where we are running in this country. We have never seen that before-and we certainly did not see it under the last 13 years of Labor. That is something that we pro-ised to deliver to the people of AustralIa III our election campaign in !'Aar-h-not only so all the so-called experts m thIS place and all the economists out there in the private sector can understand it but so all the people in mainstream Australia, the average punter out there who is trying to work out whom he is going to vote for, who over the years has been cajoled by the promises that governments will throw a few dollars here and throw a few dollars there, can compare how this government has performed with the previous one and compare the track record of this government with the previous one. That will be in place so that all those people in mainstream Australia, in middle Australia, who really want to understand how their parliament and the government of their country is performing, what is happening to the the economy of their country, will be able to. They will not have to put up with all the nonsense they have had to put up with in the past and be mushroomed with the economic information and jargon that comes out. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the promise to implement that struck a chord with Australians because they want to see some honesty and integrity in this place. That is why they voted a coalition government into power on 2 March. They knew that we would have the backbone to address the economic failings that had been perpetrated by Labor for 13 years on' this country, that we would address those structural problems that the previous administration was not prepared to or going to address. In a lot of cases, the previous administration knew where the problems were, they knew what they had to do, but either they did not have the backbone to do it or they were not allowed to do it by their industrial wing. The previous speaker, the member for Canberra, as I said, spent 20 minutes speaking about some of the old antiquated Labor polimant.ra from the past and how the economy of thIS country should be run. I just point out to him that a senior member of his party who was in charge of this country for 13 years got it t? where it is today. They had the opportumty to try all their policies, try all the stuff he was talking about tonight and failed. I have already pointed out one of the most descriptive headlines that appeared in the Daily Telegraph the day after the budget was also brought down. What did some of the peak bodies around the place have to say? These are not just peak bodies that the coalition quotes but peak bodies that the Labor Party have quoted from many times. In the last three years that I spent in opposition in this place, I heard the Labor Party quote from a lot of these bodies. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: The Federal Government has delivered on its promise to eliminate the deficit and put the Australon Ian economy onto a solid foundation for sustainable non-inflationary growth. The National Farmers Federation said: ... tonight's Budget is likely to boost business confidence, support lower interest rates and provide the foundations for ongoing inflationary growth. The Housing Industry Association said: The first Coalition Government Budget shares the pain to make gains on national savings and interest rates. The Real Estate Institute of Australia said: ... tonight's Federal Budget has returned long overdue control to Government spending. By cutting its deficit and refocusing its spending is now greater chance of sustainably lower real interest rates. Lower interest rates will benefit business investment, employment and borrowers. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants said: The first Howard Budget will do much to responsibly repair Australia's sick economy ... The Minerals Council of Australia said: By focusing on economic fundamentals the first Howard Budget has, in the opinion of the Minerals Council of Australia, established a secure basis for Australia's future economic success. The State Chamber of Commerce in New South Wales said: The Howard Government has come good on its promise to support the small and medium sized business sector. Business will largely welcome the Federal Budget and applaud the implementation of long overdue cuts to government spending. I might just go on to a few that might interest opposition members. The Council on the Ageing, when talking about residential care financial contributions, said: This money will benefit those nursing homes which have upgraded their buildings and meet quality standards. The Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission said: Measures which the Government should be congratulated on are the introduction of a national strategy to prevent the incidence of child abuse; greater funding for marriage and relationship education; greater recognition of the role of those who care for the frail aged and the disabled; and initiatives to improve rural health services. That is exactly what the Prime Minister was talking about in question time today-a focus preventative activity in the breakdown in marriage in Australia and not trying to deal with it after the event. The RSL said: The first Howard Budget largely honoured the Government's commitment to Australian war veterans and their families. The government has recognised the special needs of the veterans ... So this budget has been roundly received across the length and breadth of Australia. It has been extremely well received. A lot of those peak bodies were here earlier this week to give it a vote of confidence. As was pointed out in this place earlier this week, they did there not have to break down the front doors of this place to get in here and give us their message; they walked in and delivered it in a sensible way. I go back to where I started at the opening of my address. The problem we inherited was not of our making. It took Labor 13 years to create the problem, but we have the backbone to fix it. We made the constructive decision right from the start to fix it. We told the people of Australia on 2 March that we would fix it and we are going to keep on that line from here until we square this away and we end up in surplus. (Time expired)",91
259,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE,"In speaking on Appropriation Bill (No.1) I indicate that I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). This budget was conceived in malice and delivered in spite. It is a spiteful, deceitful document and just how spiteful and deceitful will be apparent as the Australian public realise the ideological savageness beneath the glib presentation of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on budget night. The figures are now becoming available and the Australian people are slowly starting to realise that they have been slugged where it hurts most-in the hip pocket. I must say that during the election campaign in my own area, the Illawarra, I put it to many people to look beyond the promises the conservatives were making and look at their track record. As usual, the people of the Illawarra saw the glibness of the conservative bribes and returned both me and my colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) to this parliament. The same cannot be said, unfortunately, for many other areas of Australia. This budget of betrayal has the fingerprints of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) all over it. This is his budget from beginning to end. It is a budget where the Prime Minister failed his first test and proved that his word is not worth the breath in which it is said. So much for honesty and integrity. This is a budget of reversal and a litany of broken promises from a political leader who unmistakably pledged like no-one else to raise and restore the people's faith and confidence in the public policy process and this parliament. I have found it interesting to hear government members, especially new government members, come into this chamber and try to defend the indefensible. It will be very interesting to see what they say as the bites start to take effect and their constituents start to put the pressure on them. We will see what they are saying then-it is more likely to be said in the party room. I must say that I am singularly disappointed that the Illawarra Mercury did not reproduce the front page lead it had after the 1980 budget. It gained national prominence when it declared in thick bold print 'Lies, lies, It is true that this budget was cleverly packaged. Much of the really nasty element was leaked to the public in the weeks leading up to its presentation. In a couple of instances, individual members presented budget statements detailing the dramatic cuts contained in their portfolio. This happened particularly in education and Aboriginal affairs. While the budget did receive some initial positive commentary in the media and the business community, it is beginning to unravel as the detail begins to be subjected to close examination right across the community. The buzz word in politics today is mainstream. I can recall that last year it was the battlers. Each year there is a different spin on what Australians supposedly are. For a political leader who made so much of wanting to make Australians relaxed and comfortable, the continued use of the term mainstream makes a complete mockery of the desire to be all inclusive, to see Australians as a broad church and to govern for all of us. This was one of the Prime Minister's promises-and it is yet another broken pledge. The budget measure takes the stick to all Australians. It hits out at pensioners, students, the unemployed, migrants, families, workers, business, the sick, the disabled, our youth and indigenous Australians. It is a long list of Australians-this affects every community. If these people are not mainstream Australians, what are they? The Howard government came to office through slick campaigning. It made itself the smallest possible target. It parroted the line that Medicare, child care, reconciliation, the environment, education, industry, regions, workers and families would all be protected. Labor, in its years in government, can be justifiably proud of its record in establishing and beefing up the social safety net and providing increased priority to social justice issues. The budget damages all those areas, in some cases irreparably. With this in mind, the opposition has established a number of tests which the budget measures will be subjected to. We will examine where each measure betrays a promise. We will look at where each measure damages equity and we will lies'. look at where each measure damages national savings. The vast majority of the budget measures fail these tests easily. But they are locked up in the appropriation bills. The opposition has no intention of revisiting 1975. As a result, the majority of these budget measures will pass through the parliament but they will be subject to heavy criticism in this place, the Senate and our electorates. The people of Australia will not be able to forget the Prime Minister's promises and his ultimate betrayal. Just as Labor has done since 1983 we presented to the Australian people at the last election a vision of where we wanted Australia to be in the last crucial decade of this century. Just as at every eJection since 1983 our plan was presented honestly, credibly and with responsibility. The current Prime Minister did not present to the electorate these policies contained in this budget. Not once did he say to the people that he was going to chop away savagely at $8 billion in Commonwealth expenditure. Labor's alternative to this budget was to continue growing the economy at an average of four per cent; to keep inflation low, averaging 2.5 per cent; and to keep creating jobs at the rate of 700,000, keeping the country on target to achieve an unemployment rate of five per cent by the end of the decade. Our vision also encompassed continuing to build Australia's social justice base. After 13 years of continuous government, this talk about not presenting an alternative vision is laughable and disingenuous. Labor has the runs on the board in all the policy areas that the Howard government has abandoned in this budget. At the last election it gave us very large ticks. The focus of deficit and debit in this budget is a smokescreen for the government's attempts to imitate Thatcher's Britain and Gingrich's United States. Australia has the lowest government expenditure in the industrialised world. It has the fourth lowest government debt and equal third lowest budget deficit. This is in the context of the budget. There was no need for ripping $8 billion away from expenditure. Australia does not face an economic crisis. There must come a time when this country's economic advisers in Treasury and in the corridors of this place must accept that Australia cannot continue on the road of doing more with less. The counting paperclip mentality that grips this country needs to be shelved. There is no need to try to imitate Thatcher or Gingrich. Perhaps one could understand and accept all of this pain if Australia's national priority of reducing the unacceptable level of unemployment were to be reduced. But the budget papers make clear that unemployment is set to stay above eight per cent for some considerable time. It also makes clear that the budget measures will have the effect of soaking economic growth. In simple terms, all of this pain and devastation will result in nothing. It will, it is claimed, put the budget into surplus. But, again, the budget papers make clear that if growth were to continue at the levels Labor left it-averaging four per cent per year-the deficit would right itself over the life of this parliament. Economic growth is set to remain at 3.5 per cent through the remainder of the decade. What a dismal public policy outcome. This is the budget we did not have to have. It is not the budget which Australia needs. The impact of this budget on regions such as the one I represent is dismal. The IIIawarra faces slashing of higher education funding. Students face a hefty increase in the higher education contribution scheme and it will be required to be repaid much faster. University places at the University of Wollongong will be lost. Faculties will have to close. Capital works will not commence. The sum of $150 miIlion will be wiped from the IlIawarra with one stroke of the pen. Interestingly, in the government's Rebuilding Regional Australia document education is not even mentioned. The front page of last week's Wollongong Advertiser under the heading 'Funding cuts may force Uni to lose courses, staff' , it states that Wollongong University will lose courses and staff as a result of federal government cuts to education funding. It quotes the university vice-chancellor, Professor Gerard Sutton, as saying that the university was not happy about having to reduce the number of courses and he believed the federal government was not approaching the education issue correctly. In damning criticism, the professor goes on to say: What is happening is pretty short-sighted on the part of the federal government. If we were to run the university as a business, then I would only retain two of the nine faculties, which is crazy. It would mean that Australia would have no social fabric and it would have no technological base from which to launch its economic recovery. The IIIawarra needs labour market programs but this government destroys them. Over the last few weeks I have attended graduation ceremonies of LEAP and new work opportunities participants. I have talked to participants and they do not see a future for themselves. All of them praised the programs they were involved in. However, in the budget, jobskills, LEAP, new work opportunities, jobtrain, special intervention program, accredited youth training, skillshare, job clubs, the mobility assistance scheme and TAP all disappear. There is no commitment to the unemployed, particularly in places like the Illawarra, by this government. I have been approached by both Shellharbour City Council and Wollongong City Council. They are concerned about the implication of cuts to labour market programs. They stand to lose a large amount of financial and resource capacity. Both councils have taken advantage of brokering these programs and enjoyed the benefits to local infrastructure and the environment. Both councils are rightly concerned at the abolition of the operational subsidies to long day care centres. These subsidies enable those community based centres to function, catering for children such as the very young, babies and those with disabilities for whom it is more expensive to care. Growth funding to these centres is also being slashed. The choice for both councils is predictable: close these services, increase child-care costs or increase rates and charges. What a commitment to families! The better cities program gets the chopstopping the promotion of urban and regional infrastructure renewal. Local government loses out again. So too with the abolition of the regional development program. Councils will be asked to pick up the tab to make up for lost resources. Many initiatives currently under way will be scrapped. What a commitment to the regions! The MCKinsley report, Supporting regional leadership: unfinished business, kicks at the spin of the government, stating: After only 18 months in operation, the regional development program has made a significant start in rejuvenating leadership in Australia's regions. The report goes on to say: The impact of the regional development program on the regions is significant and, through them, national economic growth. Regional Australia, like the Illawarra, has been abandoned by this budget. There are substantial cuts to road funding, massive attacks on regional welfare and services, the closure of 26 CES offices, 14 tax offices, the ABC cuts, industry program cuts and job losses. The Illawarra has a high proportion of migrant residents. It is one of the most multicultural centres in Australia. Over the next four years, this migrant friendly government, as it pretended during the election, will reap over $1 billion in new charges and cuts to services. It will slug users of English language programs by increasing the fees from $2,205 to $5,500. It is a tax on ensuring that new settlers learn our common language. Visa fees are increased by 200 per cent. The fee to become an Australian citizen is increased. Family reunion funding, which the government promised to protect, is cut and tightened. The Senate will be the battleground for this unfair, unnecessary budget. I see that the government is already preparing the ground to ensure the support of Senator Harradine. It has cut $3.5 million in the foreign aid budget for family planning. It has slashed funding by $2 million to the United Nations Population Fund. It has dropped $525,000 to the Population Council and $125,000 to the International Union of the Scientific Study of Population. The International Planned Parenthood Federation has had its grant cut by $1.5 million. It is revealed that, earlier this year, in the consideration of the budget, Senator Harradine met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) urging this raft of slashings. Obviously, with the senator's support in mind, the minister, who really does know better, agreed to his requests and the results are for all to see. Australia, in late September, is hosting a meeting of the United Nations group, Asian Parliamentarians for Population and Development, of which I have been a member of the executive for many years. I must say that I am very embarrassed, seeing that we are having this international conference here on population, by the measures on population announced in the budget. The decision is an embarrassment to Australia. It reverses Australia's previously solid commitments to population aid just to gain the support of one senator. The World Health Organisation, renowned for its programs, faces the withdrawal of $725,000. I have previously been critical of Senator Harradine's forays into this area. I am sick of fundamentalist perverse morality being imposed upon essential programs in the population area. However, I suppose there are few votes in overseas aid. Yet it is often in Australia's interests to give aid. I note in today's press that the foreign minister will be lobbying for Australia to gain a seat on the UN Security Council. I wish him well, but how does he expect that the cuts that have been imposed on very important programs which support poverty reduction will be received? Debate interrupted. NA",94
260,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Post Offices Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (10.30 p.m.}-If I was to stand in this place and simply read the following list, I am very confident that members on both sides of the House would know what I was alluding to: cuts to funding for regional universities; the revocation of drought assistance; the slashing of national highway funding, some $622 million over four years; the abolition of the farm household support scheme; the sale of Telstra and the abolition of the cross-subsidies that will inevitably accompany the sale; the $2 million cut to the rural communities access program; the $1 million cut to the rural telecommunications upgrade program; the $6 million cut to the Energy Research and Development Corporation; the $1 million cut to the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation; the $5 million cut to the rural research development program; the $16 million cut to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy; the $7.4 million cut to ABARE; cuts to the national landcare program; cuts to the funding of the ABC; the $150 cut to regional development and the abolition of the division of regional development; the closure of Family Court registries; cuts to labour market programs; cuts to childcare centre operational subsidies; cuts to the dental health program; cuts to the export market development grants program; cuts to the funding of the CSIRO; the importation of cooked chicken meat; and the closure of Medicare and CES offices. I would, of course, be alluding to this government's blatant betrayal of rural and regional Australia. What is their response to this charge? They tell us they have retained the diesel fuel rebate. They have retained an entitlement already enjoyed by rural Australia for many years. It is a bit like the thief demanding your thanks for not stealing your car. But as if all these attacks are not enough, as if this is not already evidence that this government has abandoned rural and regional Australia, there is now talk of what may be the most devastating attack of all: the opening up to competition of the standard letter delivery service. Any such move will have a devastating impact, particularly on rural and regional communities, in two ways: first, it will mean the demise of Australia Post's obligation to provide all Australians with a universal letter service at a uniform charge; and, secondly, it will lead to the closure of up to 1,300 post offices across Australia. In most rural towns the local post office forms the hub of the CBD. When the banks deserted rural Australia, Australia Post moved into fill the void and provided, and continues to provide, basic banking services for those rural communities. In 1994-95, Australia Post returned to the government some $120 million in dividend payments. It delivered 93.6 per cent of all standard letters lodged with it on time and 98.8 per cent of letters either on time or within one additional day. It has achieved labour productivity improvements of greater than six per cent-record levels-and it has maintained the 45 cent rate for a standard letter service for the past five years. Many townships in rural Australia are experiencing dynamic decline, but it is about to get worse. This decision, if adopted by the government, wi11 be devastating for rural and regional Australia. Towns like Weston, Abermain, Singleton, Muswel1brook, Scone and Quirindi in my electorate will struggle to survive if post offices in those townships close. I implore the government not to take this approach. I put it on notice that I wi11 be taking every opportunity available to me to oppose any such measure.",98
261,Mrs BAILEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in this debate to add my voice to those in my electorate who raise serious concerns about the risk of disease to salmon and trout if uncooked, wild, adult salmon products are imported into Australia from the USA or Canada. The area I represent, which includes some of the largest aquaculture enterprises and some of the most popular recreational fishing areas-al1 situated near populated towns and including Lake Eildon; rivers like the Goulburn, Acheron, Rubicon, Murrindindi and Howqua; and Snobs Creek-produces 60 per cent of Australia's rainbow trout and large quantities of brown trout and of Atlantic and Pacific salmon. Aquaculture is a growth industry in this region and provides valuable local employment and is building up an export market for fresh and smoked fish into the highly competitive and consumer demanding markets of Asia. This region also supports a large and growing recreational fishing industry, adding important dollars to the local economy. All of this investment and growth of these industries could be at risk if diseased salmon products are al10wed to be imported. As wel1 as this risk, the importation of diseased salmon products threatens our Australian reputation and image as a clean green country that produces products from an unpol1uted and disease-free environment-the envy of other countries. As a country intent on increasing our trade into the Asia-Pacific rim, we have two clear advantages that other countries lack: our proximity to the region and our reputation as a food producer from a clean, disease-free environment. It makes no sense whatsoever to lose that advantage in marketing our products. But the very real possibility exists that we could tarnish our reputation and lose that advantage if we allow the importation of uncooked wild adult salmon from North America into our country. There are 20 diseases present in the salmon population of North America that are not present in either our salmon or trout stocks. The real dangers that this presents to regions Salmon in my electorate have, I believe, been ignored in the import risk analysis reported to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in May of this year. Referring to just one of the 20 diseases known to be present in North American salmon-namely, bacterial kidney disease, BKD-the import risk analysis stated on page 32: If established in open aquiculture systems, infected fish may be treated with antibodies, however due to the intracellular location of the bacterium, this is often not effective. Vaccines are not available. The report goes on to say that 'control of BKD has to date best been achieved by avoidance'. The best way to achieve avoidance is by maintaining the existing quarantine rules. While much attention has been focused on the BKD disease there is another disease that is causing even more concern, and I refer to whirling disease. This disease attacks the soft skeleton of young fish before their bones harden, usually resulting in a deformed spine which causes the diseased fish to constantly swim in a whirling fashion-hence the name of the disease. It also affects the nervous system of the fish. When the diseased fish die, the organism which causes the disease, myxosoma cerebral us, sends out spores through the water to take up residence in tubifex worms that live in the mud. When the organism matures, it leaves the worm in search of a new host-a young fish. This organism is capable of existing in river sediment for long periods of time. It has now been established in the United States that whirling disease has almost wiped out young rainbow trout in the large rivers of Colorado. US authorities take this disease so seriously that they are publishing areas that have been affected and are drawing up extensi ve measures to combat the spread of the disease, including the guideline not to transport live fish. There are scientific, industry and environmental groups throughout North America trying to deal with both the short-term and long-term problems of this disease. We do not have this disease in our fish stock. Our growing aquaculture and recreational fishing industries cannot afford the risk of this disease. (Time expired) Mobile Phone Base Stations",99
262,Mr KERR,ADJOURNMENT,"I raise before the House some concerns of the Lenah Valley School Association. They are concerned about the siting of a Telstra mobile phone base station adjacent to the school. It has been built only some 76 metres from the school boundary. The school association has been sufficiently concerned to generate an enormous degree of public reaction. There has been a petition of more than 1,000 signatures forwarded to the House of Assembly, the lower house of the Tasmanian parliament, and a petition of 894 names has been presented in the Senate drawing the government's attention to those concerns. Their concerns are in a number of areas. There is a request that we investigate further the effects of long-term exposure to low levels of electromagnetic radiation, that we review current safety standards to make sure that they are relevant to mobile phone technology, that we look at more restrictive regulations on the placement of mobile phone base stations, and that we deal with the current carriers' exemption from state planning legislation at least as far as it concerns the erection of these mobile phone base stations. The practical arrangements that exist at the moment to siting mean that there is no necessary consultation of local communities. There is an obligation to have some consultation between the carrier and the relevant local council. But in the case of the Lenah Valley facility, the local community did not have an inkling that a base station would be erected in their area, let alone beside the school where many of their children are being educated. Under a proposed new code which has been developed there is a proposal that there be wider consultations, but again no necessity for consultation with local communities. There are a number of reports that are circulating, including one in the Age of 14 January of this year citing a study conducted by a Melbourne medical consultant who found that children living in the shadow of television broadcast towers are at greater risk of developing leukaemia. Those transmission emissions are much lower than Australian safety standards. The research by Dr Bruce Hocking, a former Telstra chief medical officer, suggested that the radiation effects of mobile phone base stations need to be further reviewed. I know that his work does not stand alone. There is a growing level of community awareness of these concerns. Of course it is possible to dismiss these concerns by referring to the 'not in my backyard' syndrome, but there should be a precautionary principle, particularly when the possible impacts are in relation to the young. Sitings close to schools do raise legitimate concerns. I have written to the relevant minister, Senator Richard Alston, on this matter. I am waiting on a reply to a number of concerns that I have raised with him on behalf of the Lenah Valley Progress Association. I anticipate and hope that these concerns will be fully and properly addressed. I believe that Senator Alston should be working to ensure that, under the new code, the Australian community's democratic right exists to stop the positioning of towers in high risk locations and that standards properly address the issue of long-term low-level exposure. I conclude my remarks by saying that, despite the existence of the telecommunications national code, which governs these installations, there are still significant areas of legitimate debate and concern. There needs to be more public research. We need to have assurances that there is not going to be a proliferation of additional transmitters on existing towers. We need to look at siting, particularly when it collocates with school premises. I ask all members of this House who may be facing similar circumstances to also raise their concerns with the minister. M2 Motorway",100
263,Mr ROSS CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"It is my belief that under the cloak of parliamentary privilege one ought, only with the greatest reluctance, ever reflect on the integrity of a current or former member of this place. Certainly, I have not done so in the course of my short time here. I rise tonight to do precisely that, because of a matterMrKerr- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order.",101
264,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Denison might give me some credit for listening out for what is going said. The member has said nothing as yet.,101
265,Mr KERR,ADJOURNMENT,He has said that he is intending to raise,101
266,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,He has indicated an intention of a present or former member.,101
267,Mr KERR,ADJOURNMENT,"I have never heard a member so foolish as to so flag his intentions. Given that he has, I alert you to the obvious",101
268,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Thank you for alerting me; I do not really need it. The honourable member for Parramatta will be most cautious in the way in which he speaks tonight.,101
269,Mr ROSS CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"Absolutely. In fact, that was the purpose of my preliminary remarks-to highlight the degree of caution with which I approach this subject. It relates to a matter of considerable importance to the hundreds of residents of Winston Hills in my electorate who are subject to an enormous change in their quality of life because of the building of the M2 motorway in the northern section of my electorate, which is forcing a huge amount of traffic through the small subarterial, quiet streets of what had previously been a village type suburb. So it was that the only solution to their problem was the building of ramps onto the M2 motorway, at a cost of some $8 million. So it was that the residents, in the lead-up to the last election, looked to both candidates with considerable anticipation to see whether or not they would be able to deliver on the ramps which became a huge hope, an aspiration, of that whole community. On 26 February, with six days to go before the election, my opponent at that timewhose name just escapes me-sent a letter to some hundreds of constituents in Winston Hills. I would like to quote from a letter to Mr Barry Morgan: I am very pleased to advise the discussion between federal and state governments has lead to an agreement on a dollar for dollar funding for the western facing ramps from Windsor Road to the M2. The federal minister, Mr Brereton, has already transferred $8.7 million in federal road funding on condition that the new ramps are built. to be This generated so much enthusiasm and excitement in the electoral that, on 28 February. some 500 residents attended a meeting of the Winston Hills action group at Matthew Pearce Public School, at which both my opponent and I were required to speak. I would like to quote from the minutes of the meeting sent to me by the Winston Hills action group. The then member for Parramatta stood up and said to the meeting: I set upon a course after that meeting to try and see how we could actually get these ramps brought back into the equation far earlier than had been suggested. I took the matter up with both the federal roads minister, Laurie Brereton, and the state roads minister, Michael Knight, and prior to the federal parliament going into caretaker arrangements, prior to a date at the beginning of February when no decisions could then be taken by the government, I got Laurie Brereton to agree to transfer an amount of $8.7 million to the New South Wales government on the understanding that a series of projects would be carried out to deal with the problem areas of Pennant Hills Road and the problems in Winston Hills. One of the conditions that will be attached to the transfer of that money, which has now already gone to the New South Wales government, was that we wanted the ramps-the western facing ramps at Windsor Road on the M2-reinstated. That action has been taken. I followed the member to the podium and raised with him my doubts at the prospects of the government making such a transfer in the period leading up to the election. I questioned this whole issue of whether a caretaker government could make that kind of commitment. He responded by saying: This is not a case of where money for a project is dependent on what will happen after the election. I make that point at the outset. I don't tell stories because you don't get too far doing that. The money was actually transferred. I rise to inform the House today that, after repeated requests to both the state Minister for Roads and the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), I received notification today in a letter in which the federal minister states: The former government had announced but not committed funding of $480 million for the section of the western Sydney orbital and the links to the Badgerys airport site. There was no commitment to funding the western Sydney orbital north of the M4 or any additional work on the M2. The Department of Transport and Regional Development(Time expired) Budget 1996-97",101
270,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to encourage those opposite to read the fine print of the budget that they are so adulatory of. In the fine print of the budget, you will find that the Liberal Party in this place gives with one hand and whacks families with the other. Let us look at some of the fine print. Education costs are up; HECS is increased; Austudy is cut; university, schools and TAFE funding is cut; and assistance for students with disabilities is slashed altogether. Such was the reception of that portion of the budget in Western Australia that the West Australian referred on its front page to the changes to university funding favouring only the rich. Education is not enough for this mob; there are also extra health cost cuts and health funding cuts. There is an $800 million cut to hospital funding. That will mean longer hospital waiting lists in the states. The AMA said of the federal budget: The federal budget will hit the sick, forcing patients to pay more for operations and pharmaceuticals. If it is not enough to whack the elderly with health costs, you whack them up-front with aged care costs. Older family members who need nursing homes will have to pay up-front entry fees of around $26,000. Then you will get them day by day with new daily fees of up to $34 a day. And if it is not enough to do that, you will make them pay hourly ratesuser pays-for things like meals on wheels. On our calculations it will be up to $4 an hour. This is a sensationally compassionate lot opposite. If it is not enough to get families on health, to get them on aged care costs, you whack them with prescription costs. We find that listed prescription drugs will go up from $17.40 to $20. Pensioners who are currently paying $2.70 will find that the price will go up to $3.20. The Pharmacy Guild's report on the budget states that 'pensioners may face financial difficulty.' Of course they will. If it is not enough to whack the people going to schools, TAFE or universities, if it is not enough to whack families whose children are sick and need prescriptions, if it is not enough to whack elderly people who may need to go to hospital or nursing homes, then you get young children, with child-care costs. With the reduction of community based childcare operating fees, families can expect to pay anywhere from $14 to $30 extra per week per child. Child-care funding is cut by about $500 million, shifting the cost burden to families.",102
271,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,Government members interjecting,102
272,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to at last see some signs of life over there. I thought for a moment that we could not get any of them to breathe in an iron lung. I am pleased to see some reaction. I encourage you to read the fine print of the budget which you stand up day after day and laud. When the community sees and understands the fine print, the chickens will come home to roost Any decent, respectable government would not place this burden on families. If that is not enough, what do we then find will happen to the most important thing you can give a family, namely, a secure job with secure wages and conditions? The budget projection for growth is 3.5 per cent. That means no jobs. At the same time you are slashing nearly $2 billion from labour market programs to assist those most in need-in particular, the long-term unemployed. At the precise time when this country needs to continue to tum itself into a modem, manufacturing trading country, the budget forecasts indicate that the net export contribution to growth in GDP for 1996-97 will be negative three quarters, down from plus one per cent under the previous government's policies. You are slashing all the export enhancement programs. It is not enough to whack families on the basic essentials and services. You are now proposing no jobs, no growth and any chance we had of enhancing our export. capacity, which would mean growth and jobs, is being whacked through the slashing of export enhancement schemes. If, as some people do, you happen to have trouble with your teeth or your ears, you are also whacking away the Commonwealth dental health scheme and you are whacking away the hearing services. I will not reflect on any member of this chamber by drawing attention to those members of this House who have difficulty hearing. In my own state of Western Australia, this budget will cut over $100 million from Western Australia. How will the state government find that money? In one of three ways: they will cut services, they will cut jobs, or they will impose extra taxes and charges. What has Richard Court had to say about this issue? The silence has been deafening. At least his old man had a bit of ticker. He would always stand up for Western Australia rather than simply mantra chant 'Western Australia'. It is about time we saw the Premier of Western Australia stand up for Western Australia and stand up for families who come from Western Australia. Mrs Johnston-He is doing all right.",102
273,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to see the member for Canning has a bit of life. I am pleased to see you are out there arguing that people should pay more for their teeth, for their health care and for their prescriptions. I am pleased to see you nodding agreeably. Yes, you are in favour of no jobs for people and more costs for families. (Time expired) Small Business",103
274,Mrs JOHNSTON,ADJOURNMENT,"The coalition recognises that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. We also recognise that it is small business that employs the majority of Australians. Following the budget announcement of incentives to help Australia's small businesses, I sent a survey out to all the small and medium sized businesses in my electorate of Canning. The response to date has been phenomenal. In the survey I asked small businesses: If you could fix any problem to help your business or create jobs what would it be? Mr Acting Speaker, the response from these small business owners was always the same. They have said to me, 'Fix Labor's unfair dismissal laws.' 'Reduce the level of taxation on small business.' 'Reduce the amount of paperwork we have to complete.' 'Reform the industrial relations system.' And, 'Let's have a look at the level of commercial interest rates.' The response I have had from these small business owners shows that the coalition government is on the right track. Our budget and other policy announcements address all of these issues. The government has already met its commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to six per cent. This means that small business is no longer assessed for the provisional tax on income in excess of what it has earned. This is a major benefit to small business and how it operates. This alone will deliver $180 million back to provisional taxpayers in 1996-97. The capital gains tax rollover relief that was announced in the budget will allow small businesses to rollover their business assets without capital gains tax disincenti ves. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) mentioned in his budget speech, many small businesses plough all of their hard-earned savings into their business which is both their livelihood and a plan for their retirement. The coalition government has recognised this and allowed individuals to claim an exemption from the capital gains tax up to a minimum capital gain of $500,000 on the sale of a small business where the proceeds are used for retirement. This government's industrial relations reforms currently before the parliament will rectify Labor's job-destroying unfair dismissal laws. The sooner the people in the upper house recognise the necessity to pass this legislation the sooner small businesses can get on with the business of employing people and creating real jobs. This coalition government has done more for Australia's small businesses in the mere six months it has been in office than the Australian Labor Party did in its 13 years in government. Being a small business operator myself, I know precisely what I am talking about. We are a government that respects small business. We are a government that knows just how hard small business operators have to work. We are a government that wants small business to succeed because we knowunlike those opposite-that it is small business that keeps this country going. We know that it is small business that employs the majority of Australians. We know that it is small business that takes on the majority of young people either under an apprenticeship scheme or some other form of training program. This government is committed to encouraging the small business sector and to ensuring that it gets on and creates a livelihood for all Australians. M2 Motorway",103
275,Mr ROSS CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"I conclude the remarks I was making earlier. Here we have a member saying that the money was actually transferred. Indeed, ' Mr Brereton phoned me on the afternoon the parliament was dissolved to say that he had signed the papers and the money had been transferred to New South Wales.' 'The transfer to New South Wales has been made. That is signed and gone.' This is the worse example of pre-election fraudulence. It is the worse example fully calling upon a community to believe a promise on the part of the government when not lightly given. When specifically challenged about. the government's capacity to deliver he said, 'Laurie called me this afternoon. The money has already gone.' The RTA know nothing about it. They say they have never heard about it. We are still awaiting a formal response from Michael Knight the New South Wales minister, but I can guarantee what that response will be. This is the quality of the integrity of the former government. This is their attitude to the electors of New South Wales!",104

Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Australian Bureau of Statistics compiles statistics of reported crime for selected offence categories in each State and Territory. Data for the calendar year 1994 is the most recent published. I am advised that some additional offence categories have been included in National Crime Statistics for 1995 and that this data was released on 19 July 1996. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has provided the following information to my department: Victims of crime by offence category, Victoria, 1994 Murder-56; Attempted murder-56; Manslaughter-5; Driving causing death-15; Sexual assault-3,388; Kidnapping/abduction-99; Armed robbery-788; Unarmed robbery-849; Blackmail/extortion-85; Unlawful entry with intent-72,260; Motor vehicle theft-27,701.

Shadow Parliamentary Secretaries: Allowances (Question No. 113) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 6 May 1996: (1) What were the individual travelling allowance and hire car expenses of shadow parliamentary secretaries and their staff between 1 July 1994 and 30 July 1995, including statistics on numbers of days claimed separately for Canberra, capital cities and other locations. (2) Under what provision of the Remuneration Tribunal were the claims referred to in part (l) paid. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Travelling allowance payments to shadow parliamentary secretaries are made by the Parliamentary Departments. I therefore am unable to provide that information. Details of the other amounts are provided below. None of the shadow parliamentary secretaries were provided with extra staffing resources and the figures provided relate to travel by their electorate staff. The car costs for the shadow Parliamentary Secretaries represent total usage for the period concerned.

(2) Who were the representatives in each case. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows: At its thirty seventh session, by its Resolution 37/30 of 23 November 1982, the United Nations General Assembly requested the United Nations Secretary-General (UNSG) to initiate consultations with all parties directly concerned with the question of East Timor with a view to exploring avenues for achieving a comprehensive settlement of the problem and to report to the Assembly at its thirty-eighth session. Although the question of East Timor is included annually in the General Assembly's provisional agenda, the matter is now customarily rolled over.

Medicare Services: Electoral Division of (Question No. 174) Mr Broadbent asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 9 May 1996: Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 7 May 1996: (1) How many deaths in custody have occurred in each (a) year and (b) State and Territory since 9 May 1991, when the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was presented to Parliament. (2) mlW many and which of the Royal Commission's recommendations have been adopted by (a) the federal Government and (b) each State and Territory Government and on what dates.",104
277,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NSW VIC,"-The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided me with the following information in response to the honourable member's question: (1) There have been 77 deaths of Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders since the Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths was tabled in Federal Parliament on 9 May 1991.

278,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NSW VIC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) In 1994-95, 1,031,975 services were provided MCMillan in the Federal electoral division of MCMillan. (b) In the 12 months to June 1995-96 (the latest period for which data are available), 1,068,571 services were provided in the Federal electoral division of MCMillan. Taxation: Research and Development (Question No. 212) Mr Rocher asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: (1) Further to his answer to my question without notice concerning alleged rorting of the scheme which provides tax concessions for research and development (Hansard, 7 May 1996, page 440), has advice been received of cases of rorting of the scheme; if so, how was it able to occur under the existing approval and registration procedures. (2) Have administrative barriers been erected which defer or delay consideration and approval of applications under the scheme. (3) Is it a fact that it costs $1.30 wealth for each dollar spent on research and development for all projects approved under the scheme. Mr Moore---The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) It is the case that taxation concessions do have the potential to sometimes be ""rorted"" or provide unintended tax benefits to claimants. Because of this, the administration of tax concessions should be subjected to regular evaluation and review. In accord with the Government's election commitment, a review of the R&D tax concession has now been completed and changes have been announced by the Government. The primary outcome of that review is the Government's action to close off future access to the R&D tax concession by syndicates. (2) Prior to this decision, no administrative barriers were erected which deferred or delayed consideration and approval of applications. The IR&D Board, through its Tax Concession Committee, has been diligent in its duty to carefully consider the value of the proposed R&D and the proposed financial arrangements of syndicates. It is this proper adherence to duty and accountability by the IR&D Board and its Tax Concession Committee that has delayed consideration of some syndicate proposals, rather than any form of artificial barrier. (3) Unintended tax benefits were obtained by investors in syndicates through a series of legally complex transactions and highly inflated core technology valuations. The use of overseas tax havens, pre capital gains technology and tax exempt organisations became common place. The cost to the Commonwealth revenue of these syndicates was calculated by the BIE to be in the range of $0.83 and $1.42 per dollar of new R&D. While the range was dependant upon the commercial focus of the R&D conducted and the value of the tax losses used by the researcher, the common thread was that the investor received a yield with no financial risk through unintended tax benefits. International Year for the Eradication of World Poverty (Question No. 240) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: (1) What action is being taken in the Minister's portfolio in relation to the goals of the International Year for the Eradication of World Poverty. (2) What programs have been initiated in 1996 to the Commonto achieve the goals. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Many Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs portfolio programs are aimed at preventing poverty on a broad long-term basis by providing access to appropriate education, training and employment opportunities. The portfolio also provides expert advice by way of consultancies in employment and training programs to a number of developing countries. (2) No specific, short-term, programs have been initiated. Foreign Ownership and Equity in Australian Entities (Question No. 275) Mr Bradford asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 May 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to concern in the community about the extent of foreign ownership of Australian property and the extent of foreign equity in Australian corporations. (2) Did his Department stop publishing foreign ownership figures in 1986; if so, why. (3) What is the estimated total value of foreign investment in Australia. (4) Will the guidelines under which the Foreign Investment Review Board operates be changed; if so, how. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am aware that there are some in the community who are concerned about foreign ownership of Australian property and businesses. Australia's foreign investment policy seeks to balance these community concerns with the benefits of foreign investment. In recognition of the benefits of direct foreign investment (such as supplementing domestic savings, integrating the Australian market with the world economy and increasing competitive pressures), the overall stance of foreign investment policy is liberal and welcoming of direct foreign investment. Restrictions are applied in a few areas such as residential real estate (where the net benefits to Australians from investment are considered to be lower), media, telecommunications and civil aviation. (2) The Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes statistics on foreign ownership of equity covering all sectors of the economy in each March quarter issue of International Investment Position Australia (Catalogue No 5306.0) and also in Year Book Australia (Catalogue No 1301.0). (3) At 31 March 1996, the level of foreign investment in Australia was $428,789 million (Source: International Investment Position Australia March Quarter 1996). (4) The Commonwealth legislation review schedule indicates that a review of foreign investment policy will be undertaken in 1996-97. The review schedule includes reviews to be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the national competition policy and reviews of legislation that Year Original Claims 1993 1994 1995 1/1/96-19/8/96 (2) Where practitioners inadvertently bank cheques payable to them for services not rendered or claimed, recovery action is taken to firstly, recover the amount involved and secondly, to identify how the incorrect payment occurred. The increasing use of scanning and ED! facilities by the HIC has reduced the errors. Export Market Development Grants (Question No. 399) Mr Lee asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 17 June 1996: (1) What sums were provided under the Export Market Development Grant Scheme (a) in 1992-93; (b) in 1993-94; (c) in 1994-95 and (d) between I July 1995 and I May 1996 to businesses operating in the electoral divisions of (i) Dobell;(ii) Robertson and (iii) Shortland. (2) With respect to each grant referred to in (I), what (a) sum was granted; (b) was the location impose costs upon business. The review of foreign investment policy falls into the latter category. Erroneous Medicare Payments (Question No. 393) Mr Rocher asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 17 June 1996: (I) How many instances of erroneous payments by Medicare to medical practitioners were recorded in (a) 1993, (b) 1994, (c) 1995 and (d) 1996 to the date of answering this question. (2) What action is taken against (a) practitioners who inadvertently bank cheques payable to them for services not rendered or claimed and (b) those responsible for authorising incorrect payments.",110
279,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NSW VIC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) It is not clear what is meant by erroneous payments. The Health Insurance Commission, in processing claims for Medicare Benefits, carries out a range of checks to ensure that the processing carried out is as correct or accurate as possible. In terms of underpayments, a very small percentage of underpayments, relative to total claims, were identified and corrected in the years listed as the following table indicates: Underpayments % 3,561,617 24,130 0.68 3,848,271 28,903 0.75 4,162,435 26,961 0.65 2,771,053 16,962 0.61 of the recipient and (c) was the purpose for which the grant was made. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The confidentiality provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 preclude the direct or indirect release of information concerning the Scheme affairs of individual grant recipients. Due to the small number of grant recipients in the electoral divisions of Dobell, Robertson and Shortland, the supply of separate information for each division may breach these confidentiality provisions. Therefore, the answer has been supplied for the three divisions taken together. The total sums provided under the Export Market Development Scheme in the financial years 199293, 1993-94 and 1994-95, and between I July 1995 part and I May 1996, to the electoral divisions of Dobell, Robertson and Shortland were as follows: Dobell, Robertson and Shortland (2) The confidentiality provisions of the Australia, Ian Trade Commission Act 1985 preclude the release of detailed information concerning grant recipients, such as the address of the person or the specific purpose for which the funds were used. Therefore, these specific details have not been supplied. In all cases, however, the grants were provided as partial reimbursement of eligible export promotion expenditure incurred by grant recipients. This is consistent with the purpose of the EMDG scheme, which is to build an export culture in Australia, and to boost Australia's exports, through reimbursing part of the export promotion expenditure of eligible firms and similar organisations. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (Question No. 409) Mr Sawford asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 18 June 1996: (1) What (a) initiatives have been taken and (b) funding has been allocated to assist the estimated 30,000 Australians who suffer from myalgic encephalomyelitis, also know as chronic fatigue syndrome. (2) Has the National Health and Medical Research Council allocated, or will it allocate, funding for the research on myalgic encephalomyelitis.",112
280,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NSW VIC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) & (b) The Government recognises the difficulties faced by those people unfortunately afflicted by this debilitating condition and has taken steps to address their concerns. The Government has approved funding to enable the Royal Australasian College of Physicians to produce a series of guidelines on the most clinically relevant and cost effective methods of diagnosing and treating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians has been provided with an advance of $130,000 to enable this project to commence. ""The project will be managed by a Steering Committee comprising representatives from the College itself together with representatives from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Australian Rheumatology Association, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of Pathologists of Austral(d) 11711995 to (a) 1992-93 (b) 1993-94 (c) 1994-95 11511996 $410,189 $924,712 $1,045,759 $908,197 the Australian Society for Infectious Diseases and the Australasian Faculty of Occupational Medicine. In addition, the Steering Committee will have representation from the Consumers' Health Forum and a health economist. A project officer has been appointed to provide administrative assistance to the Steering Committee which is expected to hold its first meeting over the next four weeks."" The guidelines will be published as a supplement to the Medical Journal of Australia and will be widely distributed to all general practitioners and specialist/consultant physicians with an interest in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. (2) In 1996 the National Health and Medical Research Council is providing $454,000 for support of a program of research at the University of New South Wales which is investigating aspects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Medicare Offices in Australia (Question No. 411) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 19 June 1996: (1) How many Medicare offices are there in Australia. (2) Does the Health Insurance Commission (mC) (a) decide on the location of each Medicare office and (b) approve the establishment of new offices. (3) What role does the Government play in determining the location of Medicare offices. (4) On what basis was the establishment of the Medicare office at Mandurah, WA, approved. (5) Did (a) he or his predecessor or (b) the HIC receive representations advocating the opening of an office at Mandurah; if so, in each case, (i) on what date and (ii) from whom.",113
281,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NSW VIC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 269 (2)(a) Yes (b) Yes (3) None (4) After considering the potential level of cash claims from the postcode areas surrounding the Mandurah region. Average daily cash claims from the Mandurah office, for the June quarter, were 235. The city of Mandurah has a population of 34,000 and a growth rate of 6.8%. The nearest Medicare branch offices are at Rockingham (40km) and Bunbury (lOOkm). There is no adequate public transport between Mandurah and these Medicare branch offices. The Health Insurance Commission operates Medicare offices in four other regional towns with similar or less population than Mandurah and with substantially lower growth rates. They are Albany, Bunbury, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie. (5)(a) Four (b) Eight (i) and (ii) I cannot agree to publish the names of those making representations. Correspondence, including representations from both sides of politics as well as business and private sources, was received on the following dates: 17/5/91; 6/5/93; 30/9/93; 3/6/94; 18/7/94; 27/7/94; 23/8/94; 1112/94; 16/3/95; 22/6/95; 4/7/95; One letter was undated. Air Safety Incident: Essendon Airport (Question No. 451) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 24 June 1996: (1) Did an air safety incident occur near Essendon Airport at approximately 4.50 p.m. on 15 June 1996 involving two aircraft endeavouring to land on the north-south runway simultaneously; if so, (a) will he ensure that the Bureau of Air Safety (BASI) examines the incident and (b) what airspace control procedures have been implemented to prevent incidents of this kind occurring over Essendon Airport. (2) Did the Civil Aviation Authority state at page 33 of the BASI report on the crash of a De Havilland Dove aircraft during take-off from Essendon Airport in December 1993 that it would continue investigations into the cause of the fuel control unit failure in the right engine; is the status of the investigations. (3) Is it a fact that since Essendon Airport became a light aircraft airport following the establishment of Tullamarine Airport, a series of accidents and incidents have occurred, including the Partenavia crash in 1978 killing 6 persons, the air ambulance crash in 1986 killing all on board and the De Havilland Dove crash in December 1993 on 5 houses in Essendon; if so, will he act to relocate Essendon Airport's aviation operations to a more appropriate site such as Point Cook. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), Airservices Australia and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) have provided the following advice: (1)(a) Two aircraft operating in the circuit at Essendon were operating under a sight and follow procedure. This is a normal procedure for aircraft operating at aerodromes such as Essendon. The tower controller observed one aircraft turn early and because he had doubts about the manoeuvre he issued positive control instructions to the aircraft so that safety would not be compromised. No incident report was required to be submitted and therefore there was no requirement for BASI involvement. (l)(b) The actions of the tower controller are the specified procedures in such instances. (2) Yes. The investigation into the cause of the fuel control unit failure in the right engine has been conducted in consultation with Dove operators, the Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom and maintenance organisations, both in Australia and the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, this investigation has been prolonged due to the fact that the manufacturer of the fuel controls has ceased its business, making it difficult to obtain the data that is required for this investigation. The investigation is still continuing, and has not produced any evidence to change CASA's view that the fuel control failure on the Dove aircraft was an isolated incident. (3) Yes. The three accidents referred to by the honourable member have occurred at Essendon. The Government is currently examining the future operation of Essendon Airport and will take into account community concerns as part of this consideration. Noise Audit: Perth Airport (Question No. 464) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon if so, what notice, on 25 June 1996: Has the Commonwealth entered into a contract for a noise audit for Perth Airport; if so, (a) when was the contract entered into, (b) when will the audit (i) commence and (ii) be completed and (c) what opportunities exist for local submissions and representations in respect of the audit. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth has not entered into a contract for an audit of the number of persons and buildings in areas affected by aircraft noise around Perth Airport. Corporations Law Simplification Task Force: Forum (Question No. 466) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 June 1996: Is the Corporations Law Simplification Task Force conducting a three-day forum and workshop in Sydney, Melboume and Brisbane but not Perth; if so, (a) why and (b) will he arrange for it to be conducted in Perth. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. A three-day conference (including workshop) on the Corporations Law Simplification Program was arranged in Sydney and Melbourne for July 1996, and Brisbane for August 1996, by IIR Pty Ltd. Members of the Simplification Task Force were, or will be amongst the speakers at the conference, and the Treasury has been associated with the organisation of the conference. The Task Force's participation in this conference in no way affects the Task Force's own program for conducting public seminars around Australia in connection with exposure drafts of its legislation. I would expect, as has been the case previously, that these seminars will continue to be held in Perth. I understand that the Task Force's next series of seminars will be conducted following the release of the Third Corporate Law Simplification Bill, expected later this year. Closer Economic Relations: New Zealand (Questions No. 472) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 June 1996: In Australia's Closer Economic Relations with New Zealand, what is the Government's position and intentions with respect to (a) common competition policies and (b) macroeconomic and currency convergence. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Australia and New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA), which came into force in 1983, is the primary instrument governing the conduct of trade between Australia and New Zealand in goods and services. The purpose of ANZCERT A is to develop closer economic relations between Australia and New Zealand through the mutually beneficial expansion of free trade under conditions of fair competition, via a gradual and progressive elimination of barriers to trade, including through the harmonisation of business laws. When New Zealand enacted the Commerce Act 1986 (the CA) in 1986 the competition provisions of that statute were largely based on the competition provisions in the Australian Trade Practices Act 1974 (the TPA). Subsequently, each country has undertaken periodic reviews leading to minor modifications in their competition laws. Notwithstanding the various modifications to the statutes, substantial harmonisation remains and is intended to continue. Some changes in the statutes have been complementary; for example, on 1 July 1990, under the auspices of ANZCERT A, the availability of anti-dumping actions on goods originated in each other's markets was removed and the misuse of market power provisions were expanded to take in trans-Tasman markets. Consideration will be given in the future to extending the competitive conduct provisions of the TP A and the CA to trans-Tasman markets, but these matters are not considered pressing at this stage. Although New Zealand and Australian competition laws are similar, Australia's recent implementation of reforms in response to the Hilmer Report (released in August 1993) has greatly enhanced Australia's national competition policy; for example, Australian law now includes provision for third party access to significant infrastructure facilities, such as electricity grids. Furthermore, our national competition policy contains processes for future reform, including the review of anti-competitive legislation to ensure that such legislation produces net public benefits and the implementation of competitive neutrality principles for government businesses. There is no formal mechanism to harmonise these areas of competition policy between Australia and New Zealand. However, the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement which provides for mutual recognition of various Australian and New Zealand regulations and standards relating to the sale of goods and the registration of occupations is consistent with the competition policy objective of removing regulatory restrictions on competition. (b) There is no provision under ANZCERTA for macroeconomic and currency convergence between Australia and New Zealand. Wheat: Marketing Arrangements (Question No. 474) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 June 1996: (1) What decision has the Government made on the single desk marketing arrangements for wheat. (2) How is the decision consistent with the principles and processes governing national competition policies. 3920 Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Anderson MP, has portfolio responsibility for the Australian Wheat Board (A WB) and is best placed to outline the Government's policy on the single desk marketing arrangements. (2) The Wheat Marketing Act 1989, which provides for the single desk export powers of the AWB, is included on the Commonwealth's Legislation Review Schedule and is to be reviewed in 1999-2000. The inclusion of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 on the review Schedule meets the requirement of the Competition Principles Agreement signed by the Commonwealth and all State and Territory Governments in April 1995. PAVE Tax Returns (Question No. 480) Mr Filing asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 26 June 1996: (1) What was the total number of PA YE tax returns processed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in 1995-96. (2) What percentage of the tax returns referred to in part (1) were audited. (3) What percentage of audited returns required a downward adjustment to the sum claimed as work related expenses (WRE). (4) What was the average reduction in the cases referred to in part (3). (5) What total additional revenue was raised as a result of the adjustments. (6) How many returns requiring an adjustment for the sum claimed for WRE required an upward adjustment. (7) What was the average increase in WRE allowed in the cases referred to in part (6). (8) What total revenue was forgone as a result the adjustments. (9) What total sum was claimed as WRE by all PA YE taxpayers in 1995-96. (10) What was the total number of employees at the ATO in 1995-96. (II) What was the average income of ATO employees in 1995-96. (12) What was the total cost of wages and salaries to the ATO in 1995-96. (13) What percentage of ATO employees work in the area which deals with WRE and revenue recovery associated with WRE. REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, 10 September 1996 Mr Costello--The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: For the purpose of answering this question the figures I have given are for 'Individual' tax returns where tax instalment deductions have been made. (1) As at 30 June 1996, there were 7,634,654 tax returns processed by the ATO in 1995-96 (relating to incomes earned in 1994-95). (2) 0.7% of tax returns referred to in part (1) were audited for the 1994-95 income year. The ATO audit program in relation to individual taxpayers, is primarily based upon a process of advising taxpayers prior to the lodgement of their return, that their return is to be reviewed by our audit staff. Documentation supporting claims is required at the time returns are lodged. This process results in less adjustments to returns because taxpayers take more care having been given prior warning of our intention to review their claims. There were 47,564 such audits conducted in 95/96 (relating to 1994-95 income year) on WRE. Additionally, 6052 (traditional) post issue audits were also conducted in relation to Work Related Expenses. Review activity by audit staff was undertaken in relation to a further 233,661 PA YE taxpayers on matters other than Work Related Expenses eg Income matching cases. (3) Pre issue audits: 6102 downward adjustments or 12.8%. Post issue audits: 2779 downward adjustments or 45.9%. (4) Pre issue Audits: Average adjustment $1291; Post issue audits: Average adjustment 3521. (5) Total revenue: $6.76M tax and $1.95M in penalties and interest. (It should be noted that the total revenue gained as a result of the ATO review of returns in 95/96 (for 1994-95 income year) is $126M. For WRE, the total revenue gain as a result of the ATO review of of returns is $52.6M. This takes into account the revenue attributed to the reduction in WRE claims for those taxpayers subject to pre-issue review when comparing their change in claim levels to the change in claim levels of all other taxpayers claiming WRE). (6) 105 cases required an upward adjustment (Another 39,600 taxpayers (approximately) increased their claims for WRE by self amending their claim, after they lodged their tax returns). (7) The average increase related to the 105 cases was $682 (8) $25,096 (9) $5,525,136,000 (10) 17,612 average staffing level for 1995/96 (includes SES) (11) $38,450 (12) $677,14], above the line (incl SES); $139,874, below the line; $817,015 total salaries (13) 1.5% (246.8 out of a total of 16800) Chicken Meat Industry (Question No. 483)  Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 26 June 1996: (1) How many chicken growers are there in Australia. (2) How many persons are employed in the chicken meat industry. (3) Is he able to say how many persons are dependent for their employment upon the employment of the persons referred to in part (2). (4) To what extent are lower consumer prices the benefit of competition in the chicken meat industry. (5) What was the retail price for chicken meat in (a) 1991, (b) 1992, (c) 1993, (d) (6) Has his Department estimated the potential losses in (a) employment and (b) market share to the domestic industry if the importation of cooked chicken meat were allowed; if so, what are the estimates. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publication 'Characteristics of Australian Farms 1993-94' which contains the most independent statistics on chicken growers, there were 732 poultry meat farms in Australia. A State by State breakdown of these numbers is as follows: NSW, 329; QLD, 102; VIC, 151; SA, 72; WA, 65; and TAS, 13. (2) Estimates of the number of persons employed in the Australian poultry industry are not currently available. However, a report undertaken in 1991 by JT Larkin & Associates entitled 'The Australian poultry industry: Economic Structure and the Impact of World Poultry Trade Developments' estimated the number of people directly employed in 1988/89 was 16,000. Of these, it was estimated that 11,000 people were on-farm and 5,000 people were employed in the processing sector. A further 29,000 people were estimated to be indirectly employed in the industry. (3) Due to the unavailability of statistics, I am 1996: not able to provide an estimate of the numbers of persons dependent for their employment upon the employment of the persons referred to in part (2). (4) The degree to which cost savings in the production and processing of chicken meat are passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices is dependent upon the level of competition in the industry. Although the structure of the Australian poultry meat industry is highly concentrated, with two large companies supplying around 80 per cent of the domestic market, it is likely (for reasons listed below) that the industry can be characterised as being closer to perfect competition than to a monopoly. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) advises that the chicken meat industry is assumed to be characterised by a high degree of contestability because: (i) chicken meat is marketed through highly competitive supermarkets, fast food chains and the food service sector; (ii) there are few barriers to entry, and, in addition to the two large suppliers, there are two medium sized hatcheries which supply chicks; and (iii) current State regulations (setting minimum contract prices to broiler growers) and trade practices legislation restrict predatory pricing. (5) According to ABS data, the retail price for 1994 and (e) 1995. chicken meat in: (a) 1991, was $3.09 per kilo; (b) 1992, was $2.94 per kilo; (c) 1993, was $2.89 per kilo; (d) 1994, was $2.72 per kilo; (e) 1995, was $2.92 per kilo. (6) (a) & (b) An assessment of the impact on employment and market share if cooked chicken meat imports were allowed is very difficult as, due to quarantine restrictions, there is no historical data on which to base such assessments. Therefore, it is uncertain precisely what the effects might be, though cooked chicken meat imports are anticipated to comprise some 2-5% of domestic chicken meat consumption. To try and resolve this and to ensure that industry has an input into assessing the impact of cooked chicken meat imports, I have set up a Working Group, comprised of representatives from the industry and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, which will be reporting to me shortly. Burglaries in Australia (Question No. 493) Mr Filing asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 27 June (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Economist of 8 June 1996 containing a claim that a person is more likely to be burgled in Australia than in the USA and indicating Australia's high world ranking in the incidence of burglary. (2) Is it a fact that a high proportion of are committed to fund drug addiction. (3) Will he ensure that proposed funding cuts to the National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police do not adversely affect the fight against drugs. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am aware of the article in the Economist of 8 June 1996 entitled 'Crime in America'. The article refers to an international crime survey carried out in 1992 by the Ministry of Justice in the Netherlands which it is claimed indicates that a person is more likely to be burgled in Australia than in America, although later in the article the comparison is made between Sydney and Los Angeles. While the comparisons referred to in the article are open to question, I share the concern of my state and territory colleagues who are responsible for community policing that the level of burglaries in Australia is too high. (2) I am not aware of statistics which show decisively the perc':!ntage of burglaries committed by persons seeking to support their drug habits. There is statistical data indicating that most dependent heroin users fund their drug use from property crime. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that a significant proportion of such crimes may be attributable to users of heroin in particular. (3) The government has set net savings targets for all government departments and agencies. The National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police are among those government agencies required to meet such targets. Both agencies will ensure available resources are allocated to minimise the impact of cuts on their core investigative functions. Natural Heritage Trust (Question No. 498) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 27 June 1996: (I) How are the terms 'capital' and 'recurrent' expenditure defined with respect to the proposed Natural Heritage Trust projects. (2) Are the proposed (a) National Vegetation Initiative, (b) Murray-Darling 2001 Project, (c) National Land and Water Resources Audit, (d) National Reserve System and (e) Coasts and Clean Seas Initiative classified as capital projects; if so, on what basis with respect to the definitions referred to in part (I). Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the burglaries Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The term 'capital', in relation to the proposed Natural Heritage Trust projects, refers to those projects designed to maintain and replenish Australia's environmental infrastructure as outlined in the Saving our Natural Heritage policy statement. Recurrent expenditures from the Natural Heritage Trust will be of an ongoing repair and maintenance nature, and will be used for other environmental projects and to support the further development of sustainable agriculture. (2) Yes, on the basis that the projects will contribute to our ability to maintain and replenish Australia's natural capital through: (a) reversing the long-term decline in the extent and quality of Australia's native vegetation cover; (b) contributing to the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin; (c) establishing a baseline assessment of the nation's land, water and vegetation capital which will assist in policy refinement and priority setting across all Natural Heritage Trust components; (d) assisting with the establishment and maintenance of a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of reserves; and (e) tackling coastal pollution hot spots and significant threats to Australia's coastal water quality and marine biodiversity. Eco-design and Cleaner Industries Incentive Program (Question No. 499) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 27 June 1996: (1) Were funds allocated under the Environment portfolio in 1995-96 to support projects under the Eco-design and Cleaner Industries Incentive Program; if so, (a) what sum was allocated specifically to the program, (b) how many projects were funded under the program,(c) which companies and organisations have received funding under the program, (d) what sum was provided for each project, (e) what was the purpose of each project, (f) which projects have been completed, (g) which projects have not been finalised and (h) when will the uncompleted projects be finalised. (2) Was the program designed to provide information to Australian companies and organisations on environment management capabilities in Australia. (3) Will the Government use the results of the program to promote cleaner approaches to other Australian companies and organisations; if so, what strategies will it use. (4) Will the Minister provide a list of the companies and organisations that have participated in the program showing the nature of their contribution. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l)(a) $721,000 was allocated to the program 1995/96. (b) Ten projects were funded in 1995/96. (c) The funds were allocated as follows: ECO-REDESIGN PROJECT Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology$170,000 The project involves six companies: Southcorp Appliances; Caroma; Blackmores; Imaging Technologies; Email; Schiavello NA NA Dames and Moore (technical consultant)$100,000 Edelman (communications consultant)-$105,232 The project involves eleven companies: Moore Business Systems; Nowra Chemicals; Castrol Australia; Holden's Engine Company; Bonlac; Hotel Kurrajong; Austcast; ACI Glass Packaging; Schweppes Cottee's; CSR Weathertex; Australian Meat Holdings NA ACA Research Pty Ltd-$9,OOO Amelia Tagaza (Industry pamphlets)-$9,240 ANU Local Sustainability Project-$50,000 Australian Chamber of Manufacturers-$20,500 Australian Hospitals Association-$44,OOO Australian Manufacturing Workers Union$18,000 Clean Air Society of Aust and New Zealand$5,000 Noarlunga City Council-$33,000 (d) See (c) above. (e) The purpose of the projects was to identify, implement and demonstrate cleaner production initiatives in Australia and to promote such initiatives more broadly across a range of industries. (f) Projects have been completed with the exception of the Eco-redesign, Cleaner Production Demonstration, and Australian Chamber of Manufacturers projects. (g) See (f) above. (h) Projects will be completed during 1996/97. (2) Yes. Substantial effort has been and is being made to promote cleaner production through seminars, conferences, printed materials distributed through peak organisations and the Environment Protection Agency, videos and an electronic database. (3) Yes. Various measures outlined in (2) above for will continue in 1996/97 and, as announced in the Budget, the Government plans to develop, in partnership with State and Territory environment protection agencies, a national strategy for cleaner production. (4) See (l)(c) above. The companies and organisations involved in the program have provided examples of the environmental and financial benefits of cleaner production practices which have demonstrative value to other organisations. These have been disseminated, inter alia, through the database of Cleaner Production Casestudies on the Internet. Participating organisations have contributed to the projects, in some cases financially, and in others, in kind in a variety of ways. Department of Transport and Regional Development Staff: Hunter Region (Question No. 514)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 27 June 1996: How many staff were employed at each office operated by the Minister's Department or any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility in the electoral divisions of (a) Shortland, (b) Newcastle, (c) Paterson, (d) Charlton and (e) Hunter at (i) 31 March 1996, (ii) 30 June 1996 and (iii) the date of answering this question. Mr Sharp-The amended answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Electoral Division-Shortland 31 March 1996-6 Staff members 30 June 1996-6 Staff members 24 July 1996-6 Staff members Electoral Division-Newcastle 31 March 1996-15 Staff members 30 June 1996-15 Staff members 24 July 1996-15 Staff members Electoral Division-Paterson 31 March 1996-8 Staff members 30 June 1996-8 Staff members 24 July 1996-8 Staff members Electoral Division-Charlton 31 March 1996-4 Staff members 30 June 1996-4 Staff members 24 July 1996-4 Staff members Electoral Division-Hunter 31 March 1996-4 Staff members 30 June 1996-4 Staff members 24 July 1996-4 Staff members Department of Health and Family Services Staff: Hunter Region (Question No. 515)  Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 27 June 1996: How many staff were employed at each office operated by the Minister's Department or any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility in the electoral of (a) Shortland, (b) Newcastle, (c) Paterson, (d) Charlton and (e) Hunter at (i) 31 March 1996, (ii) 30 June 1996 and (iii) the date of answering this question.",113
282,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,OTHER PROJECTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The numbers of staff employed in the Department of Health and Family Services and its agencies and statutory authorities on the dates nominated by the honourable member are set out below. The date given in part (iii) is the latest common date for which the information collected from the statutory authorities and other agencies could be provided. Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (a) Shortland (i) 31 March 1996-18 (15 full time, 3 part time); (ii) 30 June 1996-17 (14 full time, 3 part time); (iii) 23 July 1996-17 (13 full time, 4 part time) (b) Newcastle (i) 31 March 1996-12 (9 full time, 3 part time); (ii) 30 June 1996-13 (10 full time, 3 part time); (ii) 23 July 1996-14 (11 full time, 3 part time) (c) Paterson (i) 31 March 1996-15 (14 full time, 1 part time); (ii) 30 June 1996-14 (13 full time, 1 part time); (ii) 23 July 1996-14 (13 full time, I part time) The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service has no staff employed in the Charlton and Hunter el ectorates. Australian Hearing Services (b) Newcastle (i) 31 March 1996-19 (14 full time, 5 part time); (ii) 30 June 1996-19 (14 full time, 5 part time); (iii) 23 July 1996--20 (15 full time, 5 part time) Australian Hearing Services has no staff employed in the Shortland, Paterson, Charlton and Hunter electorates. Australian Government Health Service (b) Newcastle (i) 31 March 1996-9 (5 full time, 4 part time); (ii) 30 June 1996-9 (5 full time, 4 part time); (iii) 23 July 1996-8 (5 full time, 3 part time) The Australian Government Health Service has no staff employed in the Shortland, Paterson, Charlton, and Hunter electorates. Health Insurance Commission (a) Shortland (i) 31 March 1996-4 (2 full time, 2 part time); (ii) 30 June 1996-4 (2 full time, 2 part time); (ii) divisions 23 July 1996-4 (2 full time, 2 part time) (b) Newcastle (i) 31 March 1996-16 (12 full time, 4 part time); (ii) 30 June 1996-16 (12 full time, 4 part time); (iii) 23 July 1996-16 (12 full time, 4 part time) (c) Paterson (i) 31 March 1996-10 (7 full time, 3 part time); (ii) 30 June 1996-10 (7 full time, 3 part time); (iii) 23 July 1996-10 (7 full time, 3 part time) (d) Charlton (i) 31 March 1996-4 (2 full time, 2 part time); (ii) 30 June 1996-4 (2 full time, 2 part time); (iii) 23 July 1996-4 (2 full time, 2 part time) (e) Hunter (i) 31 March 1996-;-8 (4 full time, 4 part time) (ii) 30 June 1996-8 (4 full time, 4 part time); (iii) 23 July 1996-8 (4 full time, 4 part time) Advisory Committee on Biosphere Reserves: Australian Representation (Question No. 524) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: Was Australia represented at the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Biosphere Reserves under the Unesco Man and the Biosphere Program which was held in Paris in April 1996 to identify options for evaluating the world network of reserves and implementing the Seville Strategy for a sustainable development; if so, by whom; if not, why not. Mr W arwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Advisory Committee on Biosphere Reserves is established by the Director-General of UNESCO, who personally selects the members. No Australian is a member of this Committee. As the meeting was held immediately prior to the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Bureau meeting, an invitation was extended to Dr Peter Bridgewater, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, (who was in Paris for the Bureau meeting) to attend as an observer, which he did. Voter Identification Cards (Question No. 561) Mr MCDougall asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: Is the Government considering the introduction of voter identification cards for future federal elections. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The issue of voter identification at polling was examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its enquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election. In its November 1994 Report to the Parliament entitled 'The 1993 Federal Election' the Committee concluded that all objective evidence indicated that fraud was not a significant occurrence and did not influence any result at the 1993 federal election. The Committee did not support a requirement for proof of identity at polling booths. However, in a dissenting report by Mr David Connolly MP, Senator Nicholas Minchin, Senator John Tierney, and Mr Michael Cobb MP, it was stated that the conclusion of the majority was too complacent. The dissenting report recommended a number of measures to tighten up electoral procedures, including the trial of voter identification at a by-election. In the light of the dissenting report, the Government will be giving further consideration to the issue of electoral fraud and measures to tighten up electoral procedures. In addition, it is likely that they will be further examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which I believe is the appropriate forum at this time for discussion of such matters. Accordingly, the Government will reserve consideration of voter identification cards until after the Committee has examined the issues and tabled its report. IT Services Panel (Question No. 563) Mr MCDougall asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) What function does the IT Services Panel undertake within his Department. (2) Will (a) the Government and (b) small business derive any benefits from the panel's activities. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The IT Services Panel was established by the Department of Administrative Services to provide all Commonwealth agencies with a streamlined process for the procurement of information technology services. The IT Services Panel is a prequalified group of companies who have agreed to supply IT services under a standard contract known as PE68. (2) (a) The Government benefits from using the IT Services Panel by decreasing the cost of contracting. This is achieved by eliminating the need to assess each tender for commitment to quality, financial viability and industry development, as all panellists have been pre-qualified for those aspects. booths Government also reduces its legal and contract administration costs by obviating the need for individual agencies to negotiate their own set of terms and conditions, as DAS has already done so on their behalf. (b) Small business benefits from using the IT Services Panel by reducing the amount of paperwork to do business with Government. The benefits of pre-qualification that the agencies derive are, in tum, enjoyed by small business, as they are not required to re-establish their credentials for every tender. Paperwork has also been reduced through electronic tenders, and access to relevant information via the Internet. Small to Medium Enterprises (SME) also benefit because the IT Services Panel removes barriers for these companies to participate in significant cards government contracts. The IT Services Panel currently comprises 76 panellists of which 46% are SMEs. This Panel will be added to as more companies apply for admission. Portraits of the Queen (Question No. 564) Mr MCDougall asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: Has the Government ceased distributing portraits of the Queen through Government bookshops; if so, why. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Portraits of the Queen were withdrawn from sale through the then Commonwealth Government Bookshops, now called Government Info Shops, in August 1992. The decision was made on a commercial basis by the Australian Government Publishing Services (AGPS) in view of the very small demand and the introduction of free distribution of such portraits by Members and Senators from their electorate offices under the Constituents Request Program. The circumstances of the AGPS decision are unchanged and the sale of such portraits through its retail outlets remains commercially unviable. However, following a number of representations I have reviewed the situation and made arrangements for portraits of the Queen to also be made freely available to the public through Government Info Shops. Extended Sitting Hours: Costs (Question No. 571) Mr Crean asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: What additional ministerial and electorate office staff costs were incurred by his Department as a consequence of (a) the changed sitting hours which commenced on 1 May 1996, including the House sitting until 11 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays, (b) the need for the House to sit beyond the scheduled finishing time on Wednesday, 22 May, Wednesday, 29 May, Wednesday, 19 June, Wednesday, 26 June and Thursday, 27 June 1996, and (c) the need for the House to sit on Friday, 28 June 1996. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is not clear that any additional staff costs involved. The honourable Member will be aware that Senior Ministerial staff receive an allowance to recognise long and irregular hours and this allowance remains unchanged regardless of the precise hours which the House sits. Moreover the staff of Ministers' offices work long hours for reasons not associated with the sitting times of the House. In relation to the overtime worked by junior staff it would not be possible without conducting a survey to attribute the cause of the overtime to the sitting times of the House or other reasons. The honourable Member should also be aware that the Parliament by sitting beyond the scheduled sitting time is able to dispatch business in fewer days ultimately greatly reducing the costs which reconvening the Parliament would involve. More generally the Government's sitting pattern has been devised to optimise the use of Members' time, and that of their staffs, and reduce overall costs. Australian Pipeline Authority (Question No. 573) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Does the Australian Pipeline Authority retain an interest in the Moomba-Sydney pipeline system; if so, what interest, if not, (a) when was the interest disposed of, (b) to whom was it transferred, (c) what were the terms and conditions upon which it was transferred and (d) were any arrangements made between the authority and the entity to which the interest was transferred to discharge the Commonwealth's obligations to landowners across whose land the pipeline traverses; if so, what arrangements. (2) If no arrangements were made by the authority with the entity to which the interest was transferred, does the Commonwealth accept responsibility for compensating landowners across whose land the pipeline traverses. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Pipeline Authority (TPA) was abolished on 13 August 1996 on which day all its residual assets and liabilities became those of the Commonwealth pursuant to section 166 of the MoombaSydney Pipeline System Act 1994. As at the date of its abolition, TPA did not have any interest in the Moomba-Sydney pipeline system (MSP). TPA's interests in the MSP were transferred by the Commonwealth to East Australian Pipeline Ltd (EAPL) on 30 June :994. The gross sale price was $534.3 million, in exchange for which EAPL assumed ownership of all natural gas pipelines and laterals forming the MSP. On sale day, ownership were of the easements in which these pipelines run was transferred from TPA. to EAPL and the Commonwealth jointly, as tenants in common. Details of the MSP sale process and a description of the relevant contractual agreements are contained in Performance Audit Report No 10 1995-96, entitled ""Sale of the Moomba to Sydney Gas Pipeline"" published by the Australian National Audit Office. As part of the sale arrangements, the Commonwealth and EAPL entered into an Easement Agreement governing access to and administration of the easements jointly owned by them. Under this agreement, the Commonwealth took responsibility for rectifying any identified deficiencies existing in the easements at the time of sale, including any outstanding easement acquisition compensation issues. Since the MSP sale, no compensation issues have been brought to the notice of the Commonwealth. The day to day administration and physical maintenance of the easements, together with ongoing landowner liaison is the responsibility of EAPL. Similarly, EAPL is responsible for any damage that may arise to landowners as a result of pipeline operation activities after it assumed ownership of the MSP. (2) In view of the above arrangements, part (2) of the honourable member's question is not relevant. Overseas Property Group Expenditure: Kathmandu (Question No. 598) Mr Hardgrave asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: (1) Has the Overseas Property Group spent more than $3,262 on tennis court paint for the Australian diplomatic compound in Kathmandu. (2) Was an additional $2,500 expended to freight the paint to Kathmandu. (3) Were attempts made to purchase the paint in Kathmandu. (4) How many Australians are located within the Australian compound in Kathmandu. (5) Are the tennis courts used for any purpose other than recreation by Australian staff. (6) What other recreational facilities are located within the compound. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Overseas Property Group spent $3,262 on surfacing material for the tennis court. (2) Air-freight of the material to Kathmandu cost $2,965. All material imported into Kathmandu must be air-freighted at least part of the way. The material which had to be specifically packed because of its hazardous nature, was air-freighted from Sydney. (3) No suitable resurfacing paint was available in Kathmandu. (4) The Mission has two A-based staff. (5) The tennis court is used as recreation for staff and their guests. (6) Kathmandu is a difficult environment and the only recreational facilities available are the tennis court and a swimming pool both of which are on the compound. Refurbishment of Australia House, London (Question No. 600) Mr Hardgrave asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: (1) What was the initial estimate for the refurbishment of Australia House in London. (2) Is that estimate now more than $20m; if so, why. (3) What other additional costs are likely to be incurred prior to completion of the project. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) The amount approved by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works was $AI4.25 million at May 1994 prices. (2) The current estimate is $A20.3 million. The reason for the increase is to enable Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia to take up commercial space in the Australia Centre within Australia House which represents a major change in work. (3) None.",120
