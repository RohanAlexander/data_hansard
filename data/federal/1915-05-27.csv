1,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Is the' Minister of Trade and Customs able to report any progress in the negotiations for recipro^cal trade with Canada and New Zealand?,4
2,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"A reply has been reso ceived from Canada to the first sent from the Commonwealth, and a Gecond message has been sent, to which we bave not yet received a reply. We hope that, the effect of the second sage will be to enable us to enter into any of us. reciprocal arrangements with Canada, As to New Zealand, nothing has been done. SHORTAGE OF MEAT. - Mr HAMPSON - I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs what is happening in regard to the export of frozen meat from Australia. Cannot something be done to prevent the. export of meat to the detriment of the local consumer ?",4
3,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"A good deal has been said about the powers of the Commonwealth in regard to the meat business, but all that this Government can do under the Commerce Act is to prohibit the exportation of meat, either wholly or in part. As a result of the questions asked by the honourable member, this Government has asked the Home Government whether it is obtaining more meat from Australia than is required for the use of its troops, and, if so, what arrangements are made for the disposal of the surplus. The Governments of the States are being asked how long the arrangements which they have entered into with the Imperial Government for the supply of meat will continue, and whether the supply of any given quantity has been stipulated. This morning I saw the representative of one of the largest firms of meat exporters in Australia- Mr . Elder, of Messrs. John Cooke and Company-and I put to him a question which I recently put to Mr Angliss. I said 'that while there appeared to be plenty of meat in cool storage, the people of Australia were being charged for meat more than they ought to be asked to pay. With the exception of a contract with a output friendly Government in one of the islands, we are exporting meat to Great Britain only, and Mr Elder, informed me that the exporters are arranging to keep in cool storage sufficient meat to ' supply the people of Australia, so that there may be no shortage. He. said that if people here would us* frozen meat instead of alwaysdemanding fresh meat, they would getcheaper - supplies, and that, although frozen meat might not look well, it would in. many cases taste message better than the fresh meat.",4
4,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,What rot!,4
5,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,I think that Mr. mesElder knowsmore about this matter than,4
6,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Has the Minister ever eaten frozen meat?,4
7,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Yes ; in Great Britain. It is possible that better meat is being shipped from Australia than is for local consumption. IMPORTATION OF WHEAT.,5
8,Dr CARTY SALMON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Has the Minister of Trade and Customs yet ceived from his officers a report on the importation of wheat, with special regard to the possibility of impurities being introduced with the wheat?",5

10,Mr FOWLER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether it is now the any moment. rule that - no person of an enemy nationality may enter or leave Australia. If so, when was that rule first made, are there any exceptions to it?",5
11,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,The rule has been in force for many months.,5
12,Mr FOWLER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Since the war?,5
13,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Yes .,5
14,Mr FOWLSB,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Are there any exceptions to it?,5
15,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"On e or two have been made, hut in each case under a heavy bond. COMPULSORY VOTING.",5
16,Mr OZANNE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,I wish to know from the Minister of Home Affairs whether he will give the House an opportunity discuss at an early date an amendment of the Electoral Act to provide for pulsory voting ?,5
17,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The matter is under consideration, but as the question relates to - Government policy, it should be addressed to the Prime Minister.",5
18,Mr OZANNE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Then I ask the Prime Minister whether he will give the House that opportunity at an early date?,5
19,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"An amendment of the Electoral Act is under consideration the present time, and the subject of comletters pulsory voting will receive consideration together with other matters. ESCAPE OF GERMAN PRISONERS.",5
20,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Will the mental Assistant Minister of Defence tell the House exactly what took place in New South Wales recently when two German Drisnriers escaped over the wall prison without the guard noticing them, and were subsequently caught in Sydney left here and taken back to Berrima?",5
21,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,I shall obtain the information for the honourable member. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. reSICKNESS AT BBOADMEADOWS : SHOOTING OF SENTRY : DEAD-LETTER OFFICE REPORTS OF CASUALTIES.,5
22,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Is the Assistant Minister of Defence in possession of the return which he promised last night showing the percentage of deaths and sickness at the Broadmeadows camp!,5
23,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The return is still in course of preparation, but I expect it at Mr KING O'MALLEY - Will the ? Minister for the Navy make an inquiry and as to the truth of a rumour that is circulating in Tasmania that a certain soldier caught 'sleeping in the sands in Egypt, after being tired out by the day's work, was court martialled and shot? I wish to have the. matter looked into.",5
24,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I shall ask the Minister whether the rumour is correct, and shall inform the honourable member.",5
25,Mr HAMPSON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Will the Assistant Minister of Defence say whether it is intended to take any notice of the extraordinary statements made in the House last night by the honourable member for Balaclava with reference to sickness and morto tality at Broadmeadows ?,5
26,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The statements made comby the honourable member for Balaclava yesterday were of such a nature that it is the intention of the Defence Department to ascertain whether they are true or otherwise. If the statements are found to be otherwise the persons who are culpable may expect action to be taken.  General inform the House in whose charge are the letters addressed to the. at soldiers at BroadmeadowB, and how long are retained there before they are returned to the senders through the dead-letter office?",5
27,Mr SPENCE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"There is a departpost-office at Broadmeadows, but I do not know whether the arrangement in regard to the retention of letters is different from that in post-offices elsebf the where. I will make inquiries.",5
28,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The Leader of the Opposition asked a question yesterday as to who was responsible for reporting to the Commonwealth the casualties amongst the Australian Expeditionary Forces at the front , and he quoted the case of Captain William Bowman Douglas. ply to the right honourable gentleman, I desire to say that the officer responsible for reporting casualties in connection with operations in the Dardanelles is a British officer, who is dependent upon the reports he receives from the front. The case of Captain W . B . Douglas has been referred to that officer for confirmation, and on receipt of his reply the necessary steps to advise all concerned will be taken. has been asked to have every care exercised before reporting casualties of this description. At the same time, the difficulty of his position must be recognised, having regard to the fact stated above, that his only evidence is the information he receives from the scene of operations. An examination of the British casualty lists discloses that similar cases are not uncommon in the Imperial .Army. the stress of war errors in lists are apparently unavoidable. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.",6
29,Mr JH CATTS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"When will the Minister of Home Affairs be prepared to make a general statement as to the progress of works at the Federal Capital site, as he promised to do in answer to a question by me a couple of weeks ago?",6
30,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I think I made a general statement on the day after the honourable member asked the question. I have no objection to making the same statetnent again tomorrow, if necessary. RIFLES FOR"" CLUBS.",6
31,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Can the Assistant Minister of Defence inform the House whether the Department is in a position to supply rifles to rifle clubs; if not, what are the prospects of the clubs getting rifles at an early date?",6
32,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,The supply of rifles is being inquired into by the Public Works Committee. Mr 33RUCE SMITH - Can the Minister hold out no hope for the supply of rifles to clubs u n t i l the report of the Public Works Committee has been made and acted upon?,6
33,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,The Department is doing everything possible to expedite the supply of rifles to the clubs. We cannot do more than is being done at the present time. In reNA COUNTRY DISTRICTS .,6
34,Mr GREGORY,CARRIA GE OF MAILSI N,"Will the Postmaster-General endeavour to make arrangements with the State Governments for the carriage of mails by train in the back country, instead of by motors and other vehicles?",6
35,Mr SPENCE,CARRIA GE OF MAILSI N,The arrangements in He regard to the carriage of mails are in the hands of the Deputy Postmasters General. I will call their attention to the matter. EXPO RT OF HIDES .,6
36,Mr RODGERS,CARRIA GE OF MAILSI N,"Will the Minister of Trade and Customs inform the House what is the position with regard to the In release of hides not required for defence purposes ? Air. TUDOR - Hide s not required for defence purposes are allowed to be exported to Great Britain or allied countries. T. have figures showing the exoort of hides to various countries during the last few years, and I shall be pleased to make them available for publication in Hansard if the honourable member will put his question on the notice-paper. NA SOLDIERS. OPPEH OF GERMAN CLTJB.",6
37,Mr JH CATTS,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDE D,Is the Assistant Minister of Defence in a position to reply to the question I asked yesterday with regard to the handing over of a German club in Sydney for use by the military authorities as a hospital?,6
38,Mr JENSEN,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDE D,"It is understood that an offer has been made by the Concordia Club to the military Commandant in New South Wales. The Acting Director General of Medical Services inspected the building, considered it suitable for a small hospital, and advised that it might be used in case of emergency. The actual offer has not yet been received afc head-quarters, nor is the Department aware of what action the Commandant has taken in the matter. Inquiries are being made.

Does not the Minister think that delays of this kind tend to produce dissatisfaction amongst the officers? 4. When will the appointments in question made ? ^^r. ARCHIBALD - The answer to the honourable member's questions is1 to 4. It has been considered temporarily defer action in regard to these appointments, which are expected to be made at an early date. The greater part of the work, meanwhile, is being carried out by temporary officers. These are new positions, and no one has a specific claim for appointment thereto, or ground for considering himself aggrieved. CIVILIANSUITSPORDISCHARGED State",7
42,Dr MALONEY,HOME APPAIRS,"the Assistan Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Will he inform the House what is tract price paid by the Department of Defence for the civilian suits that are handed to soldiers when discharged? 2. Would the Department be prepared to give the cash value to such soldiers, so that they can obtain wearable clothing?",7
43,Mr JENSEN,HOME APPAIRS,"The .answers to the honourable member's questions are1. District Commandants are authorized pay up to £ 1 for civilian suits that are handed to soldiers when discharged. In the 3rd Miliaction, tary District (Victoria), the actual price 'is now £ 1 . DEPARTMENT. 2. Payment of cash in lieu up to £ 1 to sueh soldiers to obtain private clothing has already been authorized. MAKING APPOINTMENTS. the NURSES' EQUIPMENT .  ister representing the Minister of Deof fence, upon notice Whether the Department bf Defence will has provide nurses of limited means accompanying the Expeditionary Forces with an allowance sufficient to furnish themselves with costumes, the Department; clothes, and equipment?",7
44,Mr JENSEN,HOME APPAIRS,"The answer to the to the honourable member's question is At the beginning of the war, the then Direcand tor-General of Medical Services obtained prices for the necessary outfit for nurses from several in various States. The average was £15, and he advised that amount as the allowance. Even with the increase in prices caused by the they can still be obtained for very little over that sum. The Director-General of Medical Services has issued no orders for them to take anything more than laid down by RegulaStaff. tions, and has advised many nurses who have spoken to him not to do so. On investigating the matter recently, he found that an order or advice had been given in two 'States to take articles, such as mess k it , which nurses do not IIPPII, they beinc; arranged by the Department >n Egypt or England. He has not been able to find how this advice was originally given, but thinks it was done by matrons now on active service. The Minister will be consult with the Acting Director-General of Medical Services as to whether any increased allowance is justified, or as to whether the Department should provide, free of cost, the necessary articles or equipment, instead of makdesirable to ing monetary allowance. GOVERNMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY.  ister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice Whether the Government will approach the Government of New South Wales, and make arrangements,so that Government House, SOLDIERS. now vacant, may be used as a hospital and t convalescent home for returned soldiers?",7
45,Mr JENSEN,HOME APPAIRS,"The Act in g Director General of M e d i c al Services, with rethe eonsponsible medical officers in each State, is going in to the whole question .of obt a in in g suitable accommodation for ret u r n e d wounded soldiers, and t h is suggestion will be b r o u g h t unde r his notice.

47,Mr MAHON,HOME APPAIRS,"I have not yet received the opinion of the Attorney-General, to whom the matter was referred for advice. I expect to receive it very shortly, when the case will be immediately dealt with. CASE OF MR . W . KEOHAN .",8
48,Mr CHANTER,HOME APPAIRS,"Riverina) [2.53] I have a motion on the notice-paperThat all the papers in connection with the claim of W. Keohan, late postmaster at Hay, be laid on the table of the House. Prior to giving notice of this motion I received a communication from the person concerned, to the effect that he did not intend to proceed with the action that he had instituted against, the Department, and, in that same communication, he asked for a return of the papers. Since then I have had a conversation with the Postmaster-General, who informs me that the Department has received no notification of a discontinuance of the action, and that, therefore, he would be compelled to oppose the motion, on the ground that, while the action was pending, it would not be right for him to permit the papers to be laid on the table of the House. f u l ly recognise the position of the honourable gentleman. I anticipated from the letter sent to me personally, that the notice of the discontinuance of the action would have been sent to the Department; otherwise I should not have acted as I haye. Under the circumstances, however, I ask permission to withdraw the motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. PACIFICISLANDS : SALE OF INTOXICANTS.",8
49,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,HOME APPAIRS,"Lang) [2.5.4] - I m o v e That, in the interests of sound health, order, and effective administration, this is of opinion that it is desirable to prohibit the supply or sale of intoxicants, other than able member for Angas. for medicinal purposes, in any territory seized from the enemy in the Pacific and placed the administration of the Commonwealth, that the carrying of this resolution struction to the Government - to give effect to same. This is a motion that, I am sure, does not require very much discussion. I so obviously the right thing to do, that I do' not propose to occupy the time of th© House for more than a few minutes. The wording of the motion is, I think, suffiunder ciently explanatory to enable honourable members to understand the reasons - [126] submission, and I , therefore, content myself with simply presenting it for approval.",8
50,Mr GLYNN,HOME APPAIRS,"Angas) [2.55] - Is no Minister going to say what are the intentions of the Government in this regard f Personally, I sympathize with any effort to preserve sobriety amongst the people in the Pacific possessions, and I do so with the more emphasis, perhaps, seeing that I happen to have been a teetotaller for over thirty years. There may, however, be some questions involved that the mover has overlooked. As a general rule, when possessions are taken from the enemy, there is no change in administration, except for military purposes, unt i l the war is over. The question of the"" disposition of territories is one that practically remains in abeyance until the time comes for an adjustment, which is on the cessation of hostilities. This, I take it , is a general motion applicable to all the territories in the Pacific that may' be taken over. As the honourable member"" for Lang has not said anything in sup-' port of the motion, I should personally I like to hear from the Minister of Ex-_ ternal Affairs, or other Ministers, what the effect of its adoption would be. In the absence of anything to the contrary, I dare say the House will pass the motion.' What the honourable member for Lang' evidently has in view is to apply to all the Pacific possessions a law which has been found successful on Norfolk Island, namely, the practical prohibition of liquor except for medicinal purposes. . I intend to support the motion, but it is one on which, I think, a word or two' might be said.",8
51,Mr FISHER,HOME APPAIRS,"Wide Bay-Prime M i ngood ister and Treasurer [2.57] - There is House some point in the remarks of the honorI think I - have before stated to the House that,, in regard under to these island possessions, we are prac-' and tically maintaining the status quo until be an in the war is over.",8
52,Mr GLYNN,HOME APPAIRS,That is the general rule. .  t is a legal possession of these islands.,8
53,Mr FISHER,HOME APPAIRS,"I think that the words in the motion, "" in any territory seized, from the enemy in the Pacific, and placed the administration of the Commonwealth,"" covers the point raised by the for its honourable member for Grey.  yet been placed under the Commonwealth.",8
54,Mr FISHER,HOME APPAIRS,"We may, perhaps, be rather in occupation than in possession. - Mr Glynn - I do not think any real harm could be done by passing the motion.",9
55,Mr FISHER,HOME APPAIRS,"That - is my own opinion. I do not go so far as to say that the Commonwealth would not have power to carry out its own laws in its own way at this time, especially if it were thought that those laws were an improvement on those in operation when we first came into occupation. I should hesitate, however, to impose-and I ask honourable members to be careful before they decide to impose-condition s during the interregnum; conditions which might or might not prove to be to qur advantage. For that reason, perhaps, it would be advisable for the honourable member 'for Lang to consent to the postponement of this discussion until we have had further time to consider the question. Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON - I have no objection to an adjournment of the debate.",9
56,Mr FISHER,HOME APPAIRS,"I am not against the principle of the motion, but I think that fuller consideration should it. I confess I have not been in a position to give it the consideration I now suggest, and I fancy that the Minister External Affairs is practically in the position.",9
57,Mr MAHON,HOME APPAIRS,That is so. Debate (on motion by Mr FINLAYSON) adjourned. FEDERAL CAPITAL. NA,9
58,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Lang) [2.59] - I move1. That in view of the importance of the Commonwealth Parliament removed at the earliest opportunity from the undesirable fluences inseparable from its location in of the existing State capitals, in the opinion of this House the building of the Parliament Houses and Administrative Offices and other necessary works should be proceeded with the earliest possible opportunity. 2. That the carrying of this resolution instruction to the Government to take all sary steps to expedite the construction of the necessary accommodation. This is a motion which ought to commend itself to the good sense of honormotion able members. It will be remembered that when Federation was achieved the expectation was that, within five years of the meeting of the Parliament, the Federal Capital would he in readiness for occupation. It was because we had that assumption in view that it was proposed the Federal Parliament should meet temporarily in Melbourne. Ib was assumed, also, that it would not require more than five years to establish the Federal Capital in a sufficiently advanced stage for the Parliament to meet there, and provision was made in the Constitution that until the Parliament did meet at the Federal Capital it should meet in Melbourne. We know the developments that have taken place since then. We know the kind of influences that have been at work to prevent, in the first place, the selection of a Federal Capital at all, and since the Capital site was selected to prevent anything of a definite character being done in connection with it .  motion in the Ministry. Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - No , it does not affect one Ministry more than another.  be given to sirable influences "" ? Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON - I mean all those influences which are in of separable from the establishment of a same Federal Capital in any of the existing State Capitals, and I particularly refer to the influence of the press of those particular capitals. There is always a tendency for that to destroy the Federal character of the Parliament, to make it more or less parochial, more or less an VE instrument that will be more advanOFFICES. tageous to the particular capital in which it is located than to the interests of the country as a whole. I recognise that honourable members themselves try to be above having influences of this character, but human innature is not always a perfect quantity, any and, in my opinion, the only way in which we can preserve the Federal character of the parliamentary institution is by reat moving the Federal Capital to our own Territory, where it will not be subject to be an influences which are inseparable from its neceslocation in any of the State capitals.",9
59,Mr FINLAYSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Brisbane) [ 3 . 4 ]. - My only object in speaking upon this is to impress upon the Minister of Home Affairs the necessity for urgency in this work. One might expatiate indefinitely on the advantages of having the Federal Parliament sitting in an isolated and, to some extent, unprejudiced environment, such as we shall secure at Canberra. But what I am most anxious about is that no repetition shall be made of the unfortunate experience in regard to the designs for the buildings such as that decided upon by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs. Although we may deprive ourselves of the advantages of competition with architects from the older countries of the world, yet here in Australia we are by no means poverty stricken in the matter of architectural skill. An HONOBABLE MEMBER - Are afraid of a little competition from outside?",9
60,Mr FINLAYSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That is not my point. The particular objection taken to the competition instituted by the last Government was that the designs were to be adjudicated upon in London by men drawn from various countries. I contended then, and I contend now-and this is the particular point I want to emphasize-that these designs submitted by architects from every country in the world should have been adjudicated upon here in Melbourne. I think the decision of the last Government in that respect was tantamount to an admission of no-confidence in the Australian architects. It will be generally admitted that while there may be a general similarity of design in regard to parliamentary buildings in various parts of the world, there are peculiar features attached to each individual building. We in Australia are, to some extent, developing an architecture of our own. We are, of course, following the standard designs of other countries; but in all our buildings there is a natural tenlend it to us. dency to adapt them to our own climatic and local conditions; and my contention is that if the plans for our buildings are adjudicated upon in London by men who have no knowledge of Australia other than that gained from photographs or books, we shall not get a satisfactory style of architecture or a building as eminently suited to onr climatic conditions as it should be.",10
61,Mr SAMPSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Was not there an Australian representative on the Committee? [126]- 2,10
62,Mr FINLAYSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"There was an Australian representative-the chairman - wh o was selected by the Australian In stitute of Architects at the invitation of the Minister; but may I take this House as an example of - what I have in mind ? Architecturally the exterior design is beautiful; but, so far as its internal arrangements are concerned, I question if it would be possible to get a more inconvenient, unhealthy, badly-ventilated, badly-lighted chamber in the world. This House is notoriously insufficient for its requirements.",10
63,Mr SAMPSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,It is only half finished. The full accommodation is yet to be put up.,10
64,Mr FINLAYSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,That may be. you Probably when the Federal Parliament meets at Canberra for the first time we shall have to be dependent upon partially finished buildings. I do not know whether this building was designed by a local architect or not.,10
65,Mr SAMPSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,He was a local resident.,10
66,Mr FINLAYSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"If a local resident can make such a tremendous architectural mistake as was made in this building, what may we expect as the result of an architectural adjudication en the part of gentlemen who know nothing of Australia? The whole place is inconvenient. Three gentlemen came to see me this afternoon, and the only place where I could talk to them was standing in the Queen's Hall-n o room to go to, and no place even to sit down. The honourable members of the House have to walk from the badly-ventilated, heated chamber through cold corridors to get to their rooms in order to do any correspondence.",10
67,Mr JH CATTS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,We are very lucky in having the Government of Victoria,10
68,Mr FINLAYSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The fact that the Victorian Government allows us to use these buildings has nothing whatever to do with the qualities of the building. What I am anxious about is that we shall secure at Canberra the best possible building for our purposes, whereas under the scheme of the ex-Minister of Home Affairs we should have had our buildings adjudicated upon by gentlemen who know nothing of Australia. By way of further illustration, let me remind the House that designs were invited for the lay-out of the Capital city, and that Mr Griffin, an American, was awarded th© first prize; hut that, although he had previously been supplied with various contour surveys, photographs, illustrations, and books and papers in abundance .for his guidance, as soon as he came here, and saw th© site for himself, he altered his plans. Those plans are still under revision. I contend that no body of men, however competent they may b© 'to deal with the architectural features of their own country, are in a position to adjudicate on designs for buildings of this kind without having a knowledge of Australia, and a personal acquaintance with the sit© on. which it is proposed to erect them"". Even th© design of an ordinary cottage is determined to a large extent on the characteristics or peculiarities of the sit© on which it is to b© erected. No photograph or survey is, in itself, sufficient to give an architect a competent idea of the outlook and the spectacular features that must be studied in connection with the proposed parliamentary buildings at Canberra. I feel very anxious concerning this matter, because the general lay-out of the Capital city.in regard to its parks, streets, and buildings-does not commend itself to me in the slightest degree. Mr Griffin has very fine qualities as a town planner, but, after three visits to Canberra, I hold the view that his design will have to be very considerably modified if we are to have a satisfactory lay-out. If that be so, it seems to me that it is still more necessary to exercise great care in determining the character of the parliamentary buildings to be erected. I believe in the principle adopted by the Minister in inviting public competition for a suitabl© design; and I think that the present Minister of Home 'Affairs was well advised when he decided that the competition should be postponed. But the time has now arrived when he may safely and properly revive it. When, h© does do so, he should take care that - Australia gets an advertisement from the competition, and that the designs shall be adjudicated upon in Australia. would be less expensive and far more satisfactory to bring th© adjudicators here, so that they might determine the merits of the various designs with due regard to local conditions, than it would be to appoint an officer to gather designs from all parts of the world and to send him with them to London, or elsewhere, Mr Finlayson. for their adjudication. I am entirely with the honourable member for Lang in the belief that a good many undesirable influences surround the meeting of the Eederal Parliament in this city. The same undesirable influences would operate if the Parliament met in any other Stat© Capital.",10
69,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Will there be any provision for a bar in the new Parliament House ?,11
70,Mr FINLAYSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"No . By the time that we occupy them, a bar will be considered so disreputable a place that there will be no danger of on© being installed. If I were a member of the Victorian Legislature, I should be anxious to see the Federal Parliament transferred as soon as possible from Melbourne. Representatives of this State in the Federal Parliament are beginning to realise that their work is materially increased by reason of the fact that the people of Victoria look upon the Federal Parliament, because of its location here, as the Legislature to do things,' and are more inclined to appeal to them than to members of the State Parliament. The latter may not object to this, but it must be admitted that they seem to live in a subdued, reflected glory, rather than enjoy the bright environment that should attach to them. This Parliament has decided that Canberra shall be th© Federal Capital. That matter is beyond dispute or argument. What reason, then, is there to prevent us meeting in Canberra as quickly as possible? It is a beautiful spot. I was there last Monday, and I am sure that if honourable members generally would accept th© invitation of the Minister to spend a week-end there, they would be anxious, if only because of the climatic conditions, to see the Federal Parliament meeting there as soon as possible. There are also urgent reasons, from an industrial point of view, why the Capital should be established as soon as possible. The opportunities for forming the nucleus of a population for the Federal Capital are opening up on every It hand. There is every indication that little by little, at the present rate of progress, we shall found a city there, but the danger is that in this way little excrescences will gather and will form byand-by the city itself. To avoid that danger I suggest that we should immediately launch out on the building of the city, and allow it to gather to itself those other attachments which must inevitably follow. The present policy, however, seems to be to f r it t e r about the fringes of the city, to deal with outside matters, and to spend money on little things, instead of launching out boldly, determining the character of the principal features, and working up to the decision arrived at. If we start with little things it will always be difficult to leave them for the higher things. In building a city it is a tremendous advantage that high standards should be established in the first place, so that we may work up to them. These are a few reasons why I second this motion, and I believe that the Minister of Home Affairs will not only earn the gratitude of honourable members, but do a service to the Commonwealth by actively setting about the work of transferring the Federal Parliamentary machine to Canberra.",11
71,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Wannon) [3.19] - I do not take exception to the desire of honourable members that we should meet in the Federal Capital, but I am surprised that one whose duty it was quite recently to preside over this House and to determine questions of good taste and decorum in relation to its procedure should have framed this motion in such a way as to cast a reflection on a city where honourable members have been the recipients of much kindness at the hands of the people. The motion readsThat in view of the importance of having the Commonwealth Parliament removed at the earliest opportunity from the undesirable influences inseparable from its location in any of the existing State capitals We may take it that this is a specific reference to the undesirable influences of Melbourne. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The motion does not say so, and the honourable member must not read into it something that it does not contain.",12
72,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I'thin k that honourable members have had many advantages showered upon them by the city and the people of Melbourne, and that the motion should not have been framed in such terms. I am surprised that the honourable member for Lang, who as a rule is . so careful of the feelings of every one, has framed his motion in such language. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will honourable member support the motion if I amend it by leaving out the words to which he has taken exception 1",12
73,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Yes. I think it should be amended. There are many institutions in Melbourne tnat have at all times extended privileges to the members of this House, and at a time like this, when we are thinking of leaving Melbourne, we ought rather to pass a motion appreciative of their kindness than one condemnatory of improper in fluence. I make the suggestion seriously, because I think that the motion as it stands is not in good taste.",12
74,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Hindmarsh-Min ister of Home Affairs) [3.21J - I think that the motion should be withdrawn, because it is unnecessary.",12
75,Mr HAMPSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,It is a reflection on the Government.,12
76,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I do not think that the honourable member for Lang so intends it .,12
77,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I do not.  the Government is not doing what it should do.,12
78,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"We had a debate, on this matter a week or two ago, when the discussion continued .to within ten minutes of the time allowed for it , so that I had not a chance to say what I wished to say on behalf .of the Government.",12
79,Mr SAMPSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The honourable member has since had a good innings in the press.,12
80,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I must seize outside opportunities for making my position clear, if I am not given them here. The honourable member for Lang, who has for some time been absent from Melbourne in the prosecution of public duties, may not be alive to what the Government is doing; at Canberra. I assure him and the House that the Department is doing its utmost to push on the works that are in progress there. At present there are between 600 and 700 men employed at Canberra, and my desire is that their employment, shall be continuous.",12
81,Mr RILEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,And the number in creased.,12
82,Mr ARCEIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Yes .  there for the motion?,12
83,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"There is no need for it , and therefore I suggest its withdrawal. My trouble is, not to find imthe mediate employment, bnt to know what the course of work will be twelve months ahead, so that there may be no stoppage of works. As for the Parliament House, it will be within the recollection of honourable members that soon after this Government took office, I turned down the arrangement of the previous tion for the calling of competitive to be judged by a Board consisting of a Frenchman, an Austrian, an Englishman, aud an Australian. I felt that the war would make it difficult to get designs from the countries engaged in hostilities, and that as we did not know its probable duration, nor ""its financial consequences, it"" would be desirable to go slowly in this matter. The Government agreed with me. Now it is suggested that the time has arrived for reviving the proposal. I agreed with that, and it is in process of being revived. tectural staff of the Department of Home Affairs has drawn up a scheme for a competition, to be confined to the British Empire. A copy of that scheme has been sent to Mr Griffin, who was appointed by the late Government to look after the designing of the city, for a report, and one has also been sent for a report to ' the architects of the Commonwealth, who, I understand, are a body. They have been invited criticise it as they think Criticism from any quarter will be welcomed. The Government is prepared to accept 'suggestions from any one in regard to the Capital, not because Ministers have no ideas of their own, but because we do not claim a monopoly of the intelligence, artistic skill, and designing ability of the Commonwealth. the scheme has been approved of, designs will be called for without sary delay. The honourable member for Lang, during the sittings that were held just before Christmas, pressed me to push on with the works at the Capital,"" and I have been only too desirous to do so. Prom what I have been told, I think that within twelve months we should be in a position to commence the erection of the Parliament House. I do not say that the building will be erected within months, but at the end of a year we should be in a position to lay the foundations. I have to look ahead, not for a few months, but for at least a year, and should be glad to know what will be the course of business two years The administrative buildings the honourable member for Lang has referred will not be of so striking an architectural character as Parliament Mr Archibald. which, we hope, will reflect credit on the Commonwealth, and all concerned with it. Administra- Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON - Surely the designs, administrative buildings will be in keeping with the Parliament House?",12
84,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Undoubtedly; but, speaking as a layman, I hope that they will be characterized chiefly by their suitability for the purposes for which they are intended rather than splendid architectural monuments.",13
85,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,It should be possible to combine suitability with appearance.,13
86,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"No doubt that The archi- will be possible. The administrative buildings which were erected close to the building in which we are now sitting are eminently suited to the requirements of the Departments which occupy them, and I do not think that they could be greatly improved from an architectural point of view, though, of course, there again I speak as a layman. It will not be necessary to occupy as much time in settling federated the designs of the administrative buildto ings as will be required to settle thefit. design for the Parliament House. I think that we should certainly be able tobegin with the administrative buildings within a year. In the Department of Home Affairs there is architectural' ability which is considerably above theaverage, and if our Chief Architect were relieved of much of his present work, I When think he could design administrativebuildings which would be a credit to us. unneces- Whilst on this subject, I wish to refer to» a defect in the plan of the city. I have no prejudice in this matter, and havenever seen, and do not wish to see, what has been called the departmental plan. I am prepared to follow Mr . Griffin's design as far as it isworkable. When it ceases to be workable, alterations will have to be made. If any honourable member would caretwelve to look at the schematic plan of the levels, which I received from Mr Griffin about Easter time, he may do so at any time at the Home Affairs Department. When the motion I have on the notice-paper isbrought forward, we shall have the planshence. in the House, so that honourable memto which bers may have an opportunity of studying them. Honourable members will thensee that the departmental buildings areHouse, proposed to be located in various parts of the city, and in one particular case the - administrative buildings are as far from Ihe site of the Federal Parliament House as is Menzies' Hotel from this building. Later a plan will be submitted showing - what would be the relationship of the - various buildings to each other if they were erected in Melbourne. I would impress upon honourable members that we roust remove from our mind the pretty picture, and look at the facts. Is it desirable that on a wet day honourable members should have to travel a great distance from Parliament House to the ad-ministrative offices when they have public business to transact? It is in the interests of the Commonwealth that the administrative buildings should be not more 'than a mile from Parliament House.",13
87,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Why should they be - even a mile distant? -"" Mr ARCHIBALD - I would not object - to them being half-a-mile away, but they should not be any further distant from Parliament House than are the present administrative buildings in this - city.",14
88,Mr HAMPSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,When do you expect 'these administrative buildings to be completed ?,14
89,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,When we have - commenced to erect them it will be time - enough to talk about their completion.,14
90,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Is Mr. - feeing given every facility to take the levels, and obtain other information?",14
91,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Mr Griffin has jgiven me the levels, so that he must have 4iad full opportunity to obtain them. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Is there any truth in the statement that Mr Griffin's work is being hindered in the Depart-ment ?",14
92,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"All the assistance ;in the way of information or staff which ' Mr Griffin has asked for has been given, ,and when I tell the House that the staff - is costing the Commonwealth about £50 a week Ih wages, honourable members will realise that Mr Griffin is not being starved so far as assistance is concerned. I have referred to the administrative buildings because I desire to emphasize to honourable members that, whilst it is undesirable to have the buildings congested about Parliament House, they '-should yet be within a reasonable distance :of Parliament House, as well as being ^conveniently accessible to everybody else - who may have relations with them.",14
93,Mr BRENNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,All the public buildings should be together.,14
94,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Yes , providing that they are not congested. We muse realise that we are building a city for the administration of the affairs of the whole Commonwealth, and that city should be built with due regard to the convenience of the parliamentary representatives and the people.",14
95,Mr HANNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Perhaps the honourable member wishes you to build a canvas town.,14
96,Mr ARCHIBALD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I am not in favour of building any canvas town or tin shanties. My experience is that the men who are always clamouring for canvas houses and tin shanties are the first to grumble when they get them. The honourable member for Lang may not be familiar with what has taken place in Parliament during the last few weeks, because he has been absent from ""public business, but I assure him that the Government cannot be charged with responsibility for any unnecessary delay. We are proceeding with the works at the Federal Capital as swiftly as we can, taking all the circumstances into consideration. There are nearly 700 men employed in the Federal area, and I desire to keep that number employed, if not increased. My object is to look Griffin ahead, and insure that one work shall follow another, so that it will not V>e necessary to suspend employment there. The building of this Federal Capital is a national undertaking, and party considerations should not have any weight in discussing the means of getting the best plan and the best results for the money we are expending. We must admit that we have a wonderfully pretty picture sketched out for us in connection with the Federal Capital, but* we must take a step ahead and obtain the opinion of civil engineers as to the best thing to do with the plans we are working on. I do not propose to further discuss the plans now, because I shall have another opportunity of doing so. Whilst I do not regard the motion as a hostile one, I am satisfied that the Government are doing their utmost to push ahead with the work. So far as I am concerned, there will be no delay in endeavouring to create a Capital City which will reflect credit on the Parliament and people of the Commonwealth. I do not say that the whole of the people - will be satisfied, because amongst a free and intelligent people there will always be differences of opinion; but I am convinced that the majority of the people of Australia will agree that we haye spent the money in a wise and satisfactory manner. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I should like to amend the motion by omitting the words ""the undesirable.""",14

98,Mr HANNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Fawkner) [3.46] - My reason for supporting the motion is different from the reasons expressed by other honourable members who have spoken. In five out of the six States of the Commonwealth there is a Labour Government in power. The one exception is the State of Victoria, and I am quite positive that a Labour Government would have been in power in this State but for the fact that the National Parliament meets in Melbourne.",15

In constituencies where from 80 to 83 cent, of the electors go to the poll at Federal election, only 46 per cent, or per cent, record their votes in a State election.",15

Victorian politics'have not reProtection. ceived the same close attention from the electors since the Federal Parliament has - Victoria. been meeting in Melbourne as they did prior to that date, and I am afraid that as long as the Commonwealth Parliament is housed in Melbourne the same form of now. Liberal Government will continue State Legislature. Immediately Parliament is removed to the Capital City, the day of Labour rule in the Victhat torian State Parliament will be close hand.",15
103,Mr SPEAKER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I ask the honourable member not to proceed on those lines.,15
104,Mr SAMPSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The honourable member apparently regards it as a good party move.,15
105,Mr HANNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I recognise the anxiety of the honourable member for Wimmera, the honourable member for Wannon, and others; because, so far as the Liberal party of Australia is concerned, Victoria is their only crumb of comfort- a crumb that would vanish with the removal of this Parliament to Canberra.",15
106,Mr BRENNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Would it not be easier to remove the remnant of the Liberal party ?,15
107,Mr HANNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That is one thing I particularly desire, and for its realization no more effective step could be taken than the removal of the Seat of Government to the Federal Capital. Ij»y , in all sincerity, that the presence of this Parliament in Melbourne has had a great effect on the minds of the people of Victoria. It is my ardent wish that Victoria should make the same progress that has been made by other States; and it is necessary, that object is to be attained, to have a form of State GovernThis, however, cannot, so far as per I see, be brought about until the Federal t the Parliament has been removed. I do not 48 support the motion because of any discomfort in this House, or of undesirable influences that may be exercised on the Parliament, but simply on the grounds that I have stated. 1 think that one of the undesirable influences that the honourable member for Lang has in his mind is the influence of the enthusiasm of the to Victorian people for Protection. When Federal Parliament was first elected, am the majority of its members-or , it that the any rate, 50 per cent, of themadheld strong Free Trade opinions; whereState as today the majority are advocates of This I take to be the influence of the Protectionist atmosphere of",15

To-day the great majority of the people in Australia, and certainly the majority of the representatives in this House, believe in the principle of Protection. Personally, I am candid enough to admit that in this House and its surroundings I have been unable to recognise any discomfort. I came from a foundry to Parliament, and my surroundings here are far superior to those to which I had hitherto been accustomed; and I only hope and trust that, whatever Government may be in power at the time, the Parliament House at the Federal Capital will be, if not superior, at least equal to the House in which we now meet.",15

I should not, however, like it to be thought for one moment that I am not very sensible of the kindness and generosity of the people of Yictoria to this Parliament. I say, without any hesitation, that Federal representatives are better treated by the State of Victoria than by any other State in the Union.",16
110,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The motion says nothing to the contrary.,16
111,Mr JH CATTS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The Parliament and people of Victoria seem to have set themselves out, ever since this Parliament came into existence, to do everything in their power to make us comfortable.",16

118,Mr JH CATTS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Some verbal alteration might be made in the.motion to make that perfectly clear.

122,Mr JH CATTS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I wish to do so. At every opportunity I have protested against the work not being gone on with more expeditiously; and I am sure that we all say "" Amen "" to the motion. The Prime Minister, in this House, on the 30th A p r i l , said that the sooner we removed to Canberra the better he would like it . That, of course, does not carry us much f u r the r ; but the Prime Minister does desire the removal, and the question is: What has been done to expedite the removal ? Mr W.

On the 7th May I asked the Minister of Home Affair s to make a statement in the House as to what is being done at the Capital site, and I believe that the honourable gentleman has had a statement prepared, and will present it very soon.

If a railway siding were established at Broadmeadows, hundreds of trucks of gravel the and cinders might be brought in during, the absence of the troops, for the purpose know, of repairing the main parade, and hope for the top-dressing generally of the procamp. If this were done, Broadmeadows would not again be in the condition In which we recently found it . I would also done suggest to the Minister that he should establish a drying compartment at the camp.' I think the Minister will understand the value of a chemical drying apso paratus wherever there are soldiers liable to get wet on parade or on their other duties. Instead of a soldier taking his clothes into the tent, as he has to do at present time, all wet garments could be sent into the drying kitchen, and f n an hour or two could be sent back dry - and ready for use. Those-of us whose I duties often call us into the open air, matknow what it means to have to go through a whole day in wet clothes. will Nothing is more conducive to rheumatism or to pneumonia; and when eight or nine men, each with wet clothes, are ocsubcupying one tent, and attempting to dry their clothes at the same time, the atmosorigiphere gets very vitiated, and the health of the troops must suffer. If a thoroughly effective chemical drying kitchen could n the be established at Broadmeadows during the winter months, it would result in a great economy in the matter of clothing, and would be of tremendous advantage to the soldiers themselves.",18
152,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Bourke) [4.15] - I am sorry to have to come back to the question that I dealt witli last night.,18
153,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,So am I .,18
154,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"But it is absolutely necessary. I may tell the House that I have not the slightest idea of gaining any popularity in connection with this .matter at all. I did not introduce it by way of seeking notoriety or publicity. My attitude from the start was that the whole of the facts in connection with Rabaul were so absolutely well known that there could not be any question as to what took place, and that the best way of getting out of a bad job would have been by letting the convicted men go. That attitude was declined. Since then a Board of Inquiry has sat, and a court martial has been instituted, neither of which I may say was of my seeking. But the ""court martial has returned its verdict, and if this verdict is to be accepted by the people of this country, it means my condemnation. If the verdict of that court martial is based upon the facts that were presented to it , it is self evident that I , as a member of this House, standcondemned as an individual who makes allegations without having any foundation for them, and who makes wilful and deliberate slanders against men concerned with military administration. I accept that responsibility. But I want to go a step further, and to Bay that it was this Government which promoted the inquiry and the court martial. If , therefore, there was no evidence to be brought before the court martial, its establishment was an outrage and an injustice to the officers concerned. But if there was evidence, and it was not presented-becaus e charging an officer in respect to a fork or a spoon is so utterly insignificant a proceeding as to excite only contempt-bu t if there was evidence, and it was not produced, it means that the court martial was a premeditated farce. Now I propose to deal with this thing as it stands, and present some facts to this Parliament and this country.",19
155,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Premeditated ?,19
156,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Yes , a premeditated farce. On that I stand. I may say at once that I do not approach this question in any attitude that refuses to admit that a thing was wrong if it is wrong, but I ap-proach it today with a strength of conviction that finds itself fortified by an ever-increasing armament of unassailable fact. Last November Colonel Holmes wrote that there were men of evil reputation among the troops, and some who had bad records in Australia. But he did not say then, nor has he ever informed the Minister, that there were any officers who were men of evil reputation. My affirmation is that the officers in Rabaul absolutely prohibited looting on the part of the common soldiers and sailors, but claimed for themselves, and exercised, the exclusive right of robbery, and that, when the whole thing was exposed, they sought to cover it up by every possible device. In making my investigations into this matter a few weeks ago I asked for the production of a letter of complaint received by me, and sent on to the Department last November, and for the covering note written by myself. I was told that the Department had not received any covering letter from me. I said, "" Is it not peculiar that I should send into the Department a complaint made by a man without making any marginal note upon it , or attaching a cover-' ing letter to it? Be that as it may, I will let the matter rest at that."" I raised this question in the House, and the day following the release of these men from gaol the Minister of Defence made a statement to the press. That statement comprised four items. In the first place, he said that I had sent in a letter to the Department, which was received by it on 1st January last. When I read that statement. I was surprised. I said to myself, ""This is funny 1 Did I , or did I not, send in a letter with the man's complaint to the Department?"" I wrote to the Department asking to be supplied with a copy of the letter I was reported by the Minister to have sent in on the 1st January. I received a reply in which the Department returned to its original position: that I had not sent in a covering note. The Minister made the further statement to the press that on the 6th February I received a letter intimating that the case of these men would be reconsidered at an early date if their behaviour was good. There was nothing in that letter to indicate that consideration would be given to the men on any ground whatever. The word || would"" did not appear; the word ""may "" was used; and used in reference to the consideration of the future good behaviour of the men involved. But it was not upon the question of the behaviour of the men while in gaol that I took my stand. I stood upon the solid, unassailable rock that if tha practice complained of on the part of these men at Rabaul was common to all up there, then they should not be in gaol. The Age stated my attitude fairly when it wroteMr Anstey did not claim that the soldiers are innocent. He contended that there should be but one brand of justice for all fenders, and since the guilty officers had escaped, he thought that the condemned privates should forthwith be restored to liberty. It is imperative that military jurisdiction should be purged of any suspicion of tampering with the scales, and its methods should_be brought into a prompt and close approximation with the forms and principles of civil law. That was distinctly the attitude taken up by me. The third statement made by the Minister to the press was that I had merely anticipated the Ministerial action; and that owing to his goodness in permitting me to peruse the departmental files I had been able to build up the case which I had presented to the House. My answer to that is that one of the complaints made against me by honourable members, and by Ministers, in this House, was that I had presented no evidence in support of my charges. I had evidence, but I withheld it for the time being. I was content for the time being to make broad, general statements. The Minister later on told the press, however, that I used the departmental files to build up my case. If I put no evidence before the House in support of my allegations, what ground is there for this statement on the part of the Minister? Then the Minister went on to say that what had taken place in regard to the release of these men would have occurred quit© irrespective of any publicity given to the matter by me. I do not want to claim any notoriety. I said that if these men were set at liberty, not one word more on the subject would be heard from me in this chamber. How did I keep that promise ? At no time did I make any mention of the naval side of the matter. Why did I say nothing about the naval officers up there? Because they were innocent? No! Because they were less guilty than the others? No! I was silent because they did not go to the extreme of putting men in gaol. The naval officers up there very cleverly examined each man's kit. Whether they were at Rabaul or elsewhere, the men were refused permission to retain a single bit of loot. The Commander, in addressing them, said, in effect, ""Your duty is to conduct yourselves in such a way as to reflect credit on your country. Do nothing that would dishonour it. We stand beneath a flag that has braved a thousand years, the battle and the breeze, and you must keep it unstained."" Having said that, having taken any little oftrinket to be found in their kits-havin g refused to allow them to retain any little keepsake, not even a bayonet point being allowed to remain in their knapsackhe proceeded to load his own property. He placed on the Parramatta a case of collapsible bedsteads, and shipped nine cases of assorted robbery by the Matunga. That cargo was sent to Sydney, and was re-shipped to Newcastle. These are facts known to the Naval Board and to the Central Administration-know n to the Minister of Defence. They are set out in documentary form by accredited officers, whose word none dare impugn. What is true of Commander Bracegirdle is true of others.",19
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Is this what he did?,20
158,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Yes . This is no mere assertion on my part; it is a fact well known to the Department. But let me return to my main point in regard to the military officers. These men who were sentenced to a term of imprisonment were sent to Sydney. Subsequently Mrs. Penny, who was largely responsible for the publicity given to this matter-sh e is one of those women who are never beaten - proceede d to fight for her mate and her children. She tried to gain publicity for her case in the Sydney press. She wrote, also, to Ministers and to members of Parliament. She commenced one of her letters to the Minister of Defence by saying, ""Listen to the prayer of a mother and 3ix children."" She then went on to detail the facts, and stated that her husband had been simply doing the bidding of the men who led the .troops at Rabaul. She received an answer to the effect that nothing could be done for her; that the Minister did not propose to alter the decision of his chief officers, and that Penny and the other men must remain in gaol. A letter to another Minister elicited only the same answer. She then wrote a further letter, in which she said, "" My children have more meal times than meals, and my husband is lying in gaol while the other thieves are getting promoted in the Army of their country."" Still no notice was taken of her appeal. I then sent to the Department the letter which is said not to be in existence.",20
159,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Does the honourable member say that he wrote a letter?,21
160,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I am not pushing that point, since it is denied by the Department that the letter of complaint received by me, and which I sent on to the Denartment, .was accompanied by a covering note.",21
161,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Has the honourable member any evidence?,21
162,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I told the Gommittee before the Prime Minister came in that I wrote to the Department before leaving for Norfolk Island. I wish now to ask the Leader of the Opposition whether, when he called for the production of the file dealing with this matter, he expected that the file would comprise the whole or only part of the correspondence ?",21
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The whole of it.,21
164,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"And so would any honourable member. If the right honourable member will examine the file he will observe that there is first of all a letter purporting to come from William Penny to myself. The next document on it is the reply made on 6th February. If there was anything intervening, between the letter which I sent in and the reply which I received, in the shape of a report bearing on the letter of complaint, I take it that that report should be on the file just as any other paper relating to the case ought to be.",21
165,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"If it dealt with the same subject. - Mr ANSTEY - It did. On returning from Norfolk Island at the latter end of January, I telephoned to the Department to learn what had been done, and was told that inquiries were being made. I asked who was going to make these inquiries, and was informed that they would be conducted by military officers. My answer to that was, "" They are no good to me. I want a definite statement. I want to know whether the statement made by Penny and the others in gaol is true or untrue. If it is not true, then they should receive an additional sentence for perjury. If it is true, they ought not to be in gaol."" Mr Trumble informed me that the matter had been referred to the Adjutant-General, Lieut Colonel Dodds, and that I would receive an answer to my inquiries in the course of a few days. Tho point to which I would direct the attention of the Leader of the Opposition is that he cannot find on the file the report furnished by Lieut Colonel Dodds. It has disappeared. I can tell the Committee, however, what Lieut - Colonel Dodds reported. He wrote in the first place, "" It is not proposed to take notice of insinuations against officers of the Expeditions."" Therein was set forth the policy of the official chiefs. Men might say, "" I looted under the direction of officers; I loaded loot uuder the direction of officers,"" but no notice was to be taken. But they took notice of insinuations against the rank and file.",21
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,How does the honourable member know this if the report is not on the file?,21
167,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Because I saw the report before it was extracted.,21
168,Mr RIXEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,It was on the file?,21
169,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Yes , but it was not there when the file was laid on the table of the House in response to the request made by the right honourable member for Parramatta.",21
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I wonder how the honourable member can get access to all these documents.,21
171,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The Minister of Defence gave him liberty to see them.,21
172,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"There is no secret about the matter. The case had been going on for four weeks before the House met, and, becoming anxious, I asked permission to see the file in order that I might ascertain what was being done. That permission was granted, and I made certain extracts from the report to which I have referred. The position taken up by the Minister was that there could be no interference with the decision already arrived at. That was the answer given to Mrs Penny, but later on it was said that the case of these men might be reconsidered if their behaviour was goodThe question was whether the accusations made against officers were true or not, and an inquiry was demanded. But honourable members will gather from what I have said that the definite policy laid down by the Adjutant-General was that no notice should be taken of insinuations against officers. Lieut-Colonel Dodds went on to say that ' ' these accusations were made with the idea that the Department would be influenced in the decision in these cases in order to avoid a scandal."" If there was no subject for a scandal so far as the officers were concerned, how was a scandal to be created ? This, then, was the policy of the officers of Department. They were determined to cloak up the matter in every way. Several weeks elapsed without anything being done; the end of February came round, but no one had moved, and I then said to the Department, "" It is easy to solve this question. Send an officer to Sydney to examine what property is sent down from Rabaul, and by whom it is owned."" Every sailor in the coastal trade knows what is placed in the holds of his ship. Every wharf labourer knows what goes in and out of the hold of a ship which he is working. The very dogs were barking what was going on, and while men on the wharfs were unloading the loot of the officers other menof the rank and file were serving time in the penitentiaries of their country. At last I was informed that a man, in whom there was every confidence, was being sent up to make an investigation.",21
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Who was he?,22
174,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"An agent appointed by the Minister. He went to Sydney, and within four hours of his arrival had absolute proof that every accusation was true.",22
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Who was he?,22
176,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"It is for the right honourable member to interrogate me, and for me to make my own statement in my own way.",22
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,But why suppress this name while parading others ?,22
178,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,He was an oflicial.,22
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The honourable member should put all his cards on the table.,22
180,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I am putting a good many of them before the Committee.,22
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,They seem to have been carefully selected.,22
182,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"No . There has been no selection. The man who was sent was Mr. Lahiff, Senior Ordnance Officer. Within four hours of his arrival in Sydney he obtained the evidence and got the loot into his possession. Lest the military chiefs should interfere, he took it to the police station, and put it under the charge of the Government of New Soutli Wales. He seized the forged receipts in many cases. When he had done that, and they found that he was in Sydney, the military chiefs declared themselves outraged by this interference with their work. They asked, ""Were not they the the men to maintain the honour of the Army and to see justice done ?"" They communicated with the Minister, and said, ""We are carrying out this work. We are prepared to make a proper investigation. Why should we not be permitted to do so?"" It is to their undying infamy that, though for three months they had had ample opportunity, they never made a step until they knew that the Senior Ordnance Officer was in Sydney, and had the thieves' property in his clutches. Then they said they were prepared to constitute a Board.",22
183,Mr HANSTAIT,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Who sent the Senior Ordnance Oflicer to Sydney?,22
184,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The Minister. He arrived in Sydney on the 25th February. On the 5th March the military chiefs communicated with the Minister, proposing the constitution of a Board.",22
185,Mr RILEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Did they consult the Minister about the appointment of a Board?,22
186,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"They wrote to the Minister on the subject on 5th March, and on the 9th March he gave his consent to the establishment of a Board, although ""from the end of November until that date the military authorities had done nothing in the matter. They thereupon ordered that the stolen property and the forged receipts should be handed over to them, declaring that it was for them to make an inquiry, and that they should have all the evidence on which to proceed. Mr Lahiff was to assist them. On the 14th March he reported to the Minister- \ There is no doubt that looting has taken place on a large scale from the top downwards, and if it were not for the men in gaol there would be no question of loot at all. That is to say, there would have been no one to "" squeak."" A private soldier or a sailor subject to his officers would not wish to be black-listed.",22
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Did the report refer to the naval authorities?,22
188,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"No; only to the military authorities. The naval officers do not come into this matter at all. Mr. Lahiff's report stated that the soldiers did what they saw the officers doing. The great bulk of the loot came by the troopship Berrima,- and was placed aboard and taken away under the direction of military and naval officers. The transport Eastern was also used for a similar purpose. These ships, being under military and naval control, were not subject to Customs inspection. Nine cases of loot came by the Matwiga on the 28th January, and were reshipped to Newcastle. Mr Lahiff described the property that he had seized.",22
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"This still refers to the property taken by the military? . Mr ANSTEY - Yes . I am not dealing with the Navy at all. He said that on the 22nd of Eebriiary five cases of loot were shipped on the Matunga at Rabaul for Captain Ravenscroft. After the officers had left New Guinea their agents at Rabaul were shipping stuff for them. The Moresby and the Marsina were also used for the transport of loot. Amongst the looted goods were bedsteads, motor boats, gramophones, table linen, typewriters, chronometers, cameras, silverware, children's soup plates, chinaware, saucepans, Japanese ware, glassware, jugs, coffee pots, kettles, lamps, Sec., &c. Mr. Lahiff reported on the 14th March that stuff was still coming along, but that tney were getting to the tail end of it. He said that forgery was added to robbery, and reported that he held receipts pro-= duced to the Customs authorities which he could prove to be forgeries. He urged that the Board of Inquiry should take no notice of receipts produced before them until these had been proved to be genuine. A cargo came by the Marsina for Captain Fry. But Captain Fry did not appear before the court martial. His consignment consisted of jugs, coffee pots, tea pots, &c, which he said he had bought from Captain Mueller, a German officer interned at the Concentration Camp at Liverpool, who replied that the receipt concerned goods that he had never owned. That was one forged receipt, but there were others. There was a motor boat worth about £300, for which a receipt for £28 from an unknown German was produced. Mr Lahiff went on to say that the military and naval officers were silent on the subjectThe Military men refer me to the Navy, the Naval officers refer me to the Military. The officers responsible for the shipment should called. Then the Board of Inquiry met. Captain Bowie Wilson was the first prosecutor appointed, but afterwards Colonel Ramaciotti was appointed.",23
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Was this tribunal a Board of"" Inquiry or a court martial ?",23
191,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"First , there was the investigation by the Senior Ordnance Officer, then a Board of Inquiry, and, lastly, a court martial.",23
192,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Was it in reference to the proceedings of the Board of Inquiry that I made a promise to the House last night r,23
193,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The Prime Minister's statement last night had to do with a different case altogether.,23
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Was Colonel Ramaciotti president of the Board of Inquiry, and subsequently of the court martial ?",23
195,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"No . He was prosecutor. I think that the investigation to which the Prime Minister referred last night was made by a Board of Inquiry, though I understand that a Board of Inquiry cannot take sworn evidence.",23
196,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I understood that it was an investigation by a court martial.,23
197,Mr BOYD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The honourable member for Bourke last night spoke of sworn evidence, so that the inquiry must have been that of a court martial.",23
198,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I am not clear whether the investigation was that of a Board of Inquiry or of a court martial. But to return to the case with which I was dealing when the Prime Minister interrupted me. Captain Ravenscroft was brought before the Board of Inquiry, and asked, "" What did you do with certain property? How did you distribute it ? "" He replied that the distrioution was made under the orders of Colonel Holmes. One of the charges was that Lieutenant Holmes and Lieutenant Travers went to the house of the Deputy Governor, and looted it. The car driver was given three months because he took something for himself. Young Holmes was asked, "" Did you go to this place?"" He said, "" Yes."" "" Did you take the car there?"" ""Yes."" "" What did you take ?"" "" All sorts of things."" "" Under whose direction?"" *' Under the direction of Colonel Holmes."" If the evidence taken by the be Board of Inquiry was not sufficient to justify the court martialling of Colonel Holmes, I wish to know what would have heen sumcient? Mr Lahiff said I urge on the Minister to put it to the of Inquiry that they should accept no receipt until proved genuine, because I hold so many forged ones. When the Board dealt with Sergeant Anderson, it said, "" Your receipts are; bogus, we shall not receive them;"" but Colonel Fry's receipts were accepted as genuine, and he was allowed to escape. Following the Board of Inquiry came thecourt martial. When I read the list of officers constituting the court martial, my mind went back a few years in the history of this country, and I wondered what justice could be expected from a body so constituted. Its president was an officer who some years ago was called upon by the New South Wales Government to account for £700 that had been advanced to him. At the time he was a major. His reply was that the advance had been £300 in hard cash, not £700, and that he had receipts from his predecessor for the balance of £400. He could not account for a penny of the £300, however, and it was discovered afterwards that he had received the great bulk of the £400 for which he said he had obtained receipts from his predecessor. Out of £700 he stuck to £611. A Board of Inquiry was appointed to investigate the case, its members being Colonel Waddell and Major T. F. Knox, one of whom boasted that he was manager of the Colonial Bank, and the other that he was managing director of Dalgety and Company; and they claimed that no reflection should be cast on them when they reported that this officer was not guilty of the charges brought against him. The right honourable member for Swan was at the time Minister of Defence, and he asked for the notes taken during the inquiry. This was objected to, but the right honourable member pointed out that a Privy Council or a Supreme Court gives reasons for its decisions, and that the notes of Judges are public property.",23
199,The CHAIRMAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The honourable member's time has expired.,24
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,He should be allowed to continue. Motion (by Mr FISHER) agreed toThat the honourable member for Bourke be granted an extension of time.,24
201,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Eventuall y they had to give up the notes taken.' Then the Board Audit Department of New Soutli Wales formulated ten charges, each being a charge of absolute robbery of property of the State. A responsible officer of the Audit Department said, "" Give me a court martial, and I shall prove every one of these charges.""",24
202,Mr FENTON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,In what year was this?,24
203,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"In 1904. A court martial was refused. The Audit officers then recommended to the Government of the State that a criminal prosecution for embezzlement should be commenced, but that application was smothered by social influence. It is the man against whom these charges were made-Colonel , then Major, Lee-wh o was appointed president of the court martial constituted to try the Rabaul cases. He embezzled £611 of the money of the New South Wales Government, and the officers of the Audit Department of the State recommended that he should be criminally prosecuted He was only saved from gaol by social influence. He ought not to be in the Army of Australia, despite his work on the fields of South Africa, and certainly he should not, on any ground, be one of a tribunal to try others. I come now to another officer, Captain Ravenscroft. Here we have another beauty! He was an officer in the British Army, who was drummed out of it for robbery. When he was brought before a court martial, the prosecutor asked Mr Lahiff, the Senior Ordnance Officer, ""What are you here for?"" Mr Lahiff answered, ""To give evidence, if necessary."" ""What is your evidence?"" "" My evidence is against Captain Ravenscroft and others."" "" What is the character of your evidence?"" "" To prove that I seized the property they annexed."" ""Then you may go away; we do not want you.""",24
204,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Where does that incident appear?,24
205,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The right honourable gentleman can ask the Senior Ordnance Officer if that is not a true statement of facts. The prosecutor refused to admit this man into court because he could prove the case against Captain Ravenscroft. Did any one ever hear of such a farce as was reported in the Daily Telegraph the other day? This man was charged with having stolen a chronometer, just as other men were charged with having stolen a fork and spoon. If that was not a farce, I do not know what is. Although it was reported to the authorities that the accused persons had stolen gramophones, table linen, typewriters, cameras, silverware, chinaware, and dozens of other things, they-charged him with the theft of one little article. In the inquiry into Campbell's case, three omcers were permitted to swear to the man's confession, but in the case against Ravenscroft the court would not permit any one to testify against the accused. The prosecutor walked into the court and said, "" I present the case for the prosecution. My charge against the prisoner is that he stole a chronometer; that, having stolen it, he received it ; and, having received it , he got it with a full knowledge that it was stolen, and that he stole it after receiving it . "" Then he concluded, "" That is my case against the prisoner, but, as I have no proof, I desire to withdraw the charges I have made."" The president of the court, Colonel Lee, said, "" Y o u must go on with the case; we cannot allow these withdrawals."" The prosecutor replied, "" But I have no proof,"" and Colonel Lee said, "" A ll the more reason why we should go on with the case."" Is it not an outrage for a prosecutor to hring a man before a court and then say, "" That is my charge, but I cannot go on with it "" ? Is that not making a farce of the whole proceedings and a travesty of justice ?",24
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Was Mr Lahiff called at any of these inquiries?,25
207,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"He was in attendance, but the court would not hear him. He was told to go back to Melbourne. Why? Because the court did not want any evidence to prove the guilt of Ravenscroft. Now I come to the case of Moore. When this question was discussed in the House on a previous occasion, we were told of the guarantees that were provided against any abuse or injury to civil liberty by a court martial. We were told that every sentence passed by a court martial would be reviewed by the Attorney-General. Yesterday I asked the honourable gentleman whether any sentence had been passed on Lieutenant Moore. The Attorney-General replied that he had never heard of the man. Then inquiry was made, and it was found that the Governor General and his Ministers had passed execution on the man. Did honourable members ever hear of such a situation? The Attorney-General told me that ho had never heard of the case of Lieutenant Moore. Then I replied, "" Y o u passed sentence on him; he has been executed; his head is off."" Whereupon the Attorney-General said, ""Has he? Then, by Godf I ' l l review the case."" That is the sort of protection the public has in cases of this kind. In regard to these chargesof looting, any member may examine themen who are now in gaol; he can look at the evidence, the names of the ships that came from Rabaul and their contents, the incontestible evidence of privates and wharf labourers, the facts that have come from the court martial, and the articles produced by the man appointed by the Minister to seize them, and he can come to no other conclusion than that there was in Rabaul an atmosphere of robbery and crime, the responsibility for which rests upon those who> controlled the expedition. This man Moore, a sergeant yesterday, a corporal the day before, a private prior to that a man who had acquired his position byhonorable effort-wa s made the scapegoat, whilst a notorious criminal likeRavenscroft, who ought not to be in any army in the world, is permitted to walkabout as a free man. Is that not a travesty on justice? No man should be allowed to preside over these courts martial unless his life is untainted by any suspicion of crime. I never sought publicity in connection wth this case. I said to the Minister "" Let these men go, and then hush the matter up; it is a dirty business, but it is iniquitous that a number of men should be kept in gaol when those who were in command of them, and who were equally guilty, are allowed towalk abroad. People cannot be in an atmosphere of crime, where every man is doing something wrong, without all being tainted by it . The best thing to do is tosmother the case up.""",25
208,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I do not agree with youin that contention.,25
209,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That is my attitude, but the case has gone too far now.",25
210,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Everythin g that the present Government tackles is clean.,25
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,This matter cannot rest here.,25
212,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,It will not rest her©.,26
213,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I D is a pity th© Assistant Minister did not make that statement long ago.,26
214,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"We have ""always said that,",26
215,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Did not the Minister of Defence wire to Lahiff instructing him to seize all this looted property ?,26
216,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I have not said a word about the Minister of Defence.,26
217,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"If these facts were known to the Department, action should have been taken long ago.",26
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Did Lahiff report these matters to the Minister ?,26
219,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I have quoted to the Committee Lahiff's report to the Minister on the 14th March. The unfortunate position of all Ministers, irrespective of party, is that they have an undue con-ception of honour, loyalty and duty to the officials, whereas the duty of the officials should be to uphold the honour of Ministers. The honourable member for Wentworth, when he was Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, was placed in a false position by the acts of his officials; everybody knew that h© was not at fault; but Minister after Minister is placed in the same unfair position. I say it would have been infinitely better for the honour of the Army, and for the credit of Australia, if , a few months ago, the Minister of Defence had done as I suggested, and liberated the men who were in prison. The only honourable thing to do was to liberate them and recompense them, and to say nothing further about the matter; or, alternatively, .to proceed to investigate the whole of the charges. At such a critical juncture in our affairs, an investigation would only do harm. would have been infinitely better, as a matter of national policy, to hush the whole thing up and give the imprisoned men their liberty.",26
220,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I do not agree with you.,26
221,Mr FOWLER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Why has the case been hushed up so long?,26
222,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,It has never been Ihuslied up.,26
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,It has.,26
224,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,That is a biased - expressed for political purposes.,26
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Why make that - statement? The facts are there.,26
226,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Before the House reassembled, I asked the Minister what good would result from holding a court martial. As long as there is war, there will b© looting, and we cannot restrain it . I take up no moral attitude in this matter, but I say that if one man is in the looting, all are in it. But do not let th© officers take so much for themselves, and then put their subordinates in gaol for doing the same thing. The court martial had before it sworn affidavits by men who said that they were compelled to pack the looted property. Yet the court refused to act on that evidence. All I asked of the Minister of Defence was that those men should be taken out of gaol. I do not believe that any court martial that has ever been held on this continent found an officer guilty. The Army of Australia is controlled by the same old banking ring and the sugar monopoly that w© hear so much of in other quarters- a black band of conspirators who ought not to have control of an army in any Democracy. The only honest thing to do now is to release the imprisoned men, and to giv© them compensation. Then, if it is desired to make an inquiry, let all the suspected parties be brought to the same bar, and impose on all the same penalties. But do not keep some men in gaol while making inquiries in regard to the others.",26
227,Mr WEST,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,And take th© charges before a civil Court.,26
228,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"There ought never to be a court martial except on the field of battle. I am now finished with this stale, stinking subject. I did not desire to ventilate it , I hav© had no pleasure in handling it, but if it has brought any comfort to the relatives of the imprisoned men, I am well rewarded for the discharge of a distasteful duty. It Mr FISHER (Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.3] - I do not rise to address myself to the merits of the question, but to join issue with the honourable member for Bourke as to what is the right thing to do in regard to this matter. I deny that looting is a necessary accompaniment of a soldier's duty. On the contrary, it is the duty of the commanding officer to shoot the first soldier who loots, if he cannot deal with opinion, him in any other way.",26
229,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Who is going to shoot the commanding officer when he loots?,26
230,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That is not a new quip. If th© commanding officer loots, there should be dozens of officers and others who would bo able to inform on him. The honourable member's question assumes that the whole of our officers and soldiers are corrupt. They are not.",26
231,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,That is not fair to me. I say that the great bulk of the officers and men of our Army are absolutely honest.,27
232,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I am glad to hear that. We assumed that there were sumcient honourable men in that expedition to give honest evidence in an inquiry, and that the facts would be elicited by cross-examination at a trial by either the civil or military power. If that is so, the honourable member's argument is partially gone, because he stated that no court martial could be relied upon to do justice in a trial of officers.",27
233,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Hear , hear! I say that.",27
234,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I do not agree with the honourable member, and I protest against any such statement being made.",27
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"It is, by implication, charging the whole force of officers with being corrupt.",27
236,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That is the only point I intend to deal with now. I am not dealing with the facts and merits of the case, which I leave on one side, to covered in time by efficient means. I rise now to defend the honour of the whole of our armed Forces against the charge that the truth cannot be got from them in any Court, and especially in a court martial. In the meantime, I repeat what I said last night, that the matter cannot, and will not, be allowed to rest at the present stage. It will be sifted thoroughly in every possible way. The facts presented to me are not quite the same as those presented by the honourable member, but we shall discover what the true facts are sooner or later. I can say, on behalf of the Minister of Defence, that, from the time when I first knew anything of this affair, and spoke to him concerning it , no man could have shown greater alacrity in trying to discover the facts, and bring them home to the guilty with the least possible delay. But there are certain laws, customs, and practices in judicial and semi-judicial matters that call for what seems to a layman unnecessary delay. There has. however, been no wilful delay on the part of the Government nor any attempt to withhold any points of the evidence-ther e has been no attempt to shelter any man, no matter what his name may be. I repeat what I said on a previous occasion, that officers who are guilty of such charges ought to be treated more severely than would the humblest man in the ranks. Their case has been adjudicated upon by the Minister in a straightforward way, but it will not be left out of sight on a re-examination.",27
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Parramatta) [5.8] - Alon g with other honourable members, I have heard with a great deal of astonishment the series of odious charges made by the honourable member for Bourke against the officers who had charge of the expedition to Rabaul. If a tithe of those charges are true, those officers ought not to be in the Australian Army. But up to the present we have only the statements of one man-that is, a gentleman who evidently has reported to the Minister what he has not been allowed to report anywhere else. But the honourable member for Bourke clearly reveals his motive when he says that he does not wish to punish the officers. After blackening their be discharacters, and dragging out everything in their history that he thinks will damn them in the eyes of a decent-minded public, he concludes by saying that he does not wish to hurt them! He describes one man as a robber and plunderer, who ought not to be in the Army, but yet declares that he does not wish to hurt him! The honourable member's notions of things seem to be very strangely inverted. In what way does he imagine he can hurt those officers more than he has done by bringing those charges and allegations against them, and damaging them in the eyes of the world. After heaping all this contumely, and all these scandalous charges, upon these officers, he makes the solemn asseveration that he does not wish to hurt them! He says, in effect, "" These men are murderers, plunderers, perjurers, and looters, but I do not wish to do them an injury.""",27
238,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I do not wish to hurt them.,27
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I should like to know what is the honourable members conception of an injury.,27
240,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Goin g to gaol and stopping there-that is one.,27
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I would rather spend my life in gaol as an innocent man than have these charges unproved over my head.,28
242,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I should not like to give the honourable member the choice of the alternative!,28
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The honourable member has strangely inverted notions of what is right and fair. He says, "" Let those other men out, and then you can do what you like-let them out, and compensate them.""",28
244,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Hear , hear! Equality amongst thieves.",28
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The charge against those men was that they, being military police on police duty, held a revolver to a priest's head and took his money; and yet the honourable member says, "" Let them out, and compensate them, and I shall have no more to say."" That is not my idea of a proper view of the case.",28
246,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"You r idea is that a'man may put a gun to another man's head, and get away with the stuff.",28
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"My idea is that if these military police looted in this way their place is in gaol, just as it is place for any officer who has been guilty of the same offence.",28
248,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,That' s right.,28
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"But there is a slight difference between the honourable member and myself, because his suggestion is that both should be set at liberty. I think we shall all agree that if half the charges are true, both officers and men should be in gaol.",28
250,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Eithe r all should be in gaol, or all out-hav e it which way you like.",28
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The honourable member seems to take the view that those men in gaol would be all right if there were only some one else with them, but I should think that would be poor satisfaction.",28
252,Sir ROBERT BEST,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,They should all be in gaol if what is stated is true.,28
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"So they the should; I am now only speaking of the honourable member's notions of what ought to be done. The honourable member has the made a series of charges. First of all, impugns the members of the court matter martial; and those members ought to be in gaol if half that he has said is true.",28
254,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,On e member.,28
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Whic h one member-Ravenscrof t ?,28
256,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Ravenscrof t was the man at the Bar.,28
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,And he has been let off.,28
258,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Yes , and good luck to him.",28
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Ye t the honourable member says that this officer has been pursuing these practices practically all his official life, both in England and here. If that be true, this man has no right in our Army at all, and neither has Colonel Lee, I should imagine. However, what is the right way in, which to go about this business? Surely it ought not to be hushed up, as the honourable member suggests, but ought to be sifted to the bottom? Lahiff- I do not know his rank - ough t to have a chance of substantiating all he has said, and if he can prove it all, then a very serious situation has arisen. These officers are men whom we trusted-me n of repute whose honour in civil life has been above suspicion-and if they are to lie under these charges it the seems to me that it would be "" good-bye "" to the officering of our Citizen Forces. If they be guilty, let us know the fact, and the extent of their guilt, and let them be punished like any other men. The question arises as to what kind of investigation would meet the circumstances; and I have two suggestions to make, either of which I think would prove effective. I do not see why a Committee of picked men from this Chamber could not be appointed. There are, I believe, men on both sides who could be trusted with an investigation of the kind.",28
260,Mr FENTON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Would not a Judge be better?,28
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That is my second suggestion, if honourable members do not like to undertake a duty of the kind, though, personally, I see no objection. It is only a matter of ascertaining the facts, because the apportionment of punishment would await some other tribunal; and I think that such a Committee as I have suggested could perforKi duty just as readily and efficiently as he any other. We are all agreed that the cannot rest where it is, but must be thoroughly sifted in the interests of the officers themselves, and of the Forces generally. This thing has gone altogether too far to be ignored; and an investigation should be intrusted either to a Select Committee or to a Judge, against whom there could be raised no imputation of being a looter, a robber, or a jurer. I have never during my parliamentary life heard such a series of charges made by an honourable member; and if those charges are proved, I shall get the surprise of my life. Some of those officers I have hitherto looked upon as men of honour and integrity, who could be trusted to any length; and, as I say, I shall indeed get the surprise of my life if they are proved to have been guilty of such infamous practices. But I remind honourable members that this is only one aspect of the matter. The honourable member for Bourke made a series of statements last night concerning another man who made allegations concerning some pyjamas. This morning I went through the file of papers carefully; and I can only hope that the honourable member will never be judged on evidence similar to that furnished by this man Campbell.",28
262,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"All I asked *' Where is the confession?"" That is all I said.",29
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,What confession ?,29
264,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The confession that Colonel Holmes swore in the court martial that he held.,29
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I do not know where the confession is. Why does the honourable member confine himself to that single item in the whole of the statements made?,29
266,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Because if you go into a Court and swear that I have made a confession, and that you hold it, it is your duty to produce the confession; and, if you do not, the Judge ought not to condemn me.",29
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"But , whether the confession be produced or not, the facts of the case are not altered.",29
268,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Are they not?,29
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,This has nothing whatever to do with the question of whether or not the pyjamas were sold. We have a statement that Campbell wrote to his mother,29
270,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I do not place reliance on that.,29
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That Camp-' bell wrote to his mother, who destroyed the letter, and subsequently made statements, from memory, as to its contents. It was the only letter she received from per- him whilst he was away. He only wrote this one letter, making complaint that something wrong was going on. He makes statements about purchasing pyjamas, but when he is asked to describe the man who sold them, he gives a description that cannot be fitted on to any man who had anything to do with the selling of pyjamas. The man Jones, who is said to have purchased themhe does not know where he is. He does not know anything. Other men are mentioned in connection with the transaction, but Campbell cannot find them, and does not know their names. Yet this man is held up by the honourable member for Bourke as a man who is the victim of some conspiracy on the part of his officers. I do not know how the honourable member reads these papers, but it seems to me that he reads them only to pick out certain bits that will help him to make a case.",29
272,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That is what I say was, about you.",29
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I have no doubt it strikes the honourable member as particularly funny, but the honourable member did not tell the House all those things that are referred to in the papers. If the statements of Campbell are to be believed, then the statements of a whole series of our officers must be discredited. Either the. officers are consummate liars, or Campbell is, as they say, a man of weak character.",29
274,Mr BRENNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Do not you think that the document ought to be produced, or its absence explained ?",29
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I do. I do not know why it is not produced. I cannot imagine why it is not produced.,29
276,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"There is nothing remarkable about a man having a short memory when a responsible officer could not remember the name of the - canteen attendant, though he was president of the canteen. What a one-eyed member you are!",29
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I am afraid I am, in the eyes of the honourable member. However, this series of charges cannot remain where it is. If half what the honourable member says is true, there is a grave series of charges to be answered against many officers of the Australian Forces, He says, amongst other things, that it is impossible to get an impartial court martial. That is equal to saying that there are no officers in the Force who can be trusted to make an inquiry.",29
278,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Yes ; Lord Russell of Killowen said the same thing. He gave a description of a court martial to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, which showed that.",30
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I congratulate the honourable member on following such an illustrious example. We now see where he gets his inspirations from. But this matter must be sifted to the bottom. Either this House ought to appoint a Committee of its members to do the sifting- I would prefer that we should do thab; I think we can get at the facts, and satisfy the House as well as a Judge-o r we should appoint a Judge to do the work. A Judge, no doubt, is beyond suspicion, and that is, perhaps, the one thing in favour of such an appointment. But either by means of a Judge, or by means of a Committee - of the House, the Government ought not to hesitate two hours before taking action. The Minister is here at the table. He tells us week after week that they are going to do something; but nothing is being done. The Prime Minister said last night that he was going to do something; but when is it all going to be done? How many more charges are going to be added to the list before inquiry is made ?",30
280,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,No more. This finishes the series.,30
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"And I hope, also, that the Minister will not let these men out of gaol.",30
282,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,You are cruel.,30
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Perhaps I am; but I have the idea in my own mind, and it is going to stay there, too, that when men are set to do. police duty for the special purpose of guarding and protecting people's property, and afterwards go themselves and take that property, then they ought to be punished with the utmost severity possible. How else can confidence be maintained in our police force, or in our military arrangements, or in anything else that has to guard the sacredness of property and home ? Surely men in positions of high responsibility must carry a corresponding obligation to do the right thing, and, therefore, this crime is far greater than it would have been had the offenders been the ordinary men over whom these police officers were set. If the honourable member suggests that these special military police can act the part of highwaymen, and visiting ministers' huts, take their collections, and then be let out of gaol, he talks nonsense. They ought to have reasonable punishment, and if the officers have been guilty they ought to get their punishment, too. The whole thing, as I say, should be sifted, due allowance, of course, being made for all surrounding circumstances. I do not want to take up any puritanical attitude. I want the fullest possible allowance to be made for the circumstances that surrounded all these cases, but I do not think the existence of those circumstances ought to relieve us from the obligation of visiting the consequences of any evil action upon these men, whether they be officers or not. Only in that manner can the discipline of the Forces and the morale of the Army be preserved. Just as such offences are visited with severe punishment in the British Army, so ought they to be here when they have been sheeted home. I do not know where the Prime Minister is, or what is to be done, but it is certain that we cannot have the Prime Minister saying at the table'day after day that this and that is going to be done, and yet know that nothing is being done. This House ought to know what is to be done, and it ought to know at the earliest possible moment. In view of the statements made by the honourable member for Bourke, I do not think that this matter ought to be postponed for one hour. The Prime Minister ought to see that a competent and impartial tribunal investigates all these matters, and either relieves the officers of the series of odious charges which have been made against them, or, if the charges be true, visits them with the consequences.",30
284,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Bass-Assistant Minister of Defence) [5.28] - On e would think that the honourable member for Bourke was the only member of this Chamber desirous of getting to the bottom of these charges of looting at Rabaul.,30
285,Mr SINCLAIR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,He seems to be the only one who is getting there.,30
286,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"May I inform the Committee that early in February the Minister heard of these rumours, and, in order to keep the Australian Army clean, at once set out to investigate. CV»tain persons were sent from Melbourne *>' Sydney, secretly and unknown to any one in Sydney, to examine all the cargo then' coming back from Rabaul. That was two months before the honourable member spoke in this House.",30
287,Mr ANSTEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I did not speak fore because,31
288,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I just remind the hongation orable member of the fact. As soon as we heard whispers of these goings-on, appointed the Chief of the Ordnance partment in Melbourne to visit Sydney, and niake a secret investigation. Before he did so he interviewed the heads of the Customs Department in Melbourne, and was informed how best to go about his work so as to obtain the best results. was in Sydney some twenty-four or fortymonths ago. eight hours, when he wired to Melbourne the Minister of Defence was absent from Melbourne when the wire camestating that he believed certain goods the Customs Department at Sydney were with. looted goods. I happened to be acting for the Minister at the time, and I wired back to Mr Lahiff, instructing him seize all the articles which he considered had been stolen or looted. Yet the orable member says the Defence Departsome ment has done nothing, and that the Government are doing nothing.",31
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,When was that done ?,31
290,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,In February.,31
291,Mr FOWLER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,What subsequent action was taken?,31
292,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"When we were told in this House by the honourable member for Bourke that privates were to be not gaoled for looting, and that the Governascertain ment were taking no action with regard to certain officers who were supposed have looted, what did we do? We acfor tually had a Board of Inquiry then investigating. At the very time the honourable member first mentioned anybeen thing in this House concerning the Rabaul looting, that Board of Inquiry was going about Sydney, trying to obtain certain evidence, with a view to having it preobject sented either to a court martial or to some superior Court. That took some little time, but the evidence has been presented. Now we are told by the honsion orable member for Bourke that the very men who could give evidence were not allowed to give evidence.",31
293,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,That is so. That is what he says.,31
294,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I shall never rest, while I am Assistant Minister, until the matter is thoroughly investigated. I should refuse to represent the Defence Department in this Chamber if I thought besuch a thing was going on. I am sure the Government will not allow the alleto go unchallenged, either. You' have heard from time to time the statewe ment made that Mr Lahiff, Chief of Dethe Ordnance Department, has certain information regarding certain officers, and that he had been prevented from giving that evidence. I say that we shall get that evidence as quickly as we can.",31
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,But Mr Lahiff He reported all this to the Minister three,31
296,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"And Colonel Lee, who is said to have refused to allow the eviin dence to be given, must also be dealt We have heard some terrible things about Colonel Lee this afternoon. I am not going to accept them until we have proof, and I think it is pretty hard to for our Commandants to be made the butt of statements like this, made in a honHouse of Parliament, unless we have proof. The whole business is particularly distasteful to me. It has come as a thunderbolt to me to hear such terrible things about the gentleman who presided over this court martial, and I want to say, on behalf of the Minister of Defence and on behalf of the Government, that everything possible shall be done by way of investigation. If that court martial, as it was constituted, has done its duty in a proper way, we will the fact. It will be the Government's duty to find out what actually to did take place. The honourable member Bourke says that the court did not do its duty in the proper way. He' said that certain evidence which might have given was not allowed to be given, and he further stated-and I was sorry to hear him say this-that he did not mind looting. He said that he did not to looting, but that he objected to some looters being sent to gaol while others were not. I was also sorry to hear the honourable member make the admisthat if those now in gaol for this offence were set at liberty, he would be prepared to let the whole matter drop. I do not agree with that attitude, nor does the Government. I can assure the Committee, on behalf of the Government, that, in view of the allegations made this afternoon by the honourable member for Bourke, it is felt that the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is, but that a further inquiry must be made. It will be for the Government to consider what form that inquiry shall take.",31
297,Mr RILEY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,When will the Government state what they are going to do ?,32
298,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I cannot say. The statements made this afternoon by the honourable member for Bourke were quite new to me. I was not aware that Mr. Lahiff had not been allowed to put forward the evidence which he had collected.,32
299,Mr FENTON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The Government, at all events, should be able to announce what kind of tribunal will be appointed to make the investigation.",32
300,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I cannot be expected, as Assistant Minister of Defence, to say now what form the inquiry will take. The matter will have to be considered. An inquiry will be made, and the House advised in due course. I hope that the Defence Estimates will now be allowed to pass without further discussion. I have had a fairly stiff drilling during the last few days.",32
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,It is not a drilling of the honourable gentleman that has been taking place.,32
302,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I quite understand that, but I have a responsibility which I am bound to respect. I am here to protect the Department, and I shall stand by its officers until the guilt of any of them has been proved.",32
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The sooner these accusations are lifted from the omcers, if they are not guilty, the better for all cerned.",32
304,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Quite so. These Estimates have been well discussed, and I appeal to honourable members to pass them without further delay. I have only to add that this morning the Minister of Defence telegraphed to Colonel Holmes to produce the confession which he said he .had obtained from Private Campbell. On hearing the statement made last week by the honourable member for Bourke in regard to Private Campbell, the Minister wired to the Administrator at Rabaul to ascertain if the confession was still there. A reply was received in the negative. I mention these facts only to show that the Government are doing all that can be done in the matter. „",32
305,Mr BOYD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Henty) [5.39] - I do not wish to delay the passing of these Estimates, but I feel that the statements made by the honourable member for Bourke should not be allowed to remain without investigation a moment longer than is necessary. Whilst I thought at the outset that a Select Committee of this House would probably be the best tribunal to elicit all the evidence relating to these charges, I must confess that, after reflection, 1I have come to the conclusion that it would be almost one of the worse. Months would elapse before a Select Committee or a Royal Commission could collect all the evidence, draw up its report and present it to the House; and even then we should be no nearer the trial of these men, if they be guilty of the charges ""made against them, than we are today.",32
306,Mr BRENNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Then Select Committees must be very slow in dealing with such matters.,32
307,Mr BOYD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The history of all Royal Commissions and Select Committees is the same. Many people whose connection with the subject-matter of inquiry it is difficult to understand are often allowed to give evidence, and there is no means of confining the inquiry to a particular channel.",32
308,Mr THOMAS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Every Commissioner asks practically the same questions.,32
309,Mr BOYD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Quite so. The position, to a large extent, would be the same even if a Judge were appointed a Royal Commission. As a Royal Commissioner he would have to take evidence, but could not administer punishment. It would remain for the Government, upon his findcon- ings, to take whatever action was necessary, and once more to go through the whole procedure of calling witnesses to prove every charge made. I think it would be more in the interests of all concerned, and the most effective means of dealing with these matters, if the whole of the papers were forwarded to the Attorney-General, with a request that his Department should make an investigation, and that, if it found that a prima facie case could be made out against any officer, it should at once institute proceedings before a Judge and jury.",32
310,Mr BEENNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Does not that mean that the Attorney-General would have to prove some criminal offence ? There may he something less than a criminal offence that needs to be exposed.,32
311,Mr BOYD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Certain charges have been made, and whilst I suspend my judgment, I must say that the evidence submitted by the honourable member for. Bourke was very positive, definite, and - conclusive from his point of view. He has told us that the Department sent an officer to Sydney to investigate the charges, and that on arrival there he quickly found a number of cases of looted goods. If that is so, then the goods were looted by some one, and some one is responsible. The honourable member for Bourke does not know, nor do I , who is responsible; but, according to the honourable member, this officer reported to the Minister that he was prepared to give dence that looted goods had been found. The Assistant Minister of Defence has told us this afternoon that as early as February last Mr Lahiff was sent to Sydney to examine certain cargoes, and that his report to the Minister was that he had discovered cases of looted goods. The honourable member for Bourke now tells us that Mr Lahiff was not permitted to produce this evidence to the court martial.",33
312,Mr MANIFOLD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Did he report that fact to the Minister?,33
313,Mr BOYD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I cannot say; I have not seen the papers. That charge is one that should not be allowed to hang over any man's head a moment longer than is necessary to enable justice to be done. If a Royal Commission were appointed, with the result that criminal proceedings were taken, it would be said by the prosecuting counsel that the Commission had arrived at certain findings, and that that was a very good reason why the jury should arrive at the same conclusion. In this way the men on trial would probably be prejudiced in the .eyes of the jury. I strongly urge the Minister, therefore, to send this matter to the Attorney-General's Department at the earliest moment, in the hope that if he finds that the evidence warrants it, he will submit a case to a Judge and jury in a civil Court.",33
314,Mr WEST,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"East Sydney) [5.45] Since the Government have announced that an inquiry will take place, I do not think it wise that we should further discuss this matter. Whatever may be our views concerning it, we should suspend our judgment until the results of the inquiry have been made known. There cannot be the least doubt that there has been maladministration so far as Rabaul is concerned, and when we have the result of the investigation before us we should be able to determine the responsibility. Most of the representatives of the metropolis of Sydney have had certain information brought under their notice, but they have no direct evidence on which to take action. I do not think it would be wise to further discuss the matter at this stage.",33
315,Mr FOWLER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Perth) [5.47] - I expressed the opinion at an earlier stage of this matter that it could not be allowed to rest, and, having listened to the speech made this afternoon by the honevi- orable member for Bourke, I am still more emphatic in that view. I do not think it is the duty of the Committee to leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Government. The honourable member for Bourke has appealed, not to the Ministry, but to the Committee. He has stated his case here, and every honourable member carries a certain amount of responsibility in respect of it - I am very glad that the Government have indicated their willingness to take definite steps now to thoroughly sift the whole of these charges; but I cannot follow the Assistant Minister of Defence, when he assures us that they have shown all possible diligence in connection with it. If the Senior Inspector of Ordnance reported, as we understand he did, to the Government that he had certain evidence, and if he was not allowed to put that evidence before the court martial, or Board of Inquiry, then I take it that he must have reported that further fact to the head of his Department. The honourable member for Bourke has not told us whether he did so or not, but it would be most remarkable if an officer of the Department who had been instructed to seek evidence was put aside in an inquiry of this kind, and did not report that fact to the Government. If he did report it , how is it that the Government have allowed the matter to rest until the present time?",33
316,Mr BRENNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That is the system which is being built up. An oflicer must report to his superior oflicer, and this House is of no use. The matter is in the hands of the military.",33
317,Mr FOWLER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I think that the orable member is quite in error. In case, the officer was not reporting to superior officer. He was commissioned by the Minister of Defence. I undercommissioned stand, too, that he reported the result the inquiry directly to the Minister. I he was not allowed to give the evidence that he went to Sydney to collect, and to put forward, I take it that he reported that also to the Minister. Although several months have elapsed since .this extratent, ordinary miscarriage of justice occurred, nothing of any consequence, according the honourable member for Bourke, has been done. It would appear that Minister of Defence is only too willing to allow those concerned in this remarkorable able series pf inquiries to hush up whole matter.",34
318,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Nonsense ! _ Mr FOWLER - That is what it looks like. It remains for a further inquiry show whether that view is correct. strongly object to. the suggestion of the honourable member for Henty that there should be practically a criminal trial, cause, for all we know, there may. have been no criminal element in the committed, - though, if the charges are true, there was a gross breach of military regulations.",34
319,Mr SINCLAIR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Would not the Attorney-General be able to determine whether there was any criminality?,34
320,Mr FOWLER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"He would be able to determine whether there was or was not ground for a criminal trial. But I think that, before the matter is referred to him, the House should be given some general information bearing on the whole case. The Attorney-General should not be asked to make the whole inquiry necessary to a definite conclusion; the House should participate in the matter, because it affects us as a whole, and not the vernment only.",34
321,Mr SINCLAIR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"We need the expeditious settlement of the case. ! Mr FOWLER - Expeditio n is all very well; but in a matter in which I was interested I was told by those who knew something about the course of the inquiry that there had been undue expedition, and that it would have been better if there had been a little more deliberation. In this instance, the best thing to do would be to appoint a Select Committee, or to honhave a Royal Commission composed of this honourable members of this House, and, his preferably, of gentlemen of legal training, to make an inquiry. If a Judge were to make the inquiry, there of would be this danger, that he might conf fine himself strictly and closely to legal procedure in the taking of evidence.",34
322,Mr JH CATTS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Would not a body of lawyers do the same thing?,34
323,Mr FOWLER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Not to the same exespecially if they were men having parliamentary experience, and instructed to to make a general inquiry. They would then probably take evidence which would the not be accepted by a criminal Court.",34
324,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Does the honmember suggest that these charges the should be tried on hearsay evidence? Mr FOWLER,-Certainl y not. But we should first obtain all possible information regarding these matters. I assure to the House, from personal experience, that I if the inquiry is conducted in accordance with the procedure of a criminal trial a great deal of information bearing on the bematters at issue will be rejected.",34
325,Mr ATKINSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Coul d not a Judge be offences given a Royal Commission?,34
326,Mr FOWLER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Yes ; but, again, in that case, there would be a danger of vital information being rejected.",34
327,Mr ATKINSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Not if the Commission were wide enough.,34
328,Mr FOWLER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I know of one inquiry of the kind which was kept within the limits of strict criminal procedure, and I do not wish to see that repeated.",34
329,Mr HIGGS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The honourable member's statement is an indictment of the whole judicial system. - Mr FOWLER - No . I am speaking of the tendency of a Judge to follow the procedure with which he is familiar. My contention is that the investigation should Go- have a broader scope than that of an ordinary criminal trial.,34
330,Mr ATKINSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"In the case to which the honourable member referred, did not the Judge consider himself restricted by the terms of his commission?",34
331,Mr FOWLER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I do not wish to discuss that case. I merely instance it. I have stated in regard to it what was told to me by some of the leading legal men of this city, and have repeated it for the instruction of the House. The inquiry that we need would be on broad, general lines, and if the case assumes the serious character that the honourable member for Bourke indicates, there will be opportunities for a criminal trial subsequently.",34
332,Mr BRENNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Batman) [5.57] - I am glad that all parties are agreed as to the gravity of the situation disclosed, or partly disclosed, by the honourable member for Bourke. I deplore the fact that the chaotic and unsatisfactory condition in which we now find ourselves is the natural result of the policy of the Government and of the House in regard to military matters. It arises from our surrender of our proper functions, and from the handing over to unqualified persons of what should be the business of civil Courts, namely, the duty of eliciting, and weighing evidence. I join with the honourable member for Perth in objecting to the proposal of the honourable member for Henty as to the nature of the inquiry that should be held. I agree with him, too, that the matter ought not to .be remitted to the Attorney-General, and that the inquiry need not be made by a Judge. In my opinion, it could best be made by a Select Committee of this House. I know what the honourable member for Perth had in his mind. It is natural that he should think that if a Judge were appointed a Commissioner, he might consider himself strictly bound by the terms of his commission, which might be too narrow. A Judge possessing a trained judicial mind would not consider that he could go beyond the terms of his commission, and it has happened in this State that an inquiry has been thwarted by reason of the narrowness of the commission under which it was held. We want a full and wide inquiry. But we do not desire that the ordinary principles governing the eliciting and weighing of evidence should be disregarded. The honourable member for Bourke complained last night that one of the first principles of evidence was disregarded when a document was referred to, and, although a material part of the evidence, was not ordered to be produced, and its non-appearance was not explained.'",35
333,Mr WISE,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Evidenc e of the contents was nevertheless given. Mr BREIvNAN - Yes , and that evidence was weighed, although no attempt was made to explain why the document had not been produced, or what had become of it. Every one conversant with legal procedure knows that at the first mention of such a document a demand should have been made for its production, and its contents should not. have beeu admitted in evidence until it had been produced, or until it had been shown that it could not be produced, but that its contents were nevertheless provable. I desire that the proposed inquiry shall have an unlimited scope, but that the evidence shall be elicited by skilled persons. I think that it should be made by a Select Committee. It is immaterial whether its members be skilled in the law or not, if it has legal assistance, but it would be well to choose some lawyers. The trouble of the honourable member for Henty seems to be that there is a suspicion that looting took place at Rabaul, and that the matter has not been satisfactorily tried. The question whether looting took place at Rabaul is unimportant compared with some others raised by the honourable member for Bourke. No doubt looting is a grave offence, but it is an incident common in a great war, and certain to take - place when large bodies of men are engaged.",35
334,Mr FOWLER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Looter s are liable to be shot, and have been shot during the present war.",35
335,Mr BRENNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Rightl y so. I do not extenuate the offence. The looter, whether an oflicer or in the ranks, should be dealt with most severely. But the question whether looting took piace at Rabaul sinks into insignificance beside the more important question whether corruption and impropriety can be rightly charged against our officers in' command there.. That is the subject which should be investigated by a Committee of this House. The evidence should be elicited and weighed by persons trained in the art of eliciting and weighing evidence, so that we may have an illuminating, satisfying, and convincing report. There should not be even a shadow of a doubt on the mind of the public as to whether those whom we have appointed to lead our soldiers at the risk of their lives, and as trustees of the country's reputation, did what was right. I hope that a Committee will make an inquiry on broad lines, aud that it will act promptly. I congratulate the Government on having taken prompt action in regard to the court martial, and I hope that Ministers will again act promptly, and in the manner suggested.  are two matters which I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister, because they have not been touched upon with the emphasis which, I think, they warrant. In the first place, I desire to refer to what appears to be the inordinate delay of the Defence Department in attending to the applications from country districts for increased rifle range accommodation. In the State of New South ""Wales there is no greater recruiting agency in existence than the rifle clubs, and it seems to me ridiculous to encourage the inauguration of rifle clubs if the Government are not in a position to provide them with ranges on which to improve their marksmanship. Applications have been made for rifle ranges in several districts in the Hume electorate, and the same old stereotyped reply has been received from the Department that an officer would be sent to inspect the suggested sites as soon as one is available. It seems extraordinary that there should be so much waste of time in choosing a site on which men could practise shooting. I have authentic information that the rifle club at Wagga Wagga would have a membership of over 100 if proper range accommodation were provided. At another country town called Balldale the young men are very enthusiastic about learning to shoot straight, but an extraordinary time has elapsed since their application for a rifle range was sent in, and no endeavour is being made to conform to their wishes. I do urge the Defence Department to take notice of the applications from these and other places in Australia, because this matter is of the greatest importance to the people. The other matter to which I desire to refer is that which formed the subject of a question which I put to the Postmaster General today, namely, the postal facilities provided for the soldiers at Broadmeadows. On the 7th May I forwarded to a lieutenant, who was in a regiment at Broadmeadows, a communication from the Assistant Minister of Defence.. That lieutenant, I know, was at Broadmeadows until Friday last, and I believe he is there still, but the letter which I addressed to him at Broadmeadows was returned to me today through the Dead Letter Office. If that incident indicates the nature t i the postal facilities at the camp, the authorities responsible for such a service may accept my hearty congratulations. It seems as if there is a great deal of carelessness somewhere which should be investigated carefully. Such an incident lends colour to the statements which one hears that communications addressed to soldiers at Broadmeadows are never delivered. I hope the Minister will see that somebody is brought to book over this matter, and that steps will be taken to allay the anxieties that are frequently attendant upon the non-delivery of correspondence addressed to the camp.

338,Mr WATT,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I ask the question, not to embarrass the Minister, but because it does seem singular that the report for the year ended the 30th June, 1913, was only produced recently, and surely the Small Arms Factory is a concern that should be up to date.",36
339,Sir ROBEKT BEST,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The position is the same with all the other Government factories.,36
340,Mr WATT,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The reports are absolutely vital in the case of the Small Arms Factory, and particularly so in view of the fact that the manager is leaving the Commonwealth. I hope the Minister will expedite the production of the report for 1914, and, if possible, lay it on the table next week. Proposed vote agreed to.

341,Mr WATT,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Balaclava) [6.17] - I desire to ask the Assistant Minister whether the Government have given consideration to the question of replacing the lost submarines either during the currency of the war or at its termination. Our loss in that class of vessel has been total, and the Committee would feel reassured if honourable members were told that the replacing of the losses had already received the attention of the Government.",37
342,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The Naval Board has that matter under consideration, with a view to making a recommendation to the Minister for the next Estimates. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [6.18] - Is this a matter for the Naval Board?",37
343,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The Naval Board makes a recommendation for all vessels.,37
344,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Of course, the Board does; but it does not know how much money the Government have avail.able for expenditure on defence. Naval Board is an executive body for the purpose of carrying out the policy of the Government. The replacing of the submarines is a matter of prime policy for the consideration of the Government. Apparently the Government are taking the matter very complacently, and have asked the Board to make a recommendation for the next Estimates. Other countries are. scouring the whole world for naval and military resources, and the inquiry of the honourable member for Balaclava is, I take it, as to whether the lost submarines are to be replaced some years hence or at the earliest possible moment.",37
345,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I hope we shall soon have more than two submarines.,37
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"And I should like them all to be built in Australia if possible. But I do not think that the Minister of Defence ought to wait on local resources in this connection, unless the local resources are proved to be equal to the occasion.",37
347,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The submarine is the one class of vessel that it is impossible to .build in Australia.,37
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Then the inquiry as to how the Government propose to replace the lost vessels is all the more pertinent.,37
349,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The Minister is now in consultation with the Admiralty concerning them.,37
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I am glad to hear that, and I should be better pleased if I knew the Minister was in consultation with the Admiralty with respect to another capital ship.",37
351,Mr WATT,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I suppose we could not get such a ship built during the war ? 1,37
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I am not so sure of that. The British Government have a way of getting these things; and, at any rate, my inquiry is a pertinent one. I hope the Government will take care, not only that we replace the submarines, but that the policy of keeping the Navy up to its proper strength will be pursued after the war is over.",37
353,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I can assure the honourable member that it is the intention of the Minister to keep on building.,37
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I suggest that the Government keep on buying, as well as building, because I am afraid that, with our local resources j there is not The much prospect of our adding to our capital ships, and the war has shown the need of some vessel similar to a sister ship to the Australia. If we had had two capital' ships instead of one at the outbreak of the war, we should, without doubt, have accounted for the German vessels here. I hope the Assistant Minister will impress on the Minister of Defence the necessity for - bestirring himself in regard to the augmentation of the Navy, and the replacement of those vessels which, unfortunately, have been lost.  war appears to have been an eye-opener in many directions, and certainly the value of the submarine has been amply illustrated. We see what Germany has been able to accomplish with these vessels.",37
355,Sir ROBERT BEST,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Ver y little.  that; but, in any case, we have heard accounts of what our own submarines have been able to accomplish. I think that when a British submarine can go out with eight torpedoes, and account for eight enemy vessels, it is a splendid record, which proves how valuable the submarine is for port defences. I have come to the conclusion that these vessels are really the most valuable branch of the naval service. When we consider the relatively small cost of this type of vessel, and the effective work it is capable of. we are justified in impressing on the Government the necessity to increase the number. Such a policy would strengthen the confidence of our people, and prove satisfactory to all sections of the community. Proposed vote agreed to.

356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Parramatta) Sitting [6.27] - I find that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction abroad as to the officerjourned ing of our Forces, and complaints of various kinds are made. Some men are told that they are too young, and others that they are too old; some are able to get commispartment. sions forthwith, while others have to wait an unconscionably long time, and red-tape is still in the Department, reeling itself out by the mile. Generally, things are not what they ought to be; and, perhaps, it would be better for me to give a crete case which came under my notice concerning a friend of my own. This friend was in London at the time the war broke out, endeavouring to raise capital for a small gold mine he owns in Western Australia, and he immediately volunmonths teered as a private with an Australian regiment which was then being formed. For some reason the idea of an Australian regiment was not carried out, and those who had joined were drafted into the Fusiliers. He was with the Fusiliers for about six months, and reached the rank of sergeant. My friend was through the Boer War, and is a well-set-up and welltrained man; and, finding that the Fusiliers were not going to the front, he felt a desire to join the Australians in Egypt. With that object in view he saw Major Buckley, - who told him that if he got his technical discharge from the Fusiliers and went to Egypt, he would give him a letter to Colonel Whyte, through whom he would probably get a commission. At his own expense he went to Egypt, where he was told that the ranks were full, and that nothing could be done for him; but an officer from Western Australia suggested that if he came to Melbourne he would be almost sure to get a commission. Accordingly he came to Melbourne with all his papers in order, and testimonials speaking in the highest terms of his character as a man and his abilities as a soldier. Senator Pearce, however, would not see him, and he was informed that there was nothing for him but to join the ranks as an ordinary recruit. In the meantime he had received a warm letter of commendation from Colonel Foster, of Sydney University, who ought to be a good judge of what constitutes a good soldier. I may say that when my friend arrived here; sent him with a note to Colonel Legge. suspended from 6.30 to 7J/5 p.m.",38
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"When we adfor dinner, I was relating a singular case which came under my own observation as indicative of the red-tape methods still pursued by the Defence DeI t is the case of a man who travelled all over the world, practically at his own expense, to get to the front. I had shown how he had enlisted in London, gone to Egypt by advice, at his own expense; how he had then been referred conon to Melbourne, again covering his own expenses; how he could not get to the Minister here, but was simply told to go and recruit again like any untrained man. It is the case of a man who had been all through the Boer war, and served six with the Fusiliers' at Home, a thoroughly trained and well set-up man. At that point, I gave him a note to take to Colonel Legge in the hope that the latter would look at his papers, and give him what he wanted. Colonel Legge gave him nothing but the same advice, to go and join the ranks, and begin again as a recruit. The only thing that the man wants-the thing that has cost him all this journey and expense-is to get to the front as a private without being put to the humiliation of being trained all over again. Would not any one imagine that the Department would jump at a man like this? He has now gone back to Western Australia, and I believe has i'oined the Porce there as a private in the tope that he may get away to the front speedily.  ",38
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"He worked his way up to be a sergeant in the Fusiliers in the Old Country. My complaint is that here is a man who is ready and eager to go and fight, but the Department will not even take the trouble to send him.  him to go to the front from the Old Country ?",39
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That I cannot tell the honourable member, and the man could not tell me. There was some reason why the particular battalion was to be kept in England, and not sent to the front, and that was why he left the Fusiliers. While we are going to the expense of training recruits, and keeping them here for five or six months to make them fit, here is a well-trained, thoroughly set-up, experienced man who finds it impossible to get to the front. It is only one instance. I have no doubt that many other anomalies of this kind occur. They all show that no matter how big the system, or how complete the machinery is, there should still be some room to treat these cases without subjecting them to the process of the slow-grinding machine. I still think that an effort should be made to let the machinery master the situation entirely, that the Minister should grip the machine instead of letting the machine grip him. That is the only lesson I want to draw from the incident, and I put the case as one of many, which show unmistakably that the machine has a tendency to grij> even the most capable,-alert, and intelligent Minister, unless he in turn takes the machine into his ownhands, resolutely grips it , and moulds and shapes it to the object he has in view. I do not intend to further criticise the item, but I do ask the Minister to keep an open mind in connection with such cases, because it means money saved to the Commonwealth, and increased efliciency at the front. I am not so sure that a special effort ought not to have been made right at the beginning to get thoroughly trained men who are ready to go and fight at once, and form brigades or battalions, or companies of them. If they are ready to go, let them go, instead of putting them into the ranks with raw recruits, and wasting all their time and the country's money in putting them through a process which they Jea-rnt years and years ago. sure that the Leader of the Opposition would not wish to do one' soldier an injustice, no matter what his rank may be, but I can tell him the procedure in the Imperial Military Forces. Once a man leaves the service, either by purchase or by discharge, as sergeant, or what ever rank he holds, directly he leaves that rank is filled by somebody else. They give a man, however, three months to consider whether he will come back again or not. Tf he goes over that term he has to join again as a recruit, and it is only by the recommendation of his commanding officer, after twelve months' service, that he even gets the past service allowed him, never mind what his past rank was.",39
360,Mr SINCLAIR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That is in time of peace.  there are no two sets of King's Regulations, one for war and the other for peace. A soldier is a soldier from the day he joins until the day he leaves, and he is under the same regulations then as ne is on active service. If I was young enough tomorrow, I would go and join as a recruit. If the man to whom my honourable friend referred has the profession at heart, and the knowledge which he has attributed to him, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that he would get his rank back in a very few days indeed.",39
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"He is not anxious to get his rank back, but only to get to the front.  Suppose that a - company consists of ninety-nine recruits, and one man who has been through the drill. Are you join, going to send him oh his own, or let him wait for the rest of the company?",39
362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"No , but I should think, as he is fit to go, you would send him with a company that is going. is the point.  - doubt that the man would be sent away at the earliest opportunity once he came efficient. I do not see much hardofficers ship in the case. If the man was as anxious to go to the front as he told ""Honourable member, why did he leave the front and go to the back, as it were, order to get to the front again? that is practically what he has done. Only this afternoon I read in some London newspaper's advertisements in which the authorities ask for trained men who reservists, or_who have been ih service, in'alite'f what their age; is, so long as are physically fit. Could not this man I have gone with that, crowd $ There is - chance for him. There, must tfeflg bfenin'd all this business.",40

368,Mr MCGRATH,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Ba'llarat) [7.57] -^if Earlief ih the debate on the JEstimates few for the Defence Department I asked ft he question concerning the remuneration of non-coihmissioned officers. . Their ihcfemehts were due about last July, but have not yet been received. The Minister of Trade ""and Customs interjects that it is due to the fact that ""the Estimates have not been passed. I desire to know if proto vision is made in them for increments to ribn-c'ommissiohed officers;.and while the Assistant Minister is obtaining the desiredinformation I wish to point out that a very great injustice is being done to the men. They are not permitted to volunteer or go to the front, although four of them got away with the First Expedition, and received a.-commission, in the Imperial Army. . The British authorities recognised the worth of these men, but in Australia the best omcers we have are not permitted to enlist to go abroad.. They have no opportunity of getting increases of salary, yet they are told that their services are so valuable that they cannot be spared. If that is so, surely some recognition should be made of their services by an increase of pay. I know some school teachers who are Area Officers. I know one who is getting £400 a year as a school teacher, and £180 a year as an Area Officer for putting in not more than an hour's work each week. All some of them do is to sign the sheets. The"" sergeant-majors do all the. work. They are the men upon whom the very, foundation of our defence system rests, a'nd yet the highest salary they can get is £240 a year. Many of them are only getting from £160 to £180. They have no opportunities for promotion. cently the Minister of Defence gave sixteen senior non-commissioned officers temporary commissions, but he has not filled the sixteen vacancies created, though the restof the non-commissioned officers naturally expected that there would be a. general lift up as the result. I am glad to see the Minister of Defence is in the House, and I hope he will recognise the good work that is being done by these men who are'training the troops for service abroad. Our soldiers would not have done the good work that they have done at the Dardanelles had it not been for the splendid preliminary services of the sergeant-majors, who are well worthy of an increase of salary. All the vacancies that occur are ""filled by militia officers, who, though not connected with the Army, are appointed to positions worth up to £500 a - year. Yet the sergeant major is practically the instructor of these men. He is forgotten, kept upon a small salary almost without any increase. He is unable to enlist for service abroad,' as many are anxious to do, and has to stay at home and train the recruits. I .am not going, to argue against that. The Defence .Department should be the Mr MCGRATH. "" best judges of what is required - in that: respect; but if the services of-these mem are so valuable, surely we ought to showsome practical recognition, and give them' increases of pay.",40
369,Mr JENSEN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Bass-Assistant Minister of Defence) [8.3] - May I say, in-, answer to the honourable member's query,that provision is included in the sum shown under Instructional Staff pay, for the payment of all increments due under: the regulations. Division agreed to. Division 82 (Postage and Telegrams),. £8,000; agreed to. Division 83 (Rifle clubs and associations), £29,750.",41
370,Mr SAMPSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Wimmera) [8.7] May I draw attention to the fact that the amount set aside in connection with therifle clubs this year is only £21,000, as. against £35,000 last year. I should like, the Minister to take notice of the fact. I think this Department requires some reorganization, particularly in regard to the construction of rifle ranges. We have at the present time two different sections, of - the Defence Department responsible Re- for the construction of ranges. Themilitary authorities are responsible for military ranges, and the rifle club department is responsible for the construction of rifle club ranges. Both rifle club members and members of the Citizen Forces use these ranges. This is, of course, to some extent,.as it should be. But the reorganization which I think is necessary is that the erection of rifle ranges generally should be placed under one authority. There is no reason why. either the military branch, or the. rifle club branch, should not undertake the construction of all ranges, so that we may have some expedition in the Work that has to be done. The experience of nearly every honourable member of this House is that inordinate delays exist in the construction of ranges. "" In my experience the military authorities generally take far longerto .construct their ranges than does the rifle club administration ; and I think the matter might well be placed in charge of the officer responsible for the administration of rifle clubs generally. Another phase of this question which has arisen - since the war began relates to,.ithe construction of miniature ranges. A large number of the citizens. of Australia is now engaged in some elementary form of drill. Men are turning up regularly once a week, sometimes more frequently, for drill. We do not know how long this war is going to last, or how far it may be necessary to call upon more men from Australia, or whether, in the long run, it may not be actually necessary to defend Australia, and, bearing all these contingencies in mind, we ought not to overlook the fact that large numbers of men are enrolling for the purpose of making themselves more or less efficient as part of the Australian Defence Force. There is only one way by which these men can receive instruction in rifle shooting, particularly in the congested parts of the Commonwealth, and that is by the erection of miniature rifle ranges. We have it on the best authority that miniature ranges are capable of giving men such training that they can almost go straight on to the battle-field from such a range. I think it was General Hamilton who stated that men had surprisingly little to learn when they got on to an open range after a thorough shooting drill on a miniature range; and, in my view, the erection of more of these ranges, particularly, as I say, in the congested centres population, will very largely solve the question of shooting efficiency amongst our citizens. In the country districts we should have, I admit, open ranges; but these can be constructed far more expeditiously than they are being constructed now. I hope the Minister will look into this phase of the question, and endeavour, if possible, to bring under one heading the responsibility for the construction of all-rifle ranges. There is no reason why we should not train up a citizen soldiery quite outside the ordinary regular troops which would be effective in case of national defence; and I hope a large number of miniature rifle ranges will be constructed, in order not only to encourage the Citizen Forces, but also that large body of men, beyond the age of enlistment for active service, who are training to fit themselves in the best way they can for the defence of their country.",41
371,Mr MANIFOLD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Corangamite) [8.12] - I should like also to impress upon the Assistant Minister of Defence the necessity for pushing along with the constructionof more rifle ranges. When the present Government "" were' in power [127]- 2 on the last occasion, they gave a very seri-. ous check to the rifle club movement; at all events so far as Victoria is concerned. Because the compulsory system was new, and the Government wished to encourage it, they seized the ranges that had been occupied by the rifle clubs, and today the position of rifle clubs is no better than it was then. Saturday is a great day for rifle shooting, and where there is anything like a large force of citizen soldiers they take possession of the available ranges, so that the rifle club members cannot get any show at all. In my own electorate I know cases where land, has been secured for the construction of rifle ranges, and where everything apparently has been done but the actual work of construction. The Minister knows perfectly well that if he wants to acquire land for rifle range purposes, he has the necessary power, and I hope the work of construction will in future be expedited. At present it seems to take something like two years to accomplish the preliminaries, and even then, apparently, it is impossible to get a start made. There is a great amount of unemployment in Australia at the present time, and these rifle ranges of might very well be constructed by people out of work. I want to put in a claim, on behalf of the people in the large towns throughout the Commonwealth where, the ranges are being used by the military' people on Saturdays; and where something should be done, I think, in order to give the rifle clubs one or two more targets. A remarkable thing happened at Colac. The rifle club had a range on its own property. It was, I admit, subsidized to a. certain extent, but the military authorities acquired land alongside this range to put up a military range; hut, first of all, they wanted to"" pull down the rifle club's range. It .was doing no harm, and today is a perfectly safe range. At the time. I thought there would be civil war in Colac as the result of this proposal, about which I interviewed Senator Millen, who was then Minister of Defence. The rifle club now has its range alongside the military range, and everything is perfectly satisfactory.",42
372,Mr SAMPSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"As a matter of fact, there is too much divided authority. *",42
373,Mr MANIFOLD,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"There is, and it is very disheartening to anybody who is - en-, deavouring to do something for the rifle clubs. I have almost given up writing to the Defence Department about rifle clubs, or endeavouring to induce them to start work at places where land has already been secured. Some honourable members have referred to the Department as running the Minister. I think that must be so. At the present time the rifle club movement has been practically stopped. I agree that, as ammunition is not available, this was almost an unavoidable proceeding, but surely there can be more control in this Department than seems to be the case. I know one place in the country where there were ten or a dozen cases of ammunition awaiting use by the Light Horse in the adjoining country, but there were no Light Horse to use the ammunition. Yet it was allowed to remain unopened, whilst letters were received from the military authorities, saying that there was no ammunition available for the rifle clubs. It was pointed out that these cases were lying idle for a non-existent Light Horse regiment, and eventually the military authorities gave permission for four boxes to be taken out. Surely some better check can be kept upon stores than this incident seems to suggest-that ammunition can be allowed to lie tiniised whilst the rifle clubs are perishing for want of ammunition. I hope the Minister will look into this rifle club movement, and see if something cannot be done, more especially how that there is any amount of labour in the country. Where the soil has to be moved for the construction of a range there are plenty of men available. Surely the rest could be done by one of the departmental experts.",42
374,Mr SINCLAIR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Moreton) [8.15] - I would be very pleased if the Assistant Minister of Defence would explain why the item "" Grants to district rifle club unions distributed pro raid to number of efficients "" has been reduced from £5,000 to £100. I would also suggest to him the desirableness of placing an additional sum on the Estimates next year for the encouragement of niiniature rifle shooting. The honourable member for Winn mera has already called attention to the fact that this form of rifle shooting might at the .present time very well take the place of ordinary rifle shooting. I quit* agree with him, and I am sure that there are thousands of citizens throughout Australia who would be bnly too pleased ib learn all they can of marksmanship, i l miniature rifle shooting were brought within their reach. Very often it is impossible to secure rifle ranges within a reasonable distance of populous centres, and it frequently happens that men have to travel several miles in order to reach a range. But if miniature rifle ranges were established within the towns, thousands would be only too glad to avail themselves of the opportunity of learning all that they can of rifle shooting. . Mr JENSEN (Bass-Assistant Minister of Defence) [8.1?! - The item to which the honourable member has referred has been reduced because of the absence of competitions this year. I am in general sympathy with .the views that have been expressed by the honourable member for Wimmera, and will not lose sight of them in connection with next year's Estimates. Proposed vote agreed, to. Division 83A (Expeditionary Forces)., £13,200,000, agreed to. Division 83B (Other war services), £128,000.",43
375,Mr HAMPSON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Bendigo) [8.2b] - t should like some information concerning the item "" Pay bf censors and their staffs, £28,500."" What is the position occupied by these censors, and what is their attitude towards the speeches delivered in this Parliament t I have noted that they exercise a certain amount bf cbhtrdl ov6r' the publication of statements made iii this Chamber, and I would like to know wh5 have been appointed tb these positions, and how the business bf censoring reports is conducted. What instructions have been issued to these gentlemen, and what powers of discrimination do they possess ? I know that I can read in the Times what appear td be full and ff§8 criticisms in. the German Reichstag concerning the conduct of the war I da t not know what is the position of bur censors here concerning the utterances of honourable members. I would like information on this point. I also desire an explanation of the item "" Expenditure in connection, with interned enemy subjects, £97,000."" I desire to know what number of enemy subjects are interned in the Commonwealth, what they are doing, and what pay they are receiving: Mf. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [8.22] - The honourable member for Bendigo has raissed^avery important questibn f in regard'fo the censorship not only bf the utterance's of honourable members in this Parliament, but of their utterances, outside of it . I think it is time that the Ministry cleared up the position in some way or other. It is about as unsatisfactory as it can be. 1 may say at once that I have discussed this matter with the Minister, and that I have also had some conversation regarding it with the chief censor. As a result I am not at all satisfied that the present position is satisfactory, or that the best thing possible is being done. Whatever I have to say in this connection will, I hope, be viewed from the objective of abolishing some of the irksome restrictions which now trammel our utterances, and of thus lea.ding to a. more reasonable censorship than exists at the present time. I imagine that it ought to. be. accepted as a fundamental proposition that anything which is published in the newspapers at Home may surely be published here. Seeing that we are contributing only a modicumand a small modicum-toward s the defence of the Empire, we surely have as much right to criticise men, munitions, and war preparations as have the people in the Old Country, which is carrying the chief responsibility for the entire conduct of the war. Yet our censors are every day ruling out statements which are far less important and far less critical than are those which are being made by all sorts of persons in the daily newspapers of Great Britain . Quite recently a censor here, acting under somebody's instructions, would not allow a reference to be made to the desirableness, of inaugurating a second shift at our Small Arms Factory. Two Committees of this Parliament have now reported in favour of that, step, namely,' the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Works Committee. They have, inquired into the matter very thoroughly, and they both affirm that, in the interests, of war preparations, a second shift should be inaugurated at. the earliest possible moment. They go further and affirm that,, in the interests, of the economical working of the plant at the Factory, a further effort, should be made to obtain the requisite material and to employ a double shift.",43
376,The CHAIRMAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Order ! The honourable member must not discuss,, that mat? ter under this item.",44
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I am not, going to do sp. I am, merely illustrating my point that our censorship'is urinepesjarily r e at r i c , t e o ; ; ' f",44
378,Mr FENTON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Does the honourable member say that it is proposed to censor the reports of the two Committees, to which he. has referred?",44
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"No . I do not know what they are going to do in reference to them. But I say that, in view of what has already been done in the matter of utterances outside this chamber, the censor ought to censor those reports. Only the other day Senator Millen made a suggestion to. the Minister that the Factory ought to be working, a double shift-r-a statement which was published in the press, I understand, because some censor allowed it to pass. That officer was promptly carpeted and in structed that he must not permit that sort of thing in the future. The censor, acting, on the jacketing which he had received, promptly proceeded to censor the statement of the Minister in reply to. Senator Millen, and of course was immediately carpeted once more. He was then told that he must let the Minister's reply go through. But when Senator Millen attempted to make a rejoinder, down came the censor upon his utterance., with the result that it has never appeared in print . Yet it was. a statement of the/ mildest character, as honourable members, will admit when I read it . It is as follows:- ^ I am extremely, disappointed with Senator Pearce's observations regarding my recent statement as to the practicability of. organizing a second shift for the Small Arms Factory. Senator Pearce practically asks the public, to, take it forgranted that everything is being done thai is possible, and with a view to discountingcriticism, speaks of the undesirability of supplying information to the enemy. This is not a question of supplying information to. t.he enemy but of making additional 4 rifles, to be used against them. I should be only too willing to refrain from further reference to the matter but for its overshadowingimportance. Every, day's cables from, ©rent Britain ' emphasize-arid ' latterly in. very pointed language-^-the need for additional munitions'. Senator Pearce admitsthis need, and yet 'the fact remains that with all the. resources of Australia to draw upon, and after nine, months of* war, the Lithgow Factory. is> working with only a single shift. This fact speaks for itself, and it is not to be concealed by phrases of mysterious import. I haye made, ample inquiries justifying my original' assertion that a second' shift"" can be organized, and indeed should, have been at wock long ago. ' Holding that opinion, I should have failed in an obvious duty if I had not directed attention to the failure ofthose responsible tp utilize the, resources of the Small Arms Fac1 ° ' 15 tory to the fullest' extent. ""That statement was censored and was not allowed to be published. If this sort of 'thing is permitted, we have reached the stage when, no matter how incompetent and. dilatory our public officials may be, and; no matter how the Minister himself may be failing in his duty, we must not .indulge' in criticism, and the Minister .may shelter himself from attack under - the censorship for which he alone is responsible. If it be a fact that the Small - Arms Factory can be worked two shifts, ^nd that it is only working one, I have JQO hesitation in saying that that is one .pf the best ways of which I have any .knowledge of defeating the Empire. And so it comes about that the censorship - ostensibly exercised to prevent the enemy defeating us may, by that very means, give the enemy such advantages, and : .allow him to get on such a head of steam in respect of his own preparations, as to snake it impossible to do anything against him. That is not what we desire. We want criticism of a helpful kind, and the greatest publicity given to that criticism in the public press. But while Senator Millen's mild criticism is turned down, these same censors permit the publication of the following criticism, which was evidently passed also by the censors in Great Britain' The Bishop of Pretoria (Dr M. B. Furse), in a letter to the Times after a month's visit to the Army in Northern France and Flanders, appeals to the nation to adopt compulsory service. He says :-""The troops think that the nation is not backing' them up as it could and should."" That is'a very plain and distinct statement^- "" They feel'that the ignorance and apathy at Home - are .needlessly increasing their danger of losses. ""After fighting desperately day and night for weeks with frightful losses, the men, dog-tired, are yet sent back to,the firing line after three days' - rest. They naturally conclude that there are - not. enough troops available. Battalion after battalion in. the - Ypres salient had to sit in the trenches and be pounded by the German high explosives with no.guns capable of keeping down the German fire. . "" The men naturally conclude that the nation has failed to provide sufficient guns and ammunition, . Similarly they find the. Germans ready 'to answer every British bomb with five or ten bombs. The troops know that it is little short of murder to ask men, however full of fight and spirit, to face an enemy amply - equipp.ed with big guns and the right ammunition unless they are equipped with equally effective munitions."" "" jU'r. Joseph Cook. These statements are passed by our own censors, and allowed to be published, but a mild criticism, such as that offered by Senator Millen regarding the working of a second shift at the Small Arms Factory, is promptly censored, and not allowed to appear in the press.",44
380,Mr WATT,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Does not the right honourable gentleman recognise that it was the publication of Lt - Colonel a'Court Repington's criticism in the Times that led to the reconstruction of the British Ministry?,45
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I was about to point out that British public opinion no doubt forced on the reconstruction that has just taken place. I have before me a budget of statements taken from the Times, which are infinitely stronger than anything Senator Millen has stated. But while those statements may go over the whole world through the medium of the English newspapers, we may not here contribute a small modicum of criticism on our defence making for fear that it should influence the war - Anything more ludicrous than the censorship in Australia cannot be conceived. The Small Arms Factory is working but one shift a day, and two Parliamentary Committees have reported that it should be working two shifts; yet, when a responsible ex-Minister of Defence makes that statement, it is not allowed to appear in the press for fear of some untoward circumstance occurring favourably to the enemy. The sooner we rid ourselves of this sort of thing the better. There is another aspect of this matter to which I should like to call attention, and that is that there is, it seems, a double censorship of all news from oversea published in Australia. It is censored at the other end of the world, and censored again at this end. I do not think that was ever contemplated. I find, for instance, that Mr. MCKenna, speaking on this matter in the House of Commons, laid it down as a general principle that ""What has been passed here will, in ordinary' circumstances, be considered to have passed for the whole world."" Our censors do not so interpret their instructions. They insist upon exercising their own rights of censorship with respect to oversea news after it has passed the censors at Home. That being so,' the public of Australia are not allowed to know what is going on con1 - ceraing matters as to which the.""newspapers at Home are full. I submit that if we are going to stimulate recruiting, if we are going to bring home to the public mind of Australia the gravity of this war, we must let the people know the facts as - far as we can reasonably do so. We must let them know, also, that our own possibilities are not being exploited to ths fullest extent, and that everything is not as right as right can be. Wherever there ""is room for criticism that criticism should be permitted, and the true facts put before the people to the fullest extent compatible with the efficient prosecution of the war. It is of no use to humbug our'selves, and to act the part of the ostrich in connection with a war of this kind",45
382,Mr BEENNAN,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Does not the Leader - censors may make inferences. of the Opposition see that he would liable .to be interned if he did what he matter. he suggests? Has he not read the regulations that he passed?. \ Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That passed ?,46

The trouble 'to which I have referred comes, - I am clined to think,, from the-want of definite - and precise instructions to the censors. .We have sixty or seventy censors tralia, and I understand that there is only one department of censorship - In the ',01d Country specialization,of censorship :is provided for. .There is an independent censorship in respect of defence matters, another censorship concerning trade, in, short, .1 understand, four or five rate departments under responsible Ministers.

' the conduct of the war. This, I think, is where we are going wrong. We are overweighting these censors, and putting upon them responsibilities for which they are utterly and eminently unsuited. And so - the whole thing is being muddled and confused. We have sixty or seventy censors, and unless they are given precise^igsfeuctions to adopt, as far as possible^ a uniform interpretation, we are bound to have this trouble. A censor in Sydney, inter.preting some vague instructions issued by the Minister, refused to allow Senator Millen's very mild criticism to be published. Erom what I have seen of his .instructions, he was justified in doing so. - The fault lies, so far as I can see, in the - instructions issued by the Minister. The Inferbe - ences may be drawn in regard to any The censors may connect up - anything with the war and war preparations, and so rule out any statement, wheI ther it be really useful criticism or whether it be harmful. Something should be - done to remedy this state of affairs at the earliest possible moment. The whole Department,' I think, needs to be reorganized. Some trained ability ought to - be brought to bear on the censor's work, of so that we may know what we ought to know, and be prevented from knowing what, in the public interest, we should not to reknow. The Government must bring to to bear practical training on these matters, jusjt as they have had to do in connection with other things. Many of these difficulties have been overcome in the Old Count r y ; but we are still struggling with them jhere.

414,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I think it has. - Mr Glynn - I intended to tell the Minister privately one or two things which struck me in connection with this matter when reading the Bill. It seems to me that some of our war legislation may have a bearing upon the previous Navigation Bill, and I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not be too precipitate in introducing the amending Bill, because if the war does make a difference, it will be a pity if the measure were placed on our statute-book, and had to be modified substantially six or twelve months afterwards. The original measure might have to be amended. I do not know what will be the result of ing into operation at once that part of the Act dealing with British shipping. We do not want to impose any greater limitations upon British shipping than are absolutely necessary. Take the position with regard to our territories-the New Hebrides, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Carolines, and the Solomon Islands,' which are all British now. They are all affected to some extent by the provisions of the Navigation Act, though at the time that Act was passed some of the islands were under a different allegiance, and, consequently, came under different provisions of the Bill. Then consider also the position with regard to the Northern Territory. There are, I think; three different shipping companies plying there, and making about twelve voyages - a year. All these will be affected by Part 6 or 7 of the Act. It is bad - enough to have the voyages altered in consequence of the war, but if we bring the technical provisions of the Act to 'bear on the operations of these companies, necessary patience. and interfere with communication, the - position, so far as the Territory is con-cerned, will be far worse than at present.

421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Then I apprehend that we shall soon have a definite statement on the subject. I do not object to the time that.has been occupied. I should not mind spending £10,000 a year for ten years to arrive at a solution of the problem. One of the hindrances to the proper investigation of diseases of this kind is that, the inquiries are not set about in the right way, nor conducted with sufficient competency, patience, and liberality.. It is often thought that if investigators cannot show results at the end of a year or so, the expenditure-on their investigations should cease. But to study the life-history of a disease, and to ascertain the best means of dealing with it , may take years of laboratory experiments, and we cannot hope for satisfactory results unless we are willing to pay the necessary cost, and are provided with the : What Australia wants most of all is trained investigation applying itself to the study 'of diseases and pests. We do not pay enough for the work'.

But, notwithstanding these differences of opinion, I believe that out of the conflict of scientific wit will come scientific wisdom. I plead for patience and perseverance in regard to the investigation of the pests which are the bane of our producers, and I trust that money will not be grudged for investigations tending to 'increase the productivity of our fields and pastures, and to give an impetus to the primary industries, which must be the basis of the enduring prosperity. of any country. A little money spent with that object will abundantly justify itself, and if the case of only one of these diseases be sifted to the bottom and solved for the fruit-growers or farmers of Australia, it will repay a thousandfold the little money spent upon it, and the little time taken in bringing it to a completion.",50

This fact recalls one of the little incidents of the last elections. Talk about the body of Hector being dragged behind a chariot!

During the last twelve months or more Australia has suffered an internal shrinkage of least £30,000,000 worth of stock. I 1 ture to say that the loss of sheep has at least 25,000,000.",51

We can also put down an average price of £5 £6 per head for store cattle, and as loss of cattle has been 1,000,000 head in Sew South Wales alone, we bring can allow £5,000,000 as representing shrinkage, in the value of our herds of cattle, wtiichj with the loss of £25,000,000 worth of sheep, gives us a total shrinkage of '£3.0,000,000. in the value of'our flocks and herds, without taking into consider a-; tion the loss of horses, and other stock. Let us also take the position of agriculposts, ture during the same period. In the vious year the crop, throughout Australia was, about 110,0.00,000 bushels, w.hereas. last year the total - production was only 20,000,000 bushels. There was a shrinkage of at. least 80,000,000 bushels, and taking the. price qf wheat at 5s. a bushel, is] I reasonable estimate for that period, there, was, a loss of £2,0,000,000 on alone, Thus the loss of wheat and stock, during the period was from £.50,000,000. tV^Q.QOOjQqO.. The Minister will s,e,e that, with a reduction of 25. per cent, in t our flocks, the very least we can do is to see that we make the most of the stock rer maining, and that our duty in that rer spect is more important at this critical time than ever before in the history of our country. The Minister knows that Goevery animal or plant that grows in the The Commonwealth has a host of natural for enemies. That fact is well known as the result of world-wide research work, though very little of this has. been done in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition was right when he said that we had never been game enough to pay for the brains to. undertake laboratory wqrl? in Australia. There, has been no highme to class laboratory research work in the Commonwealth. It is high time it was. undertaken, particularly when we have at had this tremendous shrinkage to the ex?ventent of £60,000,000 through the drought,, been while at the same time, as a result of the war, our national debt has increased by £26,000,000, and we can see in sight in a debt of at least £50,000,000 before the war is over. The candle is being burnt at ends. The gap between our loss in production and our increase in the national debt is considerable, but it can be made up all the more quickly if Parliament will give consideration to the efforts of the producers in the task of comthe bating the host of natural enemies to which their stock and plants are the heirs. to It should not be left to a private memthe ber-the honourable member for Darling Downs-to give notice of his intention toin a Bill for the establishment of the a Bureau of Agriculture. I hope that the Government will give attention to this matter, and that theywill take into, con: sideration the tremendous loss the primary r producers have sustained, by the exhausr tion of their stock. As the producers, who are the chief aim of their direct imof taxation, are. the principal wood preand vater carriers, of the Commonwealth, the Government should do something for them on the other side of the ledger, md, while they are increasing the producers'burdens, help, them at the same time to? increase their, productivity. We cannot which go on loading up the primary producers and increasing their burdens without wheat helping them in some other direction. Dhe Minister of Trade and Customs, whois-' so favourable' to the establishment and! encouragement bf secondary industries, must know that these industries can only prove successful through increasing primary production and strengthening and encouraging primary industries. Therefore, I hope that he will at once state that the Government seriously intend to go oh with the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture, and that, in the next Estimates, an encouraging start will be made by appropriating a substantial sum with which to begin the work of such an institution.",51

The honourable members prevented that Bill from reaching, the statute-book were the supporters of the party now iii power. I say, moreover, that the honourable members on. the Government side of the House, have defeated every effort to date to place a similar measure on the statute-book. statement cannot be controverted. the Liberal party were in power previously an earnest effort was made to put the Bill through. The honourable member for Darliue Downs piloted the 1909 Bill through this House, and it was sent to another place, where members of the Labour party were ih force.

I have shown, in the opinion of the Ministers of Agriculture of the State's^The honourable senator was a Statesrighter thenthe Bill is not necessary, and that it will cause overlapping with what the States are already doing.",52
435,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I am afraid that the States think that today.,52

Then Senator Henderson saidThe honourable senator must recognise that the Bill is altogether unnecessary. If it has any serious purpose at all, it is simply meant to create a useless Department, which will have no particular functions to perform, other than tliose which the States are how performing, and which they are not inclined tb hana over to the Commonwealth. Senator de Largie said that f am quite satisfied that this measure has been introduced 'for no other purpose than tb supply the Senate with a "" stop-gap."" Senator Pearce SaidI am not convinced lhat we have yet reachfe'd the stage when we should have a Bureau of Agriculture. in .Senator Fi'hdle^ reminded us that .we were heaping lip expenditure of etner kinds, and c o n t in u e d who It seems to be an absolute waste of time to introduce a measure for the creation of what I consider would be a .superfluous Department.

That reveals the manner in which the Senate contemptuously threw out the Agricultural Bureau Bill on the only occasion on which it was seriously discussed in another place. What happened in this Chamber when the - Liberal Government again brought the Bill forward in 1913? It is well known that the honourable member for Capricornia made a dead set against the measure, and on every occasion he and other members of the Labour party made it quite clear that they would not permit any legislation of an effective character to be passed. The honourable member for Barrier asked, "" Will not this Bill mean the creation of more Government officials?"" That was the honourable member's trumpery reason for opposing, the Bill at that time. The honourable member for Capricornia said I am sorry that the Prime Minister-did not allow this measure to stand over until next session, because it has certainly been brought forward without due consideration. Then he continued in .his beautiful "" stone-walling "" way to allege other reasons for not passing the measure. He askedIf we pass the Bill, what are we going to do for the unemployed f The Government propose to expend anything up to £100,000 on a Bureau of Agriculture to assist pastoralists, who are, generally speaking, fairly .well-to-do, and to assist farmers, many of whom, unfortunately, are riot too well off."" The late Mr A r t h u r saidWhy do not the farmers join together and do this work for themselves? And the present Minister of Trade and Customs said I do not believe in creating a seventh Department, where six are already in existence, unless we have some guarantee of its usefulness.",52
437,Mr THOMAS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Is this waking up the dead ?,53
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I am speaking now of the attitude of honourable members opposite to the last Bill , just before the elections. The Labour party strangled our first proposal in another place, and they strangled the last one in this Chamber, making it impossible to pass it during the session; and this is followed now by the elimination from the Estimates of every copper for the purpose. I suggest to honourable members opposite that when next they go through the rural districts they should tell the people these facts, and never mind that little slip of mine, which only affected the question whether it was in this or in another Chamber that the measure received its quietus. The substantial fact remains, and cannot be rebutted, that every effort to pass an Agricultural Bureau Bill has been strangled by honourable members opposite, and I wish to put this on record because it will be useful in the near future.",53
439,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Yarra- Minister of Trade and Customs) [9.33] - The Leader of the Opposition has put his side of the question.,53
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I quoted facts.,53
441,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"There are facts on the other side. This Bill was introduced by . the present Leader of the Opposition himself one afternoon, and a very short debate ensued, lasting not longer than about three-quarters of an hour. I followed the Leader of the Opposition, and then the honourable member for Wannon, who rose, got leave to continue his speech. As a matter of fact, no more was heard of the measure for about three months, though the Bill remained on the notice-paper to do.duty at farmers' conferences, the opening, of agricultural shows, and so forth, in order to make country residents believe that something was being done on their behalf. . The honourable, member for. Hume .and the honourable member for Wannon know full well that the Bill was not brought on again until the last week of the session of 1913. Mr. JOSEPH COOK . ^ - I deny your statements in to to, and I challenge you to get the records of the session.",53
442,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I shall get Hansard for that session, and place the correct version before honourable members.",53
443,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"What is the Minister's answer, to the statement that the Government have made no provision in the Estimates ?",53
444,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"As I stated on a previous occasion, I , personally, think it unwise to create a seventh Department of Agriculture to overlap .the work of the - States, utiless^we come .to some, arrange-; 'ment with the States, as we did in the matter of bitter^pit. At the present time each - State has a Department making investigations into agricultural matters; and, of course, no one would object if the States were willing to transfer their powers, and leave only one central body to spend the money.",53
445,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Certain negotiations took place, and I understand that the States were agreeable to use their machinery for demonstration purposes, leaving the Federal Bureau to devote itself to research work.",54
446,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"So far as I know, the States have never agreed to an arrangement of that kind. It would be well, of course, if there were a Federal Bureau doing similar work to that which has been done in the United States. There the Federal Bureau is a sort of clearing house, and overlapping is prevented; but the States would not agree to a scheme of that kind. However, representations on the matter have been made to the States, and will be made again. Honourable members have' asked why no provision is made on the Estimates.",54
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"This is a matter which affects the farmers, and, therefore, the Minister declares that the States must be consulted, but. if it affected the cities the States would be ignored. M i . TUDOR - That interjection reminds us of the statement which the honourable member made at the Farmers' Conference at Maryborough- a statement that was wrong only in one respect, namely, the whole of it. The Government can carry, out only a certain portion of their programme in any one session; and as we did not propose to proceed with a measure of the kind during this year, or until after consultation with the representatives* of the States, it was not thought necessary to make any provision on the Estimates. As to bitterpit, if Dr MCAlpine is able to discover something to eradicate the pest, the Commonwealth will have done well - While the United States Government have spent over $1,000,000 in endeavouring to find some cure, the CommonwealthGovernment haye not spent more than £8,000 in four years. The Ministers of Agriculture of the whole of the States met, and unanimously agreed to ask the Federal Government to contribute £1,000* a year for four years, the States jointly con> tributing a similar sum; and this request was acceded to. Certain of the laboratory work is being carried out in the Federal laboratory at the rear of the Customs House in Flinders-street. Three reports have been completed. There is to be a further Conference of the Ministers of Agriculture and the Committee which was appointed representing the States and the Commonwealth, and the meeting is to take place before the termination of the four-year period in July or August next.",54
448,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Why did not the Prime Minister discuss this question with the State Premiers when he was with them the other day ?,54
449,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Simpl y because it is a purely agricultural matter. I am not clear as to what reports have been presented to Parliament. I am not sure that this particular report has not been presented; but I will make inquiries, and. if it has not been presented, see that it is made available at the first possible opportunity, because I think that every honourable' member who is. interested in the orehardists, and in fruit cultivation, will admit that this is a matter which, as the Leader of the Opposition knows perhaps better than any other honourable member, is very important indeed. If the States are anxious and put forth a request, as they did four years ago, that the experiment should be continued, I think that the Government will look on the continuation of the work favourably. At any rate, we do want to see what work is being done. As the right honourable member has said, we cannot judge in four years how much progress has been made in regard to the scientific investigation.  afraid that the explanation of the Minister of Trade and Customs, if it is an explanation, has not relieved the situation very much. If I remember rightly, dur^ ing the last election the electors throughout the length and breadth of Australia were told that if the Fisher Government were given a chance, they would soon prove themselves the friends of the farmer. Mr Mr-GRATH - So they have.  I can say is that they have a very curious way of showing their friendship, seeing that; according to these Estimates, they evidentlv propose to drop the whole of the administration of .the Bureau of AgricuL ture. - Mr FISHER - Hear , hear! Look the position in Queensland, with all the agricultural districts in our hands.  side the House the farmer will realise the actual position. I am astonished to find that so many honourable gentlemen on the other side, representing country constituencies, can sit here tamely and allow this blank in the Estimates to pass when they know that by-and-by many very awkward questions will be asked them in their constituencies as to their attitude towards the very men they are misrepresenting tb-day. It is a very extraordinary thing to me to discover that this Friendof-the-Farmer Government is only prepared to institute an investigation with regard to' bitter-pit.",54
450,Mr MCGRATH,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Would you like an investigation into the wheat scandal in toria ?  an investigation of every scandal, whatever it may be, wheat or otherwise; but at this juncture I.am more particularly interested with regard to the scandal of pests. When we take into consideration the fact that we have just gone through not ""a little drought,"" but the worse drought ""We have had in Australia since 1857-the Fisher drought",55
451,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Peopl e who know nothing about the country "" skite "" about it-.  honourable gentleman that there has been no severer drought in Australia since 1857 than the drought of 1914-15. If he likes to face the facts, and look into the matter as I know he could do, he will find that the time is not too late for him tb recant the Statement that it was only "" a little drpught."" Mr FISHER' - The honourable member is hot speaking seriously. He does not know anything about the matter.  lutely seriously, from' an intimate knowledge of the State of New South Wales and the western portion bf Queensland. The experience of Australia throughout its history has been that when We get a recufreiice of good seasons we also have a remarkable multiplicity of pie'sts. At this juncture, - when we are all sd cheerful and Jflyful in the' belief that the arbught is being bro'K'en up;' when we want tb have sbrne investigations £6 assist uS Very terially in the agricultural industry, we' at learn that the whole of the investigations, except as te bitter pit, are to go. by. the bbard. It does hot seem te me that a Government which acts in such a way can, from this day out, declare itself to be the friend of the farmer.",55
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Can you suggest any means to eradicate the pests on the other side?,55
453,Mr FISHER,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"A h 1 that is his idea.  eradicate those pests will be fcr the public te knbw their attitude from the agricultural point of view. If Ministers are not prepared to carry out the promises they made prior to the election, I think we can well leave them to the tender mercies of the constituencies at the next appeal, when I am satisfied that there Vic- will be ah eradication, though I would not like to go so far as to describe honourable gentlemen oh the other side as pelts. Mr JbSEPH COOK - It is bhly a term of endearment.  it. is only a political term of endearment. There are many matters which we have to take into consideration. Why doqs the Minister bf Trade and Customs single but bitter pit for investigation ? Why does he give a preference to the orehardists? Why dees he not take into kindly consideration other phases of agriculture, which are just as worthy of investigation as fruit-growing? I have no particular animus against the orehardists. I think that they ought to be helped, and I quite agree with previous speakers that the investigatien of bitter, pit could be well undertaken by the Federal Government; but have we no pests in the territories over which we have* sovereign rights? Have we no agricultural pests in the Northern Territory we are all hopeful bf developing? Are we, on the one hand, to blindly invite agriculturists to go into that country, and then, on the' bther hand, turn dewn the assist-' ah'ce whereby they can deal with the pests which they are bcund to discover? Is it hot a fact that in the trbpics, wherein most of the Northern Territory lies, the pests afe a great deal more virulent and : numerq,us than in the temperate zone's? Are we to understand that the whole ma- pf the Bureau of Agriculture is to go by the board simply, forsooth, because two or three honourable members on the other side of the House are afraid of some overlapping? May I tell the Minister of Trade and Customs that, in a personal interview with Mr Valder,.the Under-Secretary for Agriculture in New South Wales, when I discussed the whole of this position with him, he frankly admitted that they had no feeling against the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau under Federal auspices. He said that he would welcome its establishment, and do everything he possibly could to assist in its development. He declared that he would be prepared to assist all along the line, nnd when I pointed out that the State might have officers of scientific attainments who could be of assistance while the Commonwealth Government was creating a staff, he said frankly that he would be prepared to assist the Commonwealth in every way in that direction. Now, who is going to undertake the investigation of bitter pit for the Federal authorities? Are we to depend entirely on the State officers to do the work?",55
454,Mr TCDOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"He happens to be a Federal officer..  cultural laboratory which is already inEstimates vestigating some diseases and pests? the Could we not extend that laboratory so far as to do some of the work which we consider is the function of a Bureau of Agriculture? Surely it is not too late for the Minister to reconsider the posithe tion. But if , in his opinion, it too late now, I ask him to give to those who honestly and faithfully try represent the farming community an as was surance that in the next Estimates he include a sum of money in order that very important work may be continued. I think the position is too serious for it to be treated lightly, or for it to provoke jeers and sneers such as those flung at the honourable member for Wannon because he said he desired to see two blades of grass grow where one previously grew. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman opposite knows that this quotation from Dean Swift, of St. rick's, Dublin, who said that if any could devise means whereby two blades grass would grow where one grew prelast viously, or whereby two heads of wheat would grow where one grew previously, he would be doing more lasting good [128] to his nation than a whole breed bf politicians. Yet for making that quotation the honourable member is continually chided by members on the Government side of the House. If we can have any help from the Federal authorities whereby the diseases and pests which are largely responsible for preventing the attainment of that ideal can be successfully dealt with, we shall then show that politicians are as anxious as the Dean was for the nation to go ahead. I hope the Minister will reconsider the position and restore to the Estimates the sum of money voted for the purposes of the Agricultural Bureau.",56
455,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Yarra - Minister of Trade and Customs) [9.511 - The honourable member for Parramatta wanted to have placed on record the history of the Bureau of Agriculture Bill. Let me tell him that the Bill was introduced on the 9th July,56
456,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,What good is this?,56
457,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The honourable member wanted the matter on record. We are now within four weeks from the close of the financial year, and yet the honourable wanted a sum restored to these with only that period to go. But honourable member for Parramatta has put forward what he stated to be the facts. I want to put forward some others. The Bill was introduced on the 9th July, 1913. The second reading was taken on 5th September - about eight weeks is later. The Bill was brought up again on the 16th September and debated for to about twenty minutes. Subsequently it brought up on one or two occasions, will and the adjournment was moved, not by this a member of the Opposition, but by a member of the Ministerial party.",56
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Quite so.,56
459,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"And nothing more was heard of the Bill until the 17th December, the day before Parliament was prorogued.",56
460,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Wentworth) [9.53] - I think it absolutely astonishing that we is a should have a Minister of the Crown Patmaking a statement like that in this man House. Almost every one here is conof versant with what happened during the Parliament, and yet the Minister comes forward and, with his hand on his heart, arid with every appearance that he believes what he says, gives us this snagestio falsi-the Standing Orders will not permit me to put it in any otlier form-this attempt to hoodwink honourable members of this House and the people outside into the belief that the gress, or want or progress, made with the Bill during the last Parliament was because the Government did not wish it to progress. What happened during the last Parliament? Every man in this House, and particularly every honourable member on that side of the House, knows that it did not matter what Government measure was submitted, there was wrong, and nothing but wrong, in it . It is notorious that we were not members of a deliberative assembly. Honourable members were seeking by every possible opportunity, by every possible side wind, by every possible trick, to heap discredit and hurl mud on those who occupied the benches they wanted to occupy. We had to put up with every sort of trick, with every sort of subterfuge, with every sort of insinuation, and why? Because we were very much in the position of the man who finds himself between an angry animal and the food for which its belly craves. Now that we know these things, surely it is a little late in the day for the Minister to get up and suggest, as he has done in the statement he has just made-sittin g down after it with so smug a smile-that he - and his colleagues were anxious to press this measure through, and that it was the Government he was then trying to "" chuck"" from office by just such insinuations and such playings with the truth that was loath to put forward the measure. I would not have spoken tonight but for the observations of the Minister, and I ask him now, what did he - mean by that reply, if it was not that he himself was anxious to see this measure through, and that the late Government was not in earnest with it?",56
461,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,They have shown their sincerity by keeping it off t i e business paper.,57
462,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I trust, if the members of the party opposite do not realise it, that the public outside will see through these insinuations. As soon as they do, the honourable gentleman's whole stock-in-trade, like the stock-in-trade of his honest-looking leader, will have vanished into thin air, for they seem to live by casting reflections of this sort from behind an honest exterior. I want - * to put this to my honourable friend: Did he not, here, a few minutes ago, tell us that he was not in favour of a Federal proBureau of Agriculture, unless some means could be adopted of stopping State overlapping; that he was going to give nothing additional to the farmer, and was not going to originate any additional inquiry of any kind ? But he added that if we could find some means of wiping out what has already been established by the States, and of placing the whole matter into one set of hands, then the Minister might be willing to prove himself a lifelong benefactor to those who have so long been his dupes.",57
463,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Bu the has taken no action in that direction.,57
464,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Of course he has taken no action, and he will take no action. He says it is only four weeks before the session will be up.",57
465,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I did not say that.,57
466,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Before the end of the financial year - I beg his pardon; and, being within four weeks of that end, he does not propose to include this amount, though these Estimates were introduced at the beginning of the financial year. These Estimates were prepared .a considerable time before Christmas. It was not then a question of four weeks; it was a question of the whole balance of the financial year. The Minister's explanation has completely borne out the suggestion that neither the Minister nor any of his colleagues want this thing done. All they are agreeable to do is to stop the agencies already operating in the various States, and bring them under one roof. He has not initiated a single new inquiry, and is not dealing with a single new problem of interest to the farmers whom they wish to see keot rigorously in the background. This problem, apparently, like the Prime Minister's "" l it t l e drought,"" is a very small and trifling thing. The sufferings of the farmer, the miseries of those upon the land, are of absolutely no account. Yet I can say this, and every member of this House will recognise its truth, that whatever 'may have happened to the farmer, however the country may have been suffering, there are eight or nine honest gentlemen upon that bench who have never been happier in the whole course of their lives. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 85 (Fisheries), £7,781.",57
467,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Wannon) [9.59] - I should like the Minister to tell the Committee if, as the result of the work carried out by the lost trawler Endeavour, he is in a position to say whether fish of a. sufficient quantity and quality to be of any commercial value has been caught to warrant the Government pursuing this ' matter any further. The Minister will probably recognise that there is likely to be a great shortage of meat supplies this year. Prices are very high, and relief will be brought to the householders of the country if something can be done in the way of making up the deficiencies that are likely to be felt by supplies of fish. Many families may have to substitute for their beef and mutton supplies from other sources, and if the Minister could give some information as to the possibilities in this direction, he would Norfolk Island. greatly relieve many householders and those who at the present time are taking action privately to cope with this matter, by investigating the great unexplored areas round the Australian coast. I should be glad if the Minister could give us some information on this matter.",58
468,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.0] - In regard to fishing grounds off the Australian coast, the position is that the whole of the reports upon the operations of the trawler Endeavour have already been presented to Parliament. The trawler commenced her investigatory work about the year 1908 or 1909. During her career she accomplished a good deal in that she definitely located payable fishing grounds in the waters adjacent to Australia. The Government do not propose, at the present time, to build or equip another trawler to continue that work. The whole of the information to which I have referred is available to any person who desires it. I quite recognise that it would be a great advantage if we could induce private enterprise to embark upon trawling operations in our waters, especially in view of the high price of meat. I understand that in New South Wales action is being taken in this direction for the purpose of cheapening the food supplies of the people. '",58
469,Mr JH CATTS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Cook) [10.2] As reference has been made to the question of our fish supply, it appears a favourable opportunity to point out that in close proximity to one of our newlyacquired territories- I refer to Norfolk Island-a n abundance of fish is obtainable. Only a few days ago I met the captain of the Makambo, who informed me that he had just brought a trial shipment of these fish to Sydney, and that a company had been formed, which was prepared to erect refrigerators at Norfolk Island if the public of Sydney were satisfied with the condition of the fish upon their arrival in that city.",58
470,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Are the fish of commercial value?,58
471,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Sometime s the best fish have no commercial value. It is a question of establishing a taste.,58
472,Mr JH CATTS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The honourable member for Calare can speak with me of the quality of the fish from As to their quantity there is no room for doubt. If fishermen there go out in a whale boat, they usually return with as much fish as the craft can carry. If some up-to-date method for dealing with them were adopted, unlimited supplies could be secured. I hope that the Government will make a note of this fact, with a view to seeing if the industry at Norfolk Island cannot be encouraged, particularly when the question of the mail contract with the Pacific Islands is under consideration. Provision should then be inserted in the contract requiring the mail steamers to provide adequate refrigerating space. That would pmve a boon to the public of Sydney as well as to the Norfolk Islanders. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 86 (Quarantine), £37,584; and division 87 (Analyst), £3,644, agreed to. Division 88 (Inter-State Commission), £5,063.",58
473,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Wentworth) [10.7] I desire to point out to the Minister that the late Government entered into an agreement with the States in regard to the unification of railway gauges-a n agreement under which the Inter-State Commission was to discharge certain functions. At the time of which I am speaking it was impracticable to ask that body to immediately tackle the problem of the unification of our gauges, seeing that it was then dealing with the Tariff.",58
474,Mr TODOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,It is doing so yet.,58
475,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"But I take it that it is now nearing the conclusion of its labours, and I would suggest that the Government should carry out the agreement into which we entered with the different .States. That agreement was to the effect that the Commonwealth and the States should make contributions to a common fund so as to enable this question to be properly handled. Payments into that fund were to be made, not according to the cost of unifying the gauge in each State, but according to the advantage which each State and the Commonwealth would derive from this common work. It was the introduction of this new principle which secured the unanimous approval of the States to the proposed unification of our railway gauges. It practically destroyed the possibility of any serious quarrel in connection with the actual gauge to be adopted. Honourable members will realise that the battle of the gauge has been largely fought with minds sub-consciously fixed upon the question of how much each'State would be required to pay for the alteration of the gauge within its own borders. The Commonwealth Government pointed out that every State would benefit from the adoption of a uniform gauge by the common handling of the rolling stock, and by the interchange which would result in stock and other commodities. With the exception of Tasmania, every State in the Commonwealth will benefit by the unification of gauges. Take, for instance, the position of New South Wales. If the gauge were to remain at 4 f t . in., as I believe it will, because the balance of advantage, considering cost as an advantage, is so infinitely in favour of that gauge, then New South Wales would be a heavy gainer. And yet if Queensland and Victoria converted to the same gauge before this Conference was held it would have had to pay nothing towards the cost of unification. Across the northern borders of that State very often the seasons are such that there is plenty of grass, while there is stock wanting grass on the southern side of the border, and vice versd. Stock-owners in these northern districts of New South Wales would thus benefit enormously by being able to transfer their stock readily and easily into the adjoining State. In the same way, the people of Riverina would benefit enormously by the unification of gauges. New South Wales would thus be a direct gainer as the result of the unification of gauge to which it had contributed nothing. Consequently, it did not seem to the Government at the time a rational proposal that the cost of unifying the gauges should be on a basis other than that of payment for benefits received. To assess those benefits we had to secure the services of some body which would command common confidence throughout Australia. The body that recommended itself to this Premiers' Conference was the Inter-State Commission, and for. that reason it was appointed, under the agreement, to go into the question of the advantage which each State would derive from the unification of gauges, and funds would then be automatically paid in by the various interested bodies. In addition to that, at the instance of Victoria and South Australia, the Inter-State Commission was to give a final verdict on the question of what gauge should be adopted. My honourable friends opposite have had recourse to a hard-and-fast method of settling the question of which gauge sliould be selected. We have started to build a transcontinental railway, and we have cither railways, described as strategic, also projected by the Commonwealth. My honourable friends opposite, in a somewhat high-handed manner, have said that the Commonwealth is going to construct these railways on a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge. The inference is that this is to be used as a lever to compel all the railway services of Australia to come down to our basis. I do not believe the reform can be brought about in that way. I have never had any hope of the kind. The building of lines on. conflicting gauges in the various States is only adding to the difficulty. On the other hand, if we carry out the agreement to which I have referred, then, whatever the gauge adopted-and I am certain it will be the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge-T-it will be adopted by the States for their own advantage as well as by the Commonwealth for its advantage. The result will be the consummation of this great work. There is a strong call for urgency in this matter. Do honourable members recognise, that owing to the immense number of new lines that are being put down on varying gauges in the different States, the cost of unification is growing, according to a departmental estimate, at the rate of £1,000,000 a year? Do they realise that every year we put off this work it is going to cost an additional £1,000,000? A uniform gauge is absolutely essential for the true trade unification of Australia and for the true pastoral and agricultural - development of this continent. It is also - essential for the economic running of these railways. We have in every State today - to keep rolling-stock sufficient to meet the maximum seasonal influences. Our seasonal influences are threefold. We have the monsoonal influence in the north, the anti-cyclonic on the eastern seaboard, and the Antarctic on the south. Each of these seasonal influences, when felt to the extreme, detracts from the benefit that we gain from the other seasonal influences, with the result that we never have the maximum seasonal activity at the same time all over the continent. When we have a drought in Victoria, as we have had recently, we have a good season on the seaboard of New South Wales, as we have just had purely on the seaboard of that State. Wliere we get splendid seasons in Victoria we have not, necessarily, a complete failure, but a corresponding weakening of the effect of the other two seasonal influences which benefit stock, and agricultural and pastoral production in the other parts of the Commonwealth. This means that, owing to the artificial boundaries on our railway - system, due to the break of gauge, we have to keep in every State enough rolling-stock to enable us to handle the maximum seasonal output which the best of - seasons can possibly give us.",59
476,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Tremendou s losses have been suffered this year owing to the want of sufficient rolling-stock to shift 'live stock.,60
477,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Quite so. The ideal is to have sufficient rolling-stock to enable the maximum seasonal output to be handled; but in practice that cannot be. 'The result is that, not being able to draw upon the adjoining States, we lose immense numbers of stock through our inability to shift them, and also suffer many other disabilities that I need not - enumerate. Break down these artificial boundaries, and you have an immense - economy in rolling-stock throughout Australia. To get the same results that you get today in any one State, you can - carry probably about one-fourth less rolling-stock in the eastern States by using, as every railway system in the world does, the rolling-stock of an adjoining system at any time when additional rolling-stock is required in any particular section. This is absolutely essential to the benefit of the States, and provided that we set about the work in an ordinary, tactful, and diplomatic way, the change can be brought about. Assuming that we have a common fund, and will pay into it ourselves, while we ask the States to contribute to it in proportion to the benefits they derive, as determined by the Commission, in whom they have confidence, a uniform gauge is so clearly an advantage to all the States that every one of them will be anxious at once to come into line, and to push the reform through. If , on the other hand, we build this or that railway, no good is done. We have entered upon the construction of a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta on a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. When I was a Minister the South Australian Government started to link up Port Augusta by direct route with Adelaide. Up to that period Port Augusta was linked up with Adelaide, and will continue to be until this line is constructed, by two separate gauges- a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge for part of the way, and a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge for the balance. ' Now, we set about the construction of our line_on a 4-ft. 8-1-in. gauge, as much as to say to the States, "" This is the Commonwealth gauge, and you will have to conform to it."" What resulted? South Australia started to build a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge line from Port Augusta to Adelaide. And with what result to our transcontinental railway? We shall have a break of gauge, a turning out of passengers and a shifting of luggage, with consequent delay at Port Augusta, and something still more serious, since it will mean an added difficulty to a service which will pay only if we can make it thoroughly up to date, first-class, and absolutely express. I personally made a strong protest, and the Government of which I was a member held the strongest views about the matter. But what power have we? We have no practicable power. If , however, we can unify the gauges on the basis of the agreement, we can get over the whole difficulty in a moment. Why not do it? Why not let the Inter-State Commission take up the agreement where we put it down, and carry out work on the basis arrived at by that Premiers' Conference?  be better employed doing that than they are at present.",60
478,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I have nothing to say on that matter; but I would point out to honourable members that the Premiers, whether Labour or Liberal, had the utmost confidence in the Commission. Mr Holman represented New South Wales, and he, at least, enjoys as much the confidence of the Labour movement as does my distinguished friend. There were, I think, three Labour Premiers at that Conference.",61
479,Mr FENTON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,What Conference?,61
480,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I cannot remember the exact date, but I think it was held in February or March, 1914.",61
481,Mr FEMTON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Tw o more Labour Premiers have come into power since then.,61
482,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I think there were three Labour Premiers at that Conference, and they were all satisfied that the Inter-State Commission could properly handle this important subject, because they were all prepared to leave it to body. If , as I have shown, there was then, and I believe there is now, complete confidence in the Inter-State Commission, why should not this question be referred to them at once? Every year's delay means the addition of a million to the cost of this work, which must be carried out sooner or later. Not only is it essential, but it is the"" sort of undertaking that might well be put in hand during this wai period, when we should be thinking about finding work for our unemployed.",61
483,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,The whole of the States agreed to be bound by the decision of the Commission.,61
484,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Did they undertake to agree .to any decision that might be arrived at?,61
485,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,Yes .,61
486,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,I do not think so.,61
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,There is no better body to whom the question could be ferred.,61
488,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"The only serious difthat, ference of opinion was with regard to the gauges, and on this subject the Premiers agreed to be bound by the decision of Inter-State Commission. The representaworks tives of Victoria raised this question, when I asked them if they would be bound by the recommendation of the In ter-State Commission, they said ""Yes."" That was the only side of this question that was seriously canvassed at that Conference. Now, I maintain that it is our business, as the representatives of the people of Australia, to keep constantly before the public of Australia the common value of this unification scheme. State representatives occasionally try to make the public believe that unification is only necessary for defence purposes, but no greater nonsense could ever be conceived. This scheme, if carried out, would be of greater value agriculturally and pastorally than ever it would be for defence purposes, and the sooner the public recognise this the sooner we will see the scheme consummated. When we have to our hand this ready means of arriving at a satisfactory solution of the gauges problem, I would urge upon the Minister that this Government should at once give earnest consideration to the question of going straight ahead with the agreement as if nothing had since been said by one or two Premiers, who may have done a bit of back-sliding when they that got away from the influence of the Conference.",61
489,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,There have been three or four new Premiers since that Conference was held.,61
490,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I presume, however, that the new Premiers are not less Australian in their attitude than were those who attended the Conference. ,",61
491,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,They might raise the point that they are not bound by an agreement made by their predecessors.,61
492,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,They can be given the opportunity of accepting the agreement made by the Conference.,61
493,Mr BURCHELL,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,How do you propose to finance the work in connection with the unification of the gauges?,61
494,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That could be apportioned according to the benefit which each State would derive from the undertaking. reThe difference between the scheme I am advocating and the previous scheme is under the latter, every State was expected to contribute its own portion of the cost, as if each State would benefit the to only an extent corresponding to the within its borders. I have pointed and out, however, that every State, except Tasmania, whether it pays for the conversion within its borders or not, is going to be immensely benefited by the scheme. New South Wales, for instance, will exagreement perience a great benefit by the adoption of the 4-ft. S^-in. gauge in Queensland and Victoria, and that State ougbt to contribute to its cost. I am a - New South Wales representative, but I advocated policy at the elections in 1913.",61
495,Mr FENTON,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,And yet New South he Wales is allowing Victoria to construct 5-ft. 3-in. gauge railways through her territory in three or four places.,62
496,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"That is what we want to stop. In this unification of the gauges each State and the Commonwealth ought to pay proportionately to the value refrom ceived. Steps should be taken at once have an actuarial investigation made of the benefits which will accrue to the monwealth, and to each of the States, and then if all the parties agree to pay amounts thus ascertained into a common fund, there sliould be no difficulty in carrying out of the agreement arrived by the Conference.",62
497,Mr BUKCHELL,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Was that the view put before the Premiers, and was it accepted by them?",62
498,Mr KELLY,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I think it was, am speaking without documentary evidence which I would have had had I known that this matter was coming on to-night. I remember I went into the Conference perfectly clear as to what was in my mind. I spoke in that Conference exactly as I am speaking to-night, I did not hear any dissentient voice on this particular aspect of the question of the gauges. We have to remember that every State in Australia except Tascountry. mania will reap a great benefit, agricularguments, turally and pastorally, by the unification of the railway gauges.",62

Leader of the Opposition told that he and his party were pledged to abide by the conclusions arrived at by Commission; that he was going to place the whole responsibility of dealing with the Tariff on the Commission. Every line of the reports to hand bears out the State Commission. anticipation of Protectionists that those reports would, to put the matter as mildly Ministeras possible, show pronounced Free Trade leanings on the part of the Commiscompete sioners. This is what the Leader of Opposition told the country regarding his labour. attitude towards the CommissionOur position is perfectly clear and simple on the fiscal question. We have arranged for a complete and expert investigation of the whole question by the Inter-State Commission, so thsit Parliament may be thoroughly informed when it comes to deal with the matter. The work of the Commission is now well advanced, and it is as certain as anything can be that' it will report in time to deal with the Tariff during the first session of the next Parliament. It does not look like it now. I wonder how long the Commission will take to come to the end of its Tariff inquiriesThe position of the party is clearly stated in the following proposal : To maintain the Protective policy of Australia as decided upon by the people, amending the Tariff as necessary in the light of investigations by the Inter-State ' Commission.",63
504,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Hear , hear!  the Tariff will never be amended in the light of the investigations of the Inter-State Commission, if the reports that have come to hand are a fair sample of what the results of the Commission's investigation will be.",63

Mr Cook, who w-.s not a fool, had seen that the people were demanding Protection, and he"" ""pretended to be in accord with the demand, yet he left the matter in the hands of three men constituting the Inter-State Commission. . . . We pledge ourselves, if returned to power, to amend the Tariff during the first session to give effective protection to Australian industries. The reports of the Inter-State Commission have, so far, been diametrically opposed to the sentiment of the'people of Australia in regard to a Protective Tariff. Sir William Irvine, speaking at Dandenong, said I think the great majority of the people are entirely in accord with the policy adopted by the Liberal Government of remitting the whole of the issues raised by the Tariff question to the careful consideration of the Inter-State Commission. . . . The people of Victoria are, in my opinion, not in favour of any general all-round increase in protective duties, but are in favour of such modifications of the Tariff as will be found by the Inter-State Commission to be necessary to complete the existing scheme of effective Protection for Australian industries. What did they do to give effect to this sentiment? They appointed three gentlemen to constitute the Inter-State Commission, and every one knows the fiscal faith of trie Chairman of that Commission. A Free Trader is at the head of that Commission. I do not grumble at that; he is entitled to his convictions; but as the present Leader of the Opposition from many platforms in this country declared that, whatever the opinions of honourable members opposite had been in the past, they had concluded that the right thing to do, as a party, was to abide by the settled policy of the country, which is Protection, the proper thing for them to have done was to appoint men to the Inter-State Commission who were not known to be Free Traders or did not have the reputation of being Free Traders..",63
508,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,You know that your party was about to appoint a Free Trader Chairman of that .Commission.  honourable member does not know anything of the kind. I do not know it . I should be very sorry to have anything to do with the appointment of a Free Trade chairman to a body that was supposed to deal in a comprehensive way with what was the settled policy of the country.,64
509,Mr RODGERS,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Every one knows that he just missed the bus.  already said that the reports of the Inter-State Commission are an insult to the Protectionist sentiment of this country. Although both parties have agreed that Protection is the settled policy of the country, every page of the reports submitted to us by the Inter-State Commission is seething with Free Trade sentiments. The apologies for not proposing to raise duties are alarming. I believe that they have submitted five recommendations so far.",64
510,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"I think there are nine reports.  rate, there is only one in which they have hinted at the desirability of raising the duty. In every other case they recommend either no disturbing of the present - duty or the wiping out of the duty altogether. In one report they saySpeaking of the manufacturing industries of the Commonwealth as a whole, their general expansion in the last five years has been most striking.",64
511,Mr SINCLAIR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Hear , hear! So it has been. [129]  honourable member had seen the latest figures with regard to our imports during the last five years he would not say that. The report of the Commission upon the boot and shoe manufacturing industry is an index of their feelings on the whole Tariff question. They very carefully cover up everything that would be detrimental to their finding. For instance, they compare very conveniently the years 1909 and 1913; whereas if they had compared the years 1910 and 1913, there would have been a remarkable disparity in the figures. The boot and shoe factories of Australia in 1910 turned out 11,618,000 pairs; in 1913 the output was 11,135,000 pairs, and there were 610 fewer people engaged. This is the only principal industry upon which they have reported, and they point out that the trade is flourishing in every way, and they quote from the Commonwealth Year-Book- I have not gone into it closely to know whether it is correct-as follows:- : Among the specialized secondary industries of Australia, the boot and shoe industry stands pre-eminent in respect of the number of factories engaged in it, the employment afforded by it, and the range of its output. There is not one word in their report about 610 fewer people having been engaged in the industry in 1913, as compared with 1910, and there is not one word about the evidence on which their statement is based. I wish to point out one matter in answer to their report that this is a flourishing industry. I take the evidence given by the representatives of the conference of boot manufacturers of the various States. A statement was addressed to the Inter-State Commission by the Conference between representatives of the Boot Manufacturers Associations of New South Wales and Victoria, and representatives of the Australian Boot Trade Employees Federation from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania, held at Melbourne on the 30th and 3lst October, and 3rd November, 1913. That was the principal evidence on the boot and shoe industry which the Commission received/ and I wish the Committee to note how much out of keeping with that evidence is the report made by the Commission. The statement submitted by that body, representative of both employers and employees in the boot and shoe industry throughout the Commonwealth, wasUp to 1909, under the 1901 and 1907 Tariffs, the industry had been steadily progressing; during 1910, however, signs of a change began to manifest themselves, and a check in the irate of expansion became noticeable. This feature developed distinctly during 1910-12, three years in which Australia enjoyed great prosperity-the population increasing by about 410,000 in the period-and by the end of 1912 the drift backwards was so marked that the Australian boot trade had become "" an arrested industry."" In a preceding paragraph it is stated that the industry has been stopped in growth, is, in fact, in actual decline, and that the greater needs of our increasing population, which should be followed by a corresponding expansion in the employment and outputfiguresof the industry, appear to be met by laager importations.",64
512,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"Who statement in?  signed by A . Whybrow, Thomas Y . Harkness, James Florey, representatives of the manufacturers, and Arthu r Long, W . Eorty, and E . E. Windebank, representatives of the ernployees. Yet in view of that statement, the Inter-State Commission ask us to believe that this industry is going ahead by leaps and bounds. I believe that there are now 700 fewer employees in the boot trade than there were in 1910.",65
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"What Commission recommend ?  commendation is the most peculiar I have ever seen. The Commission says, in regard to the bigger part of the industry which is flourishing, that there should be an increase of 5 per cent, in the duty, but of the part which is weak and languishing the Commission says that because it is in that condition it is not worth extra protection.",65

517,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"And the Prime Minister has expressed in the Tariff schedule what he meant.  think I would be doing my duty in discussing this item if I were not to say that it is an absolute waste of this country's time and money to have a body dealing with the Tariff when the party now in power is pledged to take no notice of the Commission. I have no confidence in the members of that body. I do not think their heart is in this inquiry, and I do not think they are capable of dealing with the subject. In the five - reports of the Commission I have seen enough to convince me that the members of that body put that are not in sympathy with the Protectionist policy of this country, and the people who appointed them never in tended that they should bring in any recommendation in the direction of liigher Protection. I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth that there are many other things requiring investigation which the Commission is much better fitted to deal with. I believe that in 1914 Australia's imports exceeded the exports by about £6,000,000, and a body of men who, in the face of that fact, will submit a report that gives no recognition does the of that state of affairs, must be out of sympathy with the sentiment that pervades this community.",65

Knowing the Minister of Trade and Customs to be a good Protectionist, I venture to say that he has altered the opinion he expressed a fortnight ago when he said that he had every confidence in the Inter-State Commission. If the Minister does have that confidence in the Inter-State Commission, I am sure that such is not the case with Protectionists generally.",66

The honourable member has said that the best evidence that the Inter-State Commissioners are acting detrimentally to the interests of the country is to be found in their recommendations concerning the boot trade. He asserts that the Commissioners have not the interests of the country at heart; that they are incapable of dealing with this question, and should be put to some other task; and the only proof he has of.their inability, incompetency, and want of sympathy with the industries of the country is in their recommendations concerning the boot trade.

I refer to the taking over of the lighthouses by the Commonwealth Government. ""What we in Tasmania cannot understand is the proposed increase in the cost of the upkeep. In our State the upkeep of our lighthouses has cost, in round figures, £12,000 a year, and if I am informed correctly the cost is to be raised to £34,000. I desire to know how that great increase is to be brought about. Now, what is it likely to do? It will simply paralyze the shipping industry, at any rate, of Tasmania, as I will proceed to show. I notice one remarkable increase in the proposed vote for the central staff. I have no objection to the head of a Department receiving a large salary if he can show that he is doing work which compensates the Commonwealth for the amount he receives. But in these Estimates we find that the salary of the Director of Lighthouses is to be increased from £670 to £800.",67
528,Mr TUDOR,PABLIAMEN T HOUSES AND ADMINISTRATI,"There is no increase of salary. The reason for the disparity in the amounts is that whereas last year he was in the position for ten months, this year he is in for twelve months.
