SIZE OF PRODUCE BAGS. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if he will postpone until next year the consideration of a proposed alteration of the legal size of wheat bags? The rumoured intention . to make this alteration is causing a considerable stir in the country. Referenceto country ' news-' papers will show that they are full of accounts of meetings on 'the subject.",14
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member not to discuss the matter.,14
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The proposed alteration will be brought about gradually, and, in any case, will not come into force until after the first quarter of next year. I propose that .it shall begin ' on the last day of March next; but every consideration will be shown to those who have bags on the water, or who have ordered bags in Australia. In my opinion, it has become absolutely necessary to adopt the 200-lb. bag as the standard; but intended to inflict hardship on any one the change must be brought about in a business like and careful way.",14
3,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"The Minister, hi statement which he has .just made, - confirmed what he said in reply to a deputation which.waited upon him last-week; but I ' wish to know whether the - intended alteration is to apply only to grain or whether sugar bags will also cluded ?",15
4,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"It is to apply to grain bags generally. There some difficulties in the way of applying to sugar bags. The only action that the Commonwealth Government can take is to prevent the importation or exportationbags of more than a certain size. All the circumstances of the case must into consideration in making the proposed change, because all sort of bags are now in use. The change has been resolved on because many of the grain bags ih use too large, and it is considered to ask men to move heavier bags than will contain 200 lbs. of grain. We. shall, howNew ever, endeavour to so bring it about as not' to inflict hardship.",15
5,Mr TIIXEY BROWN,Unknown,"The change will respectively, 'inflict hardship on the persons in chaff, because the bags used for wheat are also used for chaff. 1.

9,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if the number of hours fixed in the proposed mail contract for the journey between Brindisi and Adelaide, and the extension allowed during the monsoon months, are the same as in the new contract between' the - British Government and the Peninsular Oriental Steam Navigation Company?",16
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I am so informed.,16
11,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Is not the honourable gentleman absolutely sure?,16
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I have not satisfied myself on the subject; but I am so informed by the officers.,16
13,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Will the honourable gentleman take steps to satisfy himself on the subject, so that he can make a definite statement in regard to it when the contract is under discussion?",16
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Certainly .,16
15,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I should like to know whether the Postmaster-General, before moving for the ratification of the proposed mail contract, will inform the House what are the earnings of his Department in connection with the sending of mails to Europe? It is rather important that the House should know the actual revenue from this service before voting ^ e subsidy proposed to be spent upon it .",16
16,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,-I shall endeavour to give that information later in the day. NA ENCOURAGEMENT BILL .,16
17,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURES,"In . connection with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill now before the House, I wish to know from the Treasurer whether he has obtained from the Government of New South Wales a report upon the quality of the . material, manufactured from local ore, supplied to 'them by Messrs. Sandford and Company, -«vf Lithgow? If so, will he make it available to honourable members?",16
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I have not received any official report.,16
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,The New Wales Secretary for Works told me the other day that the material is the best that the Department has had.,16
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I know personally that the tests have been most satisfactory, and I think that it might be well for the Prime Minister to communicate with the New South Wales Government on the subject.",16
21,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"He might also communicate with the Government of South Australia, which, too, is using this material.",16
22,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,No doubt rhe Departments concerned will be glad to give the information asked for.,16
23,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURES,There should b<and some authoritative statement on the point. EXCTSE TARIFF (AGRICULTURA L MACHINERY) ACT.,16
24,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"I do not wish to add to the perplexities of the Minister of Trade and Customs; but I should like to know, in connection with the requiring of a bond from manufacturers of harvesters, guaranteeing payment of Excise, whether he will extend the same treatment to the importers of goods, allowing them to give bonds for the payment of the duties which Parliament mav ultimately' decide upon?",16
25,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MANUFACTURES,I do not know whether the honourable member is serious. He must know that the duties which importers will have to pay will be those fixed by Parliament.,16
26,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,Hav e not the Excise duties been fixed by Parliament?,16
27,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MANUFACTURES,"Is .it the intention of the Government, in view of the fact that a number of makers of agricultural machinery, during the period between the ist January last and the date on; which the decision of Mr Justice Higgins in respect to the harvester Excise was given, have been paying the rates decided upon by various Wages Boards, to collect Excise from these unfortunate people, or to take a bond guaranteeing its payment?",16
28,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"There are no Wages Boards, so far as the harvester industry is concerned.",16
29,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURES,"That an employer has ' paid rates fixed by Wages Boards would be an argument in his favour; but the President of the Arbitration Court distinguished in his recent judgment between the principles on which a wage was fixed by a Wages Board and the rates indicated by the South terms of the Excise Tariff Agricultural Machinery Act. I understand from what the honourable gentleman has said to mc personally that he wishes to submit to the Department a case in which it is contended that hardship will be suffered if the new rates are insisted upon. If he will give me an opportunity to scrutinize this application, I shall be glad to answer his question in more detail later on.",16
30,Mr CROUCH,MANUFACTURES,"As different authorisuch ties have fixed different in different States,, can the Prime Minister devise a way of removing the anomalies, that where an industrial authority has dered a decent rate to be paid, similar will be insisted on in other States?",17
31,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURES,The anomaly referred to makes it necessary for the Government to introduce legislative nroposals in gard as soon as possible after our rewill assembling after the Christmas adjournapplication ment.,17
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,Do the rates of wages fixed by Mr Justice Higgins by the Minister of Trade and Customs plv to all parts of the Commonwealth?,17
33,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURES,"Thos e fixed by the . Minister of Trade and Customs do; Mr Justice Higgins intimated that the apthey? plicability to all parts of the Commonwealth of the rates he fixed would require further consideration. He dealt only the facts before him., and the facts mitted by manufacturers in other parts Australia might be different.",17
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,Then where do these rates apply ?,17
35,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURES,"Mr Justice Higgins his judgment rrfade the distinction I spoke of, and safeguarded himself against the supposition that he must necessarily taken to have fixed rates applying to Sir' JOHN FORREST - What guide have the manufacturers of Western Australia as to the rates of wages they should pay to escape the Excise?",17
36,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,They have none.,17
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,It seems to me that they may be fined for not paying rates will which no one has yet been able to fix. hope the Prime Minister will soon give some definite information on this that the manufacturers of Western Australia and other States may know exactly they stand.,17
38,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURES,"It is highly desirable that there should be no uncertainty in this matter. The present situation has arisen because of definite applications made to the President of the Arbitration Court. far as I am aware, no such application come from Western Australia, and until is made, it cannot be declared with cerof tainty what rates should be paid there.",17
39,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"Mr Justice Higgins dicated that the standard would be in acpose cordance with his latest award, making exceptions as the local circumstances standards of wages might justify.",17
40,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURES,"The award which has so been given indicates that local circumorstances will be taken info account in each rates instance, and that, subject to that consideration, the schedule of wages which the President of the Court outlined appeared to him to represent an average this restatement. The rates of wages payable not be absolutely determined until an has been made from Western Australia.",17
41,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,Are not the manuand facturers called upon to supply informaaption as to the rates of wages they are paving ?,17
42,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURES,Yes . but Sir JOHN FORREST - What guide have,17
43,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURES,"They have the guide of the present rates applicable to their own with conditions. But the measure to which I subhave more than once alluded) in this of House will have for its object the removal of these anomalies as far as possible, 'or at all events the removal of the doubts which may exist in the minds of. manufacturers in Western Australia or in Northern Queensland as to the applicability of the present standard to them. That is a real difficulty which can be met be only by an application to the Court, but all the principle of which this Parliament ought to establish for itself.",17
44,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the judgment given by Mr Justice Higgins was not that wherever the rates of wages scheduled by him are paid, the certificate of exemption be given without further question, but that if they are not paid the application for I exemption may be supported by some evius dence as to local conditions justifying a point, so variation from those rates? how Mr DEAKIN - Speakin g from memory, I believe that the statement of the honourable and learned member is correct. TARIFF : NEW PROTECTION. Mr Reid . ^ I wish to ask the Prime , So Minister whether, in considering the has Tariff and the duties fixed from day to one day, the House is to regard the system new protection as. a part of the understanding upon which those duties are fixed ? inIn other words, do the Government proto stand by the duties irrespective of whether or not we adopt any system of new protection? Will it make any dif-. ference to the rates of duty whether the system is applied or not, because circumstances may arise which may prevent its application ? Mr DEAKIN,-The Ministry put forward the matters referred to by the honourable member as a united proposal-the duties upon one. side, and the new protection upon the other. Of course, if it is considered possible that the House may reject the new protection proposals",17
45,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,It may be ruled that those proposals are unconstitutional.,18
46,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURES,"If I could conceive that it could be ruled that this House is not competent to make any provision in regard to rates of wages, then, of course, it would be within our power to make such amendments.in the Tariff schedule as we may think.lfit.",18
47,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"Is it the intention of. the Government, under such circumstances, to ask the House to reconsider the schedule?",18
48,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURES,"We should require to reconsider the schedule of duties which this House has approved in relation to the fact that the new protection had not been accepted, because the duties that are being adopted - as the honourable member for Flinders will recollect-ar e in many instances considerably lower than those which the Government proposed. PAPER. Mr EWING laid upon the table the following paperDefence Acts-Militar y Forces-Financia l and Allowance Kegulations-Amendmen t of Regulation No. 152 (Provisional)-Statutor 1907, No. 117. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). POSTAL ADMINISTRATION.",18
49,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I have received an intimation from, the honourable member for Lang that he desires to move the adjournment of the House, to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance "" in connection with the Postal Department.""",18
50,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,That is very vague.,18
51,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"Of course I cannot help that. I did not frame the motion. Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. - Mr JOHNSON (Lang) [2.50] - I am loth to interrupt the business which has been engaging the attention of the House, and I do not intend to occupy a moment longer than is absolutely necessary to enable me to state the ground of the complaint which I wish to bring before honourable members. As the matter is one of considerable urgency, I have been obliged to adopt this course to obtain some redress for those who are affected. What I particularly refer to is the maladministration of the Postal Department, and the terrible amount of sweating which is being practised therein. So important does this matter appear to the proprietors of one of the principal dai.lv newspapers in Sydney-the Sydney Morning Herald-that they deputed a special representative to inquire into the working of the General Post Office there, and, as a result, published an article in yesterday's issue, in which the most serious accusations are made against the administration of the Department. In that article it is pointed out that time after time the conditions under which the officers have worked-es pecially in - the Telegraph . Departmenthave been so irksome that the telegraphists have been upon the point of refusing duty, and that it was only because their loyalty, to the Department prevailed over their sense of injustice, that the Department has been able to carry on operations. One of the chief grounds of complaint urged is that the officers cannot get their grievances' redressed because the heads of the administration, who are really located in Melbourne, are inaccessible to them. It is thus almost impossible for these telegraphists to bring their grievances under the notice of those who have the power y .Rules to redress them.",18
52,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I have no desire to prevent the. honourable member, doing anything which, under our standing orders, he has a right to do. But from his opening remarks I gather that he proposes to discuss the salaries paid to certain officers of the Postal Department, who he declares a*e being sweated. If so, he is distinctly anticipating debate upon the Estimates for the Postal Department. In that case I cannot permit him to proceed. If he assures me that the matter with which he wishes to deal will not be covered by the debate upon the Estimates concerning the salaries of these officers, I shall, of course, accept his assurance. But unless he can do so I ought not to permit him to proceed.",18
53,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"I am aware that the question of Supply will be considered at a later stage. I do not propose to make any reference to the salaries paid to these officers, or to the number of officers employed, but I do wish to call attention to the overtime which is being worked by them, notwithstanding repeated protests by this House. This system of overtime has seriously threatened to endanger the convenience of the public in its business relations with the Post Office. I presume that I am at liberty to debate that question ?",19
54,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I am afraid that the honourable member is not. He himself has clearly shown that if the Postmaster General replies to him he will, of necessity, have to give the very information which he will be called upon to give when the Estimates are under review. afraid that the honourable member's own remarks preclude him from proceeding.",19
55,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"As I can scarcely avoid trenching upon matter which is open to discussion when the question of Supply is under review, I shall defer my remarks until then. MAJORS' EXAMINATION: VICTORIAN SCOTTISH REGIMENT.",19
56,Mr MALONEY,MANUFACTURES,"the Minister of .Defence, upon notice I. Whether an officer of the Scottish Regiment has passed the theoretical examination for the rank of Major and has been waiting over twelve months for his practical examination? 2. What was the date of passing such theoretical examination ? 3. Has this officer requested Major Bruche, the officer responsible, to examine him, and why has such examination not taken place? 4. Will he place the correspondence as to this examination with Major Bruche on the Library table for inspection by honourable members?",19
57,Mr EWING,MANUFACTURES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. The only officer of the Victorian Scottish Regiment to whom the questions, I am informed, could have application, failed to avail himself of several opportunities of presenting himself for practical examination. 2. 25th October, 1906. 3. The only application from that officer which has reached District Head Quarters is dated 14th September, 1907. In it he asks to be examined after the '12th October. As Regimental arrangements could not be made earlier, this officer was examined on the 9th November, when he failed to complete his examination. 4. The correspondence has been placed on the Library table as requested. MANUFACTURES ' ENCOURAGEMENT BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 19th November (vide page 6186), on motion by Sir WILLIAM LYNEThat this Bill be now read a' second time. Upon which Mr FISHER had moved byway of amendment- . That the following words be added :- "" and the Committee on the Bill be instructed to incorporate in the Bill provision for the nationalization of the iron industry.""",19
58,Colonel FOXTON,MANUFACTURES,"I rise to a point of order. I submit that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wide .Bay is not in order at the present stage. I was not in the Chamber when he proposed that I am amendment, and although I listened to a portion of the debate subsequently I . did not become aware of the nature of his proposal until immediately prior to the adjournment of the House last . evening, otherwise I should have raised this question before. In support of my contention I rely upon standing orders 218, 249, 251! and also upon certain authorities which I shall quote if you, sir, so desire. I do not raise this point of order for the purpose of stifling disoussion. I hope that the honourable member for Wide (Bay and the members of his party will understand that. The amendment of the honourable member, I submit, can be moved only upon notice on the motion to go into Committee on the Bill or upon the reading of the Order of the Dav for going into Committee on the Bill.",19
59,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,Suppos e that it is so. What will the honourable member gain by raising this point?,19
60,Colonel FOXTON,MANUFACTURES,"That is a very pertinent question, and one which really implies that my action is prompted by a spirit of opposition to the amendment. As a matter of fact, I do not intend to vote for the amendment, but even if I did, I should raise precisely the same point. What we shall gain, I hope, by my action is compliance with our standing orders. If we have standing orders it is very desirable that we should strict] v comply with them. If we get into the habit of ignoring them on various occasions there is no telling when they will be set aside for the purpose of establishing a precedent which will be very undesirable. In fact; what is the use of standing orders if we are not bound by them?",19
61,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"We shall reach the discussion, at a later stage; and I do not see how the honourable member can gain much' by this point of order. ' Colonel FOXTON - That is scarcely fair, because it implies that I wish to burke discussion.",20
62,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"The question is not whether we shall or shall not observe our standing orders, because that goes without argument; the question is purely, if I understand the honourable member for Brisbane, whether the Standing Orders have or have not been complied with, and I shall be glad if the honourable member will confine himself to that point.",20
63,Colonel FOXTON,MANUFACTURES,"Quite so, Mr Speaker; but I do object to the implication that I am trying to stifle discussion. There is no doubt that the discussion may be brought on at the proper time; and that proper time, in my opinion, is after we have affirmed the principle of the Bill by reading it a second time. Until then it is only logical to take the view that it is neither desirable nor in order to give any direction to a Committee which may never sit on the Bill. Standing order 218 is as follows :Whenever an Order of the Day is read for the House to resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole, the Speaker leaves the Chair without putting any Question, and the House thereupon resolves itself into a Committee, unless upon notice given an instruction. thereto is proposed from the Chair. That implies that the proper time is after the Bill has been read a second time, and before the House goes into Committee. Standing order 249 is to the following effectNo instruction can be given to a Committee to do that which it is already empowered to do, That has no application in this case, but the standing order proceedsor to deal with a question beyond the scope of a Bill as read the second time. That again implies that it is necessary the Bill should be read the second time before the House is competent to give any direction or instruction to the Committee. 'Standing order 251 is as follows:An instruction to a Committee of the Whole - requires notice, and can only be moved before first going into Committee on any question. These three standing orders, taken ' by themselves, show prettv clearly what is the proper course to pursue on this occasion -.Mav, roth Edition, Dage 45r, says:When the order of the day is read in the Commons, for the House to resolve itself into - committee on the bill, That is, of course, where it has become an Order of the Day appointed by the House previously, the Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order No. 51, unless a member rises to move an instruction which stands upon the notice-paper, leaves the chair forthwith. When the order of the day for committee on a bill is read, the member in charge thereof can move that the order be discharged, and the bill referred to a select committee Before the House resolves itself, for the first time, into a committee of the whole House upon a bill, an instruction may be given to the committee, empowering them to make provision for matters which would exceed a fair interpretation of the rule concerning relevant amendments. To explain the principles that govern the proposal of instructions to committees of the whole House, it must be borne in mind that under the parliamentary usage in force in former times, an amendment might be wholly irrelevant to the motion or bill to which it was proposed (see page 278) and that consequently to a bill in its progress through the House, clauses might be added relating to any matters however various and unconnected, whether with each other or with the bill as originally drawn. A reaction from such laxity of procedure led to the establishment of rules and practice which imposed on the House of Commons an inconvenient rigidity in dealing with a bill . No amendment could be moved which was not strictly within the scope of the prefatory paragraph, known as the title, which is prefixed to every bill, and describes its object and scope. To obviate the difficulty thus created, the House, in 1854, by Standing 4>rder No. 34, gave a general instruction to all committees of the whole House to whom bills were committed, which empowered them to make such amendments therein as they should think fit, provided that the amendments were relevant to the subject-matter bf the bill ; and, if such amendments we're not within the title of the bill, the title was to be amended, and reported specially to the House. This general and standing instruction to committees on bills meets all ordinary occasions. Amendments to bills may, however, be offered which exceed the operation of Standing Order No. 34, and which, without a special instruction from the House, could not be considered by the Committee. In entertaining an instruction, the House - is subject to this primary condition, namely, that the amendments to be sanctioned by an instruction must come within a fair interpretation of the rule laid down by Standing Order No. 34, name.ly, that those amendments should be relevant to the subject-matter of the bill. Thus as the subject-matter of a bill, as disclosed by the contents thereof, when read a second time, has since 1854 formed the order p of reference which governs the proceedings of the committee thereon, it follows that the objects sought by an instruction should be pertinent to the terms of that order; and that the amendments, which an instruction proposes to sanction, must be such as would further the general purpose and intention of the House in the appointment' of the committee. That indicates that the Committee on a a Bill is not at liberty to introduce amendments which are ' not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill, unless there are special instructions. Those instructions moved. may be given by the House at time, which,is, I contend, after the.second reading of the Bill has been passed, and such the principle has been accepted by the House. Again, at page 456 of May, find these wordsAn instruction to a committee of the whole House can only be moved when the order of day for the first sitting of the Committee been read. Instructions to committees whole House upon bills are also moved, when founded on the report of a committee of whole House. On these authorities I contend that it necessary, first of all, that the Bill should be read a second time, and that an amendbeing ment in the terms of the amendment the honourable member for Wide Bay can be moved only on notice, and on the mohas tion to go into Committee, or on the readhave now reached. ing of the Order .of the Day which' has read'steen previously made by the House to go into Committee on the Bill.",20
64,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member has called my. attention to certain of the out Standing Orders, to which he desires me to refer in giving a ruling. In I point out that the first standing order referred to only prescribed thatIn all cases not provided for hereinafter, statesor by Sessional or other Orders, resort shall be had to the rules, forms, and practice of the Commons House of the Imperial Parliament In cases, therefore, where we have provision made, there is no such reference to the rules or orders of the House of Commons. No doubt, if the amendment now before the Chair were intended to be an instruction, and nothing more, nor less, it would be out of place that it should be moved - until the Committee itself had actually been ordered to sit; that is to say, until the second reading had been passed. Thereafter a motion, as an instruction, might properly be moved within certain times. It seems to me, however, that although the word "" instruction"" does appear in the amendment-and I suppose that is what has misled the honourable member for Brisbane - the amendment does not come before us as in any sense an instruction. If the honourable member will turn to standing orders 161 and 162 he will find that the former reads as followsAmendments may be moved to such questionthat is the question of the second readingby lea-ving out "" n o w "" and adding ""this day six months,"" which, if carried, shall finally dispose of the Bill ; or the previous question may be the proper Standing order 162 isNo other amendment may be moved toquestion except in the form of a Resolution strictly relevant to the Bill . I This amendment appears to me to be & resolution strictly relevant to the Bill. The amendment is intended to deal with the encouragement to the iron industry, and as has an alternative to the Government proposal,, of the which is to encourage that industry bymeans of a bounty, whereas the honourable the member's proposed method is not a bounty, but the taking over of the industry by the is Government. The amendment is, therefore, distinctly within standing order 162,. a motion strictly relevant to the Bilf of before us. With reference to standing order 218 I have simply to say that that nothing to do with the stage which we The standing order Whenever an Order of the Day is read? for the House to resolve itseM into Committee of the Whole, the Speaker leaves the Chair withputting any question, and the House thereupon resolves itself into a, Committe, unless uponi Notice given an Instruction thereto is proposed the first place, from the Chair. We are not at that stage, but very far removed from it. Standing order 249. No instruction can be given to a Committee to do that which it is already empowered to do, or to deal with a question beyond the scope of a Bill as read the second time. This amendment, as I have said, is not art instruction; and, if it were, it does not propose to give the Committee power which it already has, but to give it some other power which, without such a motion, it could not have. Standing order 25,1 statesAn instruction to a Committee of theWhole requires NoticeAs this amendment is not an instruction, notice is pot required. The standing order goes on to sayand can only be moved before first going into Committee on any question. That is before first going into Committee - on the Bill. The-second part of the standing order has no reference to the stage at which we have arrived in this debate, and I hold that the amendment is in order.",21
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Hav e you, sir, noticed the full effect of the words- or to deal with a question beyond the scope of a Bill as read the second time.'",21
66,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"The standing order 249 has the heading- ' What instruction may be moved. I have already said that this amendment is not an instruction. If it were an instruction it ought to be moved after the House has resolved on the second reading of the Bill, and when the House is about to go into Committee. I rule that the amendment is properly before the House.",21
67,Colonel FOXTON,MANUFACTURES,"Do I understand you, sir, to rule that the words of the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay "" and the Committee on the Bill be instructed "" and so forth is not an instruction to the Commitee?",22
68,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I have ruled, that while the word "" instruction "" appears in the amendment, and, perhaps, sufficiently justifies the honourable member in thinking that it is an instruction, it is by no means such. The amendment is introduced [properly understanding order 162, which I have quoted, and which declares that no Other amendment besides a proposal to leave out "" n o w "" and insert ""this day six months,"" or the previous question, shall be moved except in terms of a resolution strictly relevant to the Bill , which I say this amendment is. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I rise to other point of order. Under your decision', Mr Speaker, I submit that the words "" The Committee on the Bill be instructed "" are out of order. You have said that, as regards the subject-matter of this amendment, you do not regard it as an instruction.",22
69,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"I should say that it is extent. more than an instruction. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - The motion specifically provides that the Committee the Bill ""be instructed "" and so forth.",22
70,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"Is the honourable member debating Mr Speaker's ruling? Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - No . I simply urging that the word ""instructed"" should be deleted. As it stands, the amendment specifically provides that instruction shall be given to the Comfavour mittee to incorporate certain provisions in the Bill. I hope that we shall not commit ourselves to such a convery tradictory position as would be created by the acceptance of _ the motion, whilst, at the same time, it is held by Mr endeavour, Speaker that no such instruction as that for which it provides can be given at stage. I do not think that there would be subscribes. any difficulty in substituting other words for those ta which objection is taken, which - I suggest, Mr Speaker, are, cording to your ruling, out of order.",22
71,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"In reply to the point of order raised by the honourable member for North Sydney, I may say that shortly after the honourable member for Wide Bay had resumed his seat yesterday afternoon, after moving the amendment in question, I informed him that I thought it might, perhaps, be desirable to vary one or two of the. words which have given rise to the very point that has been taken today. I ultimately decided that the amendment as it stood was well within the provisions of standing order 162. I certainly think that the amendment would be improved by the deletion of the word "" instruction."" Some other word might be substituted for it. At the same time standing order 162 is so wide in its application that I cannot rule that the amendment, even as it stands, is contrary to it . I am quite prepared to confer with .the honourable member for Wide Bay, and think that the word "" instruction ' ' might be omitted, and a variation made that would meet the views - of honourable members generally. When we revise the Standing Orders, I think that we ought to amend standing order 162. I should like to see it so amended that the anonly amendment that could be moved on a motion for the second reading of a Bill would be one in substitution of it. That, I think, would be preferable to the present position.",22
72,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,It would not do to restrict honourable members to too great an,22
73,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"That is a point that need not be settled at the present stage. on Having regard to the standing order, I cannot rule otherwise than I have done. I have to interpret the standing order as it stands, and not as containing words that am I should like to see in it. Mr J. H . CAT TS (Cook) [3.19] - I rise to support the amendment moved by an the honourable member for Wide Bay in of the nationalization of the iron industry, on the ground that its production, in its very nature, must speedily, if not from the outset, become a monopoly. It would certainly be wrong to devote public money to the creation of a monopoly and then to after vested interests had been created, to have it nationalized in accordthi l ance with the view to which our party The honourable member for Flinders, who is violently opposed to and nationalization, by a process of close acreasoning came to the conclusion that this industry would become a monopoly, and others who are opposed to its nationalization take the same view. In these circumstances, we are therefore entitled to deal with the question from that stand-point. To my mind the honourable member for Flinders helped our cause considerably, and gave awav his own case when he said that he did not think that we should be prepared to grant .£250,000 to those engaged in this industry unless a complete plant were put down, and we were satisfied that it would be a success. That is exactly the position the Labour Party takes up. We hold that if public funds are to be devoted to the subsidizing of this industry we should take care that an up-to-date plant is put down and be satisfied that the people will receive value for their money. But if this bountv be handed over to a private firm we shall have no such assurance.",22
74,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,The bounty will be paid only on the iron produced.,23
75,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"The bounty might represent the margin of profit on the working of the industry, and the works might shut down as soon as it ceased, or an agitation may spring up for the granting of further assistance. No honourable member would think of putting £250,000 of his own capital into an industry in which he had no interest, and over which he had no direct control. If this huge sum is to be handed over to private enterprise it would b'e only in consonance with reason for the Government to take up a certain number of shares in the company, and to be represented on the board of directors. The people ought, in such circumstances, to have a voice in the direct management cf the enterprise, and a share in its profits. I may say at once that I prefer the imposition of a duty to the granting of a bounty, since under the new protection we intend to provide for the payment of reasonable wages to the workers engaged in the industry, and to guard against the undue inflation of prices. The Bill contains .no reference to the new protection scheme. We are told that, under it, regulations would be drafted providing for the payment of reasonable wages, but I would remind honourable members that there is nothing in the Bill to regulate the prices at which iron shall.be sold. Under a protective duty we should have a better control over the industry, and should be in a tetter position to apply to it the principles of the new protection, than we should be if we passed the Bill as it stands. The party to which I belong is pledged to the nationalization of monopolies. Individual members of it may have varying views upon the question of Socialism, and the extent to which the State should control industries; but, even if twenty-five out of twenty-six might be prepared to go beyond the nationalization of monopolies, the remaining member would not be bound by that view, since under the party platform we are not pledged to more than that. No majority view can compel a minority of the party to go beyond the platform. I am in favour of the nationalization of public utilities. Mr .MCWILLIAMS - The iron industry i'n Canada is not a monopoly.",23
76,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"I am dealing with the position of the iron industry in Australia, where the consumption of iron is not sufficient to warrant the laying down of several distinct plants. One up-to-date plant would be sufficient to produce all the iron that is necessary for the requirements of Australia.",23
77,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,There are five plants in operation in Canada.,23
78,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,And they have been bleeding the Government.,23
79,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Darling showed last night that about £4,500,000 had been paid by way of bounties to the iron companies in Canada, which have also enjoyed the protection of a duty of 25 per cent.. For the last fifteen years or more, as soon as one bounty has expired, a demand for a further bounty has been made and acceded to. When interrupted, I was pointing out that, .although a number of members of the Labour Party might be prepared to go beyond the nationalization of monopolies, that fact did not affect me. I would nationalize public utilities as well as monopolies, and I regard iron as a public utility.",23
80,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"So is sugar, but the honourable member did not fight for the nationalization of the sugar industry.",23
81,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"When the sugar duty was under consideration, I said that I was in favour of the nationalization of the industry. All the members of the Labour Party share that view. Iron is a public utility, and it would be a mistake for the Commonwealth to subsidize a private firm to produce that which is the basis of a great many of our industries; it would be wrong to leave the Commonwealth at the mercy of private enterprise, whose industry might be absolutely paralyzed by a trade dispute similar to that which has recently taken place in connection with the coal-mining inthose who misrepresent us? dustry. The honourable member for East more good than harm. Sydney is constantly sneering at the nationalization proposals of the Labour Party. He has argued that if we are in favour nationalizing one industry, we must be in favour of nationalizing all. . I do not these ' statements. know what views the party, or myself, may hold on this subject in the future. At prebility sent we are pledged to the nationalization public. of monopolies. If we secure this object, and our policy works successfully, the people may support us in a still further excursion into the domain of State but we have not now to consider how much further, it would be wise to go in fifty or 100 years time. We have quite enough to do at present in giving effect the principles of State Socialism embodied in the nationalization of monopolies. But the contention of the honourable member for East Sydney amounts to this-that if a man who had a wart on his finger were suffering from leprosy, no attempt should be made to cure him of his dire disease until the wart had been removed.",23
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"I think that there cannotone should be a quorum to !hear this discussion upon warts. [Quorum formed.""]",24
83,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,I am glad that honourable member for Parramatta recogquotations nises sufficient merit in my remarks to rant him in inviting a larger attendance of his colleagues to listen to me. At the present time it is quite sufficient for Labour Party to deal with the nationalizahonorable tion of monopolies and public utilities.,24
84,Mr HALL,MANUFACTURES,The members of the OpHansard to have saidposition are the wart curers.,24
85,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"When the Labour Party has cured some of the great diseases which now afflict the body politic, it will that, be soon enough to give attention tb minor questions. The honourable member for Sydney should cease from misrepresenting the objects of our party, and should bind us to his own interpretation on the planks of our platform. The honourable memthe ber for Swan the other day referred to our socialistic. proposals for nationalization, as proposals for the adoption of the share-and-shareposed alike system, although he knew that in industry ? making that statement he was deliberately misrepresenting us.",24
86,Mr FOSTER,MANUFACTURES,He may not have known better.,24
87,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,My complaint is that he does know better.  They do us,24
88,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"A number of misguided persons will believe anything said of by those who occupy eminent positions,and therefore it is necessary to contradict Unfortunately, many public men'do not recognise their responsito make fair representations to the",24
89,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,I could prove out of the mouths of members of the Labour Party every word that I have said. They control; are changing their front now.,24
90,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member has not stated in this Chamber that we wish to adopt the share-and-share-alike to principle. He goes outside to make the statement, where we cannot reply to him. If he made it here, we could deal with it. In the nationalization of the iron industry is involved a principle which has been supported by a very large number of members, even amongst those who call themselves anti-Socialists. They have from time to time urged the nationalization of enterprise and another, and therefore consistently object on principle to the nationalization . of the iron industry; they must deal with the proposal the on its merits. I wish to make a few from the speeches of antiwarSocialists-no t lengthy extracts-whic h show that they have on occasion given their adherence to Socialism ini some form. the For instance, on the 5th July last, the member for Fremantle, speaking on the Address-in-Reply, is reported in Referring to a system of State insurance",24
91,Mr HEDGES,MANUFACTURES,"I have always advocated though not State fire insurance. Mr J. H . CATrPS - Stat e insurance East means nationalization, and therefore Socialism. The honourable member ""having not supported Socialism in one form, is not justified in opposing the nationalization of iron industry on the ground that it is",24
92,Mr HEDGES,MANUFACTURES,Who says that I am opto the establishment of the iron,24
93,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,I understand that the honourable member was returned on the ticket of the honourable member for Swan.,24
94,Mr HEDGES,MANUFACTURES,"I have, from the start, advocated an Iron Bounties Bill.",24
95,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member, although elected as an antiyou Socialist, is a Socialist at heart. On the occasion referred to, he said",25
96,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I gather that the honourable member 'is about to quote report of a debate of this session on subject other than that .now before the Chair. If that is his intention, he must not proceed. Reports of. debates of or any other session on the subject .under discussion, arid reports ot debates of sessions on. any question, may be quoted; but reports of debates of this session questions other than that before the House control in one form or other. may not be quoted. Mr J. H. CATTS - The speech which I wish to read was delivered on 5th last..",25
97,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,This session began on 3rd July. . Mr J. H. CATTS - I understand that I shall be in order in summarizing the orable member's remarks without reading them?,25
98,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,The honourable memfhe ber may do that.,25
99,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Fremantle has admitted that he advocates Socialism Mr HEDGES !-°-In a form,- though what I have supported is not more socialistic than the sending of a telegram is. Mir. J. H . CATTS - On the 5th July the honourable member in this chamber advocated State Socialism as opposed to private enterprise. He suggested that the up to date. Government should appoint officers to call on private firms, to collect premiums from them in connection with a system of State insurance.",25
100,Mr HEDGES,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member is misrepresenting me. Mr JH CATTS* - I am sorry that Standing Orders do not allow me to quote the honourable member's exact words; but I shall take another opportunity to chapter and verse for my statement that a number of those who were returned anti-Socialists have, when it has served their purposes, acted as Socialists. Therenationalizing the iron industry. fore, they cannot oppose nationalization the iron industry purely as a matter principle; they must deal with the proof posal on its merits. The honourable memwhose ber for Bendigo has contended that the Government should assist the producers ject of the country by obtaining for them cheaper butter freights, and when asked whether that would not be Socialism, he said, "" Perhaps it is. I do hot care what call it. I call it common-sense.""",25
101,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"Hear , hear.",25
102,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"We say the same thing about this proposal. Honourable the members may call the proposed nationalia> zation of the iron industry Socialism. We reply, ""Cal l it that if you like; .but we call it common-sense."" I am glad that the this honourable member and others have been so far influenced by the common-sense other talked by members of the Labour Party that, although termed anti-Socialists, they on feel bound on occasions to support State I have here a list of nine honourable members who occupy seats on the opposite side of the July chamber, and whp were returned to this House upon theanti-socialistic ticket.",25
103,Mr HEDGES,MANUFACTURES,Does the honourable member call me an anti-Socialist?,25
104,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"When on the pubhonlic platform these honourable members assured their hearers that any excursion into the domain of Socialism would mean' nationalization of kitchens and the control of their children by the State. But in this House they honestly confess that they are in favour of the principle of nationalization as applied to .particular industries. If they do not object to the principle of nationalization, I maintain that they ought to be prepared to debate the amendment upon its merits. * These honourable members object to Socialism",25
105,Mr HEDGES,MANUFACTURES,It has a splendid record,25
106,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"It has. About £195,000,000, out of a little more than £270,000,000 of the public debt of the Commonwealth has been invested in socialistic undertakings, and quite-recently the Premier of New South Wales, in the arguing against the transfer of the State debts to the Commonwealth, declared that the capital invested in State Socialism in cite New South Wales was returning such a handsome profit that the Legislature did not as want to part with its debts. Surely these facts are sufficient to warrant us in I wish of now to refer briefly to the constitutional of aspect of the matter. Upon the showing some honourable members of this House opinions are worth considering, I submit that we should not abandon the profor the nationalization of this industry upon the ground that any such action would be unconstitutional. Sufficient doubt exists as to whether the Commonwealth has power to nationalize an industry, to warrant us. in dismissing that objection and in assuming that we do possess the necessary power. When the Prime Minister was Attorney-General in the Barton Government he expressed an opinion as to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth in regard to undertaking the control of this industry. In this connection he saidThe manufacture of iron may be incidental to the execution of many such powers, and construction of railways. The wealth may clearly undertake the manufacture of any goods for its own use, and probably if it did so and it were incidentally advantageous to the interest of the manufacture, that it should wealth to undertake it. also manufacture for other consumers, such manufacture would also come within its plied powers. Therefore, the Prime Minister has laid it down that the Commonwealth has power under the Constitution to manufacture iron if a great portion of that iron be consumed for Commonwealth purposes-that is, for the purposes of defence and of railway construction. If this question were investigated, I venture to. say it would be found that for some time to come the bulk of the iron produced in Australia will be utilized for governmental purposes. This must be obvious when we consider any scheme for our defence, which involves the manufacture of our own arms and ammunition. It has already been pointed out by the honourable member for .Nepean that half the iron now being produced in Lithgow is being used in connection with contracts with the New South Wales Government. would also urge upon the attention of honourable members that there is a likelihood of the Commonwealth embarking upon_ railway construction, and that it is not a remote possibility that the Commonwealth will take over the railways of the States as soon as the States debts become federalized. Whilst the present Prime Minister holds the views which I have quoted, the honourable member for Flinders declared last evening that he had no doubt whatever as to the constitutional power of the 'Commonwealth to undertake the manufacture of iron. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie. in referring to the honourable member, saidProbably if my honourable friend had not thought it was outside the region of practical politics, he would have resorted to that other stronghold-that it is unconstitutional.",25
107,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"^No , I do not think it is.",26
108,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member does not think it unconstitutional?,26
109,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,Not in the present Bill .,26
110,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,I am very pleased that the honourable member makes me a present of his belief that our proposal is not unconstitutional'. If I remember rightly the leader of the Opposition said this afternoon that it is unconstitutional.,26
111,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,I did not hear him say so.,26
112,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"I am not absolutely sure that he did, but if he did not make use of that language this afternoon, I am very much surprised.",26
113,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"What I mean is that so far as I know, it would not be unconstitutional 1 for the Federal Government to acquire it, but it would be unconstitutional to prevent the Statese.g,, defence from doing so. CommonWe do not propose to prevent the States from, embarking in the industry, but we do say that it is competent for the CommonIn view of the opinions which have been expressed by sucb imeminent constitutionalists as the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Flinders, we may surely accept the amendment of the leader of the Labour Party asone which is quite within the range of practical politics. In lieu of clause 9 in the Bounty Bill, which provides that a State may take over the iron industry and control 1 it, I think, that we ought to insert a provision for the Commonwealth assuming control of the production of iron in Australia. Apart altgether from the amendment, I think it would be wise to substitute a wider provision than that to which I have referred. Section 8 providesA l l bounties in respect of pig iron, puddled bar iron, or steel shall be granted on the condition^, that the manufacturer shall, if required, transfer as provided in this Act, the lands, buildings, plant, machinery, appliances, and maI terial used in the manufacture of the goods. Section 9 provides for a State, and not the Federal authority, assuming control under certain circumstances. In my judgment we ought t.o look ahead and provide that the Commonwealth shall control 1 this industry. It would be foolish to limit ourselves to the clause I ' have quoted, seeing that in a few years the Commonwealth may consume the greater portion of the iron produced in Australia. In referring to the question of railways, may I be permitted to reply to the remarks made last evening by the honourable member for Parkes? He declared! himself in favour of handing over the railways of the States to private enterprise, and asserted that the railway companiesof England treated the public much better than they were treated in Australia. I wish to quote a few' facts which are beyond dispute, aud which will absolutely demolish ' his statement. I hold in my hand a comparison which I instituted some time ago in a paper of which I hari control, and for the benefit of the honourable member I would like to give the information which I then collated. I will take the headings- "" The business trains in the suburban area of London running to time,"" ""Injuries to passengers,"" ""The 1 speed of trains,"" ""Carriage of products, meat, and fruit,"" ""Fares,"" and ""Working expenses and wages/' The time-tables, freight books and reports show that for a period of, say, six months, the number of passengers' landed at Liverpool-street sta- higher. tion, London, during morning business hours is 12,648.",26
114,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"Does the honourable member think that this has anything to do with the Bill? Mr J. H. CATTS - Las t night the honourable member for Parkes, when discussing the Bill, incidentally referred to State-owned railways, and urged that it would be better for the public if these were handed over to private control. The honourable member, as an argument against the nationalization of the iron industry, urged that the privately-owned railways in England were conducted more to the public advantage than are the State-owned railways in Australia, and my object is to dispose of the basis of the honourable member's position.",27
115,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I gathered, last evening that the honourable member for Parkes was endeavouring to strengthen his case against the nationalization of the iron industry by a comparison of privately-owned and publicly-owned railways. In that, the honourable member for Parkes was quite in oraer; and if the honourable member for Cook can disprove the point made by the honourable member for Parkes, he also will be in order. But what I fail to see is the connection between a reference to the 12,000 odd passengers which arrive at Liverpool-street station, and the question before the Chair. The number of passengers cannot affect the question of privately-owned as against publicly-owned railways.",27
116,Mr EDWARDS,MANUFACTURES,"I beg to call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.""]",27
117,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,I had intended to quote only very few figures on the point.,27
118,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"Of course, I had no knowledge of how much the honourable member intended to 'quote,",27
119,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Parkes contended that the privately-owned railways in England were conducted more for the benefit of the people than are the publicly-owned rail T ways of Australia; and, in reply, I desire to show that, as compared with London railways, the business trains ofSydney run more to time, that the injuries to passengers per thousand or per million are much less, that the speed of the trains is greater, that freight and fares are much less, that working expenses are much less, and that the wages are about 50 per cent,",27
120,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member may make such a comparison.,27
121,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"In order to make the comparison, I desire to quote from the New South Wales Railway and Tramway Review, which I recently edited, the followingOur railways compare more than favourably with the railways of the world. Statistics prove that for a period of, say, six months the number of passengers arriving at Liverpool Station, London, during the morning business hours was 12,648, 93.95 per cent, of whom arrived to time. For a similar period in New South Wales, we had 10,050 passengers arrive, and had over 96.90 per cent, to time, or nearly 3 per cent, better. In England they kil l one passenger for every ten million carried; New South Wales, one in every twelve million ; America, one in every two million. In England they injure one in every half million ; New South Wales, one in every one and three-quarter million ; and in America, one in every tenth of a million. Our suburban service is 30 per cent, faster than in England. For instance, take the Midland Company, in the very heart of London, from the suburbs to the Morgate-street central station. Take East Ham to Morgate-street, 14 miles, leaving East Ham at 7.40 a.m., arriving at the central station at 8.38 a.m - time , 58 minutes. Take our trains from Parramatta to Sydney, same distance, 14 miles, leaving Parramatta at 8 a.m., arriving Sydney 8.37 a.m - tim e 37 minutes; or leaving Parramatta at 8.20 a.m., arriving Sydney 8.53-tim e 33 minutes. These are the business trains'-the best in London with our best. The same applies to the evening business trains. When we compare the time in carrying business people, the passengers carried, and the percentages who were landed to time the State railways have nothing to fear from the comparison.  on the question before us?",27
122,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"I am quoting this in reply to the honourable member for Parkes, who, after referring to the benefits of privately-owned railways, contended that better results would be obtained if the iron industry were not conducted by the Government. There has been much criticism as to the freight in Australia on meat and f r u it ; and on this point I should to read the following from the same licationThe most favourable English instance is Great Eastern, who lowered freights for express purpose of encouraging meat producmust immediately become tion, and to develop meat traffic. Rate for tons and over, for 100 miles is £ 1 5s. iod. In New South Wales, same distance, same quantity, is ns. 8d. Single ton lots compare quite as ably. . . . Then take fruit and vegetables. Sittingbourne to London, a distance of 42 miles, rate is 18s. n d . per ton, with a discount of 10 per cent, for large quantities. New South Wales rate from Camden to Sydney, 42 miles, services. is 5s. iod. per ton. From Waterbury to London, a distance of 38 miles, the rate is 12s. whilst from Richmond to Sydney, 38 miles, our rate is 4s. i d . Our fares are, on the whole, lower, although we have not the teeming millions of people to travel. Then when we take the tion on the board of control. other side of the ledger we find our working expenses for the year ending June, 1905, were 59 per cent.; to the end of June, 1906, they only slightly over 50 per cent. While in England, the Great Northern is most favourable at 63 per the industry. cent., Great Eastern 64 per cent., and other panies much larger. The American average is about 67 per cent. Our wages are also f u l per cent, higher than in England. I offer these facts as a complete reply the generalizations of the honourable ber for Parkes, who assumed that the railways of England are better conducted, from the point of view of the people, than are the railways of Australia, and, on Australia that, contended that the iron industry ought to remain in private hands. My desire is to make my own position clear in regard to the question of nationalization, in view of the fact that the right honourable member for East Sydney made some statements which, in my opinion, were not warranted, and endeavoured to fasten on every individual member of the Labour Party views from which I , at least, dissent. I support the amendment, because iron is in its very nature a public utility, equally with, if not'more so, coal; and all public utilities ought to be the hands of the people. We have not yet travelled very far on the road of private enterprise in connection with the iron dustry ; and now is the most opportune time for the Commonwealth to exercise its power, and control this industry, to the immeasurable benefit of Australia, not only today, but in the future.",27
123,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,Does the honourable memin ber include food and clothing amongst public utilities?,28
124,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"I said a moments ago the extent to which I am prepared to go in the direction of like nationalization, and I do not desire, at pubthe conclusion of my speech, to be led into another long statement. I am in the favour of the nationalization of the iron the industry because, in its very nature, it a monopoly; two and all monopolies ought to be under the control of the State or the Commonwealth. favorI am in favour of the nationalization of From this industry because the public as a conthe crete body are the greatest users of iron in Australia in connection with the public We ought not to pay an immense sum like £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 to any private 2d.; person or persons without the Commonwealth, on behalf of the people, having some direct interest, and some representaThe Commonwealth ought to be in a position to were safeguard the interests of the public, and have some voice in framing the policy of In view of the immense comimportance of the iron trade to the people ly 50 as a whole, it should not be left now, or at any time, to exploitation by private to persons who manufacture a public utility memfor their own exclusive benefit.",28
125,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,Bendigo) [4.15] This measure is of such great interest and importance to the whole of the people of,28
126,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,I think that we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.'],28
127,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"I was about to say that this Bill involves such far-reaching interests, and is of such great importance that I feel justified in offering a few observations in respect of it, although I do not intend to take up so much - of the time of the House as has the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. The proposition that the Commonwealth should assist in the development of the iron industry has been before this Chamber in various forms during than a succession of sessions. I hope that the in time has now arrived when practical action will be taken; that the fate of the iron industry in Australia will no longer remain inin suspense, but that this Parliament will show that it realizes its significance and the absolute necessity of taking some action to place it upon a sound and practical footing. If evidence were wanting as to the immediately urgency of the Bill it would be found the circular letter which Mr William Sandford addressed to honourable members a few days ago, and in which he makes what certainly looks like a final appeal to few the Federal Parliament to assist in preventing a collapse of his ironworks at Eskbank, New South Wales. He states in that letter that the financial position of the works is now such that without Federal assistance they will have to be closed down. No honourable member-n o patriotic Australian - could regard as other than a national calamity such an event as the collapse and failure of those ironworks. I certainly hope that honourable members will take action to prevent - their closing down. I have had many, and perhaps special, opportunities to consider this question in the light of evidence taken in all the States of the Commonwealth, and can say that apart from the Tariff itself, there is before this Parliasity ment no proposition of greater moment, importance, and urgency than is the Bill now under consideration. I hope that the time has arrived when the long-continued efforts of the Treasurer will be crowned with success, and that the Bill will be passed substantially in the form in which it has been presented. If the bounty be paid in the manner proposed I believe' that it will be money well spent, and that coming ages will pronounce the verdict that the Bill was well considered and thought out, and contributed towards the material prosperity of Australia and the development cf some of its fundamental and organic industries. The honourable member for Wide Bay, in moving his amendment, drew attention to the unique fact that, up to the - present time iron production in Australia has not been established on a sound basis, although other great industrial enterprises have been fairly successful.. What is the reason for this? A number of circumstances have contributed to the state of affairs to which the honourable member for Wide Bayhas properly drawn attention. One live factor is that it is only within the last few years that scientific investigation and exploration has demonstrated the certainty of the existence of vast iron deposits in Australia.",28
128,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,The iron deposits of Tasmania were worked fifty years ago.,29
129,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"It was not demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt until recently that these deposits were worthy of the attention of capitalists who were prepared to launch upon such an enterprise. It is only of late years-sinc e the establishment of the Federal Parliament and the bringing of the question of the working of our deposits of iron ore prominently under its attention and that of the people of the world-that capitalists have really begun to show an inclination to put money into the industry. Amongst those who have largely helped in that direction none perhaps have done more than has Mr. William Sandford. He deserves the greatest praise and credit for his heroic action in standing by the industry through ill and good report. He has brought it under the attention of members of this Parliament as well as Of capitalists in Australia and elsewhere, and has battled against adverse forces, difficulties, and influences that would have discouraged-many men. It has been said that the spectacle of a brave man struggling against advercommands the admiration of the gods, and I am sure that every patriotic Aus^ tralian must regard with pride the efforts of . Mr Sandford, who has done his. level best to establish this industry. He has spent his own money-investe d his private fortune-and induced his friends also to invest capital in this big enterprise, without resorting to State assistance. But he has practically gone the length of his tether; having exhausted his own resources and induced his friends to almost exhaust theirs, he declares that unless he receives national assistance the industry must collapse.",29
130,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,Does the honourable member think that it would ?,29
131,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"We ought to accept Mr Sandford's solemn assurance, in the circular which he has addressed to honourable members, that the works will be closed unless he receives at the present juncture substantial and practical assistance. Some of the causes of the failures of the past have been want of capital and want of confidence, and in addition the fact that foreign mines and manufacturers have been supplying the requirements of Australia. I propose to confine my observations at the present stage to the question of the production of pig iron, bar, rod, angle, tee and sheet iron. Hitherto most of our supplies of those classes of iron have been drawn from countries where iron production has been established, after years of experiments and after a long and continuous effort and investment of'capital by companies and - firms that have practically secured a monopoly of the iron trade of the .world. Need we be surprised that Mr Sandford, in the Southern Hemisphere, having to compete against those world forces and factors, has experienced difficulty in placing his industry . on a sure and solid foundation? It is a common argument that the natural protection ought to be sufficient to enable the industry to be founded without State assistance. Honourable members are aware that hitherto pig iron and bar iron have been recognised as the raw materials of the engineering and other manufacturing industries in all the States, and have been properly kept on the free list. No doubt the normal freights charged upon pig, bar, rod, and sheet iron from New York or - London to Australia would amount to 16s. .or 17s. per ton.",29
132,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,Fro m 17s. 6d. to £ 1 per ton.,30
133,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"I have given the - normal freights, but evidence was given before the Tariff Commission that at certain periods of the year vast quantities of pig iron and bar iron are carried from the Northern Hemisphere to Australia as ballast, practically free, or at a nominal charge of 5s. per ton. That was proved by the incontestable evidence of Mr Sandford and his colleagues, and he refers to it as one of the contributing causes of his failure. Having to compete with the iron pro. ductions of old-world 'establishmentswhere the cost of production has been reduced to the lowest level-and which are brought out here very often as ship's ballast, he has had practically no natural protection ; he has had to compete on equal terms with the products of other countries, and has found it impossible to do so. There are also special considerations connected with the iron industry which seem to single it out from nearly every other industry as requiring particular specialization and organization to make it pay. Above all, it is an industry which cannot possibly be carried on at a profit unless it has an almost world-wide or Continental output. That has been the secret of the success of the great iron-works of the United States of America, England, and the Continent. A vast and continuous output enables the establishments to keep their furnaces going all the year round, thereby reducing the cost of production, and permitting the steady employment of a highly-trained staff of artisans. It is impossible to carry on this industry without continuity and vastness of output. Mere spasmodic production is economically unsound, and must result in failure. It is this that justifies, the Governments of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales in giving the iron industry special attention and substantial support. But the granting of bounties such as those proposed in the Bill, or the giving of such support as is provided for in the agreement between the Government of New South Wales and Mr Sandford, does not properly come within the definition ot Sbcialism, notwithstanding the assertion of the honourable member for Cook to the contrary. I have always maintained that it is the right arid duty of the State to give practical assistance to approved industries. But there .is a fundamental difference between State-aided or State-regulated industries and State-owned monopolies.",30
134,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,I suppose the honourable member would not object to State ownership under some conditions ?_,30
135,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"There are enterprises of a national character which the State is almost bound to undertake. Among these is the administration of the Post Office and the construction and management of railways. But such enterprises are, in themselves, peculiar and special, and diner fundamentally from the working of a coal mine, or the conduct of ironworks. Railways are constructed to further the trade and commerce of the whole community, and their construction and management involves the exercise of semi-territorial sovereignty and control of the land over which they pass: But the ownership of the mine does not involve territorial sovereignty, the operations entailed being merely the digging of certain minerals from the bowels of the earth and their appropriation to the uses and purposes of man. There is no analogy between State-owned railways or State-owned railway workshops, such ' as those at Newport, and State-owned coal mines or iron mines. The Newport workshops are incidental and accessory to the railway system of Victoria. As the State is justified in making railways for the development of its territory, it is justified in building workshops for the production of materials, appliances, plant, and rolling-stock to be used in connection with and upon them.",30
136,Mr HALL,MANUFACTURES,But it is not justified jn making the steel rails that it requires?,30
137,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"There'is nothing to prevent a State, if it likes, from going to the expense of making the steel rails that it requires; but the Governments of Victoria and of New South Wales will probably find it cheaper to place contracts with Mr Sandford than to make their own rails. If a State Government could make its rails more cheaply than it could buy them, itiwould be justified in making them.",30
138,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,Why could Phoenix Foundry make locomotives more cheaply than they are made at the Newport workshops ?,31
139,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"Unde r certain conditions, locomotives oould be made as cheaply and economically by private firms as by a State Railway Department. Phcenix Foundry failed because it was situated at Ballarat, ioo miles inland, and had to transport its coal and raw materials a long distance by rail, and also because, instead of its being kept regularly going, work was doled out to it piecemeal, in small orders, now and again, so that there could not be that continuity of production which is essential to profitable engineering or iron-working.",31
140,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"Furthermore , Phcenix Foundry had to make a profit on its turnover.",31
141,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"That is necessary for the success of any private enterprise. Had the Phcenix Foundry received enough work to keep it constantly going, it would not have come out on the wrong side, as it finally did, in the examination conducted by the Victorian Government. The Newport workshops are not analogous to a State ironworks. Any ironworks must supply, not merely State requirements, but also hundreds of thousands of private customers, and must be so managed that they will pay. Mr Sandford, because of his knowledge and experience, is more likely to make ironworks pay than is any State management.",31
142,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,"He would make an excellent general manager under the ""State.",31
143,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"He would have to be very highly paid for his services in such a capacity. A man who has travelled many times round the world, examining ironworks and investigating methods of iron production, is probably as expert on the subject as Mr Carnegie, and sbould command a salary of not less than £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 a year.  companies get their managers ?",31
144,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member is referring to private enterprises.  similarly ?,31
145,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"I do not think that iron, coal, or gold mines could be as"" economically or as efficiently managed by the State as by private enterprise.  Zealand today? not the Sir JOHN QUICK - No doubt the State might work a mine to supply coal to its railways.  wished to buy coal.",31
146,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"No facts have been adduced to show that ironworks could be The managed more cheaply by an Australian Government than by private enterprise. No one in this country is more capable of managing ironworks than Mr Sandford, and his able colleagues and co-directors. If we nationalize the industry, the danger is that, instead of making it a success, we shall cause failure and disaster, so that Ihe last stage will , be worse than the first. ",31
147,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"That is because the those interested in the Lithgow ironworks have had to struggle against adverse conditions, which we can largely remove. It is because the establishment of .the iron industry would benefit every other manufacturing industry in Australia that the Commonwealth is justified in making a special grant to assist it . The honourable member for Maranoa and others voted for the granting of bounties to encourage the growing of cotton and rice and other minor industries. Why, then, should they refuse to grant bounties for the establishment of an industry which in magnitude, importance, and influence overshadows every other?  arises in this case.",31
148,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"MT . Sandford will not necessarily have a monopoly. There are iron deposits in Queensland, wh<>se prospects, I am. told, are as good as ihcse of New South Wales, and there are iion deposits in Tasmania. These do not lielong to Mr Sandford. If the iron industry is established in New South Wales by the payment of a modest bounty of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , other ironworks may spring up in other States.  as easily as'boot factories.",31
149,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"I know that it requires a capital of from £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to establish ironworks; but I have been informed by a well-known engineer that, > if the bounty is granted, and Mr Sandford obtains all the plant that he .can buy, he will not be able to turn out sufficient iron to meet the requirements of the Australian market. Therefore there will be an abundant opportunity for others - either to share in the proposed bounty or to apply for similar assistance in establishing works in Queensland or in Tasmania. I deny that these works will necessarily be a monopoly.",31
150,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,They could not complete the orders given to them by the New South Wales Government alone.,32
151,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"So I am informed. Although Mr Sandford has contracted to supply the State Government with 500 tons of pig iron per month, he is not able to meet its requirements. So that there is plenty of scope for the establishment of other ironworks in Australia besides those at Eskbank. Last night, the honourable member for Flinders spoke in rather a doubtful tone. Before he is prepared to vote this money, he desires some guarantee that these ironworks will be carried on in a successful manner. In other words, he requires a guarantee against failure before he has contributed anything towards the success of the industry. If any guarantee of that kind is required, I think that we can appeal to the action of the New South Wales Government, which has exhibited a firm belief in the bona fides of this enterprise. That Government has entered into a contract with Mr Sandford' to supply it with all the iron required for State purposes. In other words, they have practically granted him a subsidy, thereby showing that they have absolute confidence in the enterprise. The iron deposits are associated with deposits of coal, and Mr. Sandford has already exhibited his faith in this, great work by spending a large amount of his own money, and by inducing the investment of private capital in the industry. The surroundings of the industry, its previous history, and the association with it of so many good and true men ought to be sufficient to satisfy even the honourable member for Flinders that it is a substantial and bond fide one, and one which ought to receive favourable treatment at our hands. I believe that it can be best assisted by means of a bounty, and that the proposal for its nationalization is a mere idle dream, which will never be realized, because it is utterly impracticable. In order to nationalize the industry, the Commonwealth would have to buy out Mr Sandford and his mines, as well as practically all the iron deposits in Australia- a course of action which would involve the expenditure of many millions sterling. Even after the Government had secured these resources, it is very doubtful whether they would be able to carry on the industry as well as those men who have staked their all in it, and who have every, reason to induce them to work these resources in an economical and successful manner. A mere stage manager or superintendent who is paid a salary wpuld not have the same strong incentive to work them successfully as would those individuals who have launched their capital in the industry, and who, as directors, are personally interested in it.",32
152,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,Why ?,32
153,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"Because men are more alert where their own interests are concerned than they are when they are acting for others. That is only human nature. As a rule, they are more select and more competent than would be a board of directors which might be appointed as the result of political patronage.  for Kooyong work the Broken Hill Proprietary Mine, or does Mr Delprat?",32
154,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"Mr Delprat is under the control of the board of directors. The latter have invested their money in the mine, and if their manager did not perform his duty faithfully they could soon displace him. We have frequent instances of that sort of thing at Bendigo. I repeat that there is a greater probability of the works being carried bn successfully by persons who are directly interested in them, than there is if they werecontrolled by State managers. Under the guidance of private enterprise, with the aid of a fair measure of assistance from the public, the iron industry will be a success. I believe that Mr Sandford's present necessities arise from the fact that, although he has erected a blast furnace for the production of pig iron at a cost of ,£120,000, he is at present without the necessary plant for converting that pig iron into bar iron, wrought iron, sheet iron, and plate' iron. In order to procure this plant it is imperative that he should secure other capital amounting to, approximately, £250,000. Without the sanction and support of the Parliament and people of Australia, he will be unable to obtain this. Consequently a crisis has now arisen in the history of the industry, and the question which we have to determine is whether this Parliament will allow Mr Sandford and his works to go down, and thereby delay the development of the industry for an indefinite period? I very much regretted to hear some members of the Labour Party declare that if they could not secure the nationalization of the industry they would vote, not for the payment of a bounty upon the production of iron, but for the imposition of duties.",32
155,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,Why ?,33
156,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"Because I am satisfied that those honourable members can trade. hardly have considered the serious sequences that will result to the whole the engineering and iron industries of tralia if duties be imposed upon pig, wrought, sheet, and plate iron.",33
157,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,We should need counterterials vailing duties then?,33
158,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"Eve n countervailthese ing duties would not be suflicient, because Mr Sandford would not be able to underincreased take the production of the whole of these raw materials.",33
159,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"Does the Bill profully vide for the payment of a bounty to Mr. Sandford, or is it designed to encourage the establishment of the iron industry?",33
160,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"It authorizes payment of a bounty to the great company of which Mr Sandford is the leading spirit. I am not ashamed to name in connection with the industry. Even with the aid of duties .his company would not be able to turn out one-quarter expansion or one-half of the bar, rod, angle, and plate iron which would be required, and every foundry would be thus called upon cost to pay practically a revenue duty upon consequently these raw materials for many years to company come. Those honourable members who countries, advocate the imposition of duties in lieu of the payment of a bounty are advocating ^'50,000. something which would operate oppresa sively upon every ironfounder and enagainst gineer in Australia.",33
161,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,What will the ironoutside foundries do when the period during which the bounty is to operate expires?,33
162,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"B y that time it benefits is hoped that the industry will have been interests .placed upon a sound footing, so that Mr. Sandford will .be able to compete with imports from oversea by the aid of duties.",33
163,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,Exactly .,33
164,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"The duties will then be necessary to prevent outside manufacturers from dumping. It seems to me that some honourable members have not realized the disastrous effects that would flow from the .imposition of duties upon these raw materials. If such duties are imposed they will also operate most injuriously to those foundries and iron works which are at present making specialized machines for export. It is well known that some foundries in New South Wales and Victoria are turning out machinery of a specialized character, known as dredging machinery, which has been invented and developed locally, and which has been so improved that it has led to an export At the present time upwards of con- £40,000 or £56,000 worth of these of :pecialized engines and machines are anAusnually exported from . Australia to the Malay Peninsula and to Eastern countries. If duties be imposed upon the. raw maI have mentioned, they will undoubtedly add to the cost of producing specially-patented Australian machines, the price of which will thereby be to the consumer, so that in course of time the foreign manufacturer will probably be able to compete successwith our own foundries. I . would now like to quote a passage from a letter which, I understand, was forwarded by the manager of the Austral Otis Engineering the Company Limited to the Minister of - Trade and Customs, and which I saw reprinted in one of the Melbourne newsmention his papers. It readsThere is another phase of the subject which requires some attention, and I trust with the of manufactures fostered by the more adequate protection will assume greater magnitude, viz., exports of manufactured iron-work and machinery. Division VIA. will increase the of raw material by 12^ per cent, ad val., and increase the cost of production of finished machinery by an equal amount. My is now exporting machinery to foreign principally Eastern Asia and adjoining islands, which this year will total probably The additional cost may cause the loss of this export trade; in any case, it will be serious handicap in getting further business foreign competition, and be a permanent factor in reducing opportunities for expansion our own borders until our local ironmasters can compete ' with' the world's prices; which must take a long time. While we are quite prepared to forego this trade for the of securing the business of our own markets, it might be politic to consider in the of the employment of labour some form of rebate of the added cost for exports the of machinery manufactured in the Commonwealth to foreign countries or otherwise' give a bonus for iron manufacture instead of the fixed duty, as it is manifestlv impossible for any two or three ironworks to make all of the qualitits and sections required. The substance of that letter is that, in the opinion of this iron-master, the best way to promote the iron industry in Australia is by a bounty, and not by a duty, which would increase the cost of production, and that it would be impossible for any one establishment such as that of Sandford Limited, to tura out all the sections and varieties required in the engineering industry.' Under the circumstances, a duty, by adding to the cost of production, would impede the development of the iron and engineering trades in Australia. I hope that the result of this debate will be secure, nof only in this Bill , but outside, especially in the case of munitions. sympathetic consideration for the iron dustry. I hope that the people of Australia will consider and examine the possibilities of the future development of these works in New South Wales, which, I hope, will receive support, not merely in the shape of iron. a bounty from this Parliament, but",33
165,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,Not only in that New South Wales.,34
166,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURES,"I hope that ironworks in New South Wales and other States will be regarded as a national asset, So f which we, as Australians, mav well feel proud, and upon which, in years to come, we shall have to draw in order to build fleets and other great engineering works, Mr Franki, in his evidence before the Tariff Commission, said that it would be ^ impossible to establish ship-building in Australia until there was iron production adjacent to the works, and he, therefore, supported a bounty as the best method developing the industry. Mr Sandford, public requirements. in his evidence, said, and truly, that iron-works of a country are the basis national defence. We can never hope to develop our national defences-w e - can never hope to build iron-clads, cruisers, and battle-ships in the same way as Japanese are now doing-unles s we have iron-works established on a sure and lasting national foundation.",34
167,Mr FOSTER,MANUFACTURES,"New England) [5.5] The last few words of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo sum up the main argument in favour of nationalizing the iron industry. The honourable and . learned member said that, without the iron industry in Australia, we cannot build great about nationalization. iron-clads, or manufacture the munitions war, necessary for our defence.

In the late Russo-Japanese war we to had some examples of contract supplies, It inseems to' me that ship-building will come within the province of the Commonwealth before many years-at least, I hope so-and this will necessitate the consumption of an enormous quantity, of Not many weeks ago there was a debate in this House on national calamity, the rabbit pest.

' Then we have our great municipalities requiring supplies of the same kind, and I do not see why the Government should not manufacture iron and of supply it , of the best qualitv, for the If ever, there was an the industry which provided an argument for of nationalization, it is the iron industry, Personally, I regret that the nationalization of any industry should be proposed before we have a national banking system, the Ways and means must be considered in every enterprise, but evidently we have in power today a Government who are prep are d t 0 undertake a large national expenditure in order to help this industry.

Private enterprise is responsible for theft and murder; it is responsible for the recent bulling and bearing in the United States-al l the abominations of the present crisis there may be attributed to private enterprise. markable that when private enterprise ir*r* into a difficulty, or when it causes almost a national crisis, it flies to the 'Government for assistance. Even in America today, those who are responsible for the present financial troubles there have appealed to the Government to issue bonds to a very large amount in order to enable the commercial community to tide over the difficulty. We remember when the Government had to be appealed to for support for the Bank of England; and if we come nearer home, we know how in New South Wales the private enterprise banks had to be assisted by the Government by means of a Banks Issue Act. We further know how the New Zealand Government had to guarantee private banks to the extent of £2,000,000 in order to avert bankruptcy and ruin throughout the Dominion. I do not object to the tirades on Socialism - so-called ; I do not object to honourable members opposing public co-operation. We know that if we establish co-operative methods-and I consider nationalization to be the quickest method of co-operationwe shall cut off the sources of supply from all kinds of men, who, for their own profit, juggle with the food supply and other requirements of the people. A nation requires supplies of all kinds, and one of the curses of the present day is that men so juggle with finance as to rob the people right and left.",34
168,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,In whose interests were the banks supported in New South Wales?,35
169,Mr FOSTER,MANUFACTURES,"The banks asked for socialistic assistance pn the plea that that assistance was for the good of the State. In that plea, they were quite right, and I am proud that the socialistic method was used for preventing a financial crisis, which to most of us would have meant ruin. That fact alone-o r that fact, coupled with the other that those concerned in the iron industry are now appealing for Government help-onl y shows that it would be better, a thousand times over, for the Government to undertake the enterprise themselves. We have a splendid world; I have nothing to growl about on this great planet. We have every means for living ioyous, happy lives; and it is only the chicanery and the private financing for profit that cause some persons to suffer as they do today. Here we are struggling against exorbitant prices. Why? Solely because of private enterprise. I do not believe in wholesale nationalization, and It is re- if a motion were to be submitted tomorrow to nationalize, for instance, the farming industry, I should take the view that there was no necessity for such a step. There are thousands of farmers engaged in production, and, therefore, there is no possibility of any monopoly, seeing that each has to produce the best article in order to obtain a reasonable price. Furthermore, I should not approve of the Commonwealth having anything to do with speculative mining, such as that for gold, for other precious metals, or for precious stones. It seems to me that all honourable members are Socialists and co-operators, and that we differ only in regard to the extent to which we areprepared to go. Honourable members of the Opposition have said that 'the Labour Party is going back upon its socialistic ideals; but, so far as I am concerned, I am prepared to vote for the nationalization of any industry when I think that such a course would be in the best interests of the public. I am not altogether enamoured of the contention that we should nationalize this industry simply because'it will be a monopoly; it is sufficient for me to urge that it should be nationalized on the ground that the best interests of the Commonwealth would thus be served. I listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders, who expressed an anxiety to ascertain whether the Labour Party, since it believed in the nationalization of the iron industry, also favoured the nationalization of land. It is unfair for our opponents to resort to such extremes. The platform of the Labour Party provides for the nationalization of monopolies, and also includes a proposal for the imposition of a land tax. We think it sufficient that our programme should cover all that is practicable within the life of a Parliament, and the honourable member for Flinders was really playing with this question when he sought to draw us in the wav I have indicated. But he was not so unfair as was the leader of the Opposition, who endeavoured to show 'that because we favoured the nationalization of the iron industry, we desired to nationalize everything. In passing, I would say to those who have urged that the iron industry would not be a monopoly, that we must not forget that we are legislating for the future as well'as for the present. The name of the Steel Trust of the United States of America is one with which to conjure, and in laying the foundations of a young nation, we have to remember that we might have such a' Trust in Australia. A steel Trust in the Commonwealth certainly would not possess such power as does the Steel Trust of America, since the railways are owned by the States; but the Labour Party feels justified in opposing a proposal to hand over to private enterprise an 'industry which could well be made a Government undertaking. I have condensed my remarks in order that a vote mav be taken as speedily as possible, and also because many of the views that I had intended to express have already been voiced by other honourable members. I was somewhat surprised by the warmth shown by the honourable member for Bendigo when dilating upon the possibility ofState enterprise-of which in this connection he knows nothing-failing . The honourable member worked himself into a state of excitement in discussing the possibility of the failure of co-operation, forgetting altogether that it is the very failure of private enterprise that has induced the Government to bring this proposal before us. He also urged that those who favoured the imposition of a duty in preference to the granting of a bounty were prepared to penalize many industries. in the Commonwealth, overlooking the fact that it is not proposed to impose the iron duties until a certificate is issued that the industry has been established. The heading to division VI . A , which covers the duties on iron and steel, sets forth that they are- . To come into operation on dates to be fixed by Proclamation, and exempt from duty in the meantime. Proclamation to issue so soon as it is certified to Parliament by the Minister that the manufacture to which the Proclamation refers has been sufficiently established in the Commonwealth.",35
170,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,The industry is alreadv sufficiently established.,36
171,Mr FOSTER,MANUFACTURES,"Not at all. As a matter of fact, only one section of the industry has been established. I shall vote for the imposition of a duty of 12£ per cent., because I think that the industry ought to be protected. I have previously voted for bounties on the understanding that they were designed to assist industries that have not been established; but I think that the production of iron in Australia has gone beyond the stage at which a bounty should be granted for its encouragement. to see how. it can be said that we should penalize manufactures of which iron is the raw material by the imposition of a. duty, subject to the condition that it shall not [221] come into operation until the iron industry is properly established. Listening to the honourable member for Bendigo, one would have thought that the intention of the Government was that the bounty payable under this Bil l should be granted solely for the benefit bf Mr Sandford. A glance ' at the measure is sufficient to show that the intention is that any one who sets up an establishment for the manufacture of pig iron and the other material mentioned in the schedule shall participate in the bounty. When we visited the works at Lithgow, I was told by a responsible representative of the company that they did not care whether they obtained a bounty or a duty; they would be satisfied sq long as the industry was assisted.",36
172,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,Did they not say that they would prefer a duty of 12^ per cent. ?,36
173,Mr FOSTER,MANUFACTURES,"I cannot say, but I certainly would prefer such a duty to the granting of a bounty. A bounty, as distinguished from a duty, is necessary only where the establishment of an industry in the Commonwealth is doubtf u l . Those which we have hitherto granted may be secured by persons in a small way of business, but the establishment of the iron .industry is necessarily an enterprise for large capital.",36
174,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,Do I understand that in the event of the Bill being defeated the honourable member would vote for the immediate imposition of a duty on iron?,36
175,Mr FOSTER,MANUFACTURES,"Not at all. The proposal of the Government is that the duty shall not come into operation until the local industry is satisfactorily established - One more reference to the speech of the honourable member for Bendigo, and I shall have done. The honourable member sought to raise a scare against the nationalization of this industry on the ground that if it were nationalized the Government would have to buy out all the iron mines and ironworks in Australia. To make such a suggestion is to disregard all the conditions pertaining to mining. If the industry were nationalized the Government would have a monopoly of it, and private enterprise in the Commonwealth would find it unprofitable. It would be absolutely unnecessary for the Government to buy up all the iron mining ventures in Australia ; but in 1 I fail the event of the amendment being agreed to I should certainly like the Government to take over MrSandford's plant, because it is a new and effective one. I wish Mr. Sandford every success, and if the amendment be rejected I shall vote for a duty of 12^ per cent., on the terms provided for in the Tariff, in order that private manufacturers may be assisted.",36
176,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"Kooyong) [5.26] - On previous occasions I have supported measures providing for the payment of a bounty to encourage the iron industry, and on the general question see no reason to depart from the position that I have hitherto taken up. It is well that the House should realise that the failure of the iron industry tu receive from the Commonwealth the assistance that its importance demands has been clue to the obstructive tactics of the Labour Party. Doubtless they have had in mind the promulgation of State nationalization, but no one can deny that the failure of the Commonwealth to assist the industry has been due t"" the tactics of that party. I have before .'rated in this House that the business with which I am associated has enabled me to ascertain in some measure what are the practical possibilities of our ore deposits. We have enormous deposits of oxidized bodies throughout Australia, and it is a matter for regret that they have not long since been utilized. But there are some misconceptions as to the possibilities of the iron industry. I may perhaps be permitted to explain that in order to nroduce the better qualities of steel, ore which has phosphorus as one of its basic contents is undesirable. Nevertheless, we have large oxidized bodies which can unquestionably be worked most profitably, and I think the House is unanimous as tp the desirableness .of ironworks being established in Australia. The only point upon which there is a difference of opinion is as to the method by which the industry shall' be assisted. The method now proposed is the granting of bounties. That method' has been adopted in other countries, notably in Canada, where over £ 1 ,5 0 0 , 0 0 0 has been distributed by the Government. But, notwithstanding that large expenditure, there are only two or three establishments in Canada producing iron which can be used for the manufacture of the best kinds of steel, ancl I am assured that over 50 per cent, of the necessary material has to be imported. Canada, however, is in a better position than Australia for the production of iron, and its ore deposits contain chemical constituents with less deleterious contents. In South Australia .there is a deposit of millions of tons of iron ore at a place called Iron Knob, and the oxidised material there obtainable has been very full y exploited by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, with which I am associated. "" The company has not yet seen any inducement for undertaking the manufacture of iron; but this ore, in its crude condition, is being exported to Great Britain and the Continent, where it is used for certain purposes for which it is serviceable. There are also magnificent deposits in Tasmania. It is estimated that over 40,000,600 tons of ore are exposed on the Blythe River.",37
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Are not the South Australian deposits too far from a coalfield?,37
178,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"There is a railway from the mine to the shipping port, to which a regular supply of coal is brbugnt by chartered steamers, so that if there were any inducements we could overcome that difficulty. But it is well for the House to know our limitations in this matter. I understand that during the period of the bounties, there is to be no issue of a. Proclamation bringing into force the duties in division VI . a of the Tariff, which would seriously interfere with Australian industries. The honourable member for Flinders last night dealt with this matter in a sound and business like way. He said-and I share his opinion-that a bountv of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 will not place the iron industry on a satisfactory footing. The honourable member for Parkes- I think under a misapprehension-suggeste d that the honourable member for Flinders was influenced by the consideration that the. enterprise which we are asked to assist is located in New South Wales. Discussions which I had with the honourable member for Flinders prior to his speech, and remarks which I have heard him make since, convince me that that is not so.",37
179,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"Hear, , hear !",37
180,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,But there is no doubt as to where the industry will be established.,37
181,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,Almos t all works of this kind will probably be established on the New South Wales sea-board.,37
182,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"Perhaps , though I do not think that any of us are influenced by that consideration. Moreover, the Moore-Heskett process, of which the promoters have such sanguine expectations, is a Victorian enterprise. I should like their wildest dreams to be consummated, because if they are, an industry will be established here which will make Australia world-famed, and will bring immense profit to the Commonwealth and to all concerned. I am yet unable to ac-. cept these sanguine expectations.",37
183,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURES,There was a very successful demonstration yesterday.,38
184,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"I am delighted to hear it ; because I ' should like the process to prove a success. If it does, Victoria, too, will share in these bounties. In any case, there is no foundation for the belief that any honourable member is influenced in regard to this proposal by the consideration that the enterprise which it will benefit is a New South Wales enterprise. The speech of the honourable member for Flinders was such as might have been made to a number of business men assembled to discuss the best way of dealing with the money proposed to be expended. He showed how the proposals of the Government should be safeguarded.",38
185,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,Bu the contended the other day that the Government will not have the money; that we are getting to the end of our financial tether.,38
186,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member for Flinders showed last night that probably during the next two years the Treasurer will have large surpluses.,38
187,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"No , I shall not.",38

189,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"He has shown that private enterprise must fail. - Mr KNOX - Ha d he come here with a specific request for assistance and support, he would have received consideration. He possesses enterprise and ability, having, as the honourable member for Bendigo has pointed out, gone round the world several times to gain a knowledge of the most approved methods of iron working. He has returned a well-informed man for the purpose of maintaining this great enterprise.",38
190,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,And he has proved that its management is beyond private enterprise.,38
191,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"To manage the industry is not beyond the capacity of private enterprise. The whole point is that there is not a sufficient market available within the Commonwealth. I wish now to place upon record a statement compiled for me, and which represents a condensation of the published statistics relating to the importation into Australia of various classes of iron.

He is giving information which bears well upon the subject under discussion, and it is very discourteous to him, as well as being contrary to the rules of the House, that conversation should be maintained in the chamber to the extent of seriously disturbing the thought of the honourable member.",39
193,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"The United States. Great Britain, Sweden and Germany have to import such large quantities of raw material that at the best we can only hope to secure a very small share of the 'production to which I have alluded.  import pig iron?",39
194,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,Yes . Great Britain largelv imports the raw material from Spain and Sweden.,39
195,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,And America imports it from Canada.,39
196,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"Americ a has to import material which is necessary to make the best class of steel. Canada, notwithstanding her great natural advantages, has never been able to make a great success of the industry, although it has been assisted by the State to the extent of over £1,500,000. I hold that a sum of £250,000 is absolutely inadequate to place the iron industry upon a sound commercial basis. I do not suggest for ai moment that even if the whole of that amount found its way into the hands of the compan v which has established works at Lithgow, . in New South Wales, it would be expended . ih an undeserved direction. On the contrary, I think that Mr Sandford's works merit all the consideration that we cari extend to them. But if there had been anv prospect of the industry proving successful, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and other companies, which possess excellent deposits of oxidized iron, would have long ago embarked upon it. But the delay in assistance to the industry is due to the obstructive policy of my honourable friends in, the Labour corner. Had they in the first instance been willing to authorize the payment of a bounty to the industry, I know that £1: .000,600 would have been sunk in establishing works at the Blvthe River. The Blythe River Company took the precaution to secure from Great Britain, one of the most competent men to advise them in regard to the enterprise. He came to Australia, and as the result of his investigations informed the company that their only hope of success was to be found in investing the sum of £1,000,000 in the industry, and that any less amount would be practically thrown away. If the honourable member for Flinders will propose the appropriation of a larger sum than that provided for in this Bill for the purpose of assisting the industry, I shall be only too glad to support him, provided that the necessary safeguards which he indicated are forthcoming.",39
197,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,A private member cannot move in that direction.,39
198,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,I quite admit that.  from ?,39
199,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"Fiv e hundred thousand pounds is not too large a sum to expend in placing the industry upon a sound commercial footing. From published returns, I gather that the production of pig iron at Lithgow at present amounts to 700 tons per week. It is also stated that this output could, with the present appliances, easily be increased to 1,000 tons per week. We may therefore assume that the output for some time to come will not exceed 50,000 tons per annum. Now, the imports of pig iron into the Commonwealth during 1906, including scrap, amounted to 61,000 tons. Assuming the) present consumption were maintained, and that the duty imposed was sufficiently high to entirely exclude imports of pig iron, there would thus be a deficiency of 11,000 tons if the furnaces erected here were to supply the necessities of the local market. But the imports of bar, rod, angle, plate, sheet, galvanized, scrap, and pig iron and hoops amounted last year to approximately 201,702 tons. So that the enterprise we are now assisting can only supply but a small proportion of the present importations. My desire, df course, is to adhere to the position I have taken up on previous occasions, and support the principle of granting a bounty. I believe that the manufacturers would prefer a straight out duty, if the financial necessities .of their enterprise at the present time could be overcome, as I hope they may be. However, I have seen no reason to change my opinion that, with proper safeguards, they would be better assisted by the payment of a bounty; and, consequently, it is my intention to vote for the second reading of the Bill, reserving to myself the full right to vote against clauses which, in my opinion, should have rendered the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Wide Bay absolutely unnecessary. According to clause 9 and other clauses, the Government assume the power, if the industry is not a financial success, to take possession; and such provisions, I think, a long way on the road which my friends in the Labour corner desire to travel. shall undoubtedly use my best efforts to that these clauses are eliminated.  tion that the Broken Hill Proprietary intend to qualify for the bounty.",39
200,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,I can assure honourable members that there is not any such intention on the part of the Broken Hill Proprietary.,40
201,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,It would be very desirable that the Broken Hill Proprietary should endeavour to earn the bounty.,40
202,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"It would be a good thing, but the Broken Hill Proprietary Company is conducted on business lines.; and I do not at present see any .prospect of success in the iron industry until the population, and the consumption, are enormously increased.  vote the money, does not the honourable member think that there ought to be the right at some time to take over the industry? *",40
203,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"If so, the same argument would apply to every industry on behalf of which a high duty has been imposed^ because I regard duties as more or less an assistance to the industries. I must say that I cannot quite understand the schedule to the Bill. The first primary production is, of course, pig irori; and it is sometimes put into blocks, and also, in its molten state, into furnaces, from which steel is produced. I desire to point out that the admixture of materials used in the secondary process very largely enhances the value; and I should like to point out an inconsistency which, I think, is worth the consideration of the Treasurer. bounty on pig iron made from Australian ore is to be 12s.; on puddled bar iron made from Australian pig iron, 12s.; and on steel made from Australian pig iron, 12s. We must assume, therefore, that it is the intention of the Government to give a cumulative bounty of 12s. a ton on the various processes.",40
204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I do not think the honourable member ought to take that for granted.,40
205,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"I am informed that the third 12s. is doubtful, but the first and second 'are undoubtedly cumulative, and, consequently, the bounty is 24s. a ton.",40
206,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The honourable go member is not correct; I took advice on the point this morning. I Mr KNOX - I understand the Minister see now to say that the manufacturer has to declare whether he will claim the bounty on steel production or on pig iron-that he will not receive twice 12s. as a cumulative bounty.,40
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The intention is not what the honourable member thinks it is.,40
208,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"At any rate, the schedule is capable of the construction which I place upon it. However, I understand from the interjection of the Treasurer that the manufacturer must say whether he intends to claim the bounty on steel or pig iron-that only 12s. will be paid to him. Sir WILLIAM L YNE - I know perfectly well that that interpretation might be placed on the schedule, but that is not the intention.",40
209,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"It is an important matter, when we are supporting a Bill of the kind. We do not intend that so large a sum as 24s. per ton shall be paid; and I entirely concur in the view that we are entering on an experiment, which I regard with considerable fear. It is quite possible that the bounty may not be effective. The more we inquire into this matter, and the more we consider the opinions of those who are competent to judge, the more we are convinced that £250,000 is altogether an inadequate amount. It will provide financial assistance to an industry which is at present in existence, and which, under proper safeguards and control, ought to have devoted to it a far larger amount than that proposed. But I repeat that this great industry is one which ought to have received attention in the early days of the Commonwealth, when large capital was available ; and for any delay there - may have The been the Labour Party must accept the responsibility.",40
210,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"Gwydir) [6.10] - I listened with some degree of satisfaction to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Kooyong. The honourable member made two distinct statements: first, that for whatever delay there may have been in the establishment of the iron industry the Labour Party are responsible; and, secondly, that £250,000 is not sufficient for the purpose intended-that £500,000 is necessary to place the industry on a sound footing.",40
211,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,"I do not think that even that amount would be suflicient. Mr Webster Neither do I , if we may judge by the experience of Canada. It is most remarkable how the honcrable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Flinders agree as to the inworks adequacy of the bounty proposed. The unanimity would have been inexplicable had not the honourable member for Kooyong indicated, to a certain extent, the influence which is at work in the urging of a larger bounty than that proposed. The honourable the industry. member first found fault with the material that has up to the present been tried for the impossible. making of iron in Australia, and said the ore hitherto discovered and tested does not contain those chemicals essential to production of the better classes of iron. After having laid down that very doubtful proposition, the honourable member then dicated that he knew one place, and place only, in Australia where iron of proper character exists, namely, at the Knob, which is now owned by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company.",40
212,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member for Kooyong did hot say that.,41
213,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable memconsistently ber for Kooyong may not have definitely stated it, but he indicated that the iron which combined the essentials was to be obtained at the Iron Knob, in which the Broken Hill Proprietary Company are terested.",41
214,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,That is not what the honourable member for Gwydir said beconsistency. fore ; what the honourable member said was that the honourable member for Kooyong indicated that there was only one place where the iron ore should come from.,41
215,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Kooyong indicated no other place, and it is somewhat strange that he should single out one spot if he knew of others; it is practically an indication on his part that, so far as his knowledge goes, there is only one place where the proper conbe ditions prevail.",41
216,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,If the honourable member had listened he would have heard the honourable member for Kooyong refer to the Blythe River.,41
217,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable memStates ber for Kooyong did not say, or infer, that the ore at Blythe River contained the only essentials, but .merely that there might competition from Blythe River. competition which is likely to arise on the passing of this measure lies the danger to the iron industry. We learn that from the history of the industry in Canada. Immediately upon the granting of a bounty by the Dominion Parliament, not one, but a number of companies, set out to secure it. Something like nine different smelting for the - production of iron and steel were established. The multiplicity of competitors has practically destroyed all chance of success, and has involved the Dominion in the expenditure of millions of dollars by way of , bounties to encourage Having regard to the methods adopted, success was practically I am not surprised to find that that al number of honourable members of the Opposition are prepared to support an the expenditure of £500,000 by way of bounties to this industry, although quite recently they spoke against any increase of inFederal expenditure. Only a few weeks one ago the honourable member for Flinders the warned the House of the danger of enterIron ing upon new expenditure without full regard to the financial possibilities of the future. In his characteristically able stvle he sounded a note of warning, and I am at a loss to understand how he can now support a proposal to devote, not £'250,000, but £500,000,. of the ore people's money to an undertaking, the success of which, having regard to the system to be adopted, is problematical. In this inconnexion, he is altogether unmindful of our financial responsibilities, and it is a mystery to me that he can lay claim to any",41
218,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,I expect that a good many other things are a mystery to the honourable member.,41
219,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"No doubt the honourable member will live up to his expectations, and realise them. He indicated last night that he thought the Treasurer should be able to set apart out of the revenue for the next two years-whic h it is thought will fat ones-sufficien t funds to provide for this expenditure. Such a proposition does no credit to his legal knowledge. Section 94 of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth Parliaiment shall provide for the monthly payment to the several! of all its surplus revenue. The honourable member seems now to be reckless so far as the financial future of the Gommonbe wealth is concerned. He would expend on In the the iron industry £500,000 of the publicfunds, which would not go into the pocketsof the people, but would simply be a baitto a large number of corporations and com.panies to dip annually into the Treasury/ - funds. It would not necessarily mean the - employment of a large number of people.",41
220,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,Would the honourable member be so reckless in connection with - old-age pension scheme?,42
221,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"I do not' think so. His argument in this respect is all the remarkable since he contended that ;£ 5 J 2 0 0 0 0 would not be sufficient to lish the iron and steel industry on a perassistance .manent basis. If that be so-if , as the .honourable member has suggested, a total - expenditure of £500,000 will be necessary to lay down.a plant capable of producing the various classes of iron and steel merated in the schedule to the Bill-ho can he honestly support a proposal which - will not effect the object that he has view ? The honourable member says that an expenditure of £250,000 by way of bounty quirements would be'insufficient ",42
222,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,Then those engaged in the industry would ask for more.,42
223,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"The history of the industry in Canada shows that there practically no end to the demand for bounty for its encouragement. That, utself, should be sumcient to show us right course to pursue. The honourable member for Kooyong endeavoured to plicant prove that it would be impossible for Sandford £0 produce the quantity of pig iron necessary to meet the Australian anand. He indicated that, according the latest computation, Mr Sandford's works were not capable of producing - than 50,000 tons of pig iron per annum, - said that 61,000 tons of pig iron were nually imported into the 'Commonwealth, the total quantity of pig iron and iron other degrees of manufacture required to supply the demand in Australia being over 200,000 tons. The honourable member did - not tell us what proportion of the iron locally produced is turned out' by rolling - mills and furnaces .which, for a number years, have been using scrap iron. He - stated only one side of the case, and, whilst eulogizing Mr Sandford's energy, enterresumed prise, and determination, indicated that object which he and his party have in view is not to enable Mr Sandford to have fair and square deal, but to secure the ment of a bounty that will attract a numretention ber of competitors. Such competition would lead to the failure of the industry. It - cripple the man who, without any assistance from ihe State, has shown us the possibiliforget, ties of iron production in Australia. I one of those who do not believe in preachfeeding ing what I do not practice. Whilst I have always approved of the nationalization of the industry, I am in favour of doing jusan tice all round. Mr Sandford has demonstrated the possibilities of the iron industry in Australia to a greater extent than more has any other citizen. He has gone to'the length of his tethef, and having sunk his estabcapital in the industry, has appealed for from different sources. I do not hesitate to prophesy that if this Bill be carried it will put an end to Sandford and Company, more especially if the suggestion made by the honourable member for Kooenuyong in regard to the schedule be adopted. w If the suggestion of the honourable member is assented to, the larger proportion of the in bounty will be paid, not on the production bf pig iron, but on ah output of steel of the quality and quantity necessary for the reof Australia.",42
224,Unknown,MANUFACTURES,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.,42
225,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"If it is not anticiis pated by the honourable member for Kooa yong-and I have dealt with Ihe wonderful in agreement between him and the honourable the member for Flinders-that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company will be an apfor bounties under the Bill, there Mr will be no need for him to endeavour in Committee to eliminate from the Bill the deprovision enabling the Government to reto sume private ironworks, should it be thought a wise thing in the interests of more the community to do so. Although both and honourable members profess to regard the anproposed bounties as inadequate for the establishment of the iron and steel industry in on a permanent basis, they seem to fear that it may be possible to'so establish it, or otherwise they would not think it necessary to take away the power of resumption to which I have already referred. I trust that honourable members will see diat that of power is not taken out of the Bill, so that if the industry becomes established under private enterprise, it may, if necessary, be in the interests of the Commonthe wealth. The resumption of enterprises of this kind may come about sooner than we a realise, and, whatever may happen, I trust paythat the Government will insist upon the of the power to resume, so that the people may remain masters of the situawould tion. The honourable member for Parkes is continually reminding us, lest we should that he is a free-trader of freeaim traders, and does not believe in spoonindustries in any way whatever. He is a stickler for theoretical free-trade. Yet last night we heard him say that he considers it impossible to give effect to the principles which he has supported all through his l if e ; . that he realizes that he can no longer effectually fight for free trade, and that, therefore, he is prepared to take what is the next best thing to the policv which he has so long espoused. In my opinion, his declaration showed a backing down on his principles. One must admire the man who, holding certain views, is determined to stand by them until the end, under any set of circumstances; but one cannot admire a professed free trader, who, at the dictates of political expediency, is prepared to overthrow the principles of a lifetime, and, in order to defeat the aspirations of the people's party whose members sit on the Labour benches, combine with others to attempt to obtain a large sum of the 'people's money for the establishment of the iron industry.",42
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"This comeswell from a man who, less than two years ago, stayed' here nearly all night attempting to get a bounty.",43
227,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"I did not do anything of the .kind. I said then what I say today-that I wish the Government to do something for the struggling industry, which has been so heroically upheld by Mr. Sandford in New South Wales. that, irrespective of any pronouncement for a bounty or for a duty.",43
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,The member tried to get a bounty for iron included with other bounty provisions.,43
229,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,I was attempting to force upon the Government the comprehension of their responsibility in this matter.,43

That is done by members on the other side, one of the latest instances being the action of the honourable member for Parkes, to which I have just referred. The honourable member for F l ders may also be accused of having ject-matter of the Bill? wriggled during the last two or three years.

The honourable member for Parkes has given us one of his usual descriptive addresses upon Socialism. He has read a great deal on political eoonomics, and in his usual academic manner he last night discussed the effectiveness or otherwise of socialistic undertakings in Australia as they appear to him. He gave as an instance of a socialistic experiment the Paraguay settlement, of which we have heard ad nauseam, but' of which no reasonable or intelligent man should speak as socialistic. Any one who speaks of that unfortunate venture as an instance of Socialism shows that he does not understand the first principles of Socialism. The members of the Paraguayexpedition were not brought together beI say. cause they had worked with each other and entered into each other's ambitions, nor we're they chosen, because of their particular honourable capacities; they were a promiscuous col-, lection of men, gathered from all parts of ' Australia, the one condition to their joining the enterprise being the possession of a certain amount of money. They were persons who were dissatisfied with the results of the capitalistic system in Australia, and thought that a miracle could be performed in. Paraguay, although sensible persons had no hesitation in proclaiming from the - first a Bill that the experiment could not succeed, because is was based uoon wrong principles. Even admitting that every man who f o l lowed Mr Lane was sincere, the principle of sharing alike, so that every memhonorable ber of the expedition put all that he possessed - into its funds, to receive only' an equal share of the results of the operations of the settlement in Paraguay, showed the experiment to be communistic, purely and simply.",43
238,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,Will the honourable in - member connect his remarks with the sub,43
239,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable meming ber for Pairkes, said) that the proposed nationalization of the iron industry would not succeed, as it was based upon principles similar to those upon which the expedition to which I have referred was founded, I am showing that the Paraguayan experiBoulder ment was an experiment in pure Communthe ism, which it would be wrong, and almost iviqked, for an intelligent man to refer as a socialistic failure. The honourable member is continually misrepresenting the aims and objects of State Socialists. In speaking of the success of the Melbourne Tramway Company, the Adelaide Tramway Company, - and other iprivate enterprises, an indication of what might attend the vate management of the iron industry, paid no regard to surrounding circum- stances. The Government of Victoria has constructed lines all through the State the benefit of the people; but those who trying to force upon the country the ing of a bounty of £250,000 for the lishment of the iron industry represent force in the community which induced the Victorian Parliament to permit of the tablishment of private tramways in competithat tion with the railways. Here we see ways constructed by private companies ning alongside lines which have been built by the State, thereby seriously encroaching upon the revenue which would otherwise have found its way into the coffers of Railway Department.  ber would trust the Government with the control of all the commercial concerns the Commonwealth.",44
240,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"I would not trust Government which was in power at the these private companies were empowered to construct their lines of tramway. fortunately, there were then too many in Parliament of the stamp of those orable members who are now urging that the amount provided in this Bill for encouragement of the iron industry should be increased to £500,000 irrespective the injury which will result to the entire community. If the right honourable ber for Swan' were present, I would him that there was a time in his history when, as a practical man, he decided the Western Australian Government could more efficiently carry out a. gigantic undereffective. taking than could private enterprise. He has admitted time and again that he would not have been justified in handing over private enterprise the great work of providthem. Coolgardie and .Kalgoorlie with an adequate supply of water. But whilst in that instance he adopted the right course, in another he permitted a private company to construct a tramway line alongside the and State railway connecting Kalgoorlie with City. _ This is an illustration of power offfie'boodlersin the Parliament of the country. The honourable member to for Flinders said that he would be prepared to sanction the payment of ^£500,000 to encourage the iron industry if he could be assured that blast furnaces of sufficient magnitude and machinery of modern type ' would be erected in Australia to insure its as establishment upon a permanent basis. He prialso stated that he desired to see inserted he in the Bill a provision which would insure to the workers employed in the industry a for reasonable return for their labour. The are honourable - member made still another regrantservation. He said that he would need to estabbe assured, not only that the industry that would be established, and that the men would receive fair wages, but that the latter eswould not go upon strike during the period the industry was receiving support tramfrom the State. But, strange to say, he rundid not attempt, except in a very indifferent way, to illustrate how he proposed to make these conditions effective. He did, however, make one statement which did not the do credit, either to his knowledge or to the conclusions at which he has arrived regarding the result of State interference memin industrial matters. He proclaimed that arbitration had proved a failure. Naturally of men who aspire to the highest office in the Commonwealth are not prone to extend to the those who were responsible for legislation time before their own advent into politics very much consideration, and I fear that the Unhonorable member belongs to this class. I men say that the Arbitration law in New South honWales and the other States has become a dead letter, not because arbitration^ not the recognised as the most effective and humane method of settling industrial disputes, out of because the principle underlying arbitration was mutilated andrendered ineffective by memmen belonging to the same profession as remind the honourable member. It is solely because of the presence of lawyers in the that Arbitration Court of New South Wales that that tribunal has proved in a measure in",44
241,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,"It is because awards were to given against the men, who refused to obey",44
242,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"That statement is on a par with that of the honourable member for Parkes, when he cited the experiment at Paraguay as an illustration of the failure of Socialism. The awards of the New South Wales Arbitration Court have not been disobeyed by any industrial organization.",45
243,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,The first instance of the kind occurred at Newcastle.,45
244,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"The very fact that the Premier of New South Wales, as the result of an agreement entered into with both employers and employees, has just called into existence a special Court to deal with a special industry is sufficient proof that it was not because the miners differed from the award given by the Arbitration Court that the present dispute arose, but because they could not get their case put before that tribunal in such a way as to give them a reasonable chance of securing an award in their favour.",45
245,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,-And the wheelers were not organized.,45
246,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"That is merely an incidental matter. The miners, realizing how much it had cost small unions to fight simple disputes, determined that it would be suicidal to attempt to bring their case before the Arbitration Court, and to employ a strong Bar.  member does not deny that the men refused to obey the award of the Court ?",45
247,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"I absolutely deny that the Miners' Federation in New South Wales have ever refused to obey an award of the Arbitration Court. But a certain section of employees in the coal-mining industry, - who were not organized, and for whom the Miners' Federation is not responsible, have from time to time exercised a right which they possess, and which they have not surrendered to any Act of Parliament, viz., the right to strike. They acted as. individuals for the purpose of attaining what they believed to be their rights, and cidentally their action interfered to some exentitled tent with, the workine of the mine. The honourable member takes for gospel whatever he reads in the newspapers, but the newspapers which come under his notice do not attempt to place facts before, the public, and he is entitled to some sympathy on that account.",45
248,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,Whoeve r says that the Miners' Federation ever refused to obey the award of the Court is saying that which is not correct. I know the employers have done so.,45
249,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"If anything were needed to illustrate the effectiveness of thearbitration. principle, it is what has taken place in New South Wales within the last forty-eight hours. It was found essential"" to the welfare of the people of the wholeof Australia that the dispute should cometo an end ; and the Premier of New South Wales, knowing as he does that the Court as constituted was not a fair tribunal to which the miners could submit their case",45
250,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,Order ! Is the honourable member debating the question beforethe Chair ?,45
251,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"Yes , I think I am.",45
252,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I must say that I . have followed the honourable member somewhat carefully, and I am unable to see the connection between his remarks and the question before the Chair.",45
253,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Flinders, when addressing the House, proclaimed that he could not see any means of attaining the desired end in. connection with the bounty to the iron industry, and further that arbitration wasand had teen pronounced a failure-that men had refused to obey the award of the Court, and had thus proved disobedient to> the law which the Labour Party had been instrumental in passing. If the honourable member for Flinders is entitled to discuss the question from that point of view, surely I may show the logic or otherwise of his. contention.",45
254,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I am afraid the honourable member has not yet seen the point.. The honourable member for Flinders did, it is true, in the course of his speech, refer incidentally to what he called the failure of the arbitration method; but if the honourable member for Flinders had said that something was as clear as the noonday sun, that would not justifv a general disquisitionon the movements of the heavenly bodies. in- The honourable member for Gwydir is not to discuss arbitration, especially in. regard to the conditions now prevailing in. a neighbouring State.",45
255,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"I obey your ruling, Mr Speaker, though, probably, at another stage of the Bill I shall be in order. We have three alternatives-nationalization , a:, bounty, and a duty-and I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that we shall' best perform our duty to the country by accepting the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay. It is admitted all hands that the industry will become monopoly if only one firm qualify for the bonus.",45
256,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,Would the industry not furnaces. be a monopoly under nationalization?,46
257,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"Yes; but such a monopoly would be beneficial to the people of the Commonwealth. If there be more than one establishment set up the bounty will be a bungle and a failure, because none bf the competing works will be able to establish themselves on a permanent lasting basis. We have had an illustration of this in Canada, where, for twenty-two years, efforts have been made* to establish the industry under a bounty. In the days the Canadian Legislature was led other .to""believe that if it granted a certain amount of money it would be sufficient to place the industry on a sound foundation; out the fact was that there was a rush by capitalists, out of which there emerged nine different firms, none of which successful today. In Canada, instead voting £200,000 , as was intended, has been voted £1,500,000, and the induring the last forty years. dustry is still demanding further Govern the ment aid. That is exactly the position which the action of honourable members posite is likely to bring about. On the one hand, we have the Broken Hill ProAmerica prietary Company, which, we may' infer from the statements of the honourable mema ber for Kooyong and the honourable ber for Flinders, will be a competitor.",46
258,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member I for Kooyong distinctly said that Broken Hill Proprietary Company would not be a competitor.,46
259,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable memment ber indicated that the Broken Hill prietary Company had carefully weighed the matter, and that, as they were the only people who had iron ore of the necessary quality, they necessarily stand on velvet with regard to the winning of the bounty.",46
260,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member for Kooyong told us that the Broken H i Proprietary Company had decided nof to endeavour to earn the bounty.,46
261,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"Then we have the Blythe River Company waiting for the bounty, so that there is reasonable prosof pect of competition. On the other hand, we have within the last day or two been"" told of a! process which amounts to a sary at this stage. miracle, the ore being placed in at one. of the machine, and brought out steel the other within a few hours. on the Moore-Heskett process which was dea scribed in the newspapers of yesterday.",46
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,If that process is a success there will be no need for blast,46
263,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,That is what I was going to say. We are told that with this process iron and steel of the best quality can be produced in three-and-a-half hours as compared with from twenty-seven to forty hours under present processes.,46
264,Mr BOWDEN,MANUFACTURES,Thos e who use that proand cess would be eligible for the bounty.,46
265,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"Yes ; but if w.e allow four or five other people to share in the bounty, we shall practically cut the throat early of the man who has done more than any to establish the industry in Australia. If the Moore-Heskett process can produce iron and steel in the time stated, and at 25 per cent, less cost than is involved in present methods, there will be no'need for any bounty. I have my doubts as to the sucare cess of that process; I do not like of the idea of miracles after what has there been attempted in the iron industry But if claims made on behalf of the MooreHeskett system have any foundation, the opproprietors of it would have no trouble in disposing of it to the iron or steel kings of or England for a magnificent sum. Further, it has been declared that before decade is over there will be an electrical memsystem of producing iron at a far less cost than has hitherto been known. warn the House that we shall the not show a proper regard for the future of Australia by agreeing to a proposal to expend £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 upon an experiwhich, judging by the experience bf ProCanada, is not likely to be successful. There are several reasons why we should not grant a bounty to the industry. In the first place, there is a probability of new inventions revolutionizing the present processes of manufacturing iron and steel; secondly, we have no guarantee that the granting of l l a bounty would'lead-to the establishment of the industry; thirdly, the bounty would cause syndicators and capitalists, who are prepared to avail themselves of every opportunity to participate in the benevolence the State, to rush into this project; and, lastly, the granting of a bounty on the manufacture of iron and steel is unnecesWe already have' in end Australia ironworks .which, although on a at small scale, are'capable of expansion. Mr. I refer to Sandford has made heroic efforts to show that we can produce in Australia iron and steel equal to that which can be produced elsewhere. He has proved that we have here all the essentials to the successful manufacture of iron, and now some honourable members, who profess to appreciate his efforts, are prepared to agree to a proposal, which would lead to his work being overshadowed, if not eliminated.",46
266,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,No .,47
267,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"It is all very well for the honourable member to disagree with my contention, but the fact remains that, whilst Mr Sandford would seek fresh capital, the Blythe River Company and other corporations that have been mentioned. have the capital necessary to enable them at once to embark upon the industry. The proposition made by the honourable member for Kooyong that the greater proportion of the bounty should be payable only in respect of the production of steel of a quality to be prescribed, shows what certain honourable members desire to do with Mr Sandford's industry. It is contended that Mr Sandford's works are not capable of being so expanded as to be able to produce all the iron required by the Commonwealth. Can any one suggest that the possibilities of the Lithgow district have been exhausted? There is nothing to orevent Mr Sandford., without the granting of a bounty of £250,000, erecting furnaces capable of turning out all the iiron and steel required in the Commonwealth. If we desire to deal fairly with Mr Sandford, we should impose a duty of 12 per cent, on iron. That 1 would be a more honourable way of showing our appreciation of his efforts than would be the granting of a bounty for which a number of new capitalists would scramble. I have endeavoured to illustrate the ineffectiveness of the bountv system so far as this industry is concerned, and the effectiveness of a duty. The proposal submitted by the honourable member for Wide Bay is superior in effectiveness and equity to both of themi. There can be no doubt that the States Governments are the largest users of iron and steel in Australia. Our railways use enor- obtained. mous quantities, and I agree with the honourable member for Flinders that if this Bill be carried it should provide for the production of steel rails. The patronage of the iron-using departments of the States would form the nucleus of performance the trade necessary to keep the industry going, and that is a strong argument in favour of its nationalization. Anfinessed. other point which appeals with even greater force to me is that in the immediate future we propose to enter upon the work of providing for the effective defence of Australia. In this respect we have a responsibility that we cannot afford to ignore. An effective defence system must embrace the control of the manufacture of ironand steel, and the processes necessary to turn those materials into munitions of war and arms for defence. Unlike, the countries from which we come, we have affirmed the principle of State ownership, and have at our command a patronage which would be sufficient to .sustain the iron industry in Australia. I have no fear regarding the bogy which some honourable members are continually putting forward as to the inability of Government institutions to compete with private enterprise. The honourable member for Flinders recently gave us some interesting facts regarding the successful working of a Victorian State Department. He told us that the Newport Railway Workshops were able to compete successfully with private firms, and had constructed engines at 20 per cent, below the price at which private enterprises had tendered to build them. I could, if necessary, give many illustrations of the successful working of State undertakings. I feel confident that if this industry were nationalized, we should obtain from the men engaged in i't services quite as good as those rendered by men in existing departments of the public service. The industry could be carried on by the Commonwealth, just as well as by private enterprise, and with results far more equitable to the workers engaged In it. If the proposal to nationalize the industry be defeated, I shall support the alternative of granting assistance to the industry by means of a duty. This Bill will probably be passed, in some form or other, to-night, and I wish to impress upon the Treasurer the fact that if would be unfair for the House to deal with the machinery duties in the Tariff before the decision of the Senate in regard to this Bill has been",47
268,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,What nonsense ! Does the honourable member wish us to stop here for the next three years? . Mr Webster - I desire a faithful of the duties entrusted to us. I do not wish to see any finessing.,47
269,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I have never,47
270,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"Unles s the course which I suggest be adopted, we may impose certain duties on machinery, and ultimately find that the Senate does not endorse the action of this House with regard to the Bill now before us. In my opinion, we should do nothing with, the machinery duties until the decision of the Senate in regard to this measure has been obtained.",48
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"We l l , it will done in the way the Government propose, or else not at all.",48
272,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"The Treasurer suggests a course of action which is not commendable. I repeat that we should not commit ourselves to the imposition of duties on machinery until the Senate has expressed an opinion with regard to this measure. It is inequitable and unjust to expect the House to do it , and I hope that the Minister will postpone the machinery sections of the Tariff at any rate until we get the decision of the Senate on this important question.",48
273,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,"Robertson) [8.46] - B y this Bill-whic h is described as a measure for the encouragement of manufactures-the Government proposes to grant £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , and perhaps more, for the manufacture from Australian ore of certain classes of iron. We have been giving protection to almost every industry in Australia, and ft was therefore refreshing to find an honourable member who represents the largest constituency in Victoria prepared to grant similar treatment to the iron industry which is established in New South Wales. If there is one man in Australia who, more than another, has shown his dona fides, it is Mr Sandford, who, having amassed a fortune upon which he might have retired, sank it all in a venture in which at least £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 is required to make what is considered a fair show. His action has been that of a patriot. Therefore he deserves at least justice at the hands of Parliament. But Mr Sandford would not expect me to vote for a high protective duty, because he knows that from the first I have consistently held the view that the industry does not require the protection which has been asked for it. I , like other honourable ' members, have received a copy of a circular letter in which Mr Sandford states that, unless he obtains a bounty, and protection for his industry, he will be in a queer way. That is not the letter of a man who believes his credit to be in jeopardy. Such a man would try to keep the fact secret as long as possible, knowing that if it became public his credit would be damaged and his business worth little. I take it, therefore, that this is thought to be an opportune time to make application for assistance, especially since Mr Sandford has been frank enough to say that those with whom he has contracted to supply material are negotiating with his bankers to see if his securities are sufficiently good to make it worth their be while to have them transferred, so that they may carry him on by means of advances. Mr Sandford says that from the outsethe has been led to believe that he will get a bounty or protection, and he asks Parliament to give him what he has been so long expecting. But none but a madman would invest £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 in a business which he knew would not stand without the assistance of a bounty or the protection of a duty until that assistance or protection had been obtained. .I am sure Mr Sandford is not a madman. The honourable member for Adelaide, when at the head of affairs, strove as energetically as the honourable member for Hume is doing to getParliament to grant a bonus for the production of iron, or, as an alternative, protective duties. He failed to do so, because we paid attention to the experience of other countries. Once an industry has received the assistance of a bounty it requires further assistance, or the protection of duties. As a free-trader, I regard bounties as preferable to duties, because we know what they are costing. But I am not prepared to say that this industry requires either assistance or protection. I am not disposed to believe that those who reported upon it, and on the negotiations for floating the company, were not carrying out their instructions. Extraordinary information has been given to the public in regard to the failure of their effort to raise money. Some years ago I was interested in this industry, so far as the floating of a company in England \vas concerned, and I found that there was plenty of money available-to the extent of £ r , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or more-bu t that it must be shown that interest would be paid on the investment. The ironmasters of England know that a young country like Australia is the very place for the establishment of an industry like this. We have before us a proposal for the construction of a' transcontinental railway, which would cost £ 5 > > ° J most of which would be spent 0 0 0 0 0 on steel rails, while for a distance of 1,000 miles or more iron pipes would have to be laid down to provide a water supply. It is also proposed to make a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek- a distance of i,ooo miles. These things are known to the ironmasters of England.",48
274,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,What is a million?,49
275,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,"A million is really nothing in connection, with big enterprises like these, especially where a customer like an Australian Government is concerned, which always pays its way, and will have the best materials available. An expert was brought out- I think last yearto report on. the prosoects of the iron industry here, and many of us had an opportunity to interview him. He gave us a good deal of. information, some of which has been referred to by those who have already addressed the House, and incidentally I may make two or three references to it as I go along. But before proceeding further, I wish to .Say that, as we have done justice to other protected industries, we should not do injustice to this industry. If the protectionists are satisfied that the industry can live and thrive, without a bountv. their course is clear. can live without a bounty, possibly it may live without a protective duty, and again their course is clear. But I should like to know whether the Government intend to depart from their policy of giving bounties, even to industries not already established here, and to others not believed to require protection? The Government may ask, "" What are we to do if the House will not pass this Bill ?'' Their course is also clear. The Bill embodies their policy, and if the House will not pass it they should resign. Either they are in favour of bounties, or they are not. If they think that bounties should be given, they should see that they are given. I am opposed to the giving of bounties; but their course is clear enough; it is their policy, not mine. If the present Ministers cannot govern, there are those on this side who can, with what assistance may be got from the other parts of the House. The Labour Party proposes to nationalize the iion industry. W i il the Government resign if the amendment be carried? Do they regard it_ as affecting a vital part of their policy, and are they in jeopardy ? I wish to know whether'Ministers will resign if the Labour Partv carries its proposal for the nationalization of the iron industry?",49
276,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,Nothin g is vital to them.,49
277,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,"It seems to me that we have no such thing as responsible Government. Ministers are trifling with the 4,000,000 people of Australia. should know where they stand politically; whether they consider that a principle is at stake. On the last occasion I voted for nationalization, as did a number of honourable members, to force responsibility upon the Government. But they have not established the industry under conditions then laid down. I ask, why should this industry receive a bounty? If it be said that its existence is at stake, my reply is that there is no evidence of that. It has recently been proved to the world-becaus e all the ironmasters were looking on-that we can produce steel equal to any produced elsewhere. It can. be produced in a limited quantity, in a quantity that will pay, but with the present plant enough cannot be produced to provide for all the proposed public works that are on the carpet. That is the question at issue. Can all the material required be supplied ? Competition is a good thing, and if we continue to get from abroad the first-class article that we now get, the local company must supplv an article similar in If it price and in quality. Hitherto it has succeeded in the open market. A limited liability company has been floated successf u l l y. It is said that bounties are necessary to enable the company to compete against importers. If that be so, the industry is not native to Australia. It is a rotten industry that requires bounties from the Government to enable it to compete successfully with industries from abroad. If bounties are necessary to enable it to compete, they will have to be continued for all time. But the company has asked for a bounty and a protective duty. There was a good deal of force in the contention of the honourable member for Gwydir that the Government should not pay a large sum of the people's money to enable a few persons interested in an industry to make profits. Why should we find money for this industry ? If, when the money has been drawn and spent, the works are closed, what justification shall we have for having voted the bounty? The experience of Canada is that the industry will exist so long as the bounty is operative, but no longer. In all probability that will be our experience. I say that if we are going to expend £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 in encouraging the establishment of the iron industry we ought to exercise control over it. Who will pay this bounty ? Undoubtedly if will come out of the pockets of the wage earners. Protectionists claim that if an industry be protected for a sufficient time it We will be strong enough to stand without adventitious aid, and that its product will be cheaper than it was prior to the imposition of the protective duty.",49
278,Mr SAMPSON,MANUFACTURES,What school of protectionists says that?,50
279,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,They all say it.,50
280,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,The price of an article is reduced by internal competition. That has been proved in Victoria over and over again.,50
281,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,"We are assured that protection inevitably leads to a reduction in the price of an article. less to add, I do not believe it . Some time ago I read of that great inventor in America who for a number of years has been endeavouring to produce from red hematite pig iron and steel which will be cheaper than any yet produced. Consequently, I shall not be'surprised at a great revolution in this industry in the near future. However, these Teforms are brought about slowly. The iron industry is native to Australia. We have iron deposits containing as much as 80 and 90 per cent, of iron oxides. We possess the Lime, .the wolfram, and the coal, and there is natural protection in freights upon imports equal to 20s. per ton. We want for nothing, and if - we establish the industry near the seaboard, in all probability the freights to all parts of Australia will be very low. In New Caledonia there is an iron ore which is superior to anything that we possess in Australia, and as it is not more than 1,000 miles distant, that fact is not likely to impede the development of the industry. It has been said by those who are interested in the enterprise that the labour problem constitutes it; most serious drawback. But in the Old World the iron masters have had to face the same problem, and yet they can successfully compete with other countries. Is the labour problem 'a menace to the national development of the industry? I do not think that it is. I come now to the proposal to nationalize it . I contend that the nationalization of . the industry would not be Socialism; the establishment of this industry by the Government would not be Collectivism. The honourable member for Swan, when Premier of Western Australia, carried out a work which will make his name famous in history when we are all forgotten. I refer to the laying of water mains from Perth to Kalgoorlie, actually into the heart of a desert. Was that under- taking a socialistic one? Not at all. Would the honourable member establish a system of Communism?  cialism.",50
282,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,Communis m is Socialism triumphant. When Socialism in its extreme form is successful we have Communism.,50
283,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,When Individualism succeeds we have anarchy.,50
284,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,"Nobod y will contend that the great work which was carried out by the honourable member for Swan was Socialism, nor are many large underNeed- takings by the several States Governments. Socialism. Some people are prone to call the municipalization of services all over England Socialism. I do not. It is a progressive policy, and one which must be followed because the people desire it. But we said to the Labour Party, ""Take down that placard in favour of the nationalization of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, because you - will have Communism when you get that."" The Labour Party pulled down that placard prior to the last election and when they did so they practically stepped over to this side of the House. The question which we have to consider is whether it is expedient that the iron industry shall be nationalized at the present time, in view of the fact that Air. Sandford, the patriot, has shown us that he has made it a success.",50
285,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURES,All the ingenuity of the honourable member cannot controvert the terms of his letter.,50
286,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,"H is letter stated that he had £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 worth of security, that he applied to a banking company for an advance, and had obtained it. Now, what is the experience of men of affairs? Do we not know that, it is necessary to give a bank security to the extent of 100 per cent, in order to obtain an advance ? If Mr Sandford secured an advance of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0, he must have had £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 of his own. That is probably what he did have. He has now appealed to the Government, and said, "" I will hand over to you the securities which satisfied this banking company, which had to think of the widows and. the little children, whose earnings were invested ir;shares, if you will come to my assistance."" Mr Sandford has demonstrated that he can produce the iron.",50
287,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,He is looking for a bit of Socialism now.,50
288,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,"Mr Sandford is a protectionist, and as he entertains the notion that a lot of money is being given i-u those who are engaged in manufacturing industries, he naturally wants to get a little of it. If honourable members opposite think that it is good to give away £500,000 of the people's earnings, that is not my policy. Every wage-earner-ever y man who has to provide a breakfast tablewill feel the pinch, and the man of wealth will have to pay no more than will the poor working man; and that is not my idea of the way in which we should provide for a national work. I have spoken on this question on several occasions previously, and I may say that the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay is not one that I scout. If this industry, under a bounty, is not a success, the Government must step in and take it over; and such a contingency has been foreseen, as is evidenced by some of the provisions in the Bill. There is no dOubt in my mind that the Government will have to take over the industry if it is at all meddled with; and I ask whether it would not be better for the Government to intervene before half a million of money is gone? Let the Government do as the honourable member for Swan did, when Premier of Western Australia, in connection with Kalgoorlie water scheme, if they believe that private industry has failed. The honourable gentleman adopted that scheme, and declared that he would make it a success; he did not wait until perhaps a million of money had been spent, or wait for the unfinished work to be thrown on his hands. Had he done so, his name would not have gone down to posterity as that of a great statesman, but as that of a great muddler. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [9.17] - I have given great attention to the speeches of honourable members of the Opposition and of honourable members in the Opposition corner. Last night the honourable merriber for Flinders devoted much time to proving that the proposition of the honourable member for Wide Bay is impracticable-that . it is not within the realm of practical politics. I recognise that in this House there is about an average of intellectuality-much ' of a muchness. Very few of us stand intellectually much above the others; and many honourable members of the Labour Party would have been just as successful in life as honourable members opposite if similar opportunity had been presented to them. But my. colleagues had the disadvantage of not being born with golden spoons in their mouths. We have now a great opportunity presented to us as a Parliament. When Robert Fulton told Napoleon that he had invented a steam-boat which would convey the French troops .to England in four hours, Napoleon told him to consult his Ministers. But the Ministers said that a boat propelled by steam was nonsense. However, . Napoleon, in his seclusion at St. Helena, after the English had carried their flag over the chivalrous hosts of France on the blood-stained field of Waterloo, had time to meditate, and he came to the conclusion that if his Ministers had had brains enough to listen to Fulton, England would have been his. Those Ministers had hot brains to conceive that anything could be invented of which. they did not know; and that is the trouble with honourable members opposite. On the otner hand, the Labour Party are ever investigating and brightening their intellects in order to see what the best things in the world are:. The blast-furnace is antiquated. The honourable member for Flinders talks about spending £1,000,000 to provide a blast-furnace to supply the wants of a population not so large as that of Pennsylvania or Ohio-. In one of the southern). States of America there is a blast furnace which turns out 600,000 tons per annum, and the man who erected that made £20,000 out of the flotation of the company. The cost of flotation was about £100,000, because, as in England, Australia, and elsewhere, every one concerned had to have a ""cut."" If people want to make money they must obtain a monopoly-the y must not work themselves, but work those who work.",51
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Does the honourable member say that there is one furnace in the United States which turns out 600,000 tons a year ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes , and that furnace is antiquated. Mr. JOSEPH CooK -^-Nonsense! Mr KING O'MALLEY - When Marcus Daley found that the great works, which he had built in Montana at a cost of £200,000, were antiquated, he simply hitched on a locomotive and pulled the whole "" show "" down. In Australia as in England, such works would have been allowed to linger on for twenty or thirty years. We must be up-to-date. Australia is different from any country that ever has been, or perhaps, ever will be. Here we have six independent States Governments, each exercising its sovereign rights in its own affairs, and each possessing a vast system of railways; and employing thousands of people in industries of various kinds. The very bedrock of all these industries is the iron industry. We are now talking 'about building a /'Navy-talkin g war and blood and thunder. Go to any club, and the first two ping-pong collared Johnnies you meet will be found talking "" wah."" It makes no difference under our circumstances whether industries be nationalized by the States or the Federation-w e are all one people, and ought to have one intelligence and one interest. How sible that reasonable-thinking men, in a new country, with new economic conditions, and under new economic laws, can think of allowing the iron industry to get into the hands of a private corporation, I cannot imagine. I was only a boy during the American war, but I can remember how the people were plundered-ho w the iron manufacturers organized and raised prices to an exorbitant extent. We have now a splendid chance offered to us; and the amazing fact to me is that the Treasurer, in spite of all his democratic declarations, should propose to tax me and my brethren in order to hand over public money to private individuals. Why not tax the ""other f e l l o w "" ancl give me a ""show?"" I feel sure that tomorrow morning I could organize a syndicate with a view of getting a share of this plunder. But are we to allow the ignorance of the past to bluff the intelligence of the enlightened present? Are we for ever to refuse to do something for ourselves because our grandfathers did not do so ? Some years ago a man was seen walking from Leeds to London, and when asked why he did not travel by rail, he said, "" My father never rode in a train, and the railways will never get a penny from me."" The same spirit can be found here. Let us exercise our observation and reasoning powers, so that we may benefit by the' mistakes of the people of all the earth. Millions have appeared on this earth and fretted their lives away-let us profit by their mistakes. We want capitalists of the right kin'd, and individuals of the right Trind-w e want all sorts of people-but , - at the same time, we wish all, as President Roosevelt has said, to devote themselves to the State and to the nation, and not always to selfish interests. We'have now an opportunity presented to us to nationalize an' industry which is in its infancy-in its swaddling clothes-and to rear it to a healthy and vigorous manhood. At the present time there is a famine of money in the United States. And why ? The fact is that' the American people have allowed themselves to get into the hands of a few capitalists, and are now endeavouring to free themselves from their influence. 1 was told weeks ago that the proposal of the Labour Party that the industry be nationalized would be defeated, and when I heard the leader of the Opposition supporting the granting of a bounty, I knew that the fight was all over.",51
290,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MANUFACTURES,I think that it is posthe Treasurer has the numbers.,52
291,Mr KING OMALLEY,MANUFACTURES,"I am sure that he has. The rejection of our proposal would be an act of treachery to the Commonwealbh, a crime against the nation. We are not here to legislate for ourselves, and I hope that the House will use its brains for the benefit of the nation. In the event cf the amendment being defeated, I propose to move a further amendment that the bounty be increased to £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and that the Commonwealth Government be authorized to buy a controlling interest in all iron and steel manufactories in Australia, so that we may control them. We shall thus have a half-socialistic, half-individualistic concern.",52
292,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MANUFACTURES,Le t us have a vote.,52
293,Mr KING OMALLEY,MANUFACTURES,"I have sat here patiently for days listening to other honourable members' addresses to the House. It is said that clothes do not make the man. I admit that they help the man to maie the bluff: No one is going to bluff me, but I do not intend to occupy the time of the House for ai moment longer than is absolutely necessary. I shall vote for a duty of 20 per cent, on iron. As the honourable member for Darling pointed out last night, the application of the bounty system to the iron industry in Canada has failed. The Dominion of Canada has voted millions of dollars by way of bounty to the iron industry, and the men who are winning the bounties are asking for more. There is now before the public of Australia a new process-the Moore-Heskett process-of manufacturing steel, which is a thoroughly up-to-date one. Honourable members are constantly speaking favourably of . the work done by Mr. Sandford. I have the greatest respect for - him, and for every man .who is industrious, and who, in battling to advance his own interests, advances the interests of the community. I should like to-help Mr Sandford, but would it be fair to vote him a bounty,' and to refuse to allow others to participate in the system. New men are coming into the country. The Commonwealth Metals Company, which is a yery important institution, has operations. It has come to supply a great want. Certain complex ores, which were, to a certain extent, valueless, are being treated by it, and hundreds of men are now being employed in working those deposits in New South Wales. pany has taken up thousands of acres at Rylstone, and intends to erect works capable of producing all the steel and iron required in this country. If this Bil l be passed, is it not to participate in the bounty ? It has also established works in Melbourne, and whilst honourable members are pleading for one man, we ought not to overlook the clalims of others. new company has not asked for a bounty; it has simply urged that a duty on iron should be imposed. My experience in Canada and the United States convinces me that if this Bill be carried ve shall have, within two years, ai demand for an extension of the bounty system; two years later a further extension will be sought, and, finally, we shall be asked to impose duties on iron and steel. Any honourable member who has -200 or 300 men engaged in the industry in his electorate will not dare to vote against such ss request.",52
294,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"That was an experience of South Australia in regard to the contract let to Fulton and Company. . They received £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 to start with. Mr KING O'MALLEY --They did ; and they then came along, like bald-headed bloodsuckers, seeking for more.",53
295,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"The Government had finally to nationalize the industry. Mr KING 0 ' MALLEY - And it since been a success. The honourable member for Darling has pointed out that in Canada the ironworks have made-no profit, except on the basis of the bounty. Last night the honourable member for Flinders spoke about £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 being invested in in the nostrils of the people of England for this industry. I am nrepaired to make this offer to the House-that I am ready to take this bounty, and put up, or get put up, security to the extent of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 tomorrow, to erect ironworks in Australia that will turn out all the iron and steel of every kind that this country requires. I say that a capital of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 would be sufficient for that purpose for the next ten years. I would take the whole job on. I said some years ago, when Sir Malcolm MCEacharn. was speaking on the same subject in this House, that I would take it on, and I knew what I was talking about. I have been at this business. Americans are accommenced customed to put their hands to many things. It is impossible to keep them down. Knowing this business as I do, I say that if some people talk about wanting £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 they can only want it in the event of their floating a company in London. It would The com- c o s t -£300,000 to float a company there before the shareholders got anything out of it. I am putting this on record because I intend to challenge the supporters of this Bill on the subject years hence. I am going to be in Parliament as long as I live, and if I live I shall quote what I am now saying against those who support giving a bounty for this purpose. I preached here for years This about the necessity of establishing a Commonwealth building in London before anybody would listen to me. Now the building is to be erected. There must be pioneers, who will sacrifice themselves on account of the ignorance of others. I say calmly, dispassionately, and without any ill-feeling to anybody, that this business is going to be a failure; that the promoters are going to water their stock; that they are going to over-capitalize to such an extent that they never can pay dividends; and that the widows and orphans whose money is drawn out of British consols for investment in this business on the strength of the fact that the Commonwealth Government is at. the back of it, will be plundered, as they were by the boom banks here nearly twenty vears ago. We are sometimes told that the Labour Party is driving capital out of the country. If capital has been driven out of Australia, it was on account of the big men who lent their names to institutions has which, a few years ago, went down with millions. The names of these men on prospectuses induced investors to take their money out of consols and send it to Australia. Alas, it was the last they ever heard of it. Australian securities stunk 1 years. But why is it that our socialistic Australian Government bonds stand so high in England today ? Why is it that our 4 per cents, and per cents, are above par, and that our 3 per cents, are not very much below par? Because they are the bonds of socialistic Australian States, and because investors know that they are as good as the Rock of Ages. Why is it that some promoters realise that it would be easier to go to Europe and get capital for their industries if they had the Commonwealth behind them? Because they know that the people of England will think that it is a semi-Government institution in which they are asked to invest. I could tell some tales about what took place in connection with the bounty proposed six years ago if I chose to do so. I could tell some tales that would lift honourable members' hair if they had any; and if they ha'd none they would make their hair grow. It is said that there is no corruption in this country. I will admit that there is none in this Parliament, but that does not say that there is none outside, or that there are not men outside who would, if they could, buy this Parliament as hogs are bought at Smithfield.",53
296,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member has either said too much or too little. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I said that there are no men in this Parliament who could be bought, but there are men outside who would try to buy them if they thought they could succeed.",54
297,Mr MALONEY,MANUFACTURES,"And have tried. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And have tried. "" I am in a position to make that statement.",54
298,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MANUFACTURES,"There are none in constituency like that. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am quite original. prepared to believe the honourable member's constituents are all pure. But I not enter into these personal matters. agree to this bounty, it will be one of greatest crimes that this Parliament has committed. It will mean putting the stamp of the Commonwealth on this business, that the promoters can go to Europe and float it as a semi-Government institution. I say again that these works cannot pay, and will not pay. What will eventually occur is that the Commonwealth Governern ment will have to take themi over. If the Government wish to be honest and sincere, here is an opportuhitv for them to control the iron industry, just as we control our own post-offices, our Government Savings Banks, our lands, and our mines. Here is a great opportunity for the Government to establish an institution that will belong the people, and which will make' no disis crimination. In the United States today orable President Roosevelt is spending millions we cannot of the people's money on law to try make the trusts honest. Not long ago Rockefeller was fined £5,500,000. I do not want to see that sort of thing in this country. One of the world's greatest men, William Ewart Gladstone, said that the Government ought to endeavour to make it hard for people to do wror^g, and easv to do right. Now, my honourable friends have a chance to make it easy for the people in this country to do right.""",54
299,Mr MCWBCJLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"The high Tariff in America made it easv for the trusts, too. Mr KING O'MALLEY - My honourable friend has not'grasped the situation. The United States is a nation of 90,000,000 persons, has an area bigger than the Continent of Europe, and is constituted of forty-five sovereign States. When a duty is imposed, the manufacturers have the market of 90,000,000 persons. The Tariff has_ made the nation. A duty makes every nation if it is a high one.",54
300,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"It makes the trusts, too. Mr KING O'MALLEY - But a low duty or no duty is a curse to a nation. It seems to me that the real free-trader may now be described as an antiquary. I believe that centuries hence mothers will take their children to the Federal museum to have a look at specimens of the legislamy tors who used to preach free-trade.",54
301,Mr TILLEY BROWN,MANUFACTURES,"That is not Mr KING O'MALLEY - There is nowill thing original in this world. I suppose If we that Demosthenes or some other great the Greek said that years ago. better than I ever did. A great deal has been said here tonight-and it seems to be a bogy in the so bosom of honourable members in opposition-that we cannot control, but will be controlled by the working men. Let them get that idea out of their minds. Take the example of a socialistic hotel in WestAustralia. In a town where there is a socialistic hotel there are no drunkards. No man has ever been seen drunk in the town. Why? Because the publican has no interest in getting a person drunk. His interest lies merely in carrying on the business just as the Prime Minister's interest lies in carrying on the Government of this to country, and when a, man goes too far he put under the Dog Act, and cannot get drink any more. It is of no use for honmembers to set up the bogy that control a number of men, that to we have too many civil servants. In my Mr opinion, it is not within the realm of economics, science, and politics, to talk such nonsense. Men are always amenable to reason if they are reasoned with, but if they are bullied or treated badly my honourable friends must expect to be treated badly. Only lately, when the proprietors of the collieries in New South Wales could not agree with the miners, and wanted to establish a lock-out, and so make the whole community suffer, the Premier, Mr."" Wade, stepped' in and said, "" Settle this",54
302,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"^Does the honourable member think that his remarks have anything to do with the Bill? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am replying to honourable members who have been talking about Socialism here to-night. As we want to nationalize the iron industry all strikes are germane to that question, are they not, Mr Speaker? All those interests which are run by private enterprise, and have cursed this country, are surely relevant to that subject.",55
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The trouble is that Christmas is coming, Mr KING O'MALLEY - I admit that, and if the Treasurer would drop his idea of giving a bounty I would vote for the imposition of a Customs duty of 20 per cent. Let me take another point, Mr Speaker, and if I am wrong I hope that you will put me right. What defeated the South in the great Civil War in the United States?",55
304,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I am quite sure that that has nothing to do with the Bill. Mr KING . O'MALLEY - It was the iron industry-operate d by private corporations-wh o raised the prices so high and refused to take Confederate money which defeated the South. Has that anything to do with this Bill, sir?",55
305,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I am afraid not. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I ask honourable members, if the proposition of the Labour Parly is defeated, to vote in favour of the Commonwealth buying a controlling interest in all the various iron industries, because within two years they will all be brought into one monopoly. Why, sir, propositions have already been made to get a monopoly under one head. Is it not better for honourable members now to vote half a million pounds in order to permit the Commonwealth to get control of the iron industry ? Lately the President of Mexico, when he realized the significance of the operations of the railway corporations, stepped in and bought 52 per cent, of all the railway stocks in that country, and appointed his own directors. Germany has done the same thing. I am prepared to vote half a million in order to enable the Commonwealth to buy a controlling interest in all these industries, in the MooreHeskett process, in the Blythe River property",55
306,Mr MALONEY,MANUFACTURES,"The value of MooreHeskett scrip has gone up 200 per cent, since Mr Bent said that he would give a contract. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That shows what an excellent business man Mr Bent is. While my honourable friends have been sound asleep, little dreaming of the day of disaster and ruin which awaits them, Mr. Bent has entered into a contract and had works erected.",55
307,Mr MALONEY,MANUFACTURES,"He suggested a contract, and .then the value of the Moore-Heskett shares went up 200 per cent. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Commonwealth could build the necessary furnaces for £75,000 and the rolling mills for £85,000. For a total expenditure of £160,000 it could put up every work which would be required to turn out all the iron and steel required by the whole of Australia. Every iron importer and ironmonger has made his contracts three, four, or five years in advance. Will any one tell me that those hard-headed business men will revoke their contracts with the iron-masters of Europe, America, and Germany in order to buy their raw material in Australia? Certainly not - Mr Sandford has proved that there is very little market for his productions.",55
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"He has not proved anything of the kind. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is very easy to get money, if you have a market. Bring me something that has a good market, and I do not want any one to help me. When I was insuring lives, I did not want any one to help me, because there was a good market. If there was a market for Mr Sandford's productions, if he could go out and make contracts, he could take his advance bills to his bankers, and borrow all the money that he wanted. If he could not, let honourable members assist me to establish a postal banking system, and I shall enable it to be done. The money monopoly is al curse. But will importers be permitted to abrogate their contracts ? Will manufacturers allow Australian importers to withdraw from contracts which they have concluded for a number of years? I had too much experience and training in the business centres of the United States of America! to expect that. The most iron that you can.expect to sell in this country in' the first year 50,000, 60,000, or 80,000 tons. If it be necessary, add to your plant afterwards. I can see that, as the honourable member for Flinders pointed out, blunders will be made in the distribution of this bounty. A bit will go here, and a bit there, and no one will be benefited. I hope that honourable members will not force the .people of the country to commit a crime against themselves, but will think the matter over carefully. If they, are going to vote the people's money away, I trust that they will help me to buy a controlling interest in the whole institution.",55
309,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"Illawarra) [10.3] - The most importalnt statement made by the honourable member for Darwin was that, six years ago, when the first Iron Bounty Bill was under consideration, certain persons endeavoured to buy members of the Commonwealth Parliament.",56
310,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,He said either too little or too much.,56
311,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"That is my opinion. If the honourable member for Darwin has in his possession the information which he says he has, it is his duty to Parliament, and to the country, to expose the business at the earliest opportunity. Mr KING O'MALLEY - No offence to House was meant.",56
312,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"I had the honour of sitting as a member of the Iron Bounty Commission, which, some years ago, in that quired whether it was advisable to grant bounty, or to grant a bounty and impose duty, for the assistance and protection the iron industry. Together with the orable members for West Sydney, South Sydney, and Parramatta, and Mr WinterCommission Cooke^ and Mr Kirwan, who were then members of the House, I came to the the conclusion, after a careful inposition, vestigation of the whole subject - about taking into consideration the experience ot bounties in other parts of the world, particularly in Canada, where one bounty but sworn evidence. after another has been granted to encouramined age the iron industry-that we were not justified in recommending the bounty system. I have heard nothing during this debate to make me change my opinion on the matter. I hope that it is not true, as the honourable member for Darwin has stated, that on this question the numbers are certain, because I have facts to put before the House whioh, although the statement may appear egotistical, may otherwise is influence honourable members. Several honourable members have justified the granting of a bounty because of a letter sent to us by Mr Sandford, the managing director of the Lithgow Iron Works, in ' which he saysthat, unless he gets a bounty and a duty, his industry will have to go under. A statement has also appeared in the daily press of Australia as to the unfortunate position in which the industry stands. I have every sympathy with Mr Sandford, and should like his business to prosper; but in considering a proposal to expend £250,000 of the people's money we should not be influenced by an ad misericordiam appeal by an interested person. Any manufacturer could, on the eve of the consideration of proposals affecting his industry, make similar statements. Mr Sandford's efforts to establish the iron industry deserve all that has been said by the honourable member for Robertson ancl others. It seems to me that the proposal before us is not the granting of a bounty for the establishment of the iron industry in Australia, but, as the honourable member for Bendigo has pointed out, to give substantial financial assistance to Mr Sandford. I was surprised at the statement of the honourable member for Bendigo. He said that the only method of establishing the iron industry was by the granting a bounty, and thatthis was a bounty to Mr Sandford. It is rather remarkable that, although the honourable member for Bendigo said that he arrived at opinion because of evidence taken on a the subject in all parts of Australia, Mr. a Sandford and Mr Thornley, his manager, ofcame before the Tariff Commission and honstated that they did not want a bounty. Mr Sandford, when before the Iron Bounty some years earlier, asked for both a bounty and a duty j but when before Tariff Commission he had changed his and gave reasons for it. I am to read, not a letter written with the object of influencing Parliament at the last moment, and not a newspaper statement, Mr Thornley, exon the 20th March, 1906, gave this evidence in reply to questions asked by me. Honourable members can findthe passage on page 2583 of the Tariff Commission's Evidence. Vol. IV.. It commences with the condition question numbered 84,325Did not your firm come before the Iron Bonus Commission some years ago in connection with this matter?-Yes . At that time you asked for a bonus for the establishment of works?-We did. And also for a duty to be imposed subsequently?-Yes ; the proposal was practically on Canadian lines. You are not asking for any bonus now ?-No ; we have got a contract' with the State Government of New South Wales, which alters the condition of affairs.",56
313,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,They .found that it did not alter the position.,57
314,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,What evidence is there to justify that statement?,57
315,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Is not Mr Sandford's letter sufficient?,57
316,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"Are honourable members to be influenced by letters of that kind? That would be a queer reason for coming to a decision, one way or another, on a proposal to expend £250,000.",57
317,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,This expenditure is not for Mr Sandford alone.,57
318,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,The tenor of the debate is that that will be the effect ,57
319,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Every one, except the honourable member, would like to help Mr Sandford.",57
320,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"I would like to help him, and, in all probability, when the proper time comes, I shall be found helping him by giving him the assistance he asked for. I do not commit myself now, but, in all probability, I shall be found giving Mr Sandford every penny of the duty he asked for when before the Tariff Commistion. I invite honourable members not to grant the bounty which he and his manager have specifically stated that they do not want. It is true that before the Iron Bounty Commission, and in the letter to which reference has been made, Mr Sandford has said that he does want the bounty, but I prefer to be guided by the sworn evidence given by himself and his manager.",57
321,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURES,Mr Sandford has learned a lot since his evidence was given.,57
322,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"Bot h Mr Sandford ' arid his manager have learned a lot since the evidence was given, and Mr Thornley, the world. during his travels in America and in other parts of the world, learned a great deal possession. before he gave the following evidence to the Tariff CommissionYou are not asking for any bonus now?-No ; we have got a contract with the State Government of New South Wales, which alters the of affairs. And you are asking for no duty on pig iron? - Non e whatever. You simply ask for 12^ per cent, on bar?Yes. What has occurred to bring about the great change made between your application to the Iron Bonus Commission and that to this Commission ?-Speakin g from my own point of view, I have had many opportunities of going into this question since the matter came before the Iron Bonus Commission. At that time. I had only just joined the firm. In the meantime I have travelled twice to England and America, and have had more time to look into the subject. I am convinced that it would be a mistake to put on a big duty, and it was proposed at the time to erect large ironworks before there was a reasonable demand for the material. I saw some works in America turning out material at such a rate that they could produce in three months in some lines more than we should require in Australia in a year. I was convinced that it would be a mistake to put down such big works right away.. They go in for special works in America?Yes; they specialize everything. And you could not hope to compete ' with them ?-We do not say that this small duty which we asked for will allow us to compete in those big lines, because the trade is not here to warrant the effort, and it is a mistake to tax people unless you can develop an industry by doing so. When it was found by a portion of the Iron Bonus Commission that the "" evidence failed to show that there was any commercial necessity for the bonus proposed,"" do you think that the portion of the Commission which so found were justified in doing so, in view of the proposal you are now making ?-No ; I do not think they were justified. Will you kindly explain?-What the proposed bonus amounted to was a guarantee that we should have a certain amount of the trade of this country. That was really the effect of the bonus. It was not the value that we should get out of it that was important, but the guarantee that we should.be in a position to compete and get a certain amount of the trade. Now, however, the State Government has come forward and treated the matter in a business manner, apart from free-trade or protection. They want the iron industry established in the State. To - get it established they have given us a guarantee of seven years' work. That is the very guarantee we wanted to get to justify us in putting down a blast furnace. As honourable members are aware, the firm have put down their blast furnace, and there was a celebration carried out in connection with it some little time ago. They are now successfully turning out as good an article as is produced in any part of",57

324,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"I quote this further statement from the evidenceI t amounts to the same thing from our point of view as a bonus. They got the State guarantee referred to, and they admit 'that that is as good as the bounty for which they' previously asked. I have given the Committee the benefit of the evidence of Mr Thornley, and if honourable members care to read the evidence given in answer to thirty or forty questions following those I have quoted, they will find ample justification for the position which I put to the Committee. I wish now to make-a short quotation from the evidence given by Mr. Sandford himself. He was asked by meWhat is the basis of your seven vears' contract with the Government of New South Wales?Certain prices - At this late hour, I do not propose toWill vou state the terms of the contract?-We have not got the figures here, but they have been published, and can be got from the Government Department. I do not think that we. should be expected to give the particulars of our own business relations. I think that when Mr Sandford, or any other manufacturer, appears before a Commission asking for public money in support of the industry in which he is engaged, he should disclose the exact state of his business relations. Parliament is entitled to the information. How can any body of men decide to grant a bounty or increase protective duties unless they know the exact business - position of the manufacturers concerned? Mr Sandford gave this further evidenceYou have shifted your ground very considerably since you were examined .1 few years ago, and I wish to know the circumstances under which it has been done?-The Government of New South Wales has given us a contract which is sufficient to enable us to erect a blast furnace at the least cost of ^50,000, which we ask the Commonwealth Government to give us in the shape of a bonus, and therefore we do not ask for a bonus. So that as regards what we previously asked for the ground is swept away. That discloses the position so far as Mr. Sandford is concerned. By his sworn evidence, and that of his manager, it is shown that he did not ask' for the bounty in March, 1906, although he had previously done so when he was before the Iron Bounty Commission. stated, by more than one member of the Committee, that this proposal means the handing over of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 of the people's money to . Mr Sandford's firm. In the circumstances, the House should give him the duty for which he asked when before the Tariff Commission, and should not be led away by the appeal in the letter which has been quoted, and the statements which have appeared in the Sydney press. What could be more fair than that those who are disposed to help Mr Sandford should do so in the way which he has himself suggested? He has said that he does not want a bounty, but a duty of 12 J per cent. In dealing with this matter, I am-not concerned with Mr Sandford or with any other manufacturer. It is a matter of national importance ito the defence of Australia, a phase of this question to which too little consideration is given in this Chamber. I invite honourable members not to vote for the bounty provided for in this Bill.",57
325,Mr TILLEY BROWN,MANUFACTURES,"Indi) [10.19]. discuss the question of nationalization at any length. I think there must be some misconception on the part of certain honourable members. They cannot have read the Bill , or they would have seen that clauses 8, 9, and JO provide for practically the same thing as the amendment of which notice has been given by the' leader of the Labour Party.. I undertake to say that the members of that Party w i l ! never get nearer to the nationalization of this industry than they will by supporting this Bill, which seems to me to have been planned for the purpose, and appears to disclose a close community of interest between the Government and their supporters. What is the good of the bond? If it is to be of any value, the bank must be associated with the gentlemen concerned in the bond. I understand that the proposal is that the State of New South Wales shall take over the iron industry so soon as private enterprise hasfailed. What right have we to saddle New South Wales or any other State with a disability of that kind? Under this Bill , if the enterprise should fail, the State must either carry it on or carry the baby. I shall not vote for the measure unless clauses 8, 9, 10 are excised, and I shall not support the amendment of the Labour Party to nationalize the industry. _ There are one or'two points connected with thisI t has been matter which no honourable member appears to have studied. Canada has beenmentioned as a country which has attempted to foster the iron industry by means of the bounty system. I agree with the honourable member for Darwin, that if we sanction the payment of the bounty proposed we shall have fo continue that system indefinitely. I have been told that the United States failed to establish theindustry for a considerable time, and that it was not until they possessed a populawhich tion of 30,000,000 that it became a sucsideration cess. I am further assured by a gentleorable man in whom I can place implicit rethe liance that it will be utterly impossible paper basket. to make the undertaking successful tralia until we possess a population 20,000,000. I believe that a number of honourable members visited trie ironworks Lithgow in order that they might see this wonderful industry for themselves. They need not have gone so ""far afield. might have visited a little roller millthe Lion mill-in South Melbourne, where they would have seen a gentleman who has established the industry, and who has never asked for State assistance, either way of a bounty or by way of a duty. This gentleman employs more than 130 hands, and has never been called upon pay any Excise. Mr Justice Higgins will never adjudicate upon his case, because pays his employees wages which attract them to the work. Honourable members might also have visited an adjoining buildtold ing, where they would have seen for it themselves one of the most wonderful inpoint. ventions in the world-a machine which will turn .out horse-shoes more perfectly than they can be turned out by a man an anvil. In short, they might haye witwealth. nessed all the processes connected with iron industry at this particular establishtion ment. The letter which Mr Sandford has addressed to honourable members is plain, straightforward ad nrisericordiam posed? appeal for assistance. I say that this Parliament was not created to grant asduty. sistance to private individuals. Further, it would be utterly impossible for us to buttress this particular industry. Mr Sandford had embarked upon it, other men with flocks and herds lost something feet and is able to wajk. like £100,000 in it before they abandoned it. When we come to consider the whole position we must recognise that it is not merely a question of producing pig iron, and of converting it into rolled flat iron. I am assured by those who understand the question thoroughly that there are so many hundreds of matters connected with the industry that, to deal with it successfully, we should require buildings which would practically cover whole of Melbourne, and even then work would not be provided for more than or four days in the year. I recognise that it was necessary that this discussion should take place."" I am exceedingly sorry that it has interrupted the work upon Mr Tilley Brown. we were engaged, namely, the conof the Tariff.

But I take it that, .to some extent, we are all They Socialists, otherwise we could not live in a civilized community. Civilization itself is the outcome of collective ideas and co-operation. If there is one industry, above all others, which should be naby tionalized, it is the iron industry. During the recent election, campaign the leader of the Opposition declared that it would cost to so many millions of pounds to nationalize certain industries. Here is an industry he which can be nationalized without the State being required to pay anything, for the purchase of vested interests.

327,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,"It has been stated Before several times in this House that protection is like nursing a baby until it gets on its I admit, as a protectionist, that if we are to maintain a civilized state it will be always necessary to impose duties against the introduction of manufactured commodities from the and outside world. Every protectionist may not feel inclined to admit that, but I do, and at the end of the five years' term I know that we shall have-to give those who engage in this industry the protection of a duty. If it is refused, they will say to us, "" You, the as a Parliament, brought into existence an industry in which so many hundred men three are employed, and now that you have ceased giving the bounty, are you going to allow the industry to languish for want of a protective duty?"" That will be rightly said to us. We have no right to bring into existence and foster an industry unless we are prepared to assist it afterwards. Then why should we humbug one another with the hope that the bounty will do all that is necessary, when we know full well at some stage of the existence of the industry we shall have to apply a duty? The common-sense course to take now, if we do not nationalize the iron industry, is to give it a duty in the same way that as protectionists, give protection to every other manufacturing industry. I have no-, thing to say regarding the attitude of the free-traders,' except that it seems strange to hear reputed free-traders support a Bill for a bounty on the manufacture ot raw iron who refuse to vote for duties upon manufactured commodities, of which iron is the raw material. Where is the sense in voting for a bounty for - an indus- tion for the House to be placed in. try, and denying an opportunity for the raw material produced by that industry to be used in making other commodities? The honourable member for Nepean, in whose district Lithgow is situated, has voted on every occasion for the lowest duty he could possibly get on any commodity. It is an appalling fact- I do not know how his constituents will take it-that the other or his position alone. evening, - when he had an opportunity of voting for a duty upon a manufactured commodity which would have used thousands and thousands of tons of the raw iron produced in his constituency, he actu- ally voted against that duty. I allude to the proposed duty on gas stoves, on which the honourable member for Nepean voted for the lowest duty he could get, although thousands of tons of iron could be used in the manufacture of gas stoves in Australia. It is useless for us to delude selves, as protectionists, with the idea the application of a bounty will be all that is necessary to establish the manufacture of raw iron. We have the experience of the past to guide us. If we want to maintain a state of civilization here, to provide that our workers shall have proper conditions of living, and that the men who invest their money shall have a return upon ir, we must always have a high duty placed upon imported commodities. I am surprised at some protectionists voting for a bounty in this case, and shutting their eyes to .the fact that the proper way to encourage the industry is to impose a duty, and I am surprised at free-traders voting for a bounty and refusing to vote for duties upon articles which they should - hope to see manufactured here from the raw iron.",59
328,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"Franklin) [10.35]. - When this Bill was previously before the House I opposed it . I fake exactly the same stand to-night. Not one argument that advanced by any supporter of the Bill would justify the House in voting a quarter of a million of money as is proposed. It is deeply to be regretted that Mr. Sandford sent' the letter so frequently we,- referred to to members of Parliament on the eve of this discussion. The result has been that the whole of the debate has hinged upon the question, not of whether a bounty should be granted to establish the iron industry in Australia, but of whether Parliament should vote money to enable one individual to meet the finan-' cial obligations in"" which the industry has landed him. That is not a proper posiThe honourable member for Illawarra has shown that Mr Sandford himself declared that he did riot want a bounty. The position seems to be now that Mr Sandford has the idea that, as the Federal Parliament is granting bounties rather freely all round, he might as well have a cut at them also. But we are not discussing Mr Sandford If Parliament is to do anything in this direction, we should have regard to the broad principles of establishing the industry in many parts of Australia, rather than to the needs of one particular individual in one particular place. ",60
329,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"I am not attacking him. I say that it is deeply to be regretted, that, owing to a certain circular letter being sent to members of our- Parliament, the individual and not the that industry has been brought into prominence.",60

331,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"I admit that, with regard to a great deal of the lobbying that has been going on for some time past, it would have been very much better for the men concerned if they had stayed away. Personally I do not think that the leg-pulling that some of them have tried to indulge in with regard to other parts of the Tariff has improved their chances in many instances.",60
332,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,It has been done by both sides.,60
333,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"I am not speaking of one side more than of the other. The Lithgow district is not the only one which it is proposed to establish the iron ment. industry. There is in the electorate of the honourable member for Darwin one the grandest deposits of iron in the known world. That is the testimony of experts. Mr Keats, the gentleman who had the flotation of that company in hand, stated evidence before the Iron Bounty CommisFederation has slept. sion that he did not want the bounty. He said further, that, if it was proposed to duty. give a bounty, a trifle of £250,000 would not go anywhere towards establishing the industry. That will be found in question 2330 of Mr Keats' evidence. son, the Chairman of Directors of that Company, also said that the bounty was quite useless to establish-the industry, and that a Customs duty would be required. I shall try to show briefly what has been the experience in Canada. More than one honourable member has pointed out that the industry was established in Canada by a bounties system. According to the Canadian Annual Review the iron industry, after twenty years of bonuses, is in such a condition that, last year, the Government had to come to the rescue with a grant of ,£500,000. That is the result in Canada, although there is a stiff protective duty of 25 to 30 per cent, on all iron imported, including steel rails.' I may point out that the production of steel rails in Canada last year exceeded 600,000 tons, and we must not forget that the production of steel rails is one of the most profitable branches of the industry, and that owing to the great .number of railways being constructed there is an enormous output. Another important point is that the railways in Canada are owned by private companies, who when they import rails have to pay the duty which I have mentioned. But the F u l l Court of New South Wales has ruled that the Federation has no power to levy a tax on the rails imported by a State.",60
334,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Oh , but there power!",61

338,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURES,If that is good of law the Federation will break down.,61

340,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"Yes , under protest, simply because the Federation is in possession. If the judgment of the New Mr JamieSouth Wales 'Full Court is upheld, we shall take from the industry a great source of profit which it possesses. In view of the experience of Canada, there is no hope of establishing the industry by means of the proposed bounty, and if the experience of Canada is to be repeated here, it would be better for the Government to conduct the industry themselves. Twenty years ago Canada had the same population that Australia has today, so that it is proposed to start the industry here under exactly similar conditions ; and if our experience is to be that of Canada-if we are to pay £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £10,000,000 in bounties and undertake all the risk-let us take any profit that may be going. I shall vote against the granting of this bounty. The men who have entered upon this industry tell us that they do not want a bounty; and we know from the experience of other countries, notably Canada, that such a bounty as that proposed is a mere crumb on the waters. We have no possible hope of establishing the industry with such a small bounty; and the money will be simply frittered away. There are honourable members opposing this bounty, who, some weeks ago, when it was proposed to fritter away money in a similar way on other industries, simply tumbled over one another in their anxiety to support the proposal. I voted against those other bounties is and I intend to vote against the present proposal, first, because it is not justified, and, secondly, because it is quite inadecase quate to establish the industry.",61
341,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"Dalley) [10.45] - I may mention, parenthetically, that the measure to before us is a Manufactures Encouragement Bill. Into this discussion there has been woven nearly every subject under the sun. We have had historical disquisitions, side and American history, and patches of economics. I do not intend to follow the iron example of other honourable members in this discursiveness, but simply to address myself, in a few plain, blunt words, to the question before the Chair. It is said that when a man is going to the penitent stool, the sooner he gets there the better; and, in parliamentary life, it is better for a man to attack himself than to allow others to attack him. I have on every occasion that presented itself opposed the granting of bounties; and the same arguments that have been used against this measure by honourable members who preceded me I have used myself. I do not think that one word which has been said against the granting of this bounty is not exactly true; but, all the same, I am going to vote for this Bill.",61
342,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,When did the honourable member change his mind?,62
343,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"I managed to change my mind before the last election. I found that some honourable members were very grandiloquent on economic theories when the question did not affect their electorates or their States - that free-traders, who could be very frigid and rigid on occasion, were neither frigid nor rigid when the interests of their constituents were concerned. The honourable member who preceded me has put the matter very clearly before the House. He said that, apparently, those interested in ironworks are under the impression that this Parliament is "" o u t "" to give bounties, and thbk that under the circumstances they have a right to be "" in it."" Without attempting to justify myself in any way, I may say that, if the Government are throwing around this plunder or loot, or whatever it may be called, I shall see if I cannot get some of it for my own State. When a bounty on sugar or on rice or cotton was proposed, we heard no cry for nationalization. We are now dealing with the iron industry, which is specially identified with New South Wales. Last week we imposed heavy duties on woollens and hats, and I now find myself on the homs of a dilemma. The Treasurer says that he does not desire the Bill to be discussed in detail at this stage. He simply desires to obtain a decision, of the House, so that he may know whether the iron industry is to be encouraged by means of a bounty or by the imposition of duties. Mv electorate is largely concerned in. the use of iron, but not in its manufacture. I recognise that if this Bill be rejected an import duty will be imposed on iron', and that it will press heavily upon those who use it in my electorate. Of the two evils I prefer a bounty to a duty. At the last general election, I asked my constituents to give me a free hand to vote as I pleased in regard to propositions of this kind, and since they acceded to my request I should be a fool if I did not exercise my freedom. My policy is that if assistance is given to one industry it should be given to others. The granting of a bounty is less harmful than is the imposition of a duty. The cost of a bounty system to a State or the Commonwealth may be readily determined, but no one can estimate the extent to which a duty may penalize individuals. Throughout my career as a member of this Parliament, I have studiously refused to be interviewed by parties interested in legislation before us. I have refused to be interviewed either by manufacturers or importers, and although it has been said that certain influences were brought to bear upon honourable members in the last Parliament, I know nothing of them. The Parliament which dealt with the Tariff of 1902 was free from the American system of lobbying and its evil influences. It was absolutely pure. I think it necessary to make that statement, in view of what has been said in the presence of a number of people in the gallery, who might otherwise go away with the impression that this Parliament is liable to corruption. I do not think that it is. If I knew of any evidence in support of such a suggestion, I should be one of the first to bring it before you, Mr Speaker. As I have said, my constituents are interested in this Bill only so far as the use of iron is concerned, but in New South Wales we have a gentleman associated with the iron industry who has shown indomitable pluck, and has a perfect right to appeal to us for assistance: If assistance is to be given to manufacturers of woollens, hats, and other goods, why, then,. should similar treatment be denied to the iron industry of New South Wales? I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill, and in Committee shall point out what provisions I think should be inserted for the protection of the public. If a bounty be granted on the production of iron, we ought certainly to be prepared to grant a bounty on shiD-building. The one is the natural corollary of the other. It is all very well for those who support this Bill to draw vivid pictures of the uses to which iron may be put, but something more is necessary. If we are to have naval dockyards and an expansion, of the ship-building industry, honourable members must be prepared to grant a complemental bounty on ship-building. ' If anv industry ought to be assisted by us, then the two that I have mentioned are deserving, of encouragement. The character of the work .and the wages paid in the ship-building industry entitle it to every consideration. When the Iron Bounties Bill was before us in 1902, I , with others, voted for the amendment providing for the nationalization of the industry, because it was submitted with the avowed object of defeating the Bill. Some honourable members have gone so far as to suggest that the nationalization of this industry would be a species of Socialism. I hold that it would not. Any well-informed Socialist will admit that Socialism does not permit of the nationalization of an industry in order that a profit may be made out of it by the State. Honourable members of the Labour Party have urged that this would be a profitable State monopoly. The true Socialist abhors State commercialism Hist as much as he abhors the commercialism of individualists.",62
344,Mr HALL,MANUFACTURES,I think that we are against the same kind of Socialism as the honourable member is.,63
345,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"Perhaps so; but at the last general election there was no differentiation between the various classes of Socialism. If , at the next general election, we differentiate between them, as I am now doing, honourable members of the Labour Party will probably find manv who voted against them at the last election according them their support, whilst some of their old supporters will oppose them. near future the electors will be divided, not as they were at the last general election, but as the true advocates of Socialism .are' separating themselves from many members of the Labour Party. If I voted for the nationalization of the iron industry, I should be justified in voting for the nationalization of all other industries. absolutely opposed to that for several reasons. Supposing this amendment to be carried, do I understand that State ownership or Commonwealth ownership is meant?",63
346,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,Commonwealth ownership.,63
347,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Wide Bay has made the matter quite clear. Many honourable members who favour nationalization in this instance may have considered that what was meant was ownership by a State. But before we can determine whether the idea of the honourable member for Wide Bay can be carried out, we have to settle whether it is constitutional for the Federal Parliament to enter into this matter.",63
348,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,Some one else will discover that for us.,63
349,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"The State of New South Wales has done a great deal to assist in the establishment of the iron industry. At the present moment it is considering whether it will not afford further financial assistance. Indeed, the Premier of the State is considering whether his Government will not finance the industry. They see a very fine industry being conducted in New South Wales. They consider it to be to their interest to keep it going. As a Federal representative, my position is that I have seen many other industries coddled by means of duties; therefore, I feel justified in voting for a bounty to coddle this industry. I openly say that it is coddling, but, under the circumstances, I think it justifiable. We have been told that it is advisable to nationalize "" public utilities."" That is a splendid phrase. No one knows better than I do how useful a high-sounding phrase is on the public platform. But food and clothing are also public utilities. Is it proposed to nationalize such things as those? I draw a distinction which I do not think is a fine.one between State-ownership of such things as railways and a State iron industry. I do not think that any man in the present day in Australia would argue against the advantage of State-owned railways. I do not think that any one would say that it is In the not advisable that the State, or the municipality, should own' waterworks, the postal service, and the means of illumination. The adjective "" socialistic "" can be applied to such enterprises for purposes of definition, but the line of distinction is that they concern practically every member of the community. No matter whether a man be I am a primary or a secondary producer, a capitalist, or the humblest worker, he is interested in our State-owned railways. But the number of those who would be concerned in State-owned ironworks is very limited. No one could contend that an ironindustry would affect the whole of the people. But if we are to nationalize the industry, why should we stop there? Why not nationalize the sugar industry or the clothing industry? I have already explained my view with regard to the new protection and the bounty system. I have seen assistance from the public purse given to many other industries. Whether that assistance is given by a duty or a bounty is a matter of indifference. I put in. a plea for a New South. Wales industry in connection with this bounty. As we are going in for higher duties and bounties all round, I am not going to see my own State neglected. other bounties had not been voted, and if duties had not been passed for the advantage of other industries, I should have been one of the strongest opponents of this proposal. But when I have seen other industries receiving assistance from the Commonwealth, I certainly think that the iron industry has a right to be considered; and the cheapest way to consider it is to give it a bounty. . The mere fact that Mr. Sandford is immediately concerned has nothing to do with the question. There is nothing to prevent a thousand other persons from applying for the bounty if they choose to establish ironworks. Mr Sandford has shown a good deal of energy and is deserving of encouragement. The argument of some honourable members, that they will not vote for a bounty until the industry has proved itself self-supporting, is one that they have not applied when giving their votes to the advantage of other industries. Why did we not hear that argument when thehat industry and the sugar industry were concerned? Another difficulty has to be faced if the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay be carried. If the Commonwealth is to establish and finance the iron industry there will undoubtedly be a struggle as to where the works are to be established. There are iron deposits in Tasmania, New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. If the Commonwealth is to take a Hand there will have to be not one, but a series of iron industries. Any one can see trie absurdity of that, because the demand for iron in Australia is not sufficiently great to warrant the establishment of more than one industry. I have now, 1 consider, given sufficient reasons for voting for the Bill . I should not pretend to defend it from an economic stand-point, or from the stand-point of experience, if it stood alone. I defend it from the basest of all base reasons-that the State of Victoria and other States having received assistance, from the Commonwealth, I intend to vote that an industry in which New South Wales is particularly concerned should receive similar assistance.",63
350,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,"Macquarie) [11.10] - I am perhaps more Interested in this proposal than are most honourable members. I all very well for the Treasurer to show impatience, but I consider that I ought to let my constituents know my intentions on this question, because, as I said, I am interested. There are two of the biggest iron deposits in my electorate, If one of which is the contributing source of supply to the ironworks which have been under review this evening. Unlike the last speaker, however, I have not fallen from political grace so far as to enter into a scramble for a. bounty for my electorate. I do not consider that to be .politics at all, but merely child's play. I am opposed to the grant of a bounty. It is hardly necessary for me to say that I regard the iron industry as practically the basis of modern civilization, in so far as all superstructure depends more or less upon the manufacture and use of iron. In view of the fact that we shall be beholden entirely to outside countries for our supplies, and that in the event of a crisis we should suffer from the shortage, it becomes imperative for us, in my opinion, to give some encouragement to the industry. But if it is necessary for us to pay away the people's money, for goodness' sake let us buy them an interest in the concern. Let us act as honourable trustees of their money. That is the consideration which appeals to me. Seeing that revenue duties have been supported by those who are averse to direct taxation, I cannot endorse any proposal to pay away to any private individual solid cash wrung from the poorer classes at the Customs House. If it is necessary, in the interests of the nation, to promote the iron industry-and I believe that"" it is,, for we live in the "" i r on age"" - let us act in a business-like manner, as men who are worthy to represent the people, and if we spend their money in that direction, let us buy them at least an interest in the concern. If that is unconstitutional, so must be our proposal to nationalize the industry. We have so far had only two issues placed before us. I shall certainly support nationalization in preference to granting a bounty. If , however, we cannot carry our proposal to nationalize, and the proposal to give a bounty is not carried, then I shall favour the imposition of a high Customs duty with all the reservations which may be necessary to regulate local industries. It has been stated that the iron industry cannot succeed in Australia, that in any case it will not pay. It has not paid so far, and it is quite possible that there t is is no market here to make the industry profitable. I must concede that I have very serious doubts as to whether in any case it would be a profitable industry. But that is no reason why we should ""drop the baby,"" as some one has been pleased to term it. If it is necessary for us to have an iron industry, as I believe it is, we must secure its establishment in order to protect our own secondary industries at all costs, and take the steps which will entail the least possible sacrifice by the people. I contend that direct control, whether whole or partial, is the best way in which to secure the most beneficial results, whether the industry is going to be profitable or not. I regard the establishment and conduct of the industry as essential to the de- dustry. velopment of Australia, and shall support any practical measure other than one to grant a bounty.",64
351,Mr ARCHER,MANUFACTURES,"Capricornia) [11.15] - I do not propose to deal in any way with the amendment. I am in somewhat of a dilemma with regard to the two proposals of the Government, namely, to grant a bounty or to impose a Customs duty of 12 J per cent. There certainly is reason to doubt whether the grant of a bounty would lead to any very good results. If that-proposal stood by itself, I should feel disposed to oppose rt as it stands, on the general ground that it would be practically throwing away the money. In the first place, I do not consider that the amount of the proposed bounty is enough, and in the second place, I do not think that the method in which it is proposed to be applied is efficient. On the other hand, if the proposal for giving a bounty be defeated, undoubtedly the Government have sufficient support in this House to carry their proposal to levy an import duty of 12 J per cent, on the raw material, and, I take it, will do so. Last year we imported raw material to the value of £1,500,000, and a duty of 12 per cent, on that sum would 1 yield a. revenue of nearly £200,000. That would be the annual tax on all sorts of people and industries. Of the two evils I prefer the lesser, which is the proposal to give a bounty. I hope that if granted it will do some good. At any rate it is far better to spend £250,000 out of the general revenue in that way over a period of five years than to tax all our industries to the amount of £200,000 a year for all time. For that reason I shall vote for the proposal to give a bounty in the expectation that the measure will be amended in certain directions in Committee, and I hope that we will never impose the import duty of 12 J per cent, on the raw material which is used by every blacksmith, wheelwright, and other manufacturers throughout Australia.",65

How can we deai with the contentious items of the Tariff until we know what is embodied in that Bill? Naturally the Treasurer desires get into recess, and I frankly admit he has been the most hard-worked MinisChristmas. ter in this Parliament up to date. I am astonished that he has not allowed the Minister of Trade and Customs to assist him in piloting the Tariff through this House. When the first Commonwealth Tariff was submitted, it was in charge a giant in the person of the right honorwould able member for Adelaide, but even he had the assistance of the then Treasurer, Sir George Turner.

384,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I hope that the Estimates will be the first business as soon as we return after the Christmas adjournment.,69
385,Mr FRAZER,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"As there appears to be no hope of discussing the general Estimates this year, we ought to be given a better opportunity of discussing a Supply Bill of this kind. It is urged that another place is desirous of getting the Bill through in order that they may adjourn. Only a few days ago there was a general story about the building that another place had absolutely no intention of adjourning until the Disputed Elections ancl Qualifications - Bill was returned to them from this House. Therefore, one of the stories must be wrong. Either another place considers it urgently necessary that that measure should be passed, or it is to be left in the lurch if another place adjourns at the end of this week. I am not going to express any particular anxiety for the Senate to have an opportunity to get that measure passed before they rise, as it may deal not only with one case, but with other succeeding cases, and therefore it should not be rushed through without serious consideration. Although I come from a distant State and have no opportunity of getting home at the week-ends, I would prefer to stay in Melbourne a little longer than to see important measures passed through with undue haste.. I am going to have my Christmas dinner in Western Australia if it is possible; but the passage of a Bill appropriating a quarter of a million pounds of the people's money in the shape of iron bounties after 'two days' discussion is of much more serious consequence to the people of Australia than is the question of where I eat my Christmas dinner. It seems futile to-night to endeavour to raise the question of the attitude of the Government with regard to carrying out the provisions of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. I thought an opportunity would have been given to honourable members on the next Supply Bill to hear a thorough statement from the Government as to their intentions on that question.",69

Having expressed my opinion, I am prepared to let this Supply Bill go through. Mr. JOSEPH COOK "" (Parramatta) [iz.o] - I see no reason, under the circumstances, in tilting against this Supply Bill.

Tariff and its discussion, they could have done so, but they preferred to fritter away the time with other legislation, and now there is really no opportunity, to deal with the Estimates before Christmas.

406,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Lang) [12.10 a.m.] - I desire to ventilate a matter of serious moment affecting the Postal Department in New South Wales, to which I referred at the commencement of the sitting. In [222]- 2 the Sydney Morning Herald of yesterday, there appears an article with the following heading: "" Chaos in the Post Office; Dissatisfaction rampant; Strike narrowly averted."" In that article is given a vivid description of the sweating conditions which continue to prevail in that office. In regard to the Telegraph Department it is stated that the position has become so acute that the operators are bordering on open revolt. I do not know whether that condition obtains at the present time, but I understand from the Postmaster-General that something has been done to relieve the pressure so far as the telegraph operators are concerned. But still it appears that sufficient has not been done to make any material alteration in the conditions, although they have been modified. The greatest cause fo; complaint appears to be in the clerical division, and the chief basis of complaint is that the officers have nor the means of gaining access to the administrative heads of the Department, who are situated six hundred miles away in Melbourne. Ob stacles are said to be placed in the way of their getting their grievances under! the notice of the Public Service Commissioner or his responsible lieutenants. Therefore the officers in Sydney are labouring under a sense of injustice. Time after time representations have been furnished to the Postmaster-General, in which allegations as to the undermanned condition of the service have been made. The first of these reports of recent date ivas furnished in March, 1906. It was stated at that time that in three months from the ist of January, something like 5,000 hours overtime had been worked by the clerical staff. A later report was furnished in June of the same year, which revealed that a similar condition of things prevailed. The chief officer at the Sydney General Post Office stated that the staff was quite inadequate to cope with'the work, and that the overworking of officers had resulted in a serious impairment of their health. We may take it that as those facts are stated by officers in a position of responsibility, they are not likely to be exaggerated. And indeed the - heads of Departments themselves, with their onerous duties and heavy responsibilities, are probably as much overworked as any of their subordinates, and have to bear an ever increasing load of worry and anxiety. In a third report, three months later, it was shown that the number of hours overtime worked by the clerical branch-exclusiv e of those employed in the mail and telegraph branches-wa s 8,000 hours. conditions have been going from bad to worse. It is stated in the Sydney Morning Herald article that the men in thirteen branches of the Clerical Division, at the General Post Office, Sydney, have worked 32,000 hours overtime between ist January and 31st August of this year-equivalen t to 869 weeks of official labour. That is surely a deplorable and disgraceful state of affairs. Mr J. H. CATTS - I beg to call attention to the state of the [Quorum formed.]",70
407,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Anothe r practice that prevails in the Department'is that although the official hours of work are supposed to be from 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. on week days, ancl from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays, the officers are now required to work from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. on weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. on Saturdays.",71
408,Mr MAUGER,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,The Public Service Act made that alteration.,71
409,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"It means that an hour a day has been added on to the work of these men without extra pay. They are compelled to work an extra six hours per week, and that is nof counted as part of their overtime.",71
410,Mr MAUGER,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I assure the honourable member that it is counted in the overtime.,71
411,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Of course I must accept the Minister's assurance, but I have been otherwise informed. One of the most serious of the allegations in the Sydney Morning Herald article is this, that there is a system of alleged terrorism prevailingOver the whole Department official terrorism exists. The employees are forbidden to open their mouth to any press representative. Even the officials of the Post Office Associations are similarly gagged, and the Deputy Postmaster-General will not speak on anv particular subject to a press representative, and when requested for a statement of affairs in Sydney refers the reporter to Melbourne.",71
412,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,A very good thing - no t to let the press overrun the Department.,71
413,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"1 can understand that it would, be highly undesirable to allow unrestrictedcommunication with the press in - regard to departmental business which is more or less of a confidential characterI do not find fault with that; but it is alleged that terrorism exists in the Post Office.",71
414,Mr MAUGER,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"The officers did not say Since then, a word to me about terrorism when I met them.",71
415,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"The Minister will understand that I am not making any charges, but simply drawing attention to charges which have been made by a reputable newspaper - the Sydney Morning Herald-in an article which was written after a representative had been sent specially to investigate various matters.",71
416,The CHAIRMAN,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I ask honourable members to desist from conversing across Committee. the chamber.,71
417,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"The article continues The men recognise that n certain amount of Sunday labour is necessary, but ask that it be kept down to absolute necessity, and where an official is required for Sunday duty he should in all cases be paid for it. Time off on another day they object, to, as such a system, they claim, simply entails extrn: duty on some one else. In the Sydney office there are two or more of the night staff off each night in lieu of Sunday. The whole or a portion of their work is done by a similar number of the day staff doing ""overtime."" Sometimes this may be only a couple of hours; sometimes it runs into five or six hours, making the total shift len or eleven liours, which is performed without a break. I know that the Postmaster-General has not been sufficiently long in office to be able to deal satisfactorily with the various complaints. I believe he has a desire to see that the conditions which have been a source of frequent complaint for so long a period shall be mitigated, and that something like decency, order, and fair conditions of employment shall prevail in that branch of the Public Service. But. I remind him that only recently the Deputy Postmaster-General, after going through all his branches, and no doubt trying to do with as few men as he could, said that it was necessary to have at least 600 additional hands to cope with the work in order to give Tiim an opportunity to meet and overcome the evils complained of. Instead of getting those 600 additional men, provision has been made for only 267. I know that that is so, because the Postmaster-General gave me that information in reply to a questionI asked a little time ago. If the Deputy Postmaster-General says that 600 additional officers are necessary to cope with the work, no less than that number should have been provided for him, because I take it that all the administrative heads in Sydney are men who are competent to hold their positions, and who would not dream, of asking for a greater number of men than are sufficient to deal with the work. The Christmas holidays are approaching-and that is the busiest season of the year-and unless something is done immediately to relieve the congestion of work and to improve the conditions of labour, there is every prospect of the whole Department breaking down from stress of overwork. It may be that a great many of the matters complained of are due to want of system in the working of the Department. In this article it is complained that matters which might be settled in two or - three minutes, by going into an office next door to interview the head of a Department, cannot be settled in that way, but that a great amount of work is entailed upon the officers by the system of red-tapeism which prevails, and which necessitates so much correspondence with Melbourne. In that way an immense amount of work is put upon the shoulders of the officers which otherwise might be avoided. As the article states, insteadbf walking into an adjoining room to oonsult the chief, the officers have to write many letters and reports for Melbourne before they can obtain an answer. It goes on to say-It is estimated that in some branches the additional work caused by the present system amounts to 50 per cent., and in others to 30 per cent. Yet the staff is not correspondingly increased.",71
418,Mr MAUGER,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"I can assure the honourable member that I am increasing the responsibilities of the Deputy Postmasters General, and trying to reduce that correspondence with Melbourne.",72
419,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,The honourable gentleman will understand that I am in no way reflecting upon his administration of the Department. I give him credit for being anxious to institute a better. condition of things. I remind the Treasurer that he is credited with being very largely responsible for the present position by refusing to make sufficient provision on the Estimates to meet the requirements said to be necessary by the pears in the Sydney Morning departmental heads.,72
420,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I shall take all the responsibility.,72
421,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,What I ask the honourable gentleman to do is to consider efficiency of the service.,72
422,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"I have my own opinion about the efficiency of the service, and the work which has to be done. I have been in the Sydney General Post Office two or three times.",72
423,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Possibl y the honourable gentleman may know more about the working of that Department than I do, as he has been in public life very much longer than I have been.",72
424,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"As I have been there two or three times, I ought to know a good deal about the work done there.",72
425,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"But is that statement not a reflection on the competency of the officers in charge, who have been there for many years? It seems to me that the whole subject of the administration of the Post and Telegraph Service - in New South Wales, if not throughout the Commonwealth, ought to be inquired into by a Commission, because these complaints have been general, and the dissatisfaction has been prevalent over a wide area.",72
426,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,It is the best paid and easiest service in the world.,72
427,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,That is called in question.,72
428,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,There is. no question about it .,72
429,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"It is called in question, not in one State or city alone, but all over the Commonwealth. I have heard honourable members representing different States and different parts of States making complaints of various kinds in connection with this Department. It has been said that in the Customs Department similar conditions prevail, though not to anything like the same extent. How true that statement is I do not know. . I feel that I have had sufficient justification, even at this hour, in drawing the attention of the Committee to the allegations, and I do so with the fervent hope that steps will be speedily taken to prevent this congestion, and to try to give more assistance, in view of the near approach of the Christmas holidays, and the consequent large increase of the work.",72
430,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I shall take no notice of an article of that kind which apHerald.,72
431,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Then the Treasurer must take the full responsibility for any break-down that may occur.  the I did not know of the existence of this Supply Bill until a copy was put into my hand a short time ago. I do not think it is fair to ask honourable members to pass at this hour of the night Supply amounting to £704,457-nearl y three-quarters of a million. The contingencies alone come to between £ 1 3 5 , 0 0 0 and £ 1 4 0 , 0 0 0 , or, roughly, 25 per cent, of the whole sum. I wish for information in regard to many of the amounts, and especially in regard to the miscellaneous expenditure in division 16, under the Department of External Affairs ?",72
432,The CHAIRMAN,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"The honourable member cannot deal with the details of the Bill until it is being considered in Committee.  said now what I have to say; but I bow to your ruling, sir, and, later on, as each item comes up, I shall have something to say about it.",73
433,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"The member was not here about two weeks ago, when an exactly similar Supply B i ll was introduced, and the question of contingencies dealt with. I did not make an explanation to-night, because I made one on the previous occasion.  wish to know all about the Bill . constituents sent me here to guard their interests, and I wish to know why the money is to be spent. It will be to discuss these items on the general Estimates, because, if we do, the Treasurer will say, "" You have already voted the money in the various Supply Bills."" By passing these Bills we are tying our hands, and voting money without knowing how it is to be spent. I have hardly left the chamber since the House met at 2.30 yesterday afternoon; but I have not heard a word of explanation from the Treasurer.",73
434,Sir WILLIAM JLYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"I explained matter at some length on a former occathe sion. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) prothe Treasurer says. posed-That Mr Chairman do leave the chair, and 'with the honourable member. report the resolution to the House.  Before you report to the House, sir, I wish to know from the Treasurer what is the total amount set down for contingencies, what is the explanation of the proposed penditure, on the investigation of tropical diseases, and under other heads, in division 16?",73

My Mr MCDONA LD (Kennedy) [12.30 a.m.] - I , like other honourable members, wish to enter my protest against the slipuseless shod manner in which the Government does its business.",73
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,The Chairman of Committees protesting!,73
438,Mr MCDONALD,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I have as much right as any other honourable member to protest. In the fourteen or fifteen years during which I have been in political life I ffave not seen business conducted in sucb a slip-shod manner.,73
439,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I could say much the the same thing about the manner in which Chairman of Committees conducts his business.,73
440,Mr MCDONALD,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I do not care what,73
441,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I like fair play.,73
442,Mr MCDONALD,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"I shall deal fairly I have never seen a Minister conduct the business of the House in the manner in which he has conducted it , and if I , as Chairman of Committees, do my work as badly, I hope that and some honourable member will be honest exenough to tell me, so that I may retire from the position - If the Minister thinksthat he can throw off at me, he will find that I can throw off at him.",73
443,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I do not want any introremarks from the honourable sparrow.,73
444,Mr MCDONALD,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"I have certain duties to perform, and I am going to perform them, whether the or any one else likes it or not. We are approaching Christmas, and the Government have never yet made a legitimate attempt to get through the business in proper order. They have allowed honourable members to take their own course in a manner that has not been creditable to the House or to the Government. HonorAble members have been kept sitting here for a very long time, and it looks as if the session would last for the whole year. When we come back after the Christmas adjournment of a month or six weeks, or whatever it may be, the chances are a hundred to one that the business will continue to be conducted in the same loose way, and we shall continue to sit until the end of the financial year. Eight months of the Supply required for the current financial year will have been passed when this Bill is dealt with, and it means that we are practically giving the Government a free hand for the next three or four months. If we meet in February next, the Government will have no other alternative but to come down with another Supply Bill,, and if they then ask for two months' Supply ten months of the Supply required for the year will have been granted before we shall have been given an opportunity to consider the Estimates at all. I question very much whether such a state of affairs ever before existed in any Parliament in Australia. I enter my protest against this method of doing business, which is not creditable to the Parliament or to the Government.",73
445,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Hume-Trea surer"") [12.43 a.m.] - I cannot allow the very unfair remarks which the honourable member has made to pass without reply.",74
446,Mr MCDONALD,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,Perhaps the honourable gentleman will show in what way they are unfair.,74
447,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"The honourable member has made remarks which every other honourable member present will admit have been absolutely beside the mark. He has said that he never knew such a length of time to be occupied in dealing with the Tariff. I have here a calculation'as to the number of days occupied in considering a - certain proportion of the Tariff in 1902, .and we have been only two-thirds of the time dealing with nearly twice as much of the present Tariff.",74
448,Mr MCDONALD,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"The first was a new Tariff that was considered for the first time foy the Federal Parliament Minister Sir WILLIAM LYNE - S t ill , the honourable member has had the conscience to make a statement which I have been very much surprised to hear him make.",74
449,Mr MCDONALD,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,That does not trouble me.,74
450,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,If the honourable member's observations had been just or reasonable I should have taken JIO exception to them; but I am not going to sit silent under the bounce of the honourable member.,74
451,Mr MCDONALD,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,When I begin to bounce the honourable gentleman will have reason to talk.,74
452,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"The honourable member cannot know how unfair his remarks have been. No member of the House has attended more assiduously to his duties than I have done; and no Minister ever carried a Tariff so far through this Parliament in the same time. What, then, has the honourable member been talking about? He has said that honourable members have been allowed to do as they liked: I could not prevent honourable members from talking, though I have tried to do so in everv possible way. I have controlled my temper, ancl restrained myself in a way that I scarcely thought I would have been able to do, while the long talk has been going on, and the honourable member for Kennedv has had no justification whatever for any of the statements he has made. If the honourable member were to tell the truth, I would not mind, but in his heart he must know, as well as I do, that what he said to-night about me is absolutely wide of the mark.",74
453,Mr MCDONALD,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"I shall say it again, because I believe it.",74
454,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,Then no one will take the slightest notice of the honourable member if he does. If he will inquire into the matter himself he will see that I am correct in the statement that I makethat the previous Tariff was not carried as far by a half as I have been able to carry the present Tariff in the same period.,74
455,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"The previous Government had a fighting Opposition to contend with. SirW ILLIAM LYNE - What I have had to contend with few know; but I feel that in most cases honourable members have been very considerate, in view of the peculiar position in which we find ourselves at the present time, with so many parties in this House. I can scarcely, think the honourable member is in his right mind to make such an attack upon me.",74
456,Mr FRAZER,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,Surely that is absolutely unjust.,75
457,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"r-The remarks which the honourable member has made in reference to me have been the most unwarranted I have ever heard in this House. Mr.'MCDONALD - I may be a fool, and I know it, but you are a fool and do not Schedule. know it.",75

459,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"I thank the the honourable member very much courtesy. In reference to the matter referred to by the honourable memmation ber for Maranoa, the information for which he has asked was given when the to £ 1 4 0 , 0 0 0 . last Supply Bill_ was being considered, only three or four weeks ago. I did not know that the honourable member was not present on that occasion. If he had been, he would have remembered what was stated at the time. When we get into Comin mittee presently I shall be very glad to give the honourable member all the mation I can, especially in regard to question of contingencies, which was principal question raised by the deputy leader of the Opposition when the last Supply Bill was being considered.",75
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Will the honourable gentleman also reply to this attack, when we get into Committee?",75
461,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"I do not wish members to say any more about it. Perhaps I should deration, the not have taken any notice of it ; but really felt very much hurt by the remarks which the honourable member made.  not look hurt.",75

463,Mr SPEAKER,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,I must ask honourable members to have some regard for the vestigation dignity of the House. These apparent attempts to stir up ill-feeling are most dignified.,75

467,Mr SPEAKER,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"I have ruled that the remarks which have been made by three or four honourable members are undignified and out of place. If the honourable member for Dalley thinks he is guilty, I am prepared to accept his apology. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses i to 4 agreed to.",75
468,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Trea surer) [12.50 a.m.] - I forget at the moment particular items the honourable member for his for Maranoa referred to.  chiefly about the votes for contingencies, which amount to from £135,000",75
469,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"If the honourable member had a copy of the Estimates before him he would see that. the contingencies required for each Department are clearly set out. The votes tor contingencies these Supply Bills are merely appropriations in respect of the votes for contingeninforcies set out in the Estimates in the chief, and in this Bill the amounts the ask for represent the proper proportion of total votes stated in the Estimates . to cover requirements for two months. If the honourable member refers to the Estimates in connection with each Department, he will see what these contingencies represent. There is nothing to which honourable sion that can object. Upon the last occaa Supply Bill was under consihonorable member for ParraI matta asked a similar question. In reply, a number of items were enumerated in the various Departments, and he was shown how the various amounts were made up. Take, for instance, the item relating.to the development of Papua. A number of imI portant works have been recommended by the Commissioner of Lands and approved by the Acting Administrator. These coui< -. be approved without a special grant, and that is why the item appears here. Then there is an item relating to the inof tropical diseases. The money provided in that connection represents the unthird annual contribution required during a period of five years.",75

471,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"It relates to an institute to be formed in connection with the Townsville Hospital. It was the Bishop of North Queensland who suggested it . The University of Svdney has already contributed £ 1 0 0 to it, and the Universities of Melbourne and Adelaide combined have contributed £ 1 5 0 . Everything in the shape of contingencies is to be found in the Estimates-in-chief.",75
472,Mr LIDDELL,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Hunter) [12.53 a.m.] I ask the Treasurer if any provision is made in this Bill for improving the ventilation of this chamber ? If the Government are in earnest about the matter, I think that some amount should have been included in these Estimates.",76
473,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,The matter is being dealt with by Mr Speaker. If money is required for the purpose it will be provided from the Treasurer's advance.,76
474,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Cala.re) [12.54 a.m.] - There is one item in these Estimates which ought to be explainedI refer to the proposed vote of £ 5 , 0 0 0 towards the development of Papua. Some time ago a Commission was appointed to investigate affairs in the Territory, and according to the report of that body its administration was not very satisfactory. Honourable members should be informed what the propose to do in connection with - that report. Is the House to be invited to consider the grave matters discussed by the Commission in question? Then there is an item of £ 2 0 0 provided in connection with the Federal Capital site. I should like to know what that expenditure is for?",76
475,Mr HUME COOK,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,It is intended cover the cost of the trip to Canberra.,76
476,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Franklin) [12.57 a m.]-.The question of the development of Papua, to which the honourable member for Calare called attention, is a very important one. Over two years ago the Prime Minister promised to make inquiries into the deathrate among the blacks employed upon the mines there. At that time the mortality was nearly equal to 26 per cent., which is by far the heaviest death-rate amongst working men in the known world. Since the Prime Minister gave that promise Mr Atlee Hunt has reported upon the state of affairs in Papua, but he made no inquiry whatever into that aspect of the question. The Royal Commission which was appointed gate the administration of the Territory gave it no consideration. After reading report one thing struck me very forcibly. Previously I had been under the impression that Captain Barton had not acted in the best interests of New Guinea, but a perusal of the evidence satisfied me that he was sacrificed because he attempted to protect the blacks from those who sought to take advantage of them.",76
477,Mr WATSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,He was no administrator.,76
478,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,The evidence tendered to the Royal Commission shows that a complete set was made against him because he attempted to protect the natives from those who desired to deprive them of the privileges which they ought to enjoy.,76
479,Mr WATSON,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,Anybod y who reads the evidence and declares that the services of Captain Barton ought to have been retained must be prejudiced.,76
480,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"It is a singular circumstance that officers who sat at Captain Barton's table, and partook of his hospitality and divulged private conversations to condemn Captain Barton have been promoted. The Administration of New Guinea is discreditable to the Commonwealth. One of the witnesses before the Commission complained of Captain Barton because he refused to grant permission to certain persons to disperse the blacks with shot-guns. Before one penny is voted in connection with the development of Government New Guinea, the Government' should make a complete statement upon this matter, especially as to the control of the natives, in the care of whom a great responsibility rests upon the Commonwealth Parliament. These statements have been made publicly, but the Government have never attempted to make the slightest inquiry into the to charges preferred by their own officers. The honourable member for Melbourne and myself went into the figures, and showed that the death-rate among the natives was appalling. The Prime Minister promised that an inquiry would be made. Two investigations have been held into the affairs of Papua, but not the slightest information has been given to the House on that subject. Before we pass further money for the administration of Papua, a complete investigation should take place, and the Government should show clearly that a great improvement is being made in the control of the affairs of the Territory.",76
481,Mr HUME COOK,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,Does the honourable member desire to cripple the present A d to investiministrator in the meantime?,76
482,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"I have no desire its to do so; but for over two years information has been coming from the wardens on the gold-fields, announcing the high death-rate of natives, but the Government have taken absolutely no steps to put an end to it. It is time the Committee declared that before further moneys are voted, there must be an explanation from the Government, and some indication of a determination that the appalling deathrate amongst the black's shall be stopped. At one of the gold-fields the doctor said that it was more dangerous for the blacks to be employed there than it was for men to be engaged in the Russo-Japanese war, because the death-rate amongst the men working on that gold-field was greater than amongst the armies engaged in that deadly conflict. And still the Government have taken no steps whatever to inquire into the subject or put an end to the scandal. The thanks of the Committee are due to the honourable member who brought this subject forward. There should be a complete investigation into the question of the control of the natives, especially of ithose who are working for the princely sum of £ 6 a year, while fines are deducted for every little offence that they commit, with the result that often, after their year's labour, the poor wretches go home with practically no wages to draw at all. The condition of ttie blacks in Papua working on some of the gold-fields under the control of this - Parliament is in some respects infinitely worse than that of the Chinese on the Rand, and we are tak'ing no notice Of it.",76
483,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Parramatta) [1.3 a . m . ] - I observe an item of £ 5 "" to reimburse the States the cost of carrying out the provisions of the Commerce Act 1905."" It strikes me that that Act is beginning to be very expensive. Will the Treasurer state whether that sum represents the disbursements for the whole year, or, if not, for how much of the year, and in what proportion and under what conditions it is paid to the States. I have never yet heard a statement from the Minister in this matter.",77
484,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Hume-Trea surer) [1.4 a.m.] - If the honourable member will allow me, I shall be very glad to explain. After the Commerce Act was passed, I did not desire to interfere any more than was absolutely necessary with the work that was being done by the States. I therefore made an arrangement for the States to carry on the work, and they are now doing it. They are carrying out the Commerce Act, to a certain extent under the direction of the Federal Government, in that they cannot make any appointments or do anything without the consent of the Federal Parliament, but a claim was made that the States officers in doing Federal work were taking the place of officers whom the Federal Government would otherwise have to appoint, and therefore I agreed to pay the salaries of such officers when employed in this work. Some officers are doing partly State work and partly Federal work. This item is a part of the total amount, which in all comes' to £ 1 1 , 0 0 0 , or £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 a year.",77
485,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"That is pretty stiff, is it not? Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE - The States demanded an increased sum after I made the arrangement with them.",77
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,How many States does it apply to?,77
487,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"To all the States which are carrying out the Act, including Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales. I do not know whether Queensland is being paid at the present time, but it will be paid if it demands payment. The total payment in the case of New South Wales comes to between £ 3 , 0 0 0 and £ 4 , 0 0 0 a year, and the amount is about the same in Victoria. Mr MCWtLLiAMS - For both imports and exports? Six WILLIAM LYNE - It is for carry- . ing out the Commerce Act, so far as that is necessary in addition to the work done , 3 0 0 by the Customs Department. The administration of Papua is not in my Department, and I do not know what has really been done, but I remember that the Prime Minister intended to make a statement with reference to certain matters connected with the general management of the Territory. All I can say now is that I will bring the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin under the notice of the Prime Minister, who will doubtless be able to give whatever information he possesses within a reasonable time.",77
488,Mr BOWDEN,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"Nepean) [1.7 a.m.] - I ' desire to urge upon the Postmaster-General the necessity of putting under way .as soon as possible the proposed erection of the new trunk telephone line to Katoomba. There is at present an absolute break-down in the work of the line. Although the season has not yet properly commenced, even now anybody who wishes to use the telephone line between Katoomba and Sydney has to wait at least an hour, and sometimes as long as two hours, before he can get connected with Sydney. I was at Katoomba the other - day, and ran across a very irate subscriber, who had been trying for over an hour to get on to his Sydney office."" He told that a matter of over £100 depended on getting the connection before 12 o'clock that day. No one knows better than the late Postmaster-General that what I about the Katoomba telephone service is true. There is an absolute failure to lize the wants or to satisfy the desires people in the matter of telephonic communiSolicitor cation,. One man who uses the telephone vouring frequently, and whose payments to the Depossible, partment amount to between £ 4 0 and £ a year, told me that he had kept a check of 100 calls within the last month or two - and , as I said, this is not the busy seaunder son-and in over seventy of those cases had to wait for an hour or more before could get Sydney. On Saturdays it. is absolutely impossible to get Sydney at all. The people of Katoomba have been private person promised over and over again a telephone trunk line for their own service. There are eleven different lines cutting their line at the present time ",77
489,Mr WATKINS,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,Is the line paying?,78
490,Mr BOWDEN,ALLEGED SWEATING INTHE GENERAL,"It is, absolutely. question, Those who desire the new line offered to guarantee, two years ago, a 10. per cent, return, and the Government were so satisthe fied that the line would pay that they agreed to construct it without a guarantee. If the line I suggest be erected within next month or so, one-third of the cost will be returned during the busy season. suspense for some years. I also desire to draw, attention to fact that one man is expected to do all the repairing between, I think, Bathurst ter. and Penrith, and also to erect. all new telephones. In Lithgow subscribers have been waiting for two months, and at ferring Wentworth Falls for as long ' as four , had been done. months, in order to be connected. whole position is absolutely chaotic. The same complaint in reference to the delay in connecting with Sydney applies Lithgow line. At present the whole of the Lithgow users are put on the Bathurst which has to carry thirteen portant exchanges, including Orange, Blayney, Portland, and other centres. 'from experience that it takes pretty well an hour to get connection with Lithgow at the under it. present time.
