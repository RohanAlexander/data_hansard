Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Leo MCLeay)--by leaveagreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Watson from moving forthwith a motion relating to the Republic of Cyprus.,11
3,Mr LEO MCLEAY,COMMITTEES,"I move: That this House(1) reaffirms its total support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island; (2) reaffirms the position that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from the territory of the Republic of Cyprus; (3) applauds the contribution of Australian peacekeepers since 1964 in maintaining order and stability on the island; (4) expresses its deep concern that after more than two decades of division on the island, there is still no lasting political settlement in sight and its strong belief that the status quo on Cyprus is unacceptable; (5) reaffirms its support for the United Nations Secretary-General's long-standing efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem in a just and viable manner; (6) notes that the prospects of Cyprus joining the EU offers potential benefits for the economic development and security of the whole island and the chance to bring the communities in Cyprus closer together; (7) urges all parties involved in the Cyprus question to demonstrate goodwill and a new resolve to work actively towards a lasting and peaceful political settlement based upon the relevant United Nations resolutions, in particular resolution 939 of 1994; (8) agrees with the United States Congress that Report ultimate total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus would meet the security concerns of all parties involved, would enhance prospects for a peaceful and lasting resolution of the dispute regarding Cyprus, would benefit all of the people of Cyprus, and merits international support; and (9) encourages the United Nations Security Council to consider alternative approaches CYPRUS to promote a resolution of the long-standing dispute regarding Cyprus based upon relevant Security Council resolutions, including Orders incentives to encourage progress in negotiations. The motion will be seconded by the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). The motion on Cyprus I have just placed before the House this morning is a matter of considerable interest to all members. Last week the President of Cyprus, Mr Clerides, visited Motion Australia and met with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) here in Canberra and with a number of ministers and members of both sides of the House in Sydney and Melbourne. I was very pleased to have the opportunity to talk with Mr CIeri des and hear his views of about the continuing problems in Cyprus 21 years after the invasion by Turkey in 1974. For the last 20 years I have taken a keen interest in a just resolution for the people of Cyprus and their struggle against the Turkish invaders. For Australia, Cyprus is not just a small island in the eastern Mediterranean; it is also the ancestral home of some 50,000 to 60,000 Cypriot Australians. As members may be aware, the Cypriot Australian community is the second largest Cypriot community outside of Cyprus itself. I have had a long association with members of the Cypriot community in Sydney, and to me the cause of Cyprus is just and special. I have visited Cyprus on a number of occasions for discussions with both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and as a member of the International Parliamentary Union Committee to monitor the situation in Cyprus have continued that dialogue with politicians on both sides of the green line. President Clerides's visit was an occasion for him to appraise the Cypriot community in Australia, and the wider community, of the current situation in Cyprus, particularly his proposal for demilitarisation of the island under the auspices of the UN. It was also an occasion to highlight the Cypriot problem in the Australian press. This is an issue in which Australia should not only be taking an interest but also leading the way because we have a unique knowledge of both communities, and also because time is running out. The world has ignored the calamity on Cyprus for too long. Old conflicts such as the Cold War and new conflicts such as the Gulf War and then Bosnia have distracted the attention of the United States and Europe. Some might say it was convenient for the United States to be so distracted, because of the strategic value of Turkey on the southern flank of the old Eastern bloc and as a staging post during the Gulf War. Over the last few years, particularly since the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the former Soviet Union, one would have thought there would have been greater international interest in dealing with the injustice on the island of Cyprus. If the Europeans and the Americans have forgotten Cyprus, Australia should not. It is my intention in the House today, in proposing this motion, to draw attention to the issue of Cyprus-to put it on the agenda for the Australian Parliament, and to have our government continue the fight for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island. After 21 years, it is time for the withdrawal of all foreign troops. It is time for a lasting political settlement. It is also time that Cyprus was ruled by Cypriots, for Cypriots. The Cypriot issue is the longest running sore in Europe. It is an absolute disgrace that the international community have allowed Turkey to occupy over a third of Cyprus for 21 years. Members would recall that in 1974, after a coup deposed the Makarios government, Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus above the so-called 'Attila' or 'Green' Line, running from Morphou to Famagusta. A puppet government was established, declaring itself to be the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, which was recognised only by Turkey. In 1983, the TFSC unilaterally declared independence as the TRNC, or Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but again was only recognised by Turkey and the declaration was condemned by the United Nations. Greek Cypriots were expelled to the south of Cyprus by the Turkish occupiers in the north. Over 150,000 Cypriots became refugees in their own country. Turkey then set about repopulating the north with people from Annatolia. An estimated 70,000 settlers were imported from Turkey to colonise the north, while it seems that 45,000 Turkish Cypriots have left the island. Over 1,600 people are considered to be 'missing persons'. Over 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed in Cyprus. They are the statistics, and they are astounding for a nation the size of Cyprus with a population of around 730,000 people. Since 1968 successive UN SecretariesGeneral have been involved in convening intercommunal talks to find a solution. A so called 'set of ideas' was developed as a blueprint in 1992. The set of ideas suggests a framework for an agreement between the two communities. The constitution of Cyprus would be amended to provide for a bicommunal and bizonal federation. Confidence building and political will are central to bringing both sides together. The latest Security Council resolution last year, No. 939, reaffirms this. Today the Australian House of Representatives urges all parties involved to actively work towards the implementation of security council resolution No. 939. As a member of the IPU committee to monitor the situation in Cyprus, I am pleased to say that that committee has managed to encourage a number of small confidence building meetings between the on the island, the most recent on 25 September 1995 at the IPU Conference in Bucharest. This is encouraging, but there is still no sign of a resolution. President Clerides, in 1993 and again in 1994, wrote to the UN Secretary-General proposing a negotiated settlement through demilitarisation but, due it seems to a lack political will on the Turkish Cypriot side, there has been no progress in achieving this. In fact, a report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council in June this year noted 'the excessive level of armaments and forces in Cyprus and the rate at which they are being strengthened are a cause of serious concern.' The Secretary-General went on to note 'the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus' and called for a withdrawal of non-Cypriot forces, as described in the set of ideas. The same report noted that Cyprus is probably the most heavily militarised part of Europe. For a small country it is a disgraceful circumstance. At the CHOGM meeting last week in Auckland, the paragraph on Cyprus in the final communique again expressed support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus and urged the UN to take resolute action on the necessary measures for a speedy implementation of the UN resolutions. CHOGM also expressed full support for President Clerides' s proposal for demilitarisation and called for the speedy withdrawal of Turkish forces and settlers, as well as the return of refugees and an accounting for missing persons. Last Wednesday, 15 November, was the 12th anniversary of the setting up of the rogue state of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The thin green line separating the north and south of the island is a very real dividing line. People have been forced out of their homes, and are not allowed to return. One of the saddest things about the occupation by Turkish troops in the north is the number of Turkish Cypriots who have now left the island. The Turkish Cypriot population on the island is probably the lowest it has ever been in the history of the Turkish people political parties on the island. The city of Famagusta, one of the jewels in the Mediterranean, is deserted. Famagusta is a metaphor for this whole sorry issue. Founded in ancient times, it has seen many invasions and it has survived. But now it is barren and empty, like the resolve of Turkey to come to the table on this dispute. To stand on the of hillside overlooking this ancient city and see it windswept and deserted overwhelms you with a great sense of sadness. Under Turkish control this jewel of the Mediterranean has gone to rack and ruin. That is something that anyone who goes to see that part of the world can only be saddened by. The emptiness of Famagusta contrasts markedly with the economic prosperity in the southern part of the island. Australia does not recognise the rogue state of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. We recognise the government of the republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island. Australia has been actively involved in efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the problem, and we firmly support the UN Security Council's resolutions. Australia has contributed to the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus. Currently, there are 20 Australian policemen on the island. We have said for many years that there must be a single state of Cyprus with a unified sovereignty and citizenship. Within such a unified state, there must be political equality between the two communities and no union with any other country. In short, it would be a Cyprus ruled by Cypriots for Cypriots. A particular concern of mine for some time has been for Australians of Greek Cypriot origin who lost their property in northern Cyprus after the Turkish invasion in 1974. Last year in this House, I raised the question of these people's rights. The answer was that the Turkish Cypriot administration would accept property claims from third party states but not from people of Greek or Greek Cypriot origin. These people are Australian citizens, and they were citizens of this country prior to the invasion in 1974. They have made a claim as Australian citizens but have been rejected by the Turkish authorities. This is a disgraceful expropriation of their property. It is interesting to note that, after the ish invasion in 1974, people with Anglo Saxon names who were British or American passport holders at the time of the invasion were not treated in the same cavalier manner. It was only if your name was a Greek name that you lost your property. My family came to this country three generations ago from Ireland. It would be the same as the British authorities in Northern Ireland, from where my grandfather came, saying that I could not inherit any property there because my name was Irish. It is just a disgraceful set of circumstances that no-one is willing to address. It should be addressed urgently. If the Turkish government wants to show some form of reasonableness in this issue, it should restore the property of these Australian citizens as a show of good faith to this country, which has provided a home to many people who have come here from Turkey. A small thing such as that-for the Turkish authorities, it is only a small thing-would be a very important part of these confidence building measures. This is the background to the struggle for justice in Cyprus which has been going on for 21 years. The Australian government has not sat on its hands, but we need to continue to press the case for Cyprus internationally. With the prospect of Cyprus joining the European Union, it is surely now the time for the international community to tum its collective attention to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus and to bringing the communities of Cyprus together. We now have the terrible situation where, of two candidate countries for the European Union, one has troops on the soil of the other. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, everyone thought that the world could tum its eyes to resolving some of these other ongoing issues, thus placing Cyprus high on the international agenda. Unfortunately, it nearly gets there, and then something else comes along to take it off the agenda. There is now a window of opportunity for the world to solve the injustice in Cyprus. It would be irresponsible and immoral for us to ignore the situation in Cyprus by leaving it to the slow processes of the UN to resolve. Do we have to wait for bloodshed Turkbefore any action is taken by the international community? After 21 years there is a need for goodwill and a new resolve to work actively towards a lasting and peaceful settlement based on UN Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 939. There is a need to recognise, as President Cieri des and the US Congress have recognised, 'that the ultimate total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus would meet the security concerns of all parties involved, would enhance prospects for a peaceful and lasting resolution of this dispute regarding Cyprus, would benefit all of the people of Cyprus, and merits international support'. After 21 years, the refugees and the families of the 1,619 persons who disappeared during the conflict cry out to us for justice for Cyprus. The international community has a duty to heed that call.",11
4,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Is the motion seconded? Mrs Easson-I rise to second the motion moved by my colleague the member for Watson. I reserve my right to speak.,14
5,Mr NUGENT,COMMITTEES,"I support what the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) has had to say. The situation in Cyprus is an international tragedy. Not only does one need to look at the current situation, which the gentleman expressed and described so accurately, but one also has to ask why this problem has been around for so long and why there is so much intransigence. As with so many of these international difficulties, whether it is Northern Ireland, Bosnia, or whatever, the history goes back a long way. The underlying reason why these situations do not get resolved is probably the fundamental lack of trust, often based on good reason on both sides, which means that people cannot come to the table and resolve the problem. Cyprus has a history of conquest and minority groups. Throughout the ages it has been a staging post in the centre of the Mediterranean. In fact, I stood in Famagusta when it was a thriving and prosperous city. If you look at Famagusta today and compare it to when I saw it 25 years ago or more, there is no question that it is an unsatisfactory and unacceptable situation. I agree with the honourable gentleman: we have to take every possible step to resolve those sorts of situations. My experience in Cyprus is not as current as that of the previous speaker. I lived in Cyprus for three years from 1968 to 1971. I was there as a member of the British air force-this was after the island had independence; as we alI know, Britain retained some small territorial land there as sovereign tory-and worked at Episkopi but in fact lived in Limassol, which was in the republic. I travelled extensively through the island. Although the military action from Turkey had not taken place then, there were two clear parts of the island. You went across the green line to go from the Turkish part to the Greek part and vice versa. There were armed incidents on a regular basis, but this was before the major Turkish military action. Therefore, if you like, it was one of the better times in recent Cypriot history. Not only did I have the chance to travel and work there but I also had the opportunity to mix socially with Cypriots-I went to their weddings and I had Cypriots of both Greek and Turkish background working for me. At that stage, it seemed that there were an awful lot of problems that were going to take a long time to resolve because of the background. There have been many changes since, and I am told by a number of friends and colleagues who still maintain regular contacts and who have travelled there that I probably would not recognise much of the Cyprus that I knew. Particularly in the Limassol area, as I understand it, the economic development has been phenomenal. In Paphos, which was a little country town, you went to a restaurant to look at the pelicans. It was a quaint place, and I understand it is almost unrecognisable in terms of its development and so on. I acknowledge that I have not had recent contact with Cyprus, but it is important to understand that the background of this problem has its genesis from the days when I was in Cyprus and before. The problem very largely came to the fore after independence. When the island was divided in 1974, it was specifically triggered by the Greek directed coup d'etat. We now have this north-south divide, this Turkish-Greek divide. In 1983, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was proclaimed. Of course, that is recognised only by Turkey. It is appropriate that we do not recognise that. As I understand it, both halves of Cyprus operate under a democratic process, although they have slightly different structures, and terri- both function as free economies. But the Greek Cypriots undoubtedly are more successful. The Turkish part of the island relies very heavily on Turkey. It is important for anybody who has not been to Cyprus to understand that roughly 78 per cent of the population is Greek Cypriot and 18 per cent is Turkish Cypriot. On the whole, things were fairly harmonious until about 1959 when British independence was achieved. In fact, there have been peacekeepers there since 1964. The United Nations Secretary-General, whoever it has happened to be, has been working pretty hard to resolve this problem on an ongoing basis, particularly since 1968. It is important that we understand the terms of UN resolution No. 939. The world community accepts that it is going to be the basis on which the solution of the Cyprus problem must be based. Paragraph 2 of resolution No. 939, which goes to the nub of the situation, states: ... ""on a State of Cyprus with single sovereignty and international personality and a single citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded, and comprising two politically equal communities as described in the relevant Security Council Resolutions in a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation, and that such a settlement must exclude union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession"". Originally, both communities of Turkey and Greece signed off on that principle some years ago, but recently it would be fair to say that the Turkish and the Turkish Cypriot communities have been moving increasingly to a position of looking for two sovereign states. Secretary-General Boutros BoutrosGhali said fairly recently with some exasperation and frustration that he felt the Turkish Cypriots had shown a lack of cooperation and goodwill in resolving the problem. That problem had its generation a long time ago and has gone through several generations of people. It is based on issues that may seem remote to us today but which were very real to those who lived on the island. The situation was the same as that in Northern Ireland, where in my view one community which was in the majority treated the minority community as second-class citizens until that minority felt that it had no option but to resort to arms. I do not condone what the IRA has done, but what I am saying is that there were reasons why that pressure was applied. When I was in Cyprus and before, there was no question that those of the Turkish minority were treated in very many respects as second-class citizens. I remember talking to one of the leading Turkish Cypriots of the day when there had been a number of historical incidents. He said, 'The next time there's a problem, we will go all the way; I would rather die than have this situation continue.' The reality was that it was manifest in all sorts of ways. The reality was that, if you were a Turkish Cypriot, you were not allowed to build a house other than with mud bricks. As is the case in our country with Aboriginal people, there were little discriminations, little pinpricks, that daily caused the irritations. Very early on there was very significant Greek military power and the Turks felt threatened in the same way that today there is very substantial Turkish military power and the Greeks feel threatened. Today, one of the problems is that the Turkish side holds a larger percentage of the land than the population can possibly justify. There is the problem of refugees who have been driven out of the north and want to go back and there are issues of compensation, which the member from Watson so graphically described. There is the problem of European Union membership. Turkey, Greece and Cyprus itself are looking to attain European Union membership. It is very interesting that, whilst we condemn the idea of incorporation of part of Cyprus into mainland Turkey, which has certainly been on the agenda of some on the Turkish side, part of the agenda in my time there was enosis on the Greek side, which talked about incorporation of part or the whole of Cyprus into Greece. It is not just that today the Turks want to incorporate part of the island into mainland Turkey. Twentyfive years ago, frankly, the boot was on the other foot. It is because of that history that many of the Turks today feel threatened by some of the moves that are made, even if they are made in good faith. There is the problem of the Turkish mainland settlers who have now gone to Cyprus and are increasing the numbers of the Turkish Cypriot population. Undoubtedly, the Turks are in greater economic need of resolving the situation. The Turks feel that if there is demilitarisation they will again be swamped by the larger number of the Greek Cypriot population. The Greeks fear confederation of part of Cyprus with Turkey because they feel they will then be swamped. It is all about each side having a fear of being swamped by the other side. It goes back in history and it goes back in blood. One of the terrible things is that, therefore, both sides are spending so much money on defence, whereas they should actually be spending that money on creating a better future for the next generation on what is a wonderful and beautiful island that has tremendous economic potential. It is not easy. We do need some confidence building measures. I think I agree with the previous speaker that Europe and the European community have not taken the issue seriously enough. If over the 25 years since I was there the European community had put a bit more effort into resolving the problems, then there is no doubt in my mind that this problem could have been and should have been solved a long time ago. I take the view that if Northern Ireland can be sorted out, and it is-it has had, frankly, an even worse bloodbath history than CyAustralian prus-and if Bosnia Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia and the former Yugoslavia can be the sorted out, as we all hope and pray that are at the present time, then with international will and international commitment, we should damned well be able to sort out the problem future. in Cyprus. I think it is, in fact, one of the long running festering sores in the internationGeneral's al community which has not received its share of attention. Australia's position is to support sovereignbit ty. We do not recognise the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. We provide the UN and we do that in a very practical sense, through our police presence as part the UNFICYP force. That force was there when I was in Cyprus for three-odd years. Those policemen do an outstanding job, often in dangerous and difficult circumstances. think every single member of that force be congratulated. I had the pleasure a year or two ago attending something of a reunion of a number of those policemen. They have actually published a little book of the history of the the House. Australian police involvement at UNFICYP. They have the pictures and they know who went where when. They are a very tight knit community. Those men have served their country, Cyprus and the international comHouse, munity extremely well. Obviously because of time. I cannot go have through the motion clause by clause; I have to agree with the mover of the motion that of the things on the agenda are things we should very much support. We do need to Australians reaffirm support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus in the way it is articulated here and in the resolution. We do want to see the removal of foreign troops because the presence in fact heightens a lot of the tensions. It keeps the distrust going. It seems to me that maybe, slight qualification, having a few UN troops on the ground when the others are withdrawn might actually be a useful safety valve, as proposed in the Bosnian situation. Certainly, one supports and heartily endorses the applauding of the contribution of the peacekeepers. There is concern that after more than two decades of division on island there is still no lasting settlement. they This means that we are condemning, and the situation is condemning, young Cypriots to less than they are entitled to expect for their We reaffirm our support for the Secretarylongstanding efforts. I would like to see him be a bit more aggressive in what he is doing. We have recently seen the UN be a more aggressive in Bosnia and maybe that is necessary in the Cypriot situation as well. support for And so I could go on. But, as I say, I support the motion. The of situation in Cyprus is a tragedy. It is something that could, and should, have been resolved a long time ago. The Turkish side, certainly at the moment, needs to take a long, I hard look at its position. The basis on which is to President Clerides has offered some new initiatives in the last 12 months on the matters of that the member for Watson mentioned have been on the table for a year and are well worth supporting. I commend the motion to",14
6,Mrs EASSON,COMMITTEES,"I rise to second the motion that was so well moved by my colleague, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). Since I have come into this I have taken an opportunity to express my interest in Australia's foreign relations. I especially been interested in the question of Cyprus and other matters of great interest all to Australians of Greek and Turkish descent. The connection between the Greeks and is one baptised in blood. In this, the 50th year of the end of the Second World War, we have rightly remembered those who UN died and who served. This remembrance has been bipartisan and I think this is the way for the future of our country. We must also remember and be thankful for those not of our land who fought for us, who helped us and with a who died saving us. Cyprus and Greece are not foreign to Australia or to Australians. Our pasts are is closely connected, our presence is one of unity and our future is one of hope. These bonds between Australians and Greeks were forged for ever in the fires of the Second World War. Australian troops fought and died for Greek liberty. Greek patriots hid Australian troops from the Nazis and often paid with their lives for doing so. This blood bond is unbreakable. The Greek virtues of courage and iron determination have forged a people who will not accept defeat. The Greek people have a sense of their own dignity and self-confidence that makes them the best of all possible allies. Australia has been blessed thousands of times over by the Greek migration to Australia and, as they stood up by us in the past, so must we stand by them in pursuit of justice for Cyprus. We have intimate knowledge of the experience of both Greeks and Turks. Each of these countries has sent thousands of its sons and daughters to Australia as migrants and they have enriched our country, our lives and helped to build our future. They and we are now one. Our successful bipartisan policy of multiculturalism has strengthened Australia and Australia's tradition for tolerance has calmed the waters of ancient hostilities. I am led to believe that Australia is held in high regard by both Cyprus and Turkey and this should embolden us to offer our services for settlement of the present unsatisfactory arrangements on Cyprus. The motion before the House captures the spirit that is needed to break the present 20-year impasse. The motion recognises the integral unity of the island. We are opposed to division. The motion calls for the removal of all foreign troops. We are opposed to occupation. The motion calls for the recognition of the negotiations based on the UN resolutions. We are opposed to the continuance of the status quo. In a world of very serious political and social problems, the Cyprus problem should not exist. It came about as a result of particular problems in the 1960s and the 1970s. The world has changed dramatically since those days. Greece, Cyprus and Turkey have changed and now it is time for the problem to be resolved. In solving this problem it would be extremely useful for all parties to remove some small stumbling blocks. In particular, I can see a great usefulness in each side giving a clear and truthful account of the people who have gone missing since July 1974. We all know that dreadful things happen in the heat of battle and that we might do things that we are later ashamed of, and in these circumstances it is understandable that people may seek to hide or deny these shameful actions. The road to peace needs the problem to be removed and, however painful it must be, the truth must be told about the fate and the current whereabouts of all missing on each side. There is no avoiding this painful act of contrition. There can be no end to the war without it. This problem is, I think, a suitable field of endeavour for the religious authorities of the two communities. They can work apart from the politicians to produce a climate of telling the truth about the missing-all the missing. Another stumbling block is the various legal and property cases which exist as a result of July 1974 events. Surely a neutral legal jurisdiction can be found to begin the process of settling these cases. These problems of the missing persons and the stolen property are especially troublesome to Australians who have taken an interest in Cyprus. I have written to the foreign minister and I have spoken on every occasion concerning the 1,619 missing at the hands of the Turkish army since 1974. Whatever the merits of the Turkish invasion in 1974, those merits have long gone after 20 years. The outstanding matters of life and property must be resolved. It is improper and outrageous for anyone to use the question of missing persons as a negotiating card. The current behaviour of Turkey is not in its own interest. As for Australia, we must stand firm in our support for the justice of the Greek cause. This government has in fact been a hardline supporter of the Greek community in Cyprus and a reliable supporter of Greece in recent years. I am confident that our support will not waver in the future. Mine certainly will not. I am sure that every person living on Cyprus would prefer to have the Australian level of prosperity, tolerance and community harmony rather than their present reality of division, suspicion and poverty. Our Australian neighbours of Greek and Turkish descent have shown that it is possible for Greeks and Turks to live together. Social harmony and equality are not dreams; they can be reality. To be successful, this reality of social harmony and equity must be based on a proper policy of multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is not multinationalism. In Australia we do not have many nations; we have one nation drawn from many peoples, and these people are proud to be Australian without having to pretend that they have come from Aberdeen, not Athens, or that they have come from Torquay, not Turkey. The communities of Cyprus can also adopt a local version of this Australian success story. Biculturalism should replace binationalism. The two communities should emphasise their Cypriotness rather than their Greek or Turkish background. This going forward to a united future is easy, and its success will tum on individual decisions to do so. The past is very alluring because we invent the past and we make it conform with our current desires. This difficulty, which is very great, is not easily come, yet it can be overcome and, in Australia, it has been overcome. The Greeks and the Turks who migrated to Australia have become Australians and live peacefully here with each other. They have maintained a lot of the good things from Greece and Turkey and given these to us, and they have dropped the bad things from Greece and Turkey such as poverty, ethnic hatred and war. This process is not a result of some unique Australian genius; it is simply a result of allowing humanity, and not race or ideology, to be the arbiter of social decisions. Mr Speaker, due to the success of our bipartisan and multicultural policy, supported for 20 years by both governments and oppositions over that period, we should not be shy in making suggestions to the divided communities of Cyprus. Our success in Australia can give us confidence. When we look at the future, we see that both Cyprus and Turkey are looking for membership of the European Union. The blunt truth is that while the Turkish army sits on Cyprus Turkey will be excluded from Europe. That is the long and the short of it. The diplomats will go round and round and issue communiques galore, but that is the bottom line. The reason for this is that Europe is worried about Islam and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. If these forces rise up in Turkey, the Europeans will become even more firmly opposed to Turkey. Greece, on the other hand, is integral to Europe. The cultural and religious dimension of Greece is fundamental to western civilisation. We cannot have this civilisation without Greece. The contribution of Greece to our world and, in the past 50 years, to Australia is beyond accurate measurement. There is no part of human understanding or endeavour where the glories of Greece and her intellect have not shone. The process of thought itself would be confusion without Socrates and Aristotle. The idea of democracy would have not come to nothing except that the Greeks made it work. The life of culture, the arts and writing, the whole unity of human life, was shown to be possible by the Greek states. Even in the religious life of the world, it was over the Greek philosophical mind which made the Gospel understandable to the whole world. Our debt to Greeks is both cultural and pragmatic. The large number of Greeks in Australia has been an incredible stroke of good fortune for us. Our narrowness was broken by the breadth of vision. Our fear of the future is broken by their enormous confidence. Our national future is strengthened by their presence amongst us. The world knows of few nations of warriors and heroes-men and women who stand and fight for what is theirs by right. Our liberty is ours by right. With Greeks in Australia, our national liberty is secure. The Greeks fought the enemies of freedom 50 years ago so that we in Australia could be part of the free world. We owe them our support and this House should give it without a quibble. I mention these facts to outline the seriousness of the problems in the Cyprus area and also to point out how a solution to the Cyprus problem can have excellent ramifications Europe-wide. A settlement based on a unitary state on the island Cyprus-<iemilitarised, without Greek Cypriots longing for Greece or Turkish Cypriots longing for Turkey---could be a workable proposal. Australia can help bring this settlement about. This requires the abolition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the end of the Greek desire for enosis. If Cyprus is to be viable, the two communities must look to each other and their common island and not to their pasts across the sea. This will be difficult because it is easier to love one's family than to learn to love the stranger. Yet, if this is not done, Cyprus will have no future. The good news is that it actually can be done, and in Australia it has been done. The Australian government should not ignore our successful integration of formerly warring Greeks and Turks who have now become cooperative Australians. This transformation can be effective in Cyprus with goodwill and a genuine desire for peace. Recently, the President of Cyprus was in Australia. He received a big welcome and impressed everyone who met him. I was certainly impressed by him, especially by his evident desire for a true peace between the two communities on Cyprus. I am convinced that the opportunity now exists for a proper settlement of this problem on Cyprus. Recently, the Israelis and the Palestinians have begun to settle their problems. Now the Bosnians, the Serbs and the Croats are agreeing to settle their problems. In these circumstances, who can sensibly say that Cyprus is beyond solution? Each side of this dispute now has a very big burden to shoulder. Both sides must purge themselves from old hatreds and point scoring. They must learn to love the future, not the past. They must be motivated for the common good and not for their own factional good. This is a tall order for groups who are not normally inclined to compromise and cooperate. I would urge a moratorium on throwing up the grievances and the bitterness of the past. These sad events and attitudes are well known. We do not require any reminding. The two communities on Cyprus are well represented by their families living in Australia. These Australians, formerly of Cyprus, are a valuable resource for any effort at mediation by Australia. I would urge all Australians with any connections to Cyprus to be supportive of this motion and committed to a peaceful settlement based on one Cyprus nation drawn from two famous cultures. The qualities and the achievements of these two cultures are fundamental to the world that we have today. Sadly, the past is very traumatic and the wounds are still painful; yet the Christian Greeks are required by the highest own authority to love those who offend them and the Moslem Turks are required by the Prophet Mohammed-peace be upon him-to live in true harmony with all their neighbours. A return to the real cultural foundations of each community can only advance the cause of peace and just settlement. Such a return is the job of the writers and the artists of these communities. The true artist strives for the unity of all humanity and the true artist does not inflame community stresses. Australia is now seeing a rise in the number of artists from the communities. Perhaps the time is coming when we can see a single community for Cyprus drawn from those Australians from each of the two communities on Cyprus. We have no end of groups from each Cypriot community. Perhaps we can soon see a community based on the Australian principles of successful group living. Due to our large migration program-a program I support and will always support, because Australia will have no future without migrants-we will increasingly be involved in the affairs of foreign countries due to the large communities from these countries in Australia. This has always been the case and should not unduly worry us. What we should always do, when the circumstances permit, is draw on our national experience in absorbing large numbers of people from stressful areas of the world and in producing from them a nation of peaceful and cooperative Australians. We have a great deal to be proud of in relation to our migration program. Our pride is the property of all the political parties in this parliament. Equally importantly, the migrants are encouraged to learn from Australia-to learn our good ways and to help break down our bad ways. This bipartisan policy is a marvellous success, and all the greater when one sees the future of multiculturalism everywhere. Perhaps multiculturalism is like two-up in that you have to be a real Australian to make it work properly. Whatever it is that is required, Australians have it. The successful settlement of Greeks and Turks into peaceful Australians is a testimony to the quality of Australia and the underlying quality of Greeks and Turks. They became a success in Australia; they can repeat the success on Cyprus. This motion is an important statement by this House. All members of all communities outside this House should support it. The foreign affairs department should see, as a resource, the well integrated communities of Australians of Cypriot descent and use them in looking for a peaceful settlement. I commend the motion to the House.",17
7,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"--Politics is a strange business from time to time because, as we know, in this place more often than not politics are dominated by the party system. But there are instances where members can coalesce to support motions of true significance, in which the best interests of nation are served through what are quite sensitive proposals, such as in this motion moved by the Chief Government Whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). He is to be commended for this motion. As I rise to speak on this motion, I would also like to remark that most recently you, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, and I shared the platform at a very successful function in Perth, at which the travails and the oppression suffered as a result of the invasion and then partition of Cyprus were amongst the subjects of discussion. That function, where there were 350 members of the local community at the community centre in Northbridge, was a tremendous success, particularly in raising those types of issues in the consciousness of our local Australian community. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, and I have shared some views on Bosnia-another subject that has been mentioned by previous speakers in relation to this topic. I am sure that he, along with me, saw most recently the excellent series on the ABC called The death of Yugoslavia, in which it was quite clear that, above all else, the underlying theme behind the breakdown, the warfare and the tragic bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia was politics and power, in particular, the seeking of power to be able to exercise it over another group of people. When we look at how this particular tragedy in Cyprus has unfolded, it essentially represents another use of naked power in aggression from one people against another. There is absolutely no excuse for the occupation of part of the island of Cyprus-part of the republic of Cyprus's sovereign territoryby the troops of another nation. Quite clearly, there is no excuse for the petition and the 21 years of scandal, in the sense of the lack of action on the part of the United Nations and, I might add, more recently on the part of the Commonwealth heads of government, notwithstanding their most recent statements. Bosnia has been mentioned as, I suppose, a correlation with the continuing tragedy in Cyprus. It is interesting to note that, in an article that I found during the debates and our matters arising from the Bosnian crisis, a Serb spokesman said, 'Well, the Turks have managed to get away with this in Cyprus for 20 years. Why shouldn't we?' That particular attitude is a significant one, because it reflects the type of results that you get when the institutions that are designed to ensure world peace and to oppose aggression, occupation and military domination fail in their objectives. Bosnia was a failure, but Cyprus has been a failure for 21 years. Bosnia was a failure for almost four years, but now we are, hopefully, at the dawn of a peaceful settlement. Cyprus still remains one of the great unresolved tragedies of Europe. Cyprus is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, but it is part of Europe. It has been culturally part of Europe since ancient times. There is no doubt, when we look at the recent history of Europe and the so-called sophistication of political developments in Europe-particularly the creation of the European Union and the greater integration of the nations of Europe within the European Union-that Cyprus is one of those remaining problems, remaining crises and remaining dilemmas that requires a solution as soon as possible in order to show that we do not and will not tolerate this type of militarist occupation. It is an illegal separation that is unrecognised and is intolerable under international law but remains in place. In other words, it is a defacto division of a sovereign nation through military aggression. I mentioned earlier the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting communique. This was the final communique from last month's summit in Auckland. The communique says: Recalling their Cyprus Communique, Heads of Government once again expressed support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus. They urged the Security Council to take resolute action and the necessary measures for the speedy implementation of all United Nations resolutions on Cyprus, in particular Security Council Resolutions 365, 550 and 939. They expressed full support for the proposal by the President of Cyprus for the demilitarisation of Cyprus. They called for the speedy withdrawal of all Turkish forces and settlers from the Republic of Cyprus, the return of refugees to their homes in conditions of safety, restoration of and respect for the human rights of all Cypriots, and the accounting of all missing persons, and expressed grave concern at the continuing influx of settlers. Expressing deep disappointment at the continued lack of progress in achieving a solution, due to the lack of political will on the Turkish Cypriot side, they reaffmned support for the United Nations Secretary-General's efforts to find a just and workable solution. In this context they agreed that the Commonwealth Action Group on Cyprus should continue to monitor developments and facilitate the United Nations Secretary-General's efforts as appropriate. That is a fine statement but, in relation to the Commonwealth, Cyprus has been one of the undying sources of discomfort because the Commonwealth has failed miserably to resolve the problems in Cyprus. In the first instance, as Cyprus was formerly a British colony, the Commonwealth had a responsibility to look at the problems in Cyprus. In particular, since 1974 the Commonwealth had a responsibility to take a far more resolute stand in opposing the occupation and separation of the island. The recent history of the island has been dominated by the division of the island since the Turkish military intervention in 1974. Since 1974 the southern part of the island has been under the territorial control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern part is ruled by an autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration supported by the presence of Turkish troops. In 1983 that administration proclaimed itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus-TRNC-which is recognised only by Turkey. Both parts of the island are ruled in accordance with democratic principles affirmed through regularly held free and fair elections. But, of course, there are a number of aspects of the administration-particularly the administration of the area that is under Turkish occupation-that require resolution. The High Commissioner for Cyprus is in the gallery today. I was very moved recently to read some comments he made in a speech on a public occasion. I would like to quote some comments that he made in relation to the personal tragedy of Cyprus. These are as follows: When you wake up in the morning, for twenty one years now, and see just opposite you, your house and property being occupied by the invasion troops, when you are prevented from returning to where you were born and brought up, when every day you count the forcibly uprooted people, refugees in their own country, and find them to be one third of your country's population, when you count the missing persons and reach the number of 1619, when out of the door of your residence you hear everyday the expansionist shout of 35 thousand Turkish occupation soldiers and the noisy scream of 90 thousand Turkish illegal settlers, when your country is today the only divided country in Europe, when for twenty one years the fundamental freedoms and human rights of your people are fragrantly violated, when during all these years you have done your best and they have done their worse, then it is impossible to welcome the suggestion that you, being weak, are obliged to endorse an unacceptable situation and the invader, being strong, is entitled to continue perpetrating his crimes. It is not a matter of sentimental reaction. It is not a matter of emotional counteraction. It is a matter of survival. It is a matter of defending your freedom and safeguarding your future. If seeking freedom and justice, if the demand for respect of human rights, if our wish and will to reunite and save our country and people, are considered by some a sentimental exercise in futile and an unrealistic approach, our people shall never accept that they don't deserve a better future, they shall never be convinced that they are a second class citizens. Those poignant words reflect the human cost of a tragedy that has been present in Europe for 21 years. Sophisticated Europe in the 1990s has this divided country right in its midst; yet it has failed to do anything about it. The other aspect of this tragedy that deserves discussion is the retardation of the economic prosperity of the island by occupation. It is clear from the statistics that if you compare the two sections of the islands-the occupied section and that which is controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus-you find there is a yawning chasm of economic development or differences between the two. At present the Republic of Cyprus is endeavouring to enter the European Union to be able to provide for its citizens a continuing increase in the standard of living and to be able to participate fully in the economic activity and the economic operations in Europe. Yet because of the occupation this process is being thwarted. The Republic of Cyprus has an average per capita income of more than $US 11 ,000 and has had that for more than two years. Unemployment is running at below two per cent and it has a positive growth rate. Through this economic prosperity it has made itself eligible for membership of the European Union. Some 200,000 Greek Cypriots who fonnerly resided in the north-one-third of the Greek Cypriot population-have flooded into the south. In the section that is under occupation, the per capita income of its citizens is less than one-third of the per capita income of those who reside in the area that is administered by the government of the Republic of Cyprus. It is quite clear from the economic statistics-and these are not statistics brandished by the government as some sort of propaganda exercise; they are statistics from reputable sources-that one section is going into decline, and that is the northern section occupied by Turkish troops, and the southern section is buoyant and increasing in economic prosperity and obviously improving the standard of living of its citizens. In anOlher sense, there is an added human rights tragedy here in that those people who reside under the occupation are being deprived of the benefits of economic prosperity and development. Apart from anything else that we can urge as Australians who value economic prosperity and the right to be able to live, work and enjoy the proceeds of a higher standard of living, this must be one of our central core objectives. Finally, I want to dwell on section 3 of the honourable member's motion, which applauds the contribution of Australian peacekeepers since 1964 in maintainipg order and stability on the island. Australia has made a very significant contribution in an extraordinarily difficult situation. For 30 years Australian police have been a familiar sight in Cyprus. Prime Minister Menzies sent the first 40 Australian police to Cyprus in 1964. Fonner colleagues of mine in the Western Australian police force served in Cyprus. They served well the interests of their country and the interests of peace and trying to find a solution. It is interesting to note the ability of the Australian police to deal with the two sides in this equation. Many of the Greek Cypriots have relatives in Australia, so many of them have that sentimental and familiar contact with Australia. The Australian police are able to deal as fair traders with the Greek Cypriots. The Turkish people respect Australia's contribution, perhaps our bravery and our efforts at Gallipoli, and the reputation Australians have for being people of honour and courage. So both sides respect the contribution made by the Australian police contingent to Cyprus. (Time expired)",21
8,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEES,"It is with pleasure that I stand to support the motion moved by the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). I express my appreciation to him for bringing it forward. It is a detailed motion which covers very well the complexity and the breadth and depth of the Cyprus issue. It also proposes some constructive and positive initiatives. The cultural/religious/political clash or, if you like, the boundary dispute between the Turkish and European empires has gone on now for many centuries. The movement of Turks into Europe, the invasion of Europe by Turks and by the eastern cultures, goes back many centuries. We have seen edges and points of friction that have lasted now for many years. We are watching one of those being played out and replayed in the Balkans. In that context the role of Europe in and through Cyprus dates back to the earliest invasions and also was caught up heavily in the crusades, which are very much part of British history. Cyprus was a staging post and a key strategic centre for the Knights of St George and the various other crusaders who were involved in that struggle. Amongst the complexity of that conflict, Cyprus was a relatively minor issue. When one looks at the Middle East and the Jewish and Palestinian question and at the three-way clash in the Balkans, then Cyprus was always pushed into the background. In that context, the tragedy that developed with the Cold War meant that Cyprus became a part of yet another battle. So what had been the battle front of Islam versus Christianity, of East versus West, of the Turkish empire and the European continent became refocused to NATO versus the Eastern bloc. The importance of the Bosporus and the Black Sea became fundamental. I can recall being in Turkey in 1968 and meeting with some British personnel stationed in a town on the Black Sea coast who manned a radar installation whose function was to watch Russian movements across the Black Sea and into Russia. They were spending their time both on observation with their radar post and in training Turkish citizens to take over that function. So in a way the Bosporus and the Black Sea became fundamental to the Cold War. In that context as well Cyprus was ignored because it was not all that critical in the dimensions of this tragedy. In a way, the world stood by and let Cyprus be divided and partitioned and let it be the centre for the of tragedy that we have seen played out over the last 21 years. In a sense it is unfortunate that, opportunistically, the major powers have allowed this to occur. It is very hard to understand how we can have resolutions about it from the UN, CHOGM and the IPU that are all virtually the same. The fact that the so-called Republic of Northern Cyprus is recognised only by Turkey is indicative that the world does not agree with the situation there. It does not accept the Turkish forces' occupation of northern Cyprus and does not accept the settlement of Turkish citizens into Cyprus. Yet nothing seems to happen. One has to start wondering why that is. The answer becomes clear that in the international power plays that go on it was of more benefit to the West to allow Cyprus to be the centre of that kind of activity rather than to risk the withdrawal of Turkey from NATO and, hence, for the West to have no control over the Bosporus and the Black Sea, which was critical. I had the privilege in 1990 of representing this parliament as a sole representative at an IPU conference in Cyprus. Being in Cyprus, it was not surprising that there was some discussion about all this. The conference, amongst its other matters, decided to deal with the Mediterranean as an issue of special business. At that conference I moved an amendment to the motion that was being dealt with, an amendment along the lines of calling for the withdrawal of Turkish forces from Cyprus. That amendment was debated both in committee and in the plenary session. It was interesting to watch that debate and to watch which representatives disagreed with that concept whilst their own governments were notionally supporting that principle in the United Nations. When it got to the floor of the IPU the interplay was interesting to watch. Eventually the amendment was carried and the IPU adopted that resolution-Qver five years ago now-which called for the withdrawal of Turkish troops. Yet, five years later, we are still discussing the same issues. But the fact is that the world has now changed. We have seen the relegation of the kind Middle East question to a much lower level of intensity. We have seen in today's media the signing of some peace accord in the Balkans. We have seen the break-up of the Soviet bloc and the desire of many members of the Eastern bloc to join NATO. There is no longer the Cold War tension and the Bosporus is no longer so critical to the so-called security of Europe. The position of Cyprus has remained the same. In effect, the rest of the world's problems have subsided and the Cyprus question has now become paramount. A world that cannot solve a problem like that of Cyprus is not facing up to its issues. There is no cation whatsoever for the occupation of northern Cyprus by Turkish forces and there is no justification whatsoever for the settlement into Cyprus of citizens of Turkey. The Turkish Cypriots have a culture of their own. It is a Cypriot culture. The Greek Cypriots have their own culture. It is endemic and natural to them. I have no doubt that if it was not for the efforts of mainland Turkey there would not be an issue on Cyprus. I have no doubt that the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots are more than able to resolve their questions. In fact, we thought they had; and so did the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We thought that resolutions were being achieved. It was therefore really quite puzzling to find that Turkey seemed not to be willing to go ahead. One starts to wonder whether the problem really is not simply one of Cyprus but rather of the internal politics of Turkey. One wonders at times who is in control of Turkey and whether the Turkish military are prepared to allow the Cypriot question to be resolved. One wonders whether the Turkish military see a resolution of the Cyprus question as being a lessening of their influence in that country and whether that may change the focus on the Kurdish issue. What the world sees as a question within Cyprus may be a much more serious question within Turkey itself and where it is going. That is quite disturbing. I am sure that all the Turkish people in Australia would like to see their country stable and consolidated. Most Turkish people whom I know do not find comfort in the Cyprus issue. They are not comfortable with it, and they do not understand why it is worth risking the wrath of the world and the alienation of all the major world forums against their country for this issue. Most of them also accept and believe, as does the Greek community, that the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots are more than able to resolve these issues. One looks at the issue and starts to ponder the significance of the Turkish military in the politics and governance of Turkey. The major powers of the world may need to start to justifi- withdraw their support for the Turkish military establishment. That may bring this issue to a head. While ever the Turkish military are part of the Western bloc and NATO and are supported by the military of the Western world, that gives them both credibility and influence. I suspect that a resolution will not be achieved until we recognise that point, start talking about it and face it. The tragedy of Cyprus, the dispossessed people, the refugees, those who are missing and the tens of thousands of people in Australia of Cypriot origin does not need all that much retelling. We are all conscious of it. It is one issue that both sides of the House strongly agree on. We need to talk more about the desecration of cultural icons and monuments in northern Cyprus. We need to talk more about the treatment of some of the property that is still owned by non-residents of that partitioned country. We need to start talking much more about the human rights and the downstream rights of successive generations. As was mentioned by earlier speakers, Cyprus needs to join Europe, and Europe needs Cyprus. The same is applicable to Turkey. Look at Turkey's economic development. Unless it joins Europe, Turkey is doomed to a future of low economic growth and development. The one sticking point all the way through is effectively Cyprus itself and the way that Cyprus is treated. I do not know how we will persuade the Turkish military and government to accept the logic and fairness of the withdrawal of their troops. Settling mainland Turkish people into Cyprus is not in the interests of Turkish Cypriots or anybody else or even of those settlers. Given that there have been decades of agreement in the world about the issue, it is hard to envisage how we will now deal with it, unless we upscale our language and understanding of it. Perhaps we have been too gentle and kind. Perhaps we have been too sensitive to those people in Australia of Turkish origin that we wish to respect and treat as Australians. We need to particularly focus on the real architect of the issue. I am now quite convinced that it is the Turkish military. The real tragedy was that, in 1990 when I was in Cyprus moving an amendment calling for the withdrawal of Turkish troops, Australia and Turkey had celebrated the 75th anniversary of Gallipoli just a few weeks earlier. Seventy-five years after that great tragedy and those great acts of heroism by both Turkish and Australian soldiers, that incredibly unusual bond between these two countries was being torn apart by their differences over a small and innocent country that had also been torn apart. It is indicative that our parliamenhomes tarians, our military and our representatives were visiting Turkey to celebrate the 75th anniversary but at the same time were arguing about the removal of Turkish forces from Cyprus. The proposal by the United States Congress, item 8 of the motion, 'ultimate total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus', is probably the best answer. The proposals for federation may be the most practical solution, but the fact is that the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots are both politically astute and very dedicated to that island and that island nation. I have no doubt that they are more than able to find a resolution. They need the will of the world behind them to call for the effective withdrawal of all forces and to assist in the resolution.

9,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMITTEES,"I wish to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). The history of Cyprus over the last 21 years has been tragic. It has been a history of suffering and violation and its capacity to generate a further outbreak of violence has not been diminished. If such an outbreak were to occur, it would have a great potential to spread beyond the island itself and exacerbate the tensions between Greece and Turkey. The tragedy of Cyprus is not just a matter of international politics; it deeply involves an important component of the Australian population. Today, there are an estimated 50,000 Australians who trace their origins to Cyprus. Australia's multicultural society embraces the second largest Cypriot community outside the Republic of Cyprus itself. Of these, 40,000 are of Greek descent and 10,000 are of Turkish descent. It is important to register that Australians of Cypriot origin of both backgrounds have worked together harmoniously in Australia and made significant contributions to Australian society. They must all feel very deeply the wounds inflicted on their country of origin. It has been 21 years since the Republic of Cyprus was invaded by Turkey: 21 years since the northern third of the island was occupied by forces from Turkey displacing over 200,000 Greek Cypriots from their in the north. It is over a decade since the unilateral declaration of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the Turkish occupied zone-a so-called republic recognised only by Turkey. The motion reaffirms a total support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island. This is of fundamental importance. It is absolutely and utterly nonnegotiable. This has been a long standing commitment of Australia and the international community and is one which the coalition has fully supported. It cannot be resiled from. The Turkish invasion imposed an occupying force, but it has achieved no legal change in the status of Cyprus. There can be no recognition of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was imposed because there was an overwhelming lack of internal and international support for the Turkish occupation. The motion reaffirms that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from the territory of the Republic of Cyprus. This states the simple truth that we are long past an age when colonialism and international conquest was in any way acceptable by the international community. There can be no real resolution of the Cyprus issue so long as an invading force occupies Cypriot soil. It is fundamental that Turkey withdraw the 35,000 troops from the Turkish mainland that occupy the northern zone. The troops from Turkey are occupying Cyprus against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the population and the universal opinion of the international community. An act of force does not become acceptable merely because it is protracted. The United Nations Secretary General, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his report to the UN Security Council in June, described the northern zone in Cyprus as 'one of the most highly militarised areas in the world'. He emphasised that in the course of this year there has been a major upgrading of Turkish tanks, anti-aircraft weapons and howitzers. Military build-ups of this sort are antithetical to any genuine move for a resolution of differences. They contain within themselves the potential for an outbreak of armed conflict. They create counter-forces and arms races which exacerbate the sense of mutual distrust and antagonism. As the motion outlines, there are strong arguments for a total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus. This would meet the security concerns of all the parties involved and would enhance the prospects for a peaceful and lasting resolution of the Cyprus dispute. It strikes me as being merely common sense that, if any security guarantees are necessary, they should be supplied by international forces under the aegis of the United Nations. I believe that Australia has made a valuable contribution to peacekeeping efforts on the island since 1964, and the motion recognises this fact. Australia has an ongoing commitment to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Cyprus. Australians have served under difficult conditions and contributed to maintaining an uneasy peace. Their contribution does need to be emphasised and applauded. The United States and the Secretary-General have a critical role to play. Successive UN resolutions and successive secretaries-general have sought to play a significant part in resolving the Cyprus problem. The motion quite rightly recognises these long standing efforts. It is worth reiterating in part some of the United Nations resolutions adopted by the Security Council. In resolution 541 of 1983, the UN Security Council deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot authorities of the purported secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus. It considers the declaration as legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal. It calls upon all states to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and nonalignment of the Republic of Cyprus. It also calls upon all states not to recognise any Cypriot state other than the Republic of Cyprus. In resolution 550 of 1984, the Security Council condemns all secessionist actions, including the purported exchange of ambassadors between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership, and declares them illegal and invalid. It also calls for their immediate withdrawal. It reiterates the call upon all states not to recognise the purported state of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus set up by secessionist acts and it calls upon them not to facilitate or in any way assist the aforesaid secessionist entity. In resolution 716 of 1991, the Security Council reaffirms its position on the Cyprus question that the fundamental principles of a Cyprus settlement are the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and nonalignment of the Republic of Cyprus and that there be an exclusion of union in whole or in part with any other country and any form of partition or secession. The coalition and the Australian government have consistently supported the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus. I think there is great merit in resolution 939 of July 1994, which affirmed that Cyprus must have a 'single sovereignty and international personality and a single citizenship' with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded. It would be a state which would 'exclude union in part or whole with any other country, or any form of partition'. Despite these resolutions and despite the ongoing UN concern with Cyprus, the fact is that very little has emanated. There have been words of concern. There have been successive resolutions. There has, however, been no resolution of the issue. I would like to emphasise that the Secretary-General has criticised the Turkish government for its approach to Security Council resolution 939. The Turkish side has consistently resisted United Nations resolutions and the Secretary General's frustration with this lack of cooperation and goodwill is transparent. The motion quite rightly 'expresses deep concern that, after more than two decades of division on the island, there is still no lasting political settlement in sight, and strong belief that the status quo on Cyprus is unacceptable'. What I do find surprising coming from someone as vigorous and forthright as the member for Watson is that his usual straightforwardness and robustness-something that was forthcoming in his speech-was not actually manifest in the components of the motion itself. Perhaps the honourable member is stepping back from the past and trying to be a diplomat, but I should say that stepping out of character does not entirely suit him. In fairness to the honourable member, I should say that this was not characteristic in his speech, but the motion studiously avoids mentioning who has done what to whom. The plain fact that is not stated in the motion is that the onus does lie with the Turkish government. The Turkish government is the government that occupies Cyprus. The Turkish government is the government that has systematically acted in breach of United Nations resolutions. The Turkish government is the government that is building up foreign forces in Cyprus. The Turkish government is the government trying to assimilate the northern zone to the Turkish mainland and the Turkish government is the government that is denying return rights to 160,000 Greek Cypriots. It is undoubtedly true, as the motion states, that there is a need for all parties involved in the Cyprus question to demonstrate goodwill and a new resolve to work actively towards a lasting, peaceful political settlement. What also needs to be said, however, is that, while there are always rights and wrongs and always pre-existing tensions, irritations and triggers in every conflict, in truth and in justice, the history of Cyprus demonstrates to any reasonable person that the party on whom the overwhelming onus lies to work actively towards a lasting and peaceful political settlement and to demonstrate goodwill and a new resolve is the Turkish government. Not to recognise this is, I believe, an affront to the facts and a misplaced attempt at diplomatic politeness that threatens to defeat and undermine the purpose of the exercise. Mr Leo MCLeay-Rubbish.",26
10,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMITTEES,"You cannot just say 'parties' when transparently for 21 years one party, the Turkish government, has occupied a sovereign state. Mr Leo MCLeay-Who are the foreign troops? The Turkish are the foreign troops and it says 'the withdrawal of the foreign troops' .",28
11,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMITTEES,"I think the honourable member actually takes my point absolutely. Regarding the final point of the motion, I must say that I did not fully comprehend its meaning. Diplomacy does undoubtedly have some good points, but sometimes it leads to a certain lack of clarity. Having supported the motion in broad terms and having noted some defects in it, I believe it is important to raise some additional points. The first one is the bringing to Cyprus of settlers from mainland Turkey. The second is the matter of compensation to people who have been displaced from their properties. And there is the matter of the involvement of international organisations other than the US and the UN. I believe that it would have been appropriate if there had been some reference to the Commonwealth, because the Commonwealth has shown a substantial capacity to contribute to solutions in very difficult and complex circumstances. It has cleared the decks after the issue of South Africa and I believe that it may make a substantial contribution to the resolution of the Cyprus issue. It is time that the diplomatic spotlight was turned on the Cyprus issue; it has been too long ignored and I think this motion does make some contribution to this goal.",28
12,Mr TANNER,COMMITTEES,"I have much pleasure in supporting the motion of the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). Although, in general, I agree with the position stated on the issue by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), I do not agree with his view about the content of the motion. I applaud the honourable member for Watson for the content of the motion, because one of the mistakes often made in debates like this is that you rather brutally beat over the head those people whom you seek to persuade. It is much better that we state the position in this motion in a fairly calm, orderly and rational way rather than beat the Turkish government over the head. I do not disagree with the honourable member for Kooyong's perspective on the matters that he has raised. But I think it is much better that a motion of this nature is couched in calm language, even if that does not necessarily reflect the depths of the emotions that many people speaking on the motion feel. It is also worth asking why his colleagues in the Senate are reluctant to debate this today. It is also worth asking why, if the motion is defective, we have no amendments before us as yet. As already canvassed, the Republic of Cyprus first achieved its independence in 1960 from Britain after four or five years of both guerilla warfare and a campaign for independence, and also substantial debate and difficulties between the communities of Turkish and Greek origin on Cyprus about a constitution. It is interesting to note some of the elements of the original constitution of Cyprus which indicate the extent to which the two communities then were able to resolve their differences in order to establish a single political entity. Both the Greek and Turkish tongues were recognised in the constitution; it was provided that there be a flag of neutral design reflecting neither Greek nor Turkish origins; both communities had the right to celebrate the various national holidays of parent communities; specific positions were accorded to the different communities in the political structure; the public service was specified to be composed of 70 per cent Greek origin and 30 per cent Turkish origin; the army was specified to have 60 per cent Greek origin and 40 per cent Turkish origin; and even the security forces and the police had similar arrangements. At that time the two communities, in spite of the background of achieving independence through guerilla warfare and some conflict, were able to resolve the difficulties and establish a basis for common operation. This, in effect, only lasted some three or four years and by 1964, as a result of intercommunal conflict, the United Nations peacekeeping force was established. In the early 1970s, as a result of the military backed coup in 1974 with EOKA, the disposing of Archbishop Makarios as the President of Cyprus and the pursuit of enosis by some forces within the Greek community, the tensions between the communities increased. The situation then unfolded, of course, whereby the Turkish invasion occurred and there was the establishment first of the federated state of Cyprus, not recognised by anybody other than the Turkish government, and then subsequently in 1983 the establishment of the self-styled Turkish Republic of North Cyprus, which occupies approximately 37 per cent of the area of Cyprus and includes within it about 180,000 people, of whom now only about 500 people are of Greek origin. Roughly one-third of the population of Cyprus at the time of the Turkish invasion are now refugees, scattered across numerous parts of the world and resettled-including, of course, a substantial part in Australia. The population of Cyprus as a whole is roughly 79 per cent Greek origin and roughly 18 per cent Turkish origin. Numerous resolutions have been passed by the Commonwealth, the American Congress and the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council with respect to this issue, and they have all followed a very similar theme, the same theme that is replicated in their the motion moved today by the honourable member for Watson. These themes are broadly as follows: that the independence, sovereignty and territory of Cyprus as a single political entity should be recognised by the entire world, including, of course, the Turkish government; that the various United Nations Security Council resolutions with respect to Cyprus, namely No. 365 of 1974, No. 550 of 1984 and particularly No. 939 of 1994, the most recent one, should be implemented; that the island should be demilitarised; that Turkish settlers and the Turkish military forces, who number somewhere in the vicinity of 30,000, should be withdrawn; and that refugees should have the right to return to their place of origin in Cyprus. These points are of fundamental importance to the resolution of the Cyprus question, and I think all of these various bodies that I have referred to that have dealt with the issue consistently over this period of time support the basic principle that there should be a single state of Cyprus with a bicommunal, bizonal and federal structure of government which gives both communities proper participation in the affairs of the nation. It could be, perhaps, broadly similar to the original arrangement that was introduced which does give reasonable recognition to the rights of the minority Turkish population but does not give them a veto or control over the entire affairs of the island. In late 1994, the Australian Labor Party reaffirmed its position on the Cyprus question at the national conference of the party. I would like to read the party position on the issue: Conference reaffirms its support for the role of the United Nations Secretary-General, commends his continuing efforts to secure a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem, and expresses concern at the lack of progress in intercommunal talks reported recently by him to the Security Council. Conference condemns the continued presence of foreign armed forces and foreign military personnel other than UN forces on the territory of the republic of Cyprus, and the fact 37 per cent of its territory is still under foreign military occupation. Accordingly, conference(a) commends the policy pursued so far by the Australian government and urges continued involvement until a fair, just and viable solution is achieved; (b) calls for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops and settlers from the republic of Cyprus and for the repeal of the recessionist declaration of the Turkish republic of northern Cyprus, an act which conference considers illegal and invalid; (c) calls upon all concerned parties to resolve the Cyprus problem which would guarantee to all its citizens the three freedoms of movement, settlement and ownership; a unified independent and nonaligned Cyprus, and the right of all refugees to return to their homelands in safety; and (d) calls on the Australian government to use its influence to have the relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions effectively implemented, including Security Council resolutions 939, 550 and 541. I had a minor involvement in the production of that resolution, and I and the government stand very strongly on that position in support of the rights of the people of Cyprus, the rights of the nation of Cyprus, to those basic attributes that were mentioned there. Recent developments have been of some significance in the dispute with respect to the future of Cyprus. The structure of so-called confidence building measures that were initially developed several years ago has waxed and waned as numerous attempts have been made to produce a resolution of the dispute through the offices of both the United Nations Secretary-General and the United States. A number of fairly minor concessions have been made by the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in recent times. In July 1994, the European Court of Justice in effect banned imports to the European Union from the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus because it did not recognise any form of health certificates that were provided other than those from the Republic of Cyprus. As a result of this, the line of the northern government, led by Mr Denktash, hardened significantly, and for a period there was an apparent rejection of the proposed bicomthat munal, bizonal federal solution. Part of the response from the Turks was to negotiate a bilateral foreign affairs and defence agreement with the Republic of Turkey. Former Turkish foreign minister Soysal in August of 1994 linked the Turkish position to the decision of the European Court of Justice and an alleged lack of equality between the two communities in the proposed bicommunal, bizonal federal solution. But he did state that in his view Turkey would not and should not directly annex the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. In October 1994, President Cieri des of the Republic of Cyprus in direct discussions with the Turkish Cypriots offered to recognise some form of partial sovereignty for the Turkish Cypriot community in return for Turkish Cypriot support for Cyprus entering the European Union. I recently participated with other delegates in a trip to the European institutions and this issue was one of a number that we discussed with people in the European institutions. It is quite clear that Cyprus is well on the way to admission to the European Union. In my view, it will be a matter of only several years, and probably no longer, before it becomes a full member of the European Union. I applaud and support that very strongly. It was interesting to note that one of the key Greek European MPs that the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and I had discussions with indicated that in his view the Cyprus question was of greater significance to the people of Greece than the Macedonian question and that this was really a pressing question which the community in Australia and the Australian government should be aware of. Although most of the recent publicity in Australia on issues relating to the Greek community has tended to focus on Macedonia, he said that we should be wary of neglecting the importance of the Cyprus issue just because it has been a long standing and ongoing issue. In January 1995, the United States initiated new intercommunal talks, primarily through Richard Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, who has been centrally involved in the Bosnian resolution that has just been achieved. Subsequent talks have stalled, and the initiatives with respect to the confidence-building measures appear to be basically over. There have been more recent talks in London, initiated by the envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Joe Clark. Some recent indirect contacts, it is indicated, are of a reasonably positive nature. The European Union appointed Serge Abou as an observer with respect to Cyprus in February 1994. He reached the conclusion that the impasse with respect to the confidence-building measures and the lack of progress in resolving the situation in Cyprus are essentially the fault of the Turkish government. In this case I concur with the comments made by the honourable member for Kooyong and no doubt those of preceding speakers. The European Union has, as I have indicated, established a timetable for Cyprus joining the EU. The Australian government does not recognise the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus-nor does any other government in the world other than the Turkish government-and supports very strongly the notion of one sovereignty, a single international personality and a single citizenship for the Republic of Cyprus with some form of negotiated political structure based on the principles of bicommunal, bizonal federal structures. Australia currently has 20 Australian Federal Police personnel participating in the peacekeeping process in Cyprus. I understand that we have been there as peacekeepers since the onset of peacekeeping over 30 years ago. The Cyprus economy is remarkably healthy in spite of these problems. In 1994, it had about five per cent growth, 4.7 per cent inflation, 2.7 per cent unemployment and a current account surplus of Ilh per cent, although its budget deficit is fairly substantial. Australia's trade with Cyprus is fairly limited. We export to them about $30 million per year. This has substantially increased and consists mostly of fast ferries, which we are the world leaders in producing. Exports from Cyprus to Australia are basically minimal. I strongly support the motion. I support the initiatives of the Australian government and acknowledge that there is bipartisan support, at least in this House if not the Senate, for the Australian government's efforts to bring about a just resolution of the Cyprus problem and to ensure that the people of Cyprus, refugees in particular-those who have been forced to leave-have the opportunity to return to their homeland to recover their property and to resume participation in their nation in the normal, proper way. (Time expired)",29
13,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"The spread of those with associations with Cyprus through the Australian community has been quite remarkable. Although this motion has been moved by a city member, the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), throughout every country area of Australiain your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, as in mine-there are many who have their origins in the villages of Cyprus. Although Cyprus is a long way from us, the impact of the unfortunate continued conflict between the Turkish and Greek population there has an undoubted impact here in Australia. Very strong feelings are held, and there have been some very significant rallies and demonstrations around the point of view of the two opposing sides. I guess there are three things that I want say about the general context of the situation and the reason that I support this motion. Indeed, I commend the Chief Government Whip for introducing it. The first is that it is very hard for a country like Australia so far away to resolve the differences that exist between the people of Cyprus. It is, of course, ultimately for them. We look towards the people within Cyprus being able to resolve their problems amicably, democratically and in a way that avoids conflict. Australia's commitments since 1964 of police detachments gives us a somewhat different perspective in one way from others. I think the way in which successive Australian police detachments have performed on that troubled island has been remarkable. They have come not just from the Australian Federal Police; they have come from the police forces around the Commonwealth. Having met numbers of them, both before their departure and after their return, I think Australia can be very proud both individually and collectively of the role that the police detachments have played. While Australia has this long-term commitment to peace in Cyprus, it does concern me that today there still seems to be so little progress towards final achievement. I have been one of those who has felt long since that it is probably more within the bailiwick of the European Union than anybody else that a resolution can be found; yet we saw in the outbreak of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia how inept and incompetent the Europeans were in anything that is within their own bailiwick. For years, the Europeans have portrayed themselves as being significant powerbrokers outside their own domain. But in the former Yugoslavia, as in Cyprus, they seem to have been not able to come to a solution. I am aware that there have been various talks and there is now some potential of an independent Cyprus becoming a member of the European Union. Were that to take place, I would be delighted. It is interesting that, since early this year, there have been discussions with Greece and Turkey to establish an EU Turkey customs to union and to make sure that, as part of that, there is a timetable for future membership of the European Union for Cyprus. The establishment of a separate community in north Cyprus, and its maintenance by virtue of the military presence of the Turks, makes it absolutely critical that both the countries on the European mainland-Greece and Turkey--come to a rational agreement on the customs union that admits Turkey, as much as they make a decision regarding Cyprus. It is important that Cyprus has the capacity to become an independent member of the European Union. Hopefully, that may lead to an independent Cyprus without the military presence that has caused Cyprus so much anxiety and so much fear for future peace in the island. That is part of the thinking behind this motion. Paragraph 8 of the motion agrees with the United States Congress resolution calling for the total demilitarisation of Cyprus. That seems to be the way in which the Australian government should approach the subject. If the island were to be totally demilitarised it would not prejudice any separate entity that might be determined by the parties on the island. If the people of north Cyprus wish to retain a separate state, as they have at the moment, there is no reason why they cannot do so. Essentially, that should be a matter which is determined by the people of the island. Hopefully, the rights of the minority Turkish population can be guaranteed by arrangements which avoid the presence of some sort of military deterrent. There is no doubt that if the island could be totally demilitarised the threat of significant military forces, which the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) mentioned, would be reduced. There are two other areas where action can follow. The European Union has the capacity to apply pressure to its members. I do not believe that the European Union can justly claim to have a responsible role in world affairs if it cannot attend to its own affairs. The divisions between various ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia should not have been insurmountable if goodwill had prevailed and if discussions, rather than fighting, had been used as a vehicle to resolve conflict. Considering the resolution of the situation in the former Yugoslavia-which seems to have emerged from intervention by the United States administration under President Clinton-one might hope that a resolution might be achieved in Cyprus between the Turkish minority and the Greek majority. Whatever has happened in the past needs to be set aside. It may be that the types of peacekeeping operations to which the United Nations is committed, with American support, within the former Yugoslavia could be applied to Cyprus. I was a member of the government when Australian police were first committed to Cyprus. It is incredible that forces have been kept there from 1964 to 1995-31 years. Our bipartisan concern has always been that we should participate in peacekeeping operations wherever they might be. I have long felt that in many instances peacekeeping operations are better carried out by police than by armed forces. We do not want to be there forever. Australia has no longor even short-term territoriEuropean al ambitions. Our desire is to broker a peace. It seems to me that it would have been better if we had been able to train the people of Cyprus to undertake the peacekeeping role themselves. We need to consider the reasons why Australians still need to be in Cyprus after all this time. If there is no capacity to form a peacekeeping entity within Cyprus itself, perhaps the European Union or nations nearby could set up some sort of multinational peacekeeping police force. It seems to me that the Commonwealth may have a role to play. After all, Cyprus is a member of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has just returned from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Auckland. For all that many of us have been a little sceptical about the long term relevance of the Commonwealth following the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa and the ending of apartheid, I am still doubtful whether, from the sorts of resolutions which I have seen coming from Auckland, the Commonwealth can really claim to be a viable and effective organisation merely on the basis of the exclusion of Nigeria from membership, on grounds which I totally endorse, and its condemnation of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. It would be far more meaningful if, as in Europe, so in the Commonwealth there could be a deliberate move within the countries which are members of the Commonwealth to ensure that one of the member countries complies with what we would see as an appropriate means to establish democratic rule. For that reason it is a pity that the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting did not adopt a motion akin to that which is before this House. Had the Commonwealth reaffirmed its total support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island, it might well have given the lead and perhaps the Commonwealth could have looked to ways by which from that it could have implemented other parts of this peace process towards which the motion before us is addressed. It could be that, instead of having just a United Nations police or a police element, it might be a Commonwealth police element. After all, something similar was developed for Bougainville in order to ensure that the two warring sides there might be able to have peace talks. While I totally support the idea of maintaining Australlan police in Cyprus, it seems to me that that is not a commitment that should be without some ultimate date of termination. I support the motion and commend the idea of resolution 939 of 1994 and the processes that the United Nations has set for resolution of the conflict. In so doing, let me say that I have always been concerned about the capacity of the United Nations to implement its decisions. So much depends on the major players, particularly the US, as to whether anything is achieved. Australia does have a capacity to get behind countries like the United States in implementing resolution 939, but the United Nations itself also has a responsibility. One would hope that the collective membership of the Security Council can adopt the resolution and proceed towards stopping the potential for continued outbreaks of fighting between the Turkish minority and the Greek majority on the island. I remain one of those who would hope that there can be a democratic solution to the troubles of this war tom republic. The motion before the House shows the good intent of the members of the Australian community as much as the members of the Australian parliament. One would hope that from it the Australian government might be able to play an even more significant role towards implementing peace between the two sides. Cyprus is an important country in the Mediterranean. It is a country which has long had an association with Australia. It was, like Australia, originally a British territory. When it achieved canvassed. independence in 1959, everyone hoped that might allow it to develop freely and democratically but, as a number of speakers have said, after the assassination of Archbishop Makarios affairs there have been extraordinarily volatile. Peace does not prevail. There are many who doubt the good intentions of Turkey at this time and it is up to others to try to broker between Turkey and Greece to ensure that Cyprus can be a truly independent nation that can achieve its own sovereignty and territorial status and that the warring parties can be put at final arm's length through the demilitarisation which paragraph 7 of the motion suggests. I commend and support the motion.",32
14,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"I congratulate the member for Watson and Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo McLeay) for bringing forward at this stage this question of Cyprus. It is a matter which clearly has occupied the attention and the deep concern of this parliament and the Australian nation ever since Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island of Cyprus. One thing that disappoints me in connection with this debate is that on this occasion alone an element of partisan response has been introduced. I am sorry to say it was introduced by the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), who saw fit to criticise the good intentions and the good wording of that motion on the part of the member for Watson. He suggested that there should have been additional detail provided in the wording. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, those additional details were added in detail by the member for Watson in his contribution in supporting hi:> motion. His comments were added to in further detail by the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), by the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), by the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), and by the member for Moore (Mr Filing). All those speakers preceded the member for Kooyong, who saw fit for the first time in the history of this parliament since northern Cyprus was invaded to introduce a degree of partisan comment, which I found most inappropriate and most disappointing. All of those issues were adequately Not only were those issues canvassed in the debate in this chamber but they were referred to quite specifically in United Nations Security Council resolution 939, which is referred to again quite specifically in the motion of the member for Watson. They were also canvassed more than adequately in the declaration of the recent meeting of CHOGM. I prevail on all members of this chamber, of the Senate and of the wider community who from time to time might give their attention to this question to maintain an honest, genuine and deliberately bipartisan attitude towards it. In that way we will be able to make progress in developing the concern, the conscience and the attitude of the Australian people and avoid at that level the tragic division which has taken place in that magnificent island in the Mediterranean. I want to quote some of the wording of the United Nations resolution to which the member for Watson refers in his motion, then I want to refer to some other resolutions by the United Nations Security Council on this very same matter. Let me first quote from Security Council resolution 939 of 1994. It says that the Security Council, on behalf of the world community: reiterates that the maintenance of the status quo-that is, in Cyprusis unacceptable; We endorse that absolutely-it is completely unacceptable. It goes on: Reaffirms its position that a Cyprus settlement must be based on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international personality and a single citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded, and comprising two politically equal communitiesas part of that more recent quite fruitful consideration which has been given to this questionas described in the relevant Security Council resolutions, in a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation, and that such a settlement must exclude union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession. Paragraph 6 of that resolution says that the Security Council: Decides to remain actively seized of this matter. That was decided at the United Nations Security Council meeting on 29 July 1994. Let me read from another Security Council resolution. It says: Condemns all secessionist actions, including the purported exchange of ambassadors between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership, declares them illegal and invalid and calls for their ate withdrawal; Reiterates the call upon all States not to recognize the purported State of the ""Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"" set up by secessionist acts and calls upon them not to facilitate or in any way assist the aforesaid secessionist entity; Calls upon all States to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, unity and nonalignment of the Republic of Cyprus; Further in that resolution, it decided 'to remain seized'. I am glad that the Security Council decided that in 1984. I have just been quoting from resolution 550 of 1984 that the Security Council decided 'to remain seized of the situation'. In 1994 the Security Council decided 'to remain actively seized of the matter'. That is a little more positive. I could go back-and will, briefly-to 1983, to Security Council resolution 541 which states: Deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot authorities of the purported secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus. We can go back to Security Council resolution 365 of 1974, 21 years ago, and we can go back to Security Council resolution 367 of 1975. It is important for people like Bob Brown and others in the world community to have confidence and faith in the capacity of the United Nations to do what it alleges it is seeking to do. We have been waiting for 21 years for the United Nations to do something about this deplorable partition in Cyprus, to prevail upon 50 million Turks occupying that proud nation of Turkey to abide by the urgings of the international community and withdraw from Northern Cyprus. Is it any wonder that I am quickly losing faith in the United Nations, in its capacity to achieve those objectives which it sets for itself? The United Nations is a recognised international body representing the whole of the world community which continues to make declarations of that kind and, after 21 years, repeats the same expression. It was in 1960 that Cyprus became an independent republic. Its sovereignty and territorial integrity were guaranteed by a treaty that was signed by Britain, Turkey and Greece. In 1974, Northern Cyprus was inimmedi- vaded by Turkey. I know there was a lot of confusion, uncertainty, ambiguity and controversy about the circumstances that immediately preceded that invasion. I think that is of little concern today. The concern today should be to bring about an equitable, sensible, longlasting and honourable solution to that terrible, tragic, continuing partition of an island one-seventh the size of Tasmania, with its top northern third separated off. Everyone of good will would seek to see an honourable solution to that situation and to those problems. My visit to Cyprus occurred in 1984. That was the 10th anniversary of the invasion. My first notice of motion in this parliament followed in October 1984. No-one visiting Cyprus could help but be affected by the magnificence of that little island-its history, tradition, culture and magnificent diversity. It has a history which, unlike 200 years of European history in Australia, goes back thousands of years. Cyprus is an island in the Mediterranean, 'Mediterranean' meaning the middle of the world. Cyprus was on the crossroads of the ancient world. It was subjected over the centuries to successive invasions and occupations. One would hope that the people of Cyprus-the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots-in today's contemporary world would have been able to find a sensible and honourable accommodation one with the other so that that little jewel in the Mediterranean could be looked on by the people of the world as one island, one people and one nation. Irrespective of whether it is a federated settlement or not, there is obviously a need for the demilitarisation of northern Cyprus and the withdrawal of the Turkish troops who occupy northern Cyprus. Those Cypriots who have been forced to leave their homes and who have had their property expropriated from them should be able to return in peace and with goodwill occupy their properties and live alongside those Turkish neighbours with whom they lived prior to 1974. There is a need for all of those things to be given consideration and for those questions to be resolved. I said that the island is one-seventh the size of Tasmania. The total population of Cyprus is about 750,000. Turkey has a population of 50 million. There are 60,000 Cypriot Australians. The member for Watson, in his contribution, referred to the fact that the Cypriot population of Australia is the second largest population outside Cyprus. We have a great and historic association with Cyprus and Cypriots. Like so many people from so many other countries and areas of the world, Australia has been able to welcome Turkish and Greek Cypriots into the bosom of the Australian community. They have been well accommodated. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Dr Andrew Theophanous, and his brother Theo, leader of the Labor Party in the upper house in Victoria, were both born in Cyprus. They are very proud of their background. There are many people of Greek and particularly Cypriot extraction in Australia who are making a continuing significant and proud contribution to the development of a diverse Australian culture. The last meeting of CHOGM in Auckland re-affirmed support for the reunification, integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus. Australia's attitude towards the partition of Cyprus is uncompromising and firm. Australia gives its full support to the government of the republic of Cyprus. Australia continues to recognise the government of the republic of Cyprus as the sole legitimate government in Cyprus. Australia refuses, and will continue to refuse, to give any recognition to the claims of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Australia has condemned, and will continue to condemn, Turkey. It will continue to appeal to Turkey to withdraw Turkish troops from that continuing presence in Cyprus. Australia does this with goodwill to both Turkey and Greece. Many Turks in Australia are making the same type of honourable contribution to the quality and diversity of the Australian community as the Greeks. We want to see them living well together in Cyprus as they live well together in Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA APEC Meeting in Osaka, Japan Debate resumed from 22 November, on motion by Mr Beddall: That the House take note of the paper.",34
15,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the statement that was delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday in reporting on his participation in the APEC conference in Osaka, Japan, together with 17 other leading heads of government-presidents and prime ministers-representing all of the 18 member countries of APEC. The Prime Minister in his statement made an observation when referring to the declaration of Bogor in Indonesia when APEC was initially established. The goals, about which I will have more to say, that were established, that were set, that were stated at Bogor are of enormous importance to the future of the Asia-Pacific world, and of course that is where Australia finds itself and where Australia will continue to be. The Prime Minister said: The Bogor goals were unprecedented and audacious. The challenge for APEC this yearthat is, this year at Osakawas to put in place at Osaka a plan of action would show how the goals could be implemented. Then he added: I believe the result in Osaka was an outstanding success. So do I. I thought the Bogor declaration in the first place and the establishment of APEC heralded a new approach on the part of the 18 member countries, including Australia, from the Asia-Pacific area which we had not seen before. The Prime Minister has also made the observation from time to time that prior to APEC there was no single forum where all those heads of government and heads of state could meet together. He has made the observation that, as a result of the APEC forum, they now know one another personally-they sit together, they talk together, they dine together, they laugh together, they address the same problems together. Before APEC, there was no such forum. There were other regional forums. There were other regional opportunities. There were other multinational arrangements of various kinds. There were continuing bilateral arrangements of various kinds and bilateral negotiations around particular issues. But there was no single body with the dimension and the potential of APEC before that Bogor declaration. APEC is important because it has now provided a framework which will ensure our continuing and deeper integration into the dynamic region around us with all of the economic, political and strategic benefits which follow from that. It is of deep and long-term significance to Australia. In this context that is the important point. There are some people who have looked at the shortterm objectives and have suggested with some legitimacy-and I do not want to diminish the genuineness and validity of their concernsthat the short-term objectives appear perhaps to be less than we would have preferred. The real value of APEC, the Bogor declaration and the continuing negotiations such as that just completed at Osaka are the long-term benefits. Those 18 APEC economies already account for 60 per cent of the world's GDP which and half the world's trade. Sixty per cent of the world's GDP and half the world's trade is accounted for within the 18 countries of the Asia-Pacific region, of which Australia is one. I mention Australia's participation in this whole process and the encouragement which Australia has given throughout the process. There have been many occasions when the Prime Minister personally and senior ministers in this government in their own areas of responsibility have taken the opportunity of bringing together many of the heads of state and heads of government in those countries. There has been a significant innovating force directed from this government. In terms of population, Australia is a relatively small member country of APEC. In terms of integrity, in terms of a moral presence and in terms of the respect afforded any of those member countries, Australia stands tall. It is great to think that Australia does have an opportunity to make the significant contribution that it has been making. In his ministerial statement yesterday, the Prime Minister said: Leaders did not only talk about principles and process at Osaka. They also delivered a package of initial actions-a 'downpayment' on their Uruguay Round commitments-which demonstrates beyond question APEC's seriousness of purpose. I agree with the Prime Minister. I am also conscious of some of the reservations which have been expressed by well-informed commentators about some of these shorter term objectives. When you look at an initiative of the kind that APEC represents, you need to examine even more closely the long-term implications. What the leaders did at Osaka was to agree to draw up timetables for scrapping trade barriers ahead of next year's leaders summit in Manila. They also renewed the pledge that they made initially at Bogor in Indonesia last year that developed economies would dismantle all trade barriers by the year 2010. The 18 countries of the world which belong to the Asia-Pacific region, which produce 60 per cent of the world's wealth and which conduct 50 per cent of the world's trade, made a solemn declaration to abolish by the year 2010 all restrictions on trade. That was a historic decision if ever there was one. They said that the developing countries would reach that same objective one decade later-in 2020. Tariff cuts and the dismantling of informal trade barriers across all of those APEC economies are expected to add $25,000 million$25 billion-directly to Australia's GDP. In addition to that, the increased trade cooperation, the cuts to red tape, the opening up of all of those processes and to freeing of those trading relationships between those 18 member countries of APEC will add to the Australian community, to the Australian economy, to the pockets of Australians, to the investment decisions of Australian business and to the dining tables of Australian families another $15,000 million. In total, the benefits to Australia can be, and almost certainly will be, in today's dollar terms, $40,000 million every year-not once off but every year, continuing. So there is our long-term investment, our long-term willingness. I know there are a lot of reservations about the extent to which, the way in which and the speed with which Australia has been dismantling its trade barriers. This country depends on trade. We live by trade. We must trade, and we cannot trade with countries that put up trade barriers against Australia. Our products have to be able to penetrate into those economies. With what credibility can Australia appeal to the countries of the world who buy our products to reduce or to eliminate their trade barriers if we maintain ours? I find it difficult sometimes in my own community to discuss this issue. People say, 'We have to go back to the 1960s. We have to go back to protection. We have to go back to the tariff wall. We have to go back to that economic fortress Australia. We can be selfdependent. We can be economically independent.' Let me say quite clearly: we cannot be. What we have to do is to recognise the world reality. Ninety-five years ago, this continent went through the experience of abolishing trade barriers between what were then the equivalent of six different countries. Then we called them colonies. Today we call them states of the Australian Commonwealth, states of the Australian federation. The world has gone a long way in the 95 years since we tore down those divisions between six countries that we called colonies, turned them into states and established the federation of Australia. Is there anyone in Australia who would say now that that was a development which should not have taken place, that those barriers should not have come down, that we should not have opened up those former countries, those former colonies, to trade, to products, to production and to the movement of people from the others? That is now the way the world is moving. What happened to this continent 95 years ago increasingly will happen to the global economy. Those barriers are coming down. What we have to do, of course, is manage the way in which they come down. I believe this government has done that admirably as seen by the fact that we have been able to tear away all of the constraints on the productive capacity of Australia and to go through all of that restructuring we have gone through, since 1983 in particular. Those people on the opposition side who purport to be the economic managers, for all of the time and times they were in government before 1983, did none of that. Mr Tim Fischer-CER?",36
16,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"They did none of that. It is all right for them to interject now and to claim, as they will, before the next election what wonderful managers they will be, but it was Jack MCEwen acting for a coalition government who put up all of those barriers and, in the process of doing that, encouraged the world to put up those barriers. Australia is now better off. Australia has restructured its industry. Australia now is one of the highest growing countries of the OECD-one of the most affluent countries of the Western world. We have done that in a managed, sensible way. There have been no knee-jerk reactions. Of course there have been occasions on which we have had to dig our heels in, when the pressure has been on the government to reverse its position, to change its direction. It has been necessary for this government to ensure that the objectives it set for itself would be achieved. I suppose to a very large extent the United States holds the key to the future of APEC. Among all those economically significant countries like Japan and China, the dominating position and role of the United States may well hold the key to the future of APEC and to the future of the objectives which APEC has set. Some commentators have suggested that APEC will start to evolve like an OECD for the Asia-Pacific region. I understand what is meant by that, and I hope it does more than that. We do not want another OECD in the Asia-Pacific region. We want APEC out there pursuing the objectives that APEC has set for itself. When we do that, the whole of the Asia-Pacific region will be more viable, it will be more integrated, it will be more interdependent and, as a result, all of those other objectives that we so frequently set for ourselves will be better achieved. (Time expired)",39
17,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"It is almost as if the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) was dropped in at short notice to give that particular address. I welcome his more generally stated support for trade. I would say in passing that he miscasts the very wise leadership role that Jack MCEwen gave to this country, particularly in pushing through the Australia-Japan trade treaty in 1957. I am sorry to say-as he is a good friend of mine-that he also ignored the role between Australia and New Zealand established by CER, the closer economic relations agreement, which was spearheaded by Doug Anthony when in government. We were moving with the times and ahead of those times-in fact, Malcolm Fraser and Doug Anthony provided the basis from which further developments have flowed, and I acknowledge those developments. I am happy to respond to the APEC statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and I do so holding in my hand a copy of the Prime Minister's statement and a copy of a statement from the NFF, which I quote in part: ""Trade liberalisation is surging ahead, but domestic reform has hit a brick wall and the Federal Government must act quickly if Australia is to remain competitive"", the President of the NFF, Mr Donald MCGauchie, said today. I agree with that. I also have in my hand a book, which I commend to members of the House and elsewhere, from the Australian Council for Overseas Aid written by Geoff Atkinson, which summarises APEC as winners and losers, as they see it, and ends up with some recommendations, but points out, quite reasonably, that there are knock-on effects of trade liberalisation, particularly with subsistence farming and the like, and that these are matters which cannot be ignored as we work through the onward momentum and the advantages overall of trade liberalisation. In the final wrap of that Bogor declaration this time last year, there seemed to be an almost overwhelming sense of optimism that major breakthroughs had taken place at that point. Indeed, if my memory serves me well, the Bogor outcome was described as the equal of the Bretton Woods agreement, the launch of the World Bank and other great turning points in world history. But what happened? Within months chinks began to appear in the APEC fabric, with widespread concern being expressed in the region that as the processes moved from Bogor to Osaka the opportunity for APEC to lose momentum was a real prospect. Japan's ability to lead APEC into the action phase came under question; ongoing spats between the USA and Japan and the USA and China on market access were a potential threat to the very fabric of APEC; and Malaysia's determination to elevate its East Asian economic caucus could also have been divisive. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: is it not against the standing orders for a member to read all of his speech?",39
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"No, I don't think so. I think it is a very accepted practice in this place. There is no point of order. Mr Robert Brown-Is the Leader of the National Party reading his speech?",40
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,I said there is no point of order. The member for Charlton will resume his seat.,40
20,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Even this government, through its Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan), was reflecting on the prospect of whether agriculture was going to be slipped out of the Bogor declaration, and there was a move by Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan in that regard. I welcome the initiatives outlined in the action agenda agreed to in Osaka. The agenda provides a blueprint for the future of APEC. I believe that if APEC is to be the pacemaker in global trade liberalisation, and indeed emerging as such, then it is important that the region's economies commit themselves to principles of comprehensiveness, world trade organisation consistency, comparability, nondiscrimination, transparency, flexibility and cooperation. It is equally important that the region's liberalisation agenda be accompanied by a timetable to achieve the long-term goal of open trade and investment. We have visited many of APEC's attributes in the past, and we recognise that it is a need of this parliament to get the right balance with regard to assessing APEC, the future of APEC, the achievements thus far with APEC, and what the practical outcomes will be flowing from APEC. I know my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson) has studied in detail aspects of this and will have more to say about this and the way that some of the outcomes of APEC have been presented one way at the international level, quite differently in Singapore and quite differently in Japan. I welcome his presence here today. In that context, I welcome the range of trade and investment facilitation initiativesinitiatives that will result in benefits flowing through to the business community. The removal of non-tariff barriers is particularly welcomed because I would argue that, while tariff reduction is a more explicit process, often tariff reductions are replaced by a more subtle form of market impediments well known to members on both sides of the House. If we can arrive at undertakings that would see the abolition of those forms of barriers to trade, the region will benefit enormously by such streamlining. I make a similar observation in regard to standards and conformance. As the Prime Minister has said, the harmonisation of customs procedures will also be of considerable benefit to Australian business. While I share the Prime Minister's hopes for APEC in the future, from a regional perspective there are, I suggest, several outstanding issues which should not be forgotten, which should be placed in perspective at the outcome of the Osaka summit. Those issues will continue to challenge its development, and I think that it is process does temper the Prime Minister's optimism. While the vexed question of agriculture was resolved, and Japan's leadership remained intact and so on, I am concerned about the fragility of the very foundations of the APEC forum, especially in the context of disputation and working through disputation problems. The point I want to make is that, it seems to me, if there is to be substantive cooperation among Asia-Pacific governments as they move towards the ambitious target set at Bogor-20lO, 2020-and ratified at Osaka, there will need to be a high degree of mutual respect and confidence. It has to be said, when we look back over the record of regional disputation, that that sense of trust does not yet fully exist. Progress has been made, but we are not by any means in the end game. To create the condiplace tions in which serious practical cooperation on facilitating or liberalising trade and investpolicy ment can be expected, all Asia-Pacific govsequence ernments in my view will need to work together on at least two urgent issues: create confidence about the capacity willingness to accommodate China-{)bviously a very large player in the first half of next century and obviously a very large player already today-in the world economy; and to change the way disputes about trade policies are dealt with by Asia-Pacific governcapable ments. It is undeniable that the frequency and severity of disputes about trade policy, and the practicalities of trade policy between US and its major East Asian trading partners, have increased in recent years. There appears to be a growing tendency for the US to link trade policy with issues including labour rights, environmental policy and political matters such as the definition of human rights. Moreover, the USA seems to prefer to seek reform of trade policies it perceives to be prise. unfair by threats of retaliation under section 301 of its own legislation, rather than using the dispute resolution mechanisms available elsewhere, most notably with the WTO. These tendencies, and the disputes arising from them, create uncertainty and, as emphasised strongly in the 1995 report of the APEC of Eminent Persons Group, they are making very difficult to achieve the degree of coopereconomic ation which will be needed for the APEC process to succeed. While goals, and indeed the achievements of APEC since it has come into being, are be recognised, they count for little if their efforts are undermined by disputation driven by domestic political agendas. The inclusion and the endorsement given to dispute mediwhich ation I would propose is critical to the longfactured term stability of APEC. It is a matter that requires considerably more attention to estabtheir lish very clearly the proper processes on dispute mediation. Accordingly, I suggest that for the Philippines meeting in 1996-the next APEC summit, already scheduled for Subic in last quarter of 1996-it would be useful to on the agenda a proposal for an APEC code of practice for the settlement of trade disputes that will have, as its core, a of provisions that would produce an orderly way of resolving trade policy disto putes-and far more orderly than recent and outbreaks in the course of this year. . The Prime Minister has spoken in his the statement of the advantages that Osaka will open up to Australian business. In a systemic context, perhaps he is technically correct. All the actions contained in the action plan are of delivering, potentially, major opportunities to business across the whole spectrum. I acknowledge the contribution that has been made by all of the leaders participatthe ing in the APEC process to date. But, realistically, I think that the Prime Minister is misleading us, because no matter what initiatives are put in place in the APEC context and no matter what bold actions are taken by APEC economies, if they do not put runs on the board then we really need to ask what benefits will accrue to Australian enterI personally take exception to the Prime Minister's assertion that there was a real win for Australian farmers in the Osaka outcomes. There was a potential win for Australian farmers. I welcome the efforts made and some the advisings given in this regard, but all it of that has to be matched with microreform and further progress right here in Australia. All of that has to be matched with removal of the taxation structure impediments and other factors which militate against Australia being able to cut the to mustard competitively at the international level and compete effectively across the wide spectrum of goods. I do not mean just primary industry goods but the many services Australia today exports. Other manugoods, including Australian whitegoods, have a very tight situation to face with export efforts and have a series of tariff concession applications raining in on them, which are administered in a hostile way too often by the Canberra bureaucracy. All of these things militate against the the fundamental strength and momentum of the exports of whitegoods from the likes of Email in Orange, in the electorate of Calare, to Asian nations. Nevertheless, against those odds, millions of dollars of Australian whitegoods are being exported to Asia, to the world, and making the grade, but they are doing so in very tough circumstances and with a very fine margin. Unless this country gets fair dinkum about completing the processes of micro-economic reform, we will not succeed in gaining the full potential that can flow from the diversity of export effort now available-right through to the ostrich industry, which met very constructively here in Canberra this week. There is the alpaca industry at one end of the diverse spectrum, and at the other is the export of high-tech ferries from Hobart to Holland and beyond. On that matter, let me add that the corporate tax rate is definitely relevant. The most recent increase in the corporate tax rate has once again closed up the gap in our competitiveness with so many of the key Asian countries with which we have to deal. They, too, have put a down payment in. You must acknowledge the down payment that China, in particular, and Korea have made as part of the APEC process, with their hundreds of items of tariff reductions tabled as part of the Osaka summit. Singapore has a tariff-free spectrum, but I remind the House that Singapore also has a categorisation and classification system of assessment of, for example, those same whitegoods. For instance, if Email seeks to change the colour of a washing machine it is exporting from Orange through to Singapore, it has to go through a whole classification process and inspection process with regard to the motor in that washing machine and every other aspect---even the electrical system-just for the sake of a change of colour of a particular product. These are non-tariff barriers which I hope the spirit of APEC will now strip away to allow the fulfilment of the trade potential that exists between Australia and Asia and between Australia!Asia and Pacific countries. Finally, I think that it is remiss of the Minister to make no reference in his statement yesterday to the host nation Japan and the Japanese government for their facilitation of the Osaka summit. Ms Crawford-They are mentioned by name: 'This meeting was a very great success for Prime Minister Murayama and the Japanese government.' There is a whole paragraph-half a page.",40
21,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I think that should have been more fulsomely put forward by the Prime Minister in his statement in terms of the whole aspect of giving a comprehensive response to the role that was played by the host nation, more than that indicated by way of interjection. It is very clear-cut that there is a lot more work to be done on the APEC agenda. I give credit where progress has been made. I acknowledge the contribution of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade in that regard. (Time expired)",42
22,Mr HORNE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Let me say in true bipartisan camaraderie that I rise to support the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on APEC, and it is a shame that we could not be joined by the other side. There is no doubt that the meeting that took place in Osaka last week was truly historic and offers enormous potential for Australia. Sure, it does not deliver, in concrete, increased trade; it does not deliver increased markets; but it does deliver potential and it does mean that our producers will have increased opportunity to participate. I would also like to say that I take pride in following my colleague the honourable member for Charlton, the Hon. Bob Brown. He is a noted economic spokesperson, and I cannot think of anyone more suited to lead the statements by the government in this particular case. He is a former chairperson of the caucus economics committee; he does understand international trade better than do most people. There are a number of important issues that we should consider about the APEC meeting last week. Let us just review a little of the history of APEC, because I can assure you that we on this side of the House are extremely proud of the fact that APEC essenPrime tially is an Australian initiative-it is an Australian government initiative. APEC was inaugurated in January 1989 at the initiative of the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and the first meeting of 12 economies was held in Canberra in November 1989. In 1991 at APEC's third meeting in Seoul, the Republic of Korea was able to negotiate the entry of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan; in 1993 Mexico and Papua New Guinea joined; and at the Seattle meeting in 1993 Chile was accepted, joining in November 1994 and bringing the membership to its present level of 18 countries. The important thing about these 18 countries is that in the APEC region we have a population of some 2.2 billion people and a total GDP of $USI4Y2 trillion, or almost half of the world output. Australia has the good fortune to be a part of that organisation-not only part of it but also I think we can say quite fairly that we helped to make it succeed; we helped to bring it together. Before I go on, I would just like to point out that there is no doubt that the participation of the Japanese government, of the Japanese Prime Minister, was important and the initiatives that they took. I think it was fairly significantly recognised by the Prime Minister because I note that in his speech he said: This meeting was a very great success for Prime Minister Murayama and the Japanese government, especially MITI Minister Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Kono who were most directly involved. Japan's leadership was very important in helping to shape this outstanding result, and I ... congratulate them on it. I am not sure what the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) really wants in a statement. But, personally, I think that that does indicate the part that the J apanese people played. APEC's share of world trade has risen from 36.2 per cent in 1980 to over 45 per cent in 1994. This is largely as a result of East Asia's strong export performance. In the five years to 1994, APEC exports grew at a trend rate of 9.6 per cent annually, and that compares with total world exports which have increased at an annual rate of five per cent. As I said previously, we are indeed fortunate that we are aligned, that we are a driving force, and that we are an industrial nation belonging to what is going to become the largest trade bloc in the world economy. As an initiator, of course, we stand to receive significant benefits. Osaka was the meeting that had the principal objective of developing concrete proposals to achieve free trade, and it has done that. In the lead-up to the meeting many fears were raised that some countries-principally Japan and China-would not be able to support the proposals mainly because of traditional trading patterns, particularly with their rural economies. Fortunately, commitment won through and Osaka will go down in history as an outstanding success: as the starting point; as the place where the foundation was laid for the 21 st century of trade which will revolutionise the Asia-Pacific region of the world. The success of APEC ensures that the 21 st century will commence on a basis of cooperation and promise for all participating nations. The growth of these regions will ensure the expansion of markets, particularly for Australia's rural sector. I know that in my own electorate of Paterson a number of companies are already exporting produced foods to South-East Asia. One company manufactures margarine and is exceeding expectations. I am very pleased that, through Working Nation and through our area consultative committee in the Hunter region, there is a trial plantation of green soya beans. Funded by the federal government, a local farmer is experimenting with a number of different species because we believe that this crop has enormous potential for export to Japan. These soya beans are eaten as a green vegetableessentially as a replacement for peanuts-by the Japanese community. We have the potential to realise something like $2,000 per tonne on this product. Mr Robert Brown-You can take a lot of credit for that, too, because of the support you have given it.",42
23,Mr HORNE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Charlton for his interjection. It is amazing what you can do with cooperation. The APEC conference in Osaka also saw some major changes to the level of tariff reductions by the large economic powers. As a nation we have traditionally hidden behind tariffs. We have encouraged growth of our industry because of tariffs. I know that in my own electorate we have one of the largest fabric manufacturers in Australia. I refer to National Textiles which employs over 500 people. That company enjoys significant tariff protection. Obviously, these are some of the problems that we will have to face up to as tariffs are withdrawn. Tariff protection in other countries for the things that we can produce-and which we are extremely competitive at producing-can be a downside. However, the expansion of those markets will more than compensate for the loss of some of the local markets that we enjoy. Japan has committed itself to accelerating its reduction in tariffs beyond the Uruguay level of reductions by years. Japan is reducing tariffs on over 700 products at a value of ¥1 0 billion and is including a substantial package of deregulation with major cuts being made in areas such as textiles, chemicals and steel imports. China has also showed its commitment to APEC by announcing that it would substantially reduce tariffs on over 4,000 goods and eliminate import control measures on 170 tariff lines, resulting in a reduction of no less than 30 per cent. This is to commence by 1996. The APEC summits have encouraged the announcement of commitments from many of the Pacific rim nations to lower tariffs. Countries such as Singapore are opening up to imports. Malaysia has recently announced tariff reductions, while our own nation is bringing down tariff levels to 2.9 per cent by the year 2000. When the Prime Minister reported to caucus on Tuesday, I had the opportunity to ask him a question.",43
24,Mr SLIPPER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,Tell us what he said.,44
25,Mr HORNE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The honourable member is rarely awake when he is here, but I am pleased to see that he is awake and listening. One of the major problems that Australian exporters have with countries such as Japan is the distribution of the goods once we get them there. Many potential exporters have told me of the problems they have in getting someone who is prepared to sell their goods. If it is not a Japanese importer who buys in Australia and then distributes, then most likely the Australian product will not be sold. I pointed this out to the Prime Minister, and he assured caucus that there will be an expanded opportunity for Australian producers to participate directly in the markets of these countries. Australian beef is a classic example. As a beef producer, I am concerned that beef producers do not get a fair return for their product. When you go to Japan, you see that a product which may be selling for $7 or $8 a kilogram in Australia is selling for many times that amount in Japan. Yet the Australian producer is finding it extremely difficult to make a profit in producing that commodity. The profit is not being made by Australian companies; it is being made by the vertically integrated Japanese companies, which are engaged in growing, slaughtering, packaging and transporting, and in selling machinery. Australians have to accept the challenge. They have to say, 'The market is there. It is not going to come to us. We have to go to it.' What the APEC summit has spelt out for Australia is increased jobs and income for the next 20 to 30 years. Analysts expect that the APEC summit will produce a $40 billion boost to the Australian economy, creating over 500,000 new jobs in the next two decades. Trade liberalisation will contribute $25 billion; the cutting of red tape, through the cooperation that is engendered in the APEC agreement, will provide another $15 bilLon saving for Australians. Real income is expected to increase by 6.8 per cent, due to regional free trade by the year 2020. In the APEC region the flow-on effects from the previous Bogor conference will see the income of APEC members increase by 3.8 per cent, or about $US745 billion. These forecasts have not taken into account the full effect of the developing nations in the region. China's demand for grain is growing so fast that its estimated shortage within 15 years could be three to six times Australia's current annual wheat production. As a close neighbour with a strong, secure agricultural sector, Australia is ideally placed to benefit from China's food requirements, and from a general shortage in food production in the Asia-Pacific region. The President of the National Farmers Federation, Don MCGauchie, has said that farmers stand to generate another $2.9 billion a year from more liberalised trade as a result of the APEC agreement. This is on top of an extra $1 billion in export income expected to come from the earlier Uruguay Round of international trade talks. At present APEC exports account for 77 per cent of Australian merchandise exports, rising from 66 per cent in 1985. At present Australia is engaged in several large infrastructure projects in China, includfor ing working on a light railway system. I know that Goninans in Newcastle is a major player in the production of rolling stock, and there is no doubt that the APEC agreement is welcomed by them because it means that firms such as Goninans which are involved in heavy industry-and I know it also participates in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile-will receive benefits. There will be additional workers in both Newcastle and in the electorate of Lyne as a result of APEC. (Time expired)",44
26,Mr SLIPPER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"As all previous speakers in the chamber have indicated, both sides of politics strongly support the APEC arrangements. Members opposite seem to have put a gloss on what has been achieved in reality. The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home), who spoke a moment ago, has perhaps hit the nail on the head when he said that APEC offers great potential for Australia and we certainly hope that that potential comes to fruition. There are a number of obstacles in the path of that fruition, and we hope those obstacles are progressively overcome so that the wonderful goals of APEC will be achieved and the many benefits that we all would like to see happen do occur so that the Australian economy and community are benefited. As was said yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the coalition welcomes the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in relation to APEC. The coalition is totally in agreement with the objectives of APEC and certainly the objectives of the government in relation to trade liberalisation. There has been over many years a period of dialogue. Many countries have had individual problems with some of the goals of APEC, and those discussions have resulted in bold declarations. We had Bogor last year and more recently we had Osaka. Unfortunately, as yet, we have not seen anything tangible to benefit the Australian economy from APEC. We continue to be offered more hope, and we welcome that hope, but we look forward to achievements of substance and positive tangible benefits to reward Australia and other countries participating in the APEC process the taxpayers' dollars that have been spent on APEC to date. The statement of goals and objectives of the leaders of APEC is welcomed warmly by the coalition, but I must say that I have concerns that what happens is that leaders gather, they make bold declarations and they go away feeling warm and fuzzy. The proof of their success, however, will be in what is ultimately achieved by the end dates of 2010 and 2020. We have noted concerns by Australian exporters that other countries have not been as open as we have in relation to trade liberalisation and I hope that those matters are addressed. It has been said that freer trade has been one-sided and that some Australian producers, particularly primary producers, have been disadvantaged. It is not contested by anyone that the Asia-Pacific region is indeed the fastest growing, the most dynamic, part of the world and we are fortunate to be geographically situated in this region. It ought to be noted, though, that the fact we are situated in the region does not automatically entitle us to the benefits that should flow. As was indicated by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fisher), we have to participate in the process of micro-economic reform; it is obvious that the government has been dragging the chain in relation to micro-economic reform. Although we are geographically located in the Asia Pacific region, this of itself will not be sufficient to make sure that we participate in the benefits of the APEC process. We have to perform domestically, we have to become more competitive, and I think decisions made by the government in recent times have indicated that the government's commitment to micro-economic reform has flagged substantially. It is a matter of concern that, while the proportion of world trade in the APEC area continues to grow, Australia's share of East Asian exports has dropped 20 per cent in the last 10 years. These points were highlighted only yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition. We are not proud of these facts. They are a tragedy. Since 1983, Australia has lost market share in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. Our merchandise trade surplus with the APEC region has actually declined, Mr Deputy Speaker-and I can see that you looked shocked at this-from $5.8 billion in 1990-91 to $1.8 billion in 1994-95. That is a reduction of $4 billion in four years, and one would hope that the government is going to look seriously at that major problem because we ought to be encouraging the growth of our trade into this region. The fact that our trade surplus has been cut back so dramatically, particularly at a time when we have such an ongoing trade deficit, is something that the government must look at. Last year, I was privileged to visit Singapore as part of a parliamentary delegation, and I was impressed to see that Australia had a very large proportion of dairy products being sold through supermarkets in Singapore. I am told that some 60 per cent of dairy products sold in Singapore comes from Australia but, of course, there should be more. When one looks through stores in Singapore, particularly supermarkets, one finds that we are not the food basket for Asia to the extent that we should be. Collectively, we as a community must do more to trade into this area. I know the government would certainly like to see our trade exports increase into East Asia, but the result has been that, over four years, our surplus has dropped by some $4 billion. Instead of going in the right direction, we are going in entirely the wrong direction. I represent part of the South Burnett, an area which is getting a new wine industry under way at the moment, and I would like to commend the wine growers and the wineries which are being established at this time. But it is a matter of concern, when looking at wine consumption in East Asia, that French product seems to be sold much more often than the Australian product does. We need to get into that market and do better than we have indeed been doing until the present time. The Bogor declaration was an important milestone. At that time, the APEC economies committed themselves to the goal of free and open trade in the Asia-Pacific by 2010-at the latest-by industrialised countries, and by 2020 by developing countries. Of course, we support this, 100 per cent. It is an ambitious aim. A lot of people talked about the Osaka summit this year and how certain countries wanted to opt out in relation to various areas, including agriculture, but I am pleased that an agreement was reached at Osaka to say, in effect, that there would be no backsliding and that the end dates of 2010 and 2020 would remain. We, of course, support those end dates, but I hope that what was said at Osaka was not merely a form of words. The proof will be in the pudding. At present, there are not sufficient guarantees to ensure that countries, in fact, meet these deadlines or, indeed, that appropriate progress is being made. Certainly, plans have to be brought forward over the next couple of years, and I hope that those plans will be real and genuine. We seem to find that on many occasions these meetings are talkfests. Forms of words are found which are ambitious and which would, if implemented, certainly be wonderful. The proof will indeed be, as we approach the years 2010 and 2020, whether those bold declarations can be brought to fruition and to reality. The APEC economies are very important to the world. For instance, the 18 APEC economies have some 60 per cent of the world's GDP and half of its trade. Australia is, as other speakers have said, fortunate to be in this geographic region and part of APEC. If the declarations which have been made are implemented, obviously we will benefit substantially. It has been suggested that we will benefit to the extent of some $40 billion each year extra income and the government has also claimed that an extra 500,000 jobs will be barriers. created. Everyone here would welcome the extra $40 billion of new income to Australia New Zealand. and 500,000 new jobs. These are government estimates and I have no reason to disbelieve them. But what we must appreciate is that will not see the $40 billion in extra income and the 500,000 new jobs unless those end target dates, of 2010 and 2020, are met. The trade liberalisation should contribute some $25 billion and the cutting of red tape will contribute a further $15 billion. Those two figures add up to the $40 billion. As I said, the coalition welcomes these benefits. We think they are absolutely vital. If we are elected to government at the next election-and we will be-we will towards these end targets of 2010 and 2020 because this issue of trade liberalisation is important for it to be a partisan issue. It is a partisan issue. The Prime Minister spoke this place yesterday, the Leader of the sition welcomed the Prime Minister's statesome ment, and everyone in this place is committed to the principles agreed on at Bogor and those at Osaka. But what we want is to see firm and strong progress towards the achievement of those principles. The eight principles which have been enunciated include WTO consistency, comparability, non-discrimination, transparency, standardisation, commitment to move together in the liberalisation process, and comprehencountry sive coverage of all sectors and issues. the Prime Minister, I was particularly pleased that the agricultural sector was not excluded. There had been suggestions that agriculture was to have been cut out of this Fortunately, the government and other governments agreed that there ought to be no sliding in this area--or, indeed, in any other area. So what we have is this bold declaration countries throughout the world of a statement of principles that everyone here supports. Yet the problem is that, until now, we have not seen any tangible benefits of APEC. We hope that those benefits will flow through to the Australian economy. It is interesting to note in that Australia has been one of the most gungho countries talking about removing trade Yet, during this process, it unilaterally reneged on an open skies agreement with The reality is that whatever the Bogor commitment, whatever has been decided in we Osaka, each country in APEC will have a continuing obligation to meet those deadlines and objectives. It is important that individual countries do not play their hands as they see fit. It is important that countries come forward next year with appropriate plans on how they are going to move towards the end dates of 2010 and 2020 because this trade liberalisation, if it happens, is of enormous benefit to Australia. We hope it happens, and it is important that everyone work towards its fulwork filment and its achievement. We believe that the declaration at Osaka, too while certainly welcome, did not go as far as not it should have. In fact, the government itself in would have liked to have seen it go further. OppoFor instance, the Commonwealth wanted quantitative measures and milestones to keep countries honest in delivering on their pledge, and a firm agreement ruling out any rises in protection. Other countries waflted more to be included in the final declaration, but those other countries were not successful either. The United States, for instance, wanted a specific timetable for full implementation by 2010 and 2020. Others suggested that each bring forward its trade openings under Like the Uruguay Round, that the non-binding investment code become binding, and so on. But all of those matters were not included in the final declaration, so what we have is a process. very fine form of words. There was a wonderful sense of progress backlast year at Bogor. We support what was achieved there. We applaud the contribution made not only by this Prime Minister but also by by other leaders. We applaud the contribution made by earlier Australian prime ministers, because this aim of global trade liberalisation has been one of those great bipartisan issues in Australian politics. We appreciate what done at Bogor. We compliment the particiWar pants at Osaka. But what we want to see movement towards the achievement of those objectives. Having found a form of words, I hope that we will not find, some time down the track, that the participants will be allowed to renege. So the government, until the election, and then the coalition in government after the election will have to watch very closely make sure that we do indeed build some accountability into this process. Many countries, of course, could take the view that 2010 and 2020 are a long way away and therefore it is okay to sign, as it is imfailed, portant to be seen as being a good internawho tional citizen. But we need to make sure that those end dates of 2010 and 2020 are met. We have to ensure that there is clearly fined progress towards the achievement of those end dates, because it would be a tragTim edy, not only for Australia, not only Australian producers, not only for the Australprinciples Ian community but indeed for the entire world community, if the achievements which have hearts, been trumpeted at Bogor and Osaka in fact brought to fruition.",45
27,Mr LATHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"By any measure or understanding of Australia's best interests, APEC and the Osaka action agenda are irresistibly logical and irresistibly good. A small trading nation like Australia will not find an economy of scale on its domestic market of 17 million people cient to sustain all industries in all parts the economy. Nor will such a small market ever produce sufficient private sector competithe tion-the competition, continuous upgrading and innovation needed for a prosperous domestic economy. Australia's solution, Australia's future, is reflected in the APEC agenda: to continue open our markets to international competition as the catalyst for dynamic industry upgradbut ing; and to seek success and penetration on global markets, finding competitive advantatime. ges and an economy of scale beyond the of limits of our small domestic market. This is, of course, the model and the formula for success that has been developed by small weaker. was trading nations around the world since World II, most notably Italy, Sweden and is Switzerland in Europe and in Asia the Asian tigers, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. It is very important in this debate to acknowledge that Australia's development and emergence as a world competitor, according to this model for small trading nations, was delayed and retarded by successive coalition to governments after World War II. It was more delayed and retarded by Menzies, MCEwen and Fraser with the crude, failed, isolationist policies of coalition government through the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s; the crude, protectionist policies of those opposite really have not reformed themselves. I am amazed in this debate to hear the deLeader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Fischer) and other coalition speakers for saying that they fully support the APEC of free trade in the region. This is bunkum; this is hypocrisy. It is not in their it is not in their heads and it is not in are not their public comments. Mrs Bishop-What rubbish.",48
28,Mr LATHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"For the reference and information of the member for Mackellar, it is certainly not in their discussion in the party room. I noted a very interesting piece in the Australian newspaper, subsequently consuffifirmed, from 6 November. An unnamed of National Party member-I trust it was not you, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile-referred to Leader of the National Party, the shadow minister for trade, and said: I don't know whether it's lack of intellectual capacity or lack of intestinal fortitude or both. to I know there are some slow learners in the National Party, none more so than its leader, we on this side of the House have known the answer to that question for a long, long It is both. When it comes to the Leader the National Party, it is a lack of intellectual capacity and a lack of intestinal fortitude. He is both dumb and dumber, and weak and Beyond that, the report goes on to talk about National Party debates about trade policy, and this is the majority opinion: They believe that the farm debt crisis and the absence of an international economic level playing field have rendered rationalism lethal to the rural economy. Fischer's enemies are anti-Hilmer, anticompetition policy and anti-level playing field. They are for protection, cross-subsidies and statutory marketing. Their mantra consists of two names: Black Jack MCEwen and Doug Anthony. The National Party majority cites the Brazilian coffee cartel as the way for Australia to be operating on the international market. This exposes the hypocrisy and the double standard, for National and Liberal Party members to come into this place and say, 'We are all for APEC; we are all for these free trade benefits,' but in their party room to be debating the model of the Brazilian coffee cartel for Australia. It is an outrage, an absolute outrage. These people have not reformed themselves. The same outfit that ran the protectionist and isolationist trade policies in the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s would do it again in the 1990s. What model would they use? They would not use APEC, regional free trade, the benefits of the Uruguay Round or the benefits of GATT. They would use the model of the Brazilian coffee cartel with all its worse features of collusion, subsidies and protectionism, rolled into the trade policies of the National Party. What would it mean for Australia's future, if, after the next election, there was a change of government and Tim Fischer, of all people, was nominated Australia's new trade minister? He would go to the next meeting of APEC. After they had called the security guards to check his credentials-not believing that someone of his low level capacity could be a participant at APEC-what would happen? He would have to announce himself and say, 'Hi; I am Tim Fischer, the new trade minister for Australia. The majority of my party back home adopt the Brazilian coffee cartel as their model for trade.' It gets worse. Judge not the National Party in isolation; look at the policies of the Liberal Party. The shadow minister for industry, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), was quoted in the Business Review Weekly from 3 July saying that he was calling for a fundamental shift in Australian tariff policy. The magazine reported: He has signalled a dramatic change in the coalition's approach to industry. Mr Moore has raised the prospect of slowing tariff reductions. He has called for a move away from reliance on multilateral trade agreements towards direct negotiation on market access with other countries. It is remarkable that the shadow minister for industry would be wanting to move away from multilateral forums like APEC and its agenda and go back to the MCEwenite model of bilateral trade negotiations. He wants to go back to the 1950s and 1960s. He wants to forget about the multilateral benefits of forums like APEC and the GATT and go back to bilateral arrangements. There is a harmony in the views of the Liberal and National parties on trade. They do not want free trade or multilateral trade negotiations. Their model is the Brazilian coffee cartel. If there were a change of government, the new minister for industry, the honourable member for Ryan, would front up at APEC, a multilateral forum, and tell them that the Howard government in Australia wants to downgrade these sorts of things. It wants to get out of multilateral arrangements and go back to the failed policies of protectionism and isolationism. There is no support for APEC from honourable members opposite. It is not reflected in their policies. All the empty rhetoric and the assurances they have provided in the House in this debate count for absolutely nothing. The thing that counts is their policy, and the policy of the National Party is modelled on the Brazilian coffee cartel. The policy of the Liberal Party, reflected in the public comments of its shadow minister for industry, the honourable member for Ryan, is to downgrade multilateral trade agreements and slow the pace of Australia's tariff reductions. Of course, as we slow our pace, our trading partners slow their pace. Effectively, the National and the Liberal parties want Australia to go back to days where the only effective penetration our industries had was on the domestic market. They want our industries to be restricted to a domestic market of 17 million people and ignore the immense benefits of moving into markets of billions of people in the Asia-Pacific. They want to limit Australia and its economic aspirations to our small domestic market, the old failed mantra, the old failed model of MCEwen, Doug Anthony, Menzies and Fraser. It is totally inconsistent with what this government is achieving by opening up international and regional markets for the benefits of free trade with effective market penetration. When it is all said and done, there is a difference in the trade and economic policies on the various sides of this parliament. The difference is this: the Labor Party wants to see Australia develop into much more than a quarry and a farm. The National and Liberal parties would limit us to this by not allowing our manufacturing and service industries to penetrate markets in the Asia-Pacific. We are seeing a re-run of the failed coalition policies from the 1950s and 1960s, and it is an immense shame for this nation and its future trading position. Only this government has had the capacity to develop a sophisticated trading strategy. Only this government, with its Labor leadership, has had the capacity to smash the MCEwen legacy, to open up the economy, and secure Australia's place in the world's most dynamic and fastest growing region, the Asia-Pacific. We have seen, in recent decades, how the world has been breaking into trade groupings-most notably, the European Union and NAFTA. Australia, by culture and geography, has had no natural grouping to slide into, so we have had to make our way into APEC. We have had to bring together the Asia Pacific as a new form of trade architecture and develop a new trade forum. We have made our way into the Asia-Pacific and APEC by virtue of leadership. The benefits of leadership, Labor leadership, Keating leadership, have brought together the Asia-Pacific as Australia's trade grouping in response to the way in which Europe and North America had been forming trade blocks. The Osaka achievements are essentially four-fold. The first is that the Osaka agreement, the Osaka achievement, confirms the Asia-Pacific grouping and does not allow any backsliding to a solely Asian economic and trade forum. It is the preference, of course, of Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, to have an Asian-only economic and trade grouping. I would have thought that the recognition by other Asian nations at APEC of the need for an Asian-Pacific focus signals the end of what has been known as the Asian values debate. When it is all said and done, Mahathir is just a crude version of Lee Kwan Yew, clear arguing that only Asian values can sustain long-term economic growth and competitiveness. The truth is that Asian values are very diverse throughout that region, reflecting the diversity of culture and outlook. Asian values do have benefits for producing dynamic growth economies, but so too do other values and cultures. It is very significant that in Singapore they are now talking about the Pacific way, a flexible combination of Eastern and Western values and culture. The Pacific way is a very good reflection and summary of the orientation that Australia can take in terms of culture, innovation and trade outlook. The second achievement at Osaka was to keep agriculture in the cart, as part of the APEC agreement. This is a very difficult matter, and I am always interested in debates such as this to hear and learn of the tension between globalism and localism. We have seen in recent decades economic and political power around the world gravitate towards global and local arenas. There are tensions in an issue like this because we have various speakers in this debate and in other forums talking about the benefits of global free trade, but they are sometimes not too comfortable when they have to deal with the local consequences of those economic relations and economic environment. There is always a tension between global economic benefits and local consequences, a tension that politicians and public policy decision makers are constantly grappling with. Agriculture is part of that because, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a romance that is built into the culture and the mythology of those who work the land. Agriculture has electoral consequences, not just in Japan, not just in the European nations, but also in Australia. We all know the consequences of the electoralism of the rural lobby. However, at the end of the day-and the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) would appreciate this-agricultural protection and agricultural subsidies are just another form of business welfare. In Europe in particular-and I am sure this will be reflected ultimately in the Asia-Pacific-there is a change in public opinion. Why should manufacturing and service sector workers exposed to international competition, not receiving subsidies from government, see agriculture receive subsidies and protection? Not only that, they pay higher prices for their agricultural produce as consumers. There is absolutely no question that public opinion is picking up this theme in Europe. It has picked it up in this country. The National Party of Australia is now a protectionist rump, totally irrelevant to the mainstream of the debate. I am very confident that those shifts in public opinion will be reflected throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Having kept agriculture in the cart at Osaka, it will stay in the cart because of that inevitable shift in public opinion. The third achievement at Osaka is to see the first down payment on regional cooperation and its trade benefits. Free trade in the region will boost Australia's GDP by 6.8 per cent or $40 billion per annum and create 500,000 new jobs by the year 2010. Regional output for the APEC nations will increase by 3.8 per cent. The first down payment, most notably in phasing down of protectionist measures in Indonesia and China, is coming onto the agenda for Australia's immense benefit. The fourth achievement of Osaka-and this is a marvel of modem government-is that APEC reflects a logical response to the globalisation of capital. I have previously quoted in the House the way in which the MCKinsey organisation has projected that international investment will reach $83 trillion by the year 2000. It is sensible, given that dimension of investment and trade around the world and the mobility of capital, for governments to defend their interests and continue their countervailing role by cooperating together. If capital is globalising itself, the institutions of government and the decision making processes also need to act within a global framework. Economic power is shifting to the global arena and it is logical for political power to also move to that arena. APEC is a very important reflection of how governments can cooperate for free trade and investment. It reflects the way in which the European Union has established similar arrangements but gone even further, with the Maastricht Treaty for a single currency and monetary union by the end of this decade.

29,Mr VAILE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"It is good to take the opportunity to pass some comments on the prime ministerial statement that was made yesterday. I will restrict my comments to that, but I cannot let the opportunity to respond to some of the remarks of the member of Werriwa (Mr Latham) go by. He was talking about things he knows nothing about. He was talking about things that happened within a National Party meeting that did not actually take place. I was wondering how come he was so privy to it. I did not see him within the meeting; maybe he was the moth on the wall or the cockroach in the comer. The article that he was referring to is totally baseless and fallacious and is wrong in fact. He has found that out and should not really be misrepresenting it in that way. The important thing that we should be talking about today is the way forward and the way that the APEC group has moved through a series of meetings. The Labor Party has focused today on the involvement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in getting this established. But it goes back a bit further-to the previous Labor Party Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and, before him, Malcolm Fraser. Let us not just focus on the narrow band of the Osaka meeting that has just taken place and the results that have come out of that. There have been a number of meetings. Let us go back to the first meeting in Seattle in 1993. Last year, there was the Bogor meeting, out of which came the Bogor declaration, which basically set out the goals of the APEC group for trade liberalisation by the years 2010 and 2020. This year, the recently completed Osaka meeting put together an action agenda setting out the principles which will underpin, I suppose, the process of trade liberalisation and trade facilitation in the Asia-Pacific region, as we move towards those target dates that were established in Bogor. As some of the previous speakers have said, this is good and well. I think that all Australians should be committed to the process, if it delivers the benefits that have been spoken of so far and that it is supposed to deliver. Nobody would argue the fact that we are, and will be in the future, an integral part of this region. We are here. We should be involved in the trading bloc that is being established in this region. It has been right that we have gone down a different path from that of Malaysia, which wanted to see a purely Asian trading bloc rather than a Pacific region. So it is important that we recognise what has happened and what has been locked in place so far. It is important to note the size and the emphasis of the trading bloc itself. The 18 APEC economies account for about 60 per cent of the world's GDP and about 50 per cent of the world's trade. Conversely, we should have a look at what Australia's share of the world's trade and the world's GDP actually is. It is undeniable that Australia's share of East Asian imports has dropped 20 per cent in the last 10 years. Since 1983, we have lost some market share in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Brunei. Our merchandise trade surplus within the APEC region has declined from $5.8 billion in 1990-91 to $1.8 billion in 1994-95. We need to maintain perspective in this whole discussion. A bit of emphasis needs to be put on the fact that it is an enormous trading block as far as its market share within the world GDP and trading areas is concerned. Australia's share of that has been declining. We have to pay attention to and try to quell that declining involvement in the APEC area. To that end, what is being established and put in place should address that situation. It really is incumbent upon the members of the APEC group and this government and future governments involved in sitting around that table, whether it be the Prime Minister of the day or the trade minister of the day, to ensure that APEC creates confidence. Countries like China must change the way disputes are dealt with, because we have seen in the world trade arena in recent times the larger trading nations around the world departing from some of their commitments. We have seen the United States departing from its commitment to the GAIT agreement and subsiding some of its agricultural products. Because there is no locked-in, legalistic agreement involved in the APEC group, we are taking some of these nations at their word, and anybody who has been in business should know that you need a little bit more commitment than that. Coming up to the meeting in the Philippines next year some attention has to be paid to how disputes are going to be resolvedwhether sanctions should be involved in a written form that the group can impose on other members that are not abiding by the agreements that have been reached in heading towards that trade liberalisation by the years 2010 and 2020. It is important as we move towards the next meeting in the Philippines in 1996 that there should be some code of practice adopted to deal with trade disputes in an orderly manner. Let us not fool ourselves: they will arise. Domestic political pressures will always be brought to bear on governments in the different countries that are members of APEC. It is going to take a great deal of steel on their behalf to resist those domestic pressures from time to time. I have instanced some of the things that have taken place-some of the actions that have been taken by the American government with regard to export enhancement of wheat and dairy products. That was done despite the signing of the GAIT agreement. The World Trade Organisation got under way on 1 July this year. But these things are still happening. In this Asia-Pacific region it is very important that established within the agreement there is some code of practice that will deal with trade disputes, and there may be a need for the development and the institutionalisation of some sort of sanction to be involved. In addressing the prime ministerial statement, I think that it is important that we acknowledge those elements of it. It is important that we acknowledge the background of APEC and how it has reached the stage it is at today. Its development has not come about as a result of the current government or the current Prime Minister. APEC has developed and evolved over a number of years. Sure, the current government has played an active role in a few of the latter meetings to develop the APEC group, but APEC certainly goes further back than that and that should be acknowledged here today. It is an enormous trading region with an enormous share of the world's GDP. We cannot tum our backs on it; we have got to be involved in it. I noted that the Prime Minister in his speech, which I have read, addressed the importance of Australia as being the 'food bowl for South-East Asia'. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has referred to Australia as the 'supermarket of Asia'. That is very true; and every member in this house, politics aside, would recognise that. We have to be working together as a nation in trying to re-establish ourselves in this area where the Australian share of trade over recent years has declined. We have got to rekindle that. At the same time as we have this very strong focus on South-East Asia or the APEC group, which also includes New Zealand, the United States of America and Canada, on the Asia-Pacific rim, let us not lose sight of the fact that we have some very strong and important trading links and commitments with the United Kingdom and with Europe. We all, particularly those of us in affected electorates-and I include you, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, with a semirural electorateacknowledge the problems that we face in dealing on a trade basis with the European Union, particularly on agricultural products with the existence of the CAP and the problems that that presents to Australian exporters of agricultural products. The fact remains, however, that we have very important trade links with Europe and we have extremely important trade links with the United Kingdom. I think that we might be the third largest investor in the United Kingdom, and it works in reverse as well. Whilst we are focusing very strongly on the APEC group, the Asia-Pacific region, we cannot lose sight of the importance of those other trade agreements and trade areas or that we have established those links with Europe and the United Kingdom. It is interesting to note some of the achievements or the agreements that have come out of the recent APEC meeting. The results of those agreements for different nations have meant different things. In speaking on trade liberalisation in this parliament since I have been a member, I have always been a touch cynical about the downstream benefits, the outcomes of the agreements that we have entered into, and the speed at which Australia is heading down that trade liberalisation path by comparison with other nations. I immediately instance the European countries, the EEC, still clinging onto the CAP. As far as I am concerned, we are ahead in the game in reducing our tariffs. I do not accept for one moment the rubbish that the member for Werriwa came up with in regard to protectionist and isolationist policies of the current coalition. That is not the case; such policies do not exist. It is a very fallacious comment that has been made by the member for Werriwa but it is something we have come to expect from him in his speeches in this place. I have always been a touch sceptical about the commitment of all countries around the world, particularly to the GATT agreement, and the pace at which we are reducing tariff measures such as subsidies and the like. We are exposing our industries to the world market at a much faster pace than are other signatories to some of these agreements. It is of the utmost importance and it is incumbent upon this government, this Prime Minister, this Minister for Trade-and future prime ministers and ministers for trade representing Australia as we move forward in our participation in the APEC group-that we make sure that it is all done on a quid pro quo basis, that we get access to the marketplaces in South-East Asia equal to the access that everybody else gets, on the same basis or the best basis that we possibly can. I do not believe that that has been achieved through the GAIT Uruguay Round and under the processes that are being undertaken now by the Wodd Trade Organisation. The tariff reductions that have been agreed to in the GAIT round are on the basis of a percentage reduction per annum. That is relative to the base that all those nations started from. We are not saying by the year 2000 everybody is going to be on a 10 per cent level or a five per cent level for a specific product. We are talking about a percentage per year, so the relativity goes back to what base each country started from. As far as I am concerned, it is going to be a long time in that process before all the nations that we are trading with and that are signatories to the GAIT are going to end up on the same level, on a quid pro quo basis of equal access into each other's marketplace. Let us not see that as being the case in APEC. Let us focus on having equitable trade relations with these countries, where we have equal access to each other's markets-as has been established, and was instanced by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in his speech, in the development of the CER. We have opened up economic relations with New Zealand on a quid pro quo basis. Those are the things that we must focus on from this day forward. What has been achieved has been very good. The ground rules have been laid out. It is now up to everybody involved in APEC to observe those ground rules. In closing, it behoves me to highlight the fact that in this agreement we are moving forward, and we support what is happening as far as trade liberalisation is concerned, but, the NFF has said, it is all well and good to participate in these agreements for trade liberalisation but it is not good enough if manufacturing and production industries have to continue working in the worse set of circumstances in the nation. Domestic microeconomic reform in Australia has stalled. It has stalled and we have to crank it up if we are going to compete with these countries, because they do not work on that basis. (Time expired)",51
30,Mrs CROSIO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (1.21 p.m.)-It is with a great deal of delight that I rise to speak in support of the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on APEC. I do so because I believe sincerely that Australia has a very different future today as a result of the recent APEC meeting-a future where the clouds now have that extra sheen in their silver lining, to the tune of some $40 billion and 500,000 new jobs. Despite those naysayers and gloom merchants who have again proven themselves incapable of gauging regional interest and the climate of change, the Prime Minister's successful stewardship of Australia's agenda at APEC means that we now live in a place with a decidedly changed future. Australians must be proud of the outcomes of this latest meeting, not solely because of the benefits it will eventually provide for us and for our children, but also because Australia and APEC are one and the same. APEC is an Australian initiative. APEC stands as a symbol of our nation's coming of age, and of our neighbours' recognition that we can play-and will continue to play-an important role in our region. No matter how much the opposition attempts to claw back some of the limelight for itself, APEC was an initiative of a Labor federal government. Recently, the Leader of the Opposition and member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), in his speech to the Asia-Australian Institute, tried to sneak onto centre stage and dip his foot in the spotlight by saying it was a coalition initiative that provided the foundations for APEC-harking back to Malcolm Fraser's dalliances with the Japanese in the late 1970s as and early 1980s. In the debate today a lot of the coalition members have referred to that, with the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) touching on it less than 10 minutes ago. All I can say to the member for Bennelong and the coalition is that they are drawing a very long bow. A few polite conversations do not an international agreement make. APEC was originally conceived in 1989-a long time after the member for Bennelong and his coalition at the time bit the political dust. It was a move symbolic of a forward-thinking government with vision, and it remains so today. The government at the time saw Australia's economic and trade future inexorably linked with the 'tiger' economies of Asia and the emerging powers of the Pacific. Nothing has changed. Three-quarters of our exports now go to this region, compared with 65 per cent in the early 1980s. The Australian orchestrators of APEC enjoyed the combination of being able to see into the future and having a great deal of common sense. In saying that they could see into the future, I do not for a minute entertain the notion that those members of the Labor government in 1989 had supernatural powers-not quite. I think anyone, any member of the government, should have been able to see that by 1989 Australia's future economic survival depended on our becoming enmeshed in the economic fabric of the Asia-Pacific region. It was because of their common sense that they could see the way the wind would blow in the coming years. However, seeing the future is not nearly as impressive as being able to become part of it. And that is just what we have been able to achieve here. Six years down the track, with all of the gains we have so far won for all Australians, perhaps it is time to spell out again, for their benefit, what the success of APEC and a strong APEC agreement means to the future of our country. I agree with the recent comments of the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan) that most Australians have heard about APEC but that not many know what it means for Australian businesses, the Australian economy, or for the average Australian in terms of jobs and other opportunities. As with any major development involving our nation's economy or trade performance, there is a propensity for our economic boffins to take the reins and guide debate above the heads of ordinary Australians. The successes of APEC are just too important to let that happen. It would be a great tragedy for Australians to have APEC and all that it means slide by without demonstrating to them that the agreement is a defining moment in our nation's history. One of the features of the federal Labor government, during its U years in office, has been its direction of 0ur foreign, trade and economic policies towards Asia. Australia's role in Asia has at times become a divisive issue; it has been championed, chastised and chattered about with increasing frequency. Some neighbours have at times questioned our motives and the commitment behind our intentions-quite rightly so, given this nation's chequered history in its dealings with the region. Others have welcomed our involvement in regional affairs with open arms. As our relationship with the Asia-Pacific region has strengthened, and in particular with Asia, it has meant that Australians have had to address extremely important issues related to our history, our heritage and our future. Throughout the history of Australia since white settlement, from colonial settlement through Federation, the two world wars and into the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, our nation has deferred to the power of the United Kingdom or the United States on most matters of international importance. By looking to take a leading role in Asia and committing ourselves wholeheartedly to APEC, Australia over the last 12 years has signalled to the world that its relationship with these two nations, and the way in which it sees itself, has now changed. I am sure that this will be a talking point for historians and social commentators for many years to come. They will point to Gallipoli, or to the defiance of Prime Minister Curtin in his dealings with the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, or the role of Doc Evatt and his appointment as the President of the United Nations General Assembly, or even to the events of November 1975, as occasions when Australia had its eyes opened to the realities of the world and its place in it. During these discussions I will have to beg to differ. In my view, it is our emerging relationship with Asia-a region culturally, economically and socially different to ourselves-and specifically with APEC, which signals Australia's real coming of age. Achieving Federation during the dying groans of the British Empire, and beginning to trust our abilities at a time when the United States has once again turned its attention upon itself, we have finally become confident enough to stand on our own two feet by admitting our future lies with Asia. It promises great changes, great possibility and great challenges. A strong APEC agreement, and Australia's position in that agreement, does not only mean a flow-on of economic benefits, although this is one of the major results. It means that the changes that have been discussed so frequently concerning Australia's role with its traditional partners, the UK and the US, have finally and decisively begun to take shape. With it will come gradual changes to our society, our cultural life and the way that we see ourselves as a nation. I do not mean that Sydney will become Hong Kong or that Melbourne will become Jakarta. Australia will always remain Australia, but by organising APEC and ushering its members forward, cementing agreements, finalising objectives and orchestrating what will eventually become the greatest trading boom the world has ever seen Australia has suddenly stopped standing in the corner with its shoulders hunched like some awkward adolescent young boy waiting to be allowed to join in the conversation of the adults. Australia is now stepping forward confidently as a young adult, responsible and ready to work with our immediate partners. Apart from what APEC means for us historically, for our standing in the region or for our own selfconfidence, it spells economic gains that at the moment seem potentially limitless. It has been mentioned before that 75 per cent of all Australia's exports now go to the region. It is perhaps more important to place that 75 per cent of exports into context with the rest of the region. One thing that needs to be impressed upon Australians is the economic enormity of the Asia-Pacific region. As our Prime Minister pointed out yesterday, the 18 APEC countries already account for 60 per cent of the world's GDP and half of its trade. More goods are now traded within the area, one country to another, than are traded within North America or the European Community. Sixty-six per cent of APEC countries' exports go to member states whereas in the European Community it is 61 per cent and in the North American free trade agreement it is 42 per cent. We are dealing with economic muscle power of an almost mind-boggling dimension. Better though than just contemplating it, we are actively harnessing that energy in great leaps and bounds. One of the agreements that makes APEC unique is that the leaders of APEC countries have now set themselves concrete objectives. Despite initial reservations from individual nations, the goals that have been set are achievable and I wager they will be achieved by those set dates. Those nations that have approached APEC's goals somewhat hesitatingly no doubt really know that the agreement is entirely within their best interest, just as it is in Australia's, to bring down tariff walls and to promote free trade. As the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) has stated in this House, while representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Trade, it is expected that APEC will increase income for all its members to the tune of some $993 billion when its combined effects flow through. That is $993 billion for everybody, and in particular the developing nations within APEC. The mind boggles at such a figure. As our minister pointed out, that is worth more than the Australian and South Korean economies combined, more than 10 times the size of the Malaysian economy and 1'12 times the size of China's economyspread across all 18 APEC nations. While we may rejoice at what APEC means for ourselves, we must remember that it is not a one-way street. We are not going to reap the benefits at another country's expense and I believe the lesser developed nations that have joined in APEC can see that as well. Our APEC goals of promoting open markets throughout the region are fully consistent with our neighbours' desires to create growth and jobs for their own people. Open markets generate growth. It is as simple as that. Setting ourselves such clear objectives makes the job of harnessing the economic muscle power of the Asia-Pacific region so much easier. We now have something to work towards. The APEC countries are not simply indulging in economic fantasies. They are not pushing ideas across the table at each other like some overrated private think-tank. They are working towards tangible, reachable goals. With each meeting we take one step forward. Sometimes they are bigger than others, but we are heading in a definite direction with our goals firmly in sight. Talking about taking steps forward, I was particularly interested to hear the statement by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong, in the House yesterday in support of the Prime Minister's success in Osaka and, as such, his leadership in previous APEC meetings. I am pleased-and I am glad that the member for Bennelong is in the chamber-that the opposition now supports the government's handling of our involvement in APEC. Yet I must point out that, despite the honourable member's repeated assurances that his comments in no way begrudge the government's vision, the messages that his colleagues have been sending the Australian people over the previous few weeks in the lead-up to the APEC meeting have been contrary to this. I, like everybody else, have watched the evening news and read the newspapers over the last few weeks. Virtually all the members of the opposition who were discussing APEC have come out and said that they had hoped the Prime Minister would fail in Osaka, meaning they hoped Australia would fail. How courageous of them. How full of national pride they are. The fact is that they are jealous of this government's achievements. Their front bench is bereft of a single person with any vision for our nation. They talk about their Lord Caseys and their Andrew Peacocks but they have long gone. Who can they talk about now? The member for Mayo (Mr Downer)? I can see him as Australia's foreign minister, bobbing up and down like a very errant little schoolboy. The coalition wants to dance to a tune that was playing in this country in the 1950s and 1960s. All I can say is that it is now a new tune and they had better learn to dance to that quick smart. Our Prime Minister on Tuesday, in talking about the success of Osaka, made a comment which I think should be recorded in Hansard. He has stated that we are stepping into a ring well above our weight and we are fighting well above there. That is, I believe, an effective way of illustrating the position that Australia, with its population of 18 million, now takes in leading APEC to the success that the countries want to see it achieve. I commend the Prime Minister for his actions. I commend the government on this step forward and particularly on the statement that was delivered here on APEC. Debate (on motion by Mr Bruce Scott) adjourned. NA",54
31,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before I call the Prime Minister to refer to the death of the former Prime Minister of Israel, I advise the House that we have present in the gallery His Excellency the Ambassador of Israel. On behalf of the House we bid him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear. NA Rabin, Mr Yitzhak",57
32,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That this House: (1) records its deep sadness at the assassination on 4 November 1995 of Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel; (2) expresses its profound sympathy to Mrs Leah Rabin and her family and to the people of Israel in their bereavement; (3) further expresses its hope that all the parties to the Middle East peace process will continue to follow the path of peace and reconciliation along which Mr Rabin had set out; and (4) requests that this motion be conveyed by the Speaker on behalf of the House to the Government of Israel. Like all Australians, I was horrified to learn of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. Few people in international public life are called on to make decisions of such weight and consequence as those that he had to make. And few have done so with such courage and clear-eyed vision. Yitzhak Rabin was a remarkable individual. His whole life was dominated by his absolute commitment to the state of Israel and to its people. From his birth in Jerusalem in 1922 he was at or near the centre of most events which created and shaped his country. His life was devoted first to the foundation of Israel, and then to ensuring its survival. For many years Mr Rabin expressed this commitment through his distinguished career as a soldier. He fought in the 1948 War of Independence, then served for more than 20 years as a member of the Israeli Defence Force. His military career culminated in his appointment as Chief of Staff of the IDF and its commander during the Six-Day War. After five years as Israel's ambassador to the United States, Mr Rabin returned to Isr.ael in 1973 to enter politics. Just as his military career was driven by his unswerving commitment to Israel's security, so was his life as a political leader. Although that deep commitment never changed, its form did-and quite profoundly. During his second term as Prime Minister after 1992, Mr Rabin came to the view cautiously-almost reluctantly, but I believe irresistibly-that the cause to which he had committed his life, that is Israel's survival and security, was now best served by a sustained effort to negotiate a settlement with the Palestinians. This did not represent any change in his fundamental beliefs. But he had the imagination and the courage to recognise that military superiority alone could not deliver lasting security for Israel. And he understood that a change of approach of parallel importance was taking place among the Palestinian leadership as well. This represented a fundamental shift in policy for Israel and many Israelis, of course, were unsettled by it. Possibly only Rabin, with his unassailable reputation as a defender of Israel's security, could have carried most of the country with him in following this new path. The breakthrough came with the signature on 13 September 1993 of the IsraeliPalestinian Declaration of Principles. In that document, for the first time ever, Israel and the Palestinians recognised each other as part of the same neighbourhood and accepted the need to deal with each other as neighbours. That historic recognition was symbolised when Mr Rabin shook the hand of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on the lawn at the White House in September 1993. That handshake was the beginning, not the end, of a process. Despite the intense political pressure Mr Rabin came under, pressure which went well beyond the normal and acceptable bounds of political debate, he remained determined to keep the peace process going. Under his leadership, the peace treaty with Jordan was signed in October 1994 and then the interim agreement with the Palestinians, just two months before his death. The worth and substance of Mr Rabin's achievements not just for Israel but for the Middle East and the world were recognised when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, together with Mr Shimon Peres and the PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat. The great shock of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination was not so much that it happened, as shocking as that was, as violence in the politics of the Middle East is tragically common; it was that he was killed by another Israeli. At the core of Israel's existence has always been its role as a sanctuary for the Jewish people. His assassin has done more than rob us all of the life and potential of Yitzhak Rabin, he has cheated the Jewish people of the security of the belief to which so many Israelis had dedicated themselves, that Israel was a place where above all else human rights and human happiness were the foundations and strengths of the society. Some good may come from his death if, as many of the country's political leaders and public figures have urged, it causes Israelis to reflect on the ways the political debate was abused and misused. Much good will come of it if it reinforces the commitment of Israelis and their neighbours to press ahead on the difficult but unavoidable path he set. From my discussion with Prime Minister Peres, I know that he and the Israeli government are deeply committed to this task. In fact, I was very moved by the things he had to say to me in his office. He told the Knesset yesterday: Our main objective will be to arrive. if possible by the end of this century. at a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. To create a Middle East without violence, without bloodshed, without terrorism, without wars, and without the factors which lead to all of these-poverty, ignorance, backwardness and prejudice. The best way Australia and Australians can honour Mr Rabin is to continue to give our full support to the peace process. We shall continue to support the right of Israel to exist in security and safety, at peace with its Arab neighbours in the context of a comprehensive regional settlement. We shall also continue to help in whatever practical ways are possible, including through our participation in the Sinai peacekeeping force and the United Nations peacekeeping operations, and through our practical work on regional security and water resources, as part of the peace process. When I met Prime Minister Peres after the funeral he told me that in the 50 years he had known Yitzhak Rabin he had never seen him as happy as he was on the night he was killed. He said he was buoyed by the support of the vast crowd of 100,000 people who had turned out to rally for the cause of peace and  seen Mr Rabin sing in public. Yitzhak Rabin's life was a life that mattered. He changed fundamentally and for the better the society which he led and the region of which Israel is a part. But it is important to remember, too, that his murder was not just a political event; it was also a human tragedy for his family and for those who loved him. No-one who saw his grand-daughter deliver that eloquent eulogy at his funeral could fail to be moved by the human dimensions of his death. That is why I am sure I speak for all members of this House when I offer our deepest condolences to Mrs Leah Rabin and the other members of Mr Rabin's family. To the people of Israel, through Ambassador Moyal who is with us in the House, our deepest sympathy on this tragic event. I commend this motion to the House.",57
33,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I second the motion. I am very pleased to warmly endorse the condolence motion that has just been moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Everybody would agree that there is something particularly horrifying and arresting about a political assassination. It is always awful when violence of the ultimate kind is used as an act of political expression. Nobody who has any understanding of the cause of justice and peace in the world would not have been absolutely shocked by Yitzhak Rabin's tragic assassination a few weeks ago. I have to say that the manner of his being assassinated and, in a sense, the events that it followed remind me of the equally tragic political assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt in 1981. There were similarities. Both those men in the cause of peace had run against the tide of some domestic political opinion and had reached, in the interests of a higher cause, for an agreement with long-term political foes. The accord that was reached between the Palestinians and the Israelis was symbolised by that meeting on the White House lawn to which the Prime Minister referred. The image of Rabin and Yasser Arafat shaking hands, with the President of the United States, the peacemaker and facilitator, between them, is one of the great images of our generation. The fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians could sit down together after all the murders, assassinations and assaults upon the state of Israel and all the other bitterness in the Middle East was really the stuff of which most of us a few years ago thought only dreams were made. That achievement was quite remarkable. Even in a very cynical and violence weary world, it was a very uplifting fact. For a man that had been through what he had been through, and for a man who was very much the heart and soul of the tumultuous birth and existence of Israel from before and after 1948, it was a remarkable act of statesmanship on his part. It was statesmanship of the best kind that brought that accord into being. In many ways, to me and many Australians, whatever their politics, Rabin symbolised the robust struggle of Israel from the time of her birth in 1948 as a separate sovereign Jewish state until the present. He was the commander in chief of the Israeli armed forces during the extraordinary victory that was won in the SixDay War in 1967. He was the defence minister who gave the order for the Israeli commanders who recaptured those who had been taken hostage at Entebbe in Uganda by the Palestinians in 1976. He then entered domestic politics after a period of time as ambassador to the United States. After encountering some reverses in his first stint as Prime Minister, he spent a long period in Israeli politics, finally returning only a few years ago to deliver the finest hour of his political contribution to the country in which he was born and the country that he loved so much. I am happy to say that I share all the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister about this very great man. I share the hopes and aspirations of all Australians that peace has finally come to the Middle East. I think of the hundreds of thousands and probably millions who have died in different wars in the Middle East. One cannot think about the assassination of a prime minister of Israel without thinking of the agony suffered by the Jewish people over centuries, particularly just over 50 years ago at the hands of the Nazis. The state of Israel is a symbol of the defiance of the Jewish people against almost unimaginable odds. The death of Rabin in such tragic circumstances had quite an impact on Australia. It reminded us of the very strong bonds that exist between the state of Israel and Australia. Those bonds are shared across the political divide both in Israel and here in Australia. The moving tributes that were paid at the various services held at the Great Synagogue in Sydney and at synagogues in Melbourne and Brisbane were a testimony to that bond. It was an opportunity for all Australians to say not only to the people of Israel but also to the Jewish community of Australia how much they are revered and respected. What a great man the state of Israel produced in Yitzhak Rabin. He is a wonderful reminder to all of us that the pursuit of peace and the capacity for human reconciliation and forgiveness is the most noble of all mankind's attributes. I simply want to conclude by quoting from Yitzhak Rabin's last speech at the Tel Aviv peace rally-to which the Prime Minister referred-on 4 November 1995, minutes before he was murdered. He said: Peace is first of all in our prayers but it is also the aspiration of the Jewish people, a genuine aspiration for peace. It is not only the prayer and the aspiration of the Jewish people but also the prayer and the aspiration of all mankind.",59
34,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"The death of Yitzhak Rabin by assassination is one of those great tragedies, one of those great shocks, of this century. Yitzhak Rabin did the hardest thing of all in politics: he moved his own people beyond the bounds of comfort to areas where they had to place their faith in their leader. It is an additional tragic burden that his death was by the hand of a man of the Jewish faith-a Jew whose testament includes the prophetic story in Zechariah 13:6, which I quote: What are these wounds on your chest. The answer will be the wounds I received in the house of my friends. The prophetic nature of Rabin's death is exemplified by his last words at that famous and now historic Tel Aviv peace rally, from which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) quoted in part. Yitzhak Rabin said: There are enemies of the peace process, and they try to hurt us. But violence undermines democracy and must be denounced and isolated. The tragic irony of Rabin's death by assassination is almost overwhelming. Israelis had always assumed that they were safe amongst themselves. After all, the entire point to the formation of the state of Israel after World War II and the appalling Holocaust was a sense of security-security in a religious context and in a physical sense for those of the Jewish faith. Only a man of Rabin's qualities and background could have delivered a peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Jordanians. If you go to some of the places on either side of the Dead Sea you will see the warm peace between Israel and Jordan beginning to bear commercial fruit in a very practical way. Rabin was trusted as part of that peace process, perhaps more so because he was a former army chief of staff. He was a man whose demeanour-his simplicity of stylebespoke his strength and authority. Whilst it is fair to say I do not agree with every aspect of Israeli activity, I do say it was only Rabin who could bring Israeli people to the peace table. It was not just his background but his persona which gave Israeli people, and people of the Jewish faith more generally, confidence in his leadership. There is a term used within the Jewish faith which has in part an Arabic background'dugri'. 'Dugri' describes behaviour which is that of substance, not of style. It exemplifies simplicity, directness and honesty. It conveys the placing of substance before style, of stripping away any pretence or deception. In short, it speaks of common sense and direct speech. It is such an approach, an approach which exemplifies Yitzhak Rabin-his life, his times, his work and his contribution-which gave confidence to the people of Israel, confidence in his striking a peace accord with the Palestinians and the Jordanians and commencing the path of peace elsewhere in the Middle East with Syria and Lebanon. When the peace accord was struck between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, he said in an address to the Palestinian people: We, like you, are people who want to build a home. To plant a tree. To love. Live side by side with you-in dignity, in empathy, as human beings, as free men. Yitzhak Rabin was a man who understood that at the end of the day there had to be a peace with Palestinians and Arabs more generally. He argued that it was completely wrong to the democratic tradition of the Jewish people to subjugate another people. Subjugation of Jews was, after all, the inspiration behind Zionism and the eventual formation of the Jewish state. One of the things that gave the signing of the peace accord so much power was the performance of Rabin. Other politicianslesser politicians-may have tried to bask in the glory of that historic event, but it belonged essentially to Rabin. To those of us who watched it on the evening news, what we saw was Rabin performing a difficult and uncomfortable but necessary activity. It was the performance of a man who had 'dugri'. Time magazine described the ceremony on the White House lawn as follows: There was no pretence . . . no attempt to convey any false emotion. It was a demonstration of the awkward rough hewn nobility that distinguishes Rabin's life. It was the gesture that will also mark his place in history. The people of Israel will suffer as they contemplate the death of Yitzhak Rabin. People of the Jewish faith all over the world, including here in Australia, mourn the death of a truly great man. Few people have within them the greatness which is that of a statesman. Rabin was such a man-a great Jew, a great Israeli, a great soldier, a great politician and a great statesman. Who would have thought that on that famous day in Jerusalem just a few days ago a Prime Minister of Israel could be eulogised by none other than King Hussein of Jordan as follows: The peaceful people in the majority of my country of the armed forces and people who once were your enemies are sombre today, and their hearts are heavy. Let us hope and pray that God will give us all guidance, each in his respective position, to do what we can for the better future that yitzhak Rabin sought. On behalf of the National Party, I express my sincere condolences to his wife, Leah, to his family, to the Israeli government and the Israeli people, and to the Ambassador of Israel and the embassy team present in the gallery today. Noble leader and Nobel laureate Yitzhak Rabin is dead, and the world is the worse for it.",60
35,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I want to join in the remarks of sympathy of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in this very sad debate on the condolence motion. I was privileged to be among those, as described by the Leader of the Opposition, who attended the services which took place at the same time as those in Jerusalem. In my case, I attended the service at the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation with a large number of my cabinet colleagues; a large number of members of state and federal parliament from both sides of the House; His Excellency, who is here with us in the gallery; and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). Nobody who went to any of those services could have failed to have been impressed by the fact that it is enormously necessary for us at this time to show members of the Australian Jewish community as well as those in Israel that we have a sense of solidarity and mourning with them. The tragedy was obviously extraordinarily deeply felt by all who attended those services, and that continues to be the case. Two weeks on, the picture has not really changed at all. Two weeks on, it does demonstrate that the judgments that were made at the time still probably remain correct; that is, that there are irreplaceable people in history. You work around the gap that is left by them when they disappear, but you cannot fill it. There is no doubt that Rabin was such a person. It is all the more poignant that these terrible events actually occurred in the 50th year of the conclusion of hostilities in World War II. The really defining event of that war was the Holocaust. It was out of the Holocaust that came the international sentiment with the Jewish people that led to the creation of the state of Israel. The state of Israel was a matter of survival. That war also saw the beginning of Yitzhak Rabin's career as a soldier. He joined Jewish military organisations and then Palestine in the early part of the war. He then fought in the struggle to make real the United Nations creation of Israel immediately after that. What an extraordinary thing, and an indication of the quality of the man, that at a very young age he would be one of the principal negotiators for Israel on the separation of the forces. He was at the core of every defining moment in the history of the state of Israel from that point onwards in some position or other-for most of it as a very senior and effective military figure and for much of it as a diplomat and a politician, in opposition or in government. In everything he did, of course, he had one eternal goal; that was the creation of Israel, a state in security and peace. Everything he has done is of a piece with that. He brought to that process a special attitude that arose out of his experience and the experience of his people. It is impossible for us to understand or comprehend what being confronted daily with the horror of annihilation, and with the experience of it, does to a mind, particularly a military mind. How much more amazing it is, then, that a man with that background should also have the mind of a man of peace. I really do think only such a person could be fully trusted by his people in bringing them out of what is an absolutely impossible strategic situation, with the attitudes that have to be reinforced in defending that situation, to take an enormous risk for peace. Nobody can stand on the Golan Heights, as I have-on both sides, I might say; on both the Israeli and Syrian sides-and look down them and not comprehend what a risk peace is for an Israeli statesman. I did have the honour of meeting him once in Israel, and deeply impressed I was by such a serious man. He was on the opposition at the time, but you could judge him as a man always on call, a man who did not rush to judgment and who inspired profound trust. They are very lucky, the Israelis, to have such a normal substance in their politics. You cannot but be impressed as you go through and meet Israeli politicians and military leaders with a multiplicity of views on the requirements for the survival of their nation, and understand the depth of moral commitment and intellectual worth in them. You could see that obviously in Yitzhak Rabin. I think it is important for us as a nation to place on record what we believe about his death and the hole it has created in a political process which has the capacity to either ensure a general global peaceful order or create the conditions of a conflagration which would affect many more than the people immediately involved. We, I think, can be pretty proud in this country as we look back over our record in relation to that. We have been enormously focused in our understanding over the years, though it drifts off the map from time to time in the way in which we see foreign affairs and foreign relations. We can be enormously proud of the role we played at the time of Israel's creation. It in many ways part of a process by which were defining ourselves too. It was in years when we first made a major impact the international stage. Therefore, the commitout ment we had as one of the first powers to recognise the existence of the state of Israel and the way in which we slotted that into diplomacy at the time focused on the rights of commitment. small nations and people to survive. As they defined themselves and came to defend brutality themselves, it was for us too, in a more way, an aspect of our own capacity to create a view about ourselves, where we stood and our role in the world. As I said at the outset, I am honoured to able to participate in this discussion chamber and to add my words to those of the others who have spoken here, memorialising the life of a very great man.",61
36,Mr COSTELLO,CONDOLENCES,"Along with a number of recurring my colleagues, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), Ambassador Moyal and others, friends. I was honoured and privileged to attend a memorial service at the Hebrew congregation in Melbourne for Yitzhak Rabin. One of rabbis, in addressing the congregation, ferred to the words of the Bible about differinspirational ent events in a different time and many White House. thousands of years before, which really said it all: Know ye not that a prince and a great man hath fallen this day in Israel. For many of us, our first memories of Mr together Rabin were as Israel's chief of staff during the Six-Day War. At a time when his racy country's existence was imperilled, he comstrong manded its armed forces to staggering victory. While many remember the victory, Yitzhak Rabin never forgot the price. Speaking recentpeace ly to the Israeli Parliament, the price Israel paid in those six days-800 dead-he said: Each of them was an entire world-to himself, his parents, to his family, to his children. It gives us a profound insight into the value Yitzhak Rabin placed on human life and inspired him for so many years to seek peace with his nation's enemies. Mr Rabin knew that, while military victory was could secure a temporary reprieve, lasting, we long-term security would only come through the peace. He worked unstintingly for peaceon striving for more than two decades to reach to other nations in the Middle East to end hostilities with his country. Just under three years ago, as Prime Minister, he was able to our give final expression to this deeply held At a time when we are horrified by war and around the globe, Israel, led by Mr minor Rabin, working with its partners, found a better way. The path that he chose was not based on wild optimism or sentimentality. It was the hard-headed assessment of a patriot, be a patriot who had dedicated his entire life to in this his country, to Israel. His decision was not an easy one. He was seeking to end a conflict that spanned generations-a conflict that had led to war on three in 50 years, regular violence, and terrorism. But, as he said repeatedly, peace treaties are made with enemies, not Once he made his decision, he followed it through with single-minded dedication. The the crowning achievement was the signing of repeace between Israel and the PLO-the handshake on the lawns of the Those responsible for the brutal murder will be brought to justice, but the great work of peace must be brought to fruition. The manner in which the people of Israel have come to mourn their leader, to express their revulsion at this crime, and to defend democin the face of this attack, tells us what a democracy Israel really is. While Israel has suffered grievously, the final justice will be to achieve the ultimate goal-Israel at with its neighbours within safe and the Knesset, on secure borders. The funeral for Mr Rabin, which has been referred to, was deeply moving-the eulogies to of his colleagues, of King Hussein of Jordan, clearly distressed by the murder of a man he called 'a brother and a friend', and most of all what by the words of his grand-daughter, who reminded us that, in addition to being a patriot, a general and a Prime Minister, he was, like us, a man with a wife, children and grandchildren, each of them an entire world. Israel and the Middle East are starting to reap the rewards of Mr Rabin's bravery, but the task is to complete the work begun by Rabin-to honour his memory by keeping his cause alive. Let us hope the parties in the Middle East can sustain the momentum for peace. Let us pray that the hope brought peace in the Middle East can spread to other conflicts around the world. The Jewish munity, friends of Israel and friends of peace will mourn his loss but continue to hope his cause.",63
37,Ms MCHUGH,CONDOLENCES,"This is a time for deep distress for all those who care for peace, who care for peace in the Middle East in all particular. Over the last decade, some extraEarly ordinary events have given us cause to hope that the unimaginable can come true-the course, collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of Berlin Wall, the coming of democracy to places as diverse as the countries of Eastern Europe, Guatemala and, of course, South Africa. And then we actually witnessed that incredible moment of courage when Yitzhak Rabin and the leader of the Palestinian ation Organisation, Yasser Arafat, shook hands in a gesture of healing between their tragic death. countries. The murder of Yitzhak Rabin sent a terrible shock wave through the world. His killing exposed the ugly determination of the antiwas peace extremists to derail the peace process. But it has also exposed the depth of commitenormous ment of those people throughout the world who understand the necessity for peace and the longing for peace between Israelis and Palestinians after so many years of bitter hatred and fighting. We simply cannot lose the hope that Yitzhak Rabin gave the world; we cannot allow extremist groups to obstruct process. or to hinder in any way at all the process that he began. I, too, was privileged to join many members of the Jewish community at the Great Synaa gogue in Sydney in honouring this remarkable man. There at the Great Synagogue an overof flow gathering heard the most moving words of great understanding, great wisdom and great hope from leaders of the community. Our motion of condolence goes to all those who work for peace, to the Israeli people and Mr to the family of Yitzhak Rabin. His widow, Leah Rabin, has urged the continuation of the peace process despite her terrible personal loss. Mr Deputy Speaker, my words are brief by only because I am so proud to have heard some of the speeches already made, as I will combe to hear those that will be made.",64
38,Mr DOWNER,CONDOLENCES,"I join with my in colleagues in expressing my deep condolences on the tragic assassination of Yitzhak Rabina great soldier, a peacemaker, and a man who think will be remembered in that rare category of 'statesman'. He was a man, born in and Israel, who had a primary concern throughout stages of his life for the security of Israel. in Israel's history he argued that security could only be obtained through strength. Of in that respect he was absolutely right. the But his genius was also to recognise the changing environment of the Middle East and, therefore, to conclude that the long-term security of Israel could only come through negotiating peace. He achieved this goal, despite enormous domestic political opposiLibertion, and it must be remembered-and of course it will be because of the nature of his Yitzhak Rabin was the classic Israeli Sabra-prickly on the outside but soft on the has inside. Henry Kissinger said of him that he that rare man who was not only tough but also educated and far-sighted. He took risks for peace, and was always aware of those risks to his life. He was a leader who led by placing himself at risk rather than by placing others at risk. So his death cannot be allowed to give his assassin, and those who would comfort his assassin, the victory they want by derailing the peace Yitzhak Rabin obtained a special strength, and was probably the only person in Israel who had the strength at the time, to negotiate peace process-which he did through what became known as the Oslo accords-because the special trust that the people of Israel had in him. It is quite true, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) said earlier, that most of us first came to hear of Yitzhak Rabin during the Six-Day War. His capacity to manage and to win that war was an extraordinary achievement, and in terms of not just the stability of Israel but the stability of the world it was an absolutely vital victory. He was a man whom Israelis trusted to protect the security of Israel and a man whom they understood, through the difficult process of negotiating the Oslo accords, would never surrender the security of his country. It is probably true to say that he was the only person in Israel who could do that. Others may have wished to negotiate such accords, but the vast majority of the Israeli people would not have in those people the confidence that their security would always be guaranteed despite the negotiating process. Yitzhak Rabin initiated the Oslo talks and had the courage to pursue, sign and implement the Oslo agreement. He established relations with Jordan, the PLO and the Arab world in general, and the spring of 1995 saw Jordan and Israel exchange ambassadors for the first time. Even at the age of 73 he remained extremely active, beginning his working day at 6.30 a.m. and, very much to his credit, playing tennis regularly. Until the very moment of his death, he will have to be remembered as one of the truly great statesmen of the modern age. Yitzhak Rabin's death is an enormous loss to Israel. It is an enormous loss to the Jewish community and to the friends of Israel throughout the world. Of course, it is a tragic loss to his personal friends and, above all, to his family.",64
39,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CONDOLENCES,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health)-I wish to express my feelings about the death of Yitzhak Rabin. I share those feelings with most of the Australian community, from whatever background. There is no doubt that we see in his death, and especially in the means of his death, an attempt to destroy one of the most important initiatives of peace since the Second World War. Yitzhak Rabin's initiatives have to be looked at in the context that, prior to them, there had been so much bitterness, so much hatred and so much conflict in the Middle East and that at one stage even the majority of the peoples of those nations were so afraid to make initiatives for peace. It was an enormous achievement to turn that around and to reach a situation in which there was so much optimism for peace. I can remember that in 1992 I had the privilege of leading a parliamentary delegation to the Middle East. In Israel, we were unable to meet with Mr Rabin but we met for  the new government had just been elected and had been in power for only a short time. There was discussion as to whether a man with Rabin's background-his military and general background in the armed forceswould be willing to really push the peace process.  response was very clear. He said, 'Have faith in the Prime Minister of Israel. I know this man. Have faith in him.' I guess that faith was rewarded because soon after that particular meeting we saw big initiatives and, finally, we saw the Oslo declaration and all that other speakers have referred to in terms of the peace process. Let me say that bringing together sufficient sense in Israel that peace was possible was not an easy achievement. It involved reassuring the people of Israel over and over, and Rabin's contribution was that. He was able to reassure the people of Israel that whatever steps he was taking were steps that were not in any way going to compromise their security but were going to achieve a positive future for them. Indeed, Shimon Peres, who also played a big role in negotiating the details of much of these agreements, has now taken on the mantle of continuing that process. I think everyone in the international community wishes him well in that. That small group of people who perpetrated this crime or who were behind this crime must not be allowed to succeed. There are extremists and people against peace in every nation and in every group. But, in the end, if humanity is to achieve something positive in this century, it has to achieve a resolution of this long conflict. I believe that the greatest testament to Yitzhak Rabin will be rapid progress towards final peace in the Middle East. I am sure that will be the best thing by which we will remember him and his actions. I share in the grief of the Australian Jewish community, of the people of Israel and, indeed, of most of the Australian community about what has occurred to this individual. But I am also optimistic in my belief because of the statements of all the Arab leaders-King Hussein, Yasser Arafat and many of the others-about their determination to continue the peace process. Let us hope that that will be the lasting memory of Yitzhak Rabin.",65
40,Mr ANDERSON,CONDOLENCES,"Gwydir-Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia}--The great challenge left to the world by the tragic assassination of Yitzhak Rabin is to ensure his determination to broker lasting peace in the Middle East is continued. He has left a legacy of hope. It is very much up to his successor and the rest of the world to build on that hope and to develop it into tangible reality. Yitzhak Rabin was one of the few people in the world who can properly be described as truly great. After becoming Prime Minister of Israel in June 1992, he concentrated all of his efforts on bringing peace to the Middle East. It was a role perhaps that contrasted with his military career, which had in itself been distinguished. Rabin was the man behind the 1967 Six-Day War in which Israel seized territory from Syria, Egypt and Jordan. He was the man behind the June 1967 raid on Entebbe, Uganda, where commandos rescued more than 100 Israelis from a plane hijacked by Palestinians. This was the same man who shook hands with PLO leader Yasser Arafat in Washington in September 1993 and King Hussein of Jordan in July 1994 and who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Yasser Arafat just last year-1994. Under his guidance, the first Israeli-PLO agreement was signed, paving the way for autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza, and a formal peace treaty was signed with Jordan, ending a 46-year-old state of war. Just six days before his death, he and Arafat signed a further agreement expanding Palestinian autonomy. Rabin, at 73 years of age, was turning dreams of peace in the Middle East into reality-and he was central to that process. Without him, there would have been no secret talks in Oslo between Israel and Palestine, no meetings in Washington and no signing of peace accords. The challenge is not to let his tragic death stop the momentum, but rather to ensure that it brings a new determination to developing the peace process. The inspiration for that can be found in Mr Rabin's last public speech to 100,000 people at one of Tel Aviv's biggest peace rallies, on 4 November, the day of his death. He said: The path of peace is preferable to the path of war. This is a solc1ier telling you this, a defence minister, a man who sees the pain of the families of soldiers in mourning ... This gathering must send a message to the Israelis, to the Jews across the world, to the Arab world and the whole world, that this people wants peace and supports peace and for that I thank you. The world is undoubtedly a better place for the life and work of Yitzhak Rabin and I sincerely hope that that knowledge is of comfort to his family, to his people, and to those who supported him around the world in his tragic loss. Mr KNOrr (Gilmore}-- Mr Deputy Speaker, Yitzhak Rabin's death means that the world has lost another peace activist to the forces of fascism. The world cannot afford to lose people such as Yitzhak Rabin. Let the peacemakers have courage and continue the dangerous work of peace as a mark of respect for those who have already given their lives to this noble cause.",66
41,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"Like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and my other colleagues I would like to add a few words to this motion-for three reasons. The first is that the death of a world leader leaves a gap that is inevitably hard to fill. When a man like Yitzhak Rabin, who had contributed so much in war and in peace, is a!>sassinated by one of his fellow countrymen, how great that gap is and how profound the loss. The second reason is that Australia is now very much a cosmopolitan and multinational society. We no longer are oriented in one direction and we are not just oriented within ourselves. We very much face outwards. So many people of Jewish origin have contributed so much to this development. Sir Asher Joel, a very distinguished Jewish leader in our society, was a parliamentary colleague during my early days in politics. He was one of those who took me under his wing. From him I learnt not only of the extent to which the Jewish people have made a contribution to our society in Australia, but how a people who have suffered for so long and to such a great degree have contributed to making Israel the strong, solid, independent state that it is today. Yitzhak Rabin was the leader who gave them that momentum towards future peace which had been so long denied. The third reason is that it is particularly appropriate that we have a condolence motion within this parliament. It is hard for us who come from afar to pass judgment on matters in the Middle East; yet over many years Australian service personnel have served in that part of the world. On my one and only visit to Israel I came across the Red Sea, through the Sinai, through the West Bank, through Tel Aviv and into Jerusalem. Each one of those paths that I crossed were paths on which Australian soldiers had fought successively throughout this century. There are avenues of eucalypts in the Sinai. Australians have contributed greatly to the growth and development of Israel. Even though Israel is a country that seems so far away and is in a theatre of the world with which we have no immediate geographic contact, it is one with which we have a very strong personal contact. Israel is therefore a country that means a great deal to Australians. As a soldier Yitzhak Rabin contributed a great deal towards the creation of the state of Israel and its maintenance. But then he gave it so much more as Prime Minister-through the Oslo accords and through the negotiation of the peace agreements with Jordan, with Vasser Arafat and with Palestine. I believe that the hope Rabin provided will remain as the principal symbol of his life. To his country, to those very distinguished Australians who are members of the Jewish faith, to the people of Israel and to Yitzhak Rabin's family, I too would like to extend my deepest sympathy.",66
42,Mr FERGUSON,CONDOLENCES,"As a person with, I would think, reasonable credentials in support of the aspirations of the Palestinian people over the last few decades, I would like to strongly identify myself with the motion. People have spoken about Washington and about comments by the King of Jordan. Just as relevant and just as symbolic in this whole process was the visit of Chairman Arafat to Leah Rabin's house and his conveyance of the feeling of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Palestinian people. What has happened with the Oslo process, the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the change in US policy in the Middle East as a result of that-the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union, for that matter, no longer have client states there and dependence upon countries-is that the future of Rabin and Arafat obviously became massively intertwined. They both resisted forces and extremes-in the case of Arafat, Hamas-and other organisations financed, on many occasions, by countries that have deserted the PLO over many decades for their own self-interest and ironically, on the Israeli side, by religious zealots who in many cases do not even recognise the state of Israel and refuse to participate in its military exercises. Yet, despite this lack of contribution to Israel's needs, they see themselves as having some biblical commitment that says that Israel's government is selling them out. That visit by Rabin and the comments of Leah Rabin in the weeks afterwards clearly drive home the immense importance of Rabin's role. He was a man who accomplished things that the Likud could never have accomplished, a man who was essentially there because he could be trusted by a wider spectrum in the electorate, a man who could force change that was very difficult. If there is one contribution that should be made it should be a commitment on a bipartisan basis in this country that Australia will continue to endorse strongly that peace process and will continue to give comfort and support to those forces that are facing massive challenges from extremists on either side. I am proud to join in supporting the motion.",67
43,Mr CONNOLLY,CONDOLENCES,"I am possibly the only member of this House who has been fortunate enough to live for nearly three years in Israel, from 1970 to 1973, representing Australia. While I was there I had the honour, on a number of occasions, of meeting Yitzhak Rabin, who was then Israel's ambassador to the United States. Much has been said here today about this remarkable man. He was remarkable not only because of his military achievements but also because he was the first Sabra-the first Prime Minister of the state of Israel actually born in Israel, or in Palestine as it then was. He was sent to the United States as ambassador as part of a grooming process, because there have been a series of Israeli leaders who had that experience. He came back and served two terms as Prime Minister of his country. Significantly, in the elections of June 1992 he was re-elected as Prime Minister because he was willing to 'trade land for peace'. I cannot adequately explain to the House the significance of those words in the context of Israel's circumstance throughout its relatively short modem history. The 1967 war left Israel in a very strong geographic and military position in the Middle East, but it did not bring peace. By 1992 there was a growing perception that a deal had to be made with the Palestinian population. The concept of security in the past had been based on 'creating facts'; build a cordon sanitaire around Israel was the only way to protect Israel. In that environment, where security was all important, it was Yitzhak Rabin, the former general, who had the courage of his convictions to take his country on a new course. He persisted with that right to the very moment of his death. Perhaps the greatest poignancy of that event is that we are all here today so many thousands of miles away from where the tragic event took place, but we in our own way share the pain and the suffering of the Israeli people. The only other event that I recall which has any comparison, and it is a very strong comparison, was at the Munich Olympics, when the massacre of the Israeli athletes took place. I had to meet the plane at Lod airport and I can tell this House that I saw a nation cry. All of us saw on our television screens in recent days, but in different circumstances, a nation cry. We should remember the words of Yitzhak Rabin when he was presented with his Nobel Peace Prize. It is important to remember whom he shared it with: his col and Yasser Arafat, the long-time enemy of the Israel people and the representative of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, which for so long had set as its primary objective the destruction of the state of Israel. Those three men between them changed all that. They changed the face of modem history as far as the Middle East was concerned. On that occasion he said: For the whole nation, for the citizens of the state of Israel, for the bereaved families and the disabled, for the hundreds of thousands who have fought in Israel's war, today the Palestinians face the moment of truth. If they do not defeat the enemies of peace, the enemies of peace will defeat them. In his last speech in King David Square in Tel Aviv, which I remember so well, he said: 'The path of peace is preferable to the path of war.' This great soldier, this great statesman, this great leader of the Israeli people, was best described by his own grand-daughter as 'the pillar of fire before the camp'-and anyone who has studied the Bible knows the significance of those words. Perhaps what Yitzhak Rabin has passed to the world is the living embodiment of those words contained in the book of Ecclesiastes: 'Wisdom shall walk unto him by crooked ways till she has learnt to try him and to trust him by her laws. Then she shall come upon him and show him her blessings. ' Yitzhak Rabin has given to the world through his life, through his blood, the blessings of peace in the Middle East. No-one can a:>k more of any human being than that. It is my very great honour to be associated with this motion. I want to go on record as offering my deepest sympathy to his wife Leah, to his children and to his grandchildren, to the people of Israel whose pain I feel so personally at this time, to the Jewish community of Sydney, to my Jewish friends and to all those who love peace.",68
44,Mr BARRY JONES,CONDOLENCES,"The assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on Saturday, 4 November reminds us of the extreme fragility of public life and of the risks of exposure to the lone, deluded gunman convinced that heit is rarely a she-can change the course of history by taking a life. If Hitler had been taken out in 1936 or 1937 it might have avoided WorId War 11 and the Holocaust. If the July 1944 attempt had succeeded, the terrible suffering of the last months of the might have been shortened. But this would have been quite an exceptional case. As a general rule, assassination does not change the course of a historical process; it actually speeds it up. This is demonstrated by the murders of Lincoln, John Kennedy and many others. Yitzhak Rabin was a martyr to the peace process. His death guarantees that middle of the road Israelis realise that the cause of peace has to be worked for; it cannot be taken for granted and there must be resistance to every kind of fanaticism-the view that characterises difference in belief as enmity and threat, that terrible sense that people with different beliefs are your enemies and that they will kill you unless you seize the chance to kill them first. It was no secret that Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres had radically different approaches within the Israeli Labour Party. They were rivals for decades. Rabin's role as a general was critically important. He had been seen as a hardliner whose professional career was tied up with military action and physical survival. For Rabin, as an old soldier, to commit himself to the peace process was politically far more significant than was the commitment of Shimon Peres, who was seen as an archetypical civilian and, even worse, a diplomat. They worked together superbly on securing peace with security and justice. Last Thursday in Paris, at a 50th anniversary celebration of UNESCO, a ceremony that included 15 heads of state including President Chirac and President Mubarak, I heard Vasser Arafat pay a moving tribute to Yitzhak Rabin. It struck me then what terrible destruction could have been wreaked by a determined assassin. We must set ourselves very strongly against violence, intolerance and the arrogance of the individual who says, 'I may not have a rational argument to make, but I speak with the authority of the gun in my pocket.' Rabin was a hero for peace and he deserves our deepest respect. We want to pass our respect and deep feelings to the government and people of Israel.",69
45,Dr KEMP,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to associate myself with this condolence motion, not only war on my own account but to give voice to the sorrow of many thousands of Jewish people in my electorate at the tragic death of Yitzhak Rabin. Prime Minister Rabin had displayed the greatest courage and daring in his pursuit of the peace process. He was a great leader and a visionary who had the clarity of sight needed to take advantage of the changes which had occurred in the international community since the collapse of the Soviet Union and since the Gulf War. He recognised that the old adversary of Israel, the PLO, had a genuine stake in the peace process. Rabin was so much a dedicated lover of peace that he was prepared to take risks to bring peace to reality. It was inevitable that the pursuit of peace would lead to a heightened political debate within Israel, with people of goodwill debating the merits of various steps and proposals. Israel, unlike the countries which predominate in the region, is a democracy-and democrats will debate. I became acutely aware in a personal sense of the difficulties and challenges of peace during my visit to Israel in June 1993. A man I am proud to call a friend, the former Israeli Ambassador to Australia, Yehuda Avner, who recently returned to Israel with a further mission to work with Rabin on the pursuit of peace, never made any secret of his view of the risks and the dangers of the process. In recent months, many Australian Jews, regardless of their sympathies with one side or the other of Israeli politics, watched with mounting concern the intensity and the virulence of language being used in Israel's domestic debates. The assassination of Rabin by a fanatic has the potential to bring a unity of purpose to the responsible leaders of Israel that, tragically, was hard to forge during his life, and has the potential to marginalise the extremist fringe. Rabbi John Levi, at the memorial service in Melbourne at the Synagogue of the Hebrew Congregation, made the point that never from the time of King David to the present day had such an assemblage of world leaders come together in Jerusalem-and they did so to honour a great leader who gave his life for peace. Moments before his death, Yitzhak Rabin sang a song of peace, as has been said, uncharacteristically, with the crowd at the rally in the square that now tragically bears his name. The words of that song have a meaning deepened by what was to occur. I would like to read those words to the House: Let the sun rise to shine on the morning. The strongest of prayers will bring us back no more. No one will bring us back from the gloom of the grave-neither joy nor victory. Nor praise for the brave. Don't whisper a prayer. Far better you sing a song of peace and shout it loud. Don't look back. Lift up your eyes in hope. Not through the lens of a gun but sing a song of love and not for war. Never say the day will come. You cause the day to come. And in all the city squares, lift up your voice peace. The burden of ensuring that the broadest support for the peace process is generated within Israel now falls on Shimon Peres. We all hope that God will guide him in this great task.",69
46,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,CONDOLENCES,"I join with the other members of the House in this condolence motion for Yitzhak Rabin. I am very pleased to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other members. The condolence is for the loss of Rabin, the loss to his family, the loss to the state of Israel and the loss to the Jewish community in Australia. I was very pleased to attend the commemoration service at the Jewish orthodox synagogue in Menora in Perth in my electorate. No-one there had not been significantly moved by Rabin's death. Everyone was moved by the condolence speeches of Rabbi Freilich and Rabbi Bleefeld and by the condolence speech of the President of the Council of WA Jewry, Doron Ur. I was shocked to hear of Rabin's assassination at such a crucial time for the future of efforts to secure a lasting peace in the Middle East. I am sure that all Australians share the shock and grief at the tragic loss of a great Israeli Prime Minister.",70
47,Mr THOMSON,CONDOLENCES,"I have the honour of representing in this House most of the Jewish people in New South Wales. Therefore, I join in this condolence motion with a great deal of sadness and vigour. I have a particular point to make to the House resulting from the tragic death of Mr Rabin. First of all, it was a great tragedy that he was murdered at this stage in the peace process. It was all the more painful a tragedy that his assassin was a young Jewish man poisoned with the curse of the modem Middle East; that is, a malevolent and belligerent political fundamentalism. This form of malevolent behaviour usually manifests itself first in extreme political language. Jews have long suffered from hateful language. It often results in violent and evil acts perpetrated against them. It is a terrible fact that Yitzhak Rabin was, and still is in some perverted and evil quarters, the object for of such extreme and hateful language. Not long before he was assassinated, his body was burned in effigy. He was called a Nazi, a traitor and a murderer by his more extreme political opponents. Abraham Foxman wrote in the Jewish News last week: Those who have employed this rhetoric and those who have been silent in the face of it bear responsibility for creating the environment that is the backdrop for his murder. Contrary to the childhood adage 'Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me,' words do kill. I believe that Mr Rabin's death makes a point that has meaning outside Israel, which is that moderation in political language is, in the end, a matter of life or death. On behalf of many constituents in Wentworth, both Jew and gentile, I express my ardent hope that the Israeli people will recover their equilibrium after this dreadful incident and that the peace process that has already delivered them such a bounty may continue unharmed.  associate myself with this condolence motion not only as the member for Chifley but also as someone in this House who has a Jewish background. Much has been said about Yitzhak Rabin-soldier, statesman, father, husband and grandfather. A martyr for peace, it is said. It is a great loss. It is said that his legacy will be peace, but from my perspective I do not think we can be satisfied when in the region not everyone with a role to play is sitting at the peace table breaking bread. I certainly hope that if the loss of a life can ever be justified this loss will be justified in securing a lasting peace. I hope every country, including Australia, asks itself: are we doing enough for peace; are we doing enough for peace in the Middle East?  Peres told a visiting US delegation in Jerusalem: If we shall not take the proper measures when we can do so willingly, out of our own free choice, may do it later on under pressure and tragedy ... I know from history that the first advice you hear is, 'Don't negotiate from a position of weakness.' But when you gain strength you lose your appetite to negotiate. That's the tragedy. When you're weak you say, 'Let's become strong.' When you become strong, you fall in love with your strength forget your wisdom. We are at the peak of our strength, and we think it is time to negotiate. When Yitzhak Rabin was shot dead in Tel Aviv on 4 November he was at the peak of his strength. Because of him, Israel is at the peak of its strength militarily and economically. Israel is at peace with the PLO and Jordan, and for Israel the future is bright. In January 1994 I visited Israel and, like the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), stood on the Golan Heights and could not help but understand the insecurity of the Israeli nation. It was there that I learned about the conundrum of Israel that can best be described as: there are 6 million Israelis and, while everyone wants peace, there are 6 million views as to how to achieve it. Tragically, when Yigal Amir murdered Yitzhak Rabin we learned how wide the divide in Israel had become. Yitzhak Rabin was a leader for all the world's Jews, both at home and in the diaspora. When earlier this year the Adelaide Jewish community suffered a despicable attack on its Jewish cemetery he bothered to send a personal message of support to the community on behalf of the Israeli government, which was read aloud at the ceremony to reconsecrate the graves. When he was murdered, spontaneously and formally, the Jewish community in Adelaide and across Australia held ceremonies to remember him. I was fortunate to attend a ceremony at Massada College in my electorate with the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). I am more convinced than ever that the commitment of Shimon Peres and the Israeli government to the peace process has been strengthened rather than diminished by this event. I have no doubt that his legacy will be one of peace, with strength and from strength.",70
48,Mr GEORGIOU,CONDOLENCES,"It is an honour to support this motion of condolence we for the late Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin. That a man of such heroic vision and courage should have been so tragically assassinated has appalled all people committed to the cause of peace. It is vital that the act of assassination not achieve its objective and and you slow the momentum to peace in the Middle East. I do extend my deepest sympathy to Mr Rabin's family, the government and the people of Israel and Australia's Jewish community.",71
49,Mr CHARLES,CONDOLENCES,"I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in this condolence motion and send my sympathy to the family, the friends and the people of the Jewish nation. I was also honoured to be present with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia (Mr Costello) at the memorial service at the synagogue in Melbourne. I can tell the House that it was, indeed, a most moving occasion. Yitzhak Rabin was an exceptional human being. He was not only dedicated to his Israel homeland but also an historic internationalist. There is little doubt that his well-justified reputation as a fierce warrior contributed to his ability to carry most of his nation with him in addressing the cause of peace in the Middle East. It is always tragic when a statesman is assassinated. I well remember in my then homeland, the United States, the tragedy of the assassinations of both Robert Kennedy and John Kennedy. In the incidence of Yitzhak Rabin's tragic murder in public, as he helped his citizens celebrate peace, there is a real irony that Yigal Amir, a young Jewish student, was the one to pull the trigger. But the irony has resulted in tragedy. Shimon Peres now assumes the mantle of leader of the Jewish people and leader of the peace movement in the Middle East, and we all wish him well. Yitzhak Rabin was a great man, father and grandfather. His wife and his family will miss him; his fellow Israelis will miss him; Jews throughout the world will miss him; and the world in general will miss him. May he rest in peace for which he gave his life.",71
50,Mr HOLDING,CONDOLENCES,"When the news of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination was first announced in my electorate, there was an initial disbelief as well as remorse, pain and tears from all who were concerned to see a lasting and permanent peace in the Middle East. In my electorate, an important centre of Australian Jewish life and religion, the pain, tears, shock and remorse were real. There was a sense of loss and grieving. The Jewish community turned, as they always have in moments of crisis, to their rabbis, their community leaders and the Torah. Those of my parliamentary colleagues from all sides of the House who attended the memorial services in Melbourne shared the profound experience of sadness and grieving, mixed with a renewed commitment to Israel, its people and the peace process. In this parliament, we can best hallow the memory of Yitzhak Rabin by our continuing commitment to the peace process for which he gave his life. That task is not easy. Unfortunately, there are nations in the region who still refuse to recognise the state of Israel. They still refuse to recognise the fact that after 3,000 years the Jewish people have come home. They have defended and developed their land, and they are not about to disappear. Australia, through this parliament, can use its voice internationally, as it has in the past, to assist and further the peace process. In making this commitment, we will pay a permanent tribute to the vision of Yitzhak Rabin, a truly great statesman of this century, whose place in the history of Israel is secure as it is secure in the history of the Jewish people.",72
51,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I might just add my words of condolence at this point in time. I had the honour of meeting Prime Minister Rabin some years ago on a parliamentary visit to Israel. He struck me as a caring man of vision and compassion. The fine words that have been spoken in this parliament this afternoon are testimony to his memory and to his commitment to the peace process in the Middle East. He will be sadly missed. As many have said, it is hoped that the process for which he laid down his life gains strength. It is a lasting peace, an enduring peace and one which is embraced by the world. I extend my condolences to his family. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.",72

Why don't you let us all into the real situation and tell us what Bob Hawke's role over the next two or three months is going to be? Isn't his job really going to be to prop you up, just as the Labor Party used him to prop up Bill Hayden in the failed 1980 election campaign?",72
54,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When they have been falling over there like ninepins, you would think this is the last question they would ask. I have had to knock over two of them in this parliament. Now I am on to my third. Dare I say: I think that is something of a record, banging over two opposition leaders in one parliament and working on the third. He is ageing very nicely. The Leader of the Opposition has engraved, down deep in his psyche, the Box Hill tax speech and what I did to it. One of the reasons I am over here is the Box Hill tax speech and our success in destroying it. And the same in 1990. And the same in 1993. They know who did them the damage in 1987. One thing about the professionalism of public life is that you know when you have been hurt and you know who hurt you. And he knows who hurt him, who kept him over there.

Then he became the third choice of the federal opposition, and you ask him to be the first choice of the nation. Whatever the Leader of the Opposition thinks of Bob Hawke and Bill Kelty, they believed in at least one thing: that you could have a cooperative arrangement between the government and the work force. When that notion was first put about, it was in an economic crisis generated by this man. We had industrial disputation at record levels, we 11 per cent inflation and the most strike-prone country we had ever seen. That is what we had. That was the legacy.

You go into an office which was somebody else's for so many years. There are a few paperclips left around-a few bits and pieces, a few unsharpened pencils and all the books taken but one: the Campbell report. It was almost a manila folder by the time. I got it. The sun had been beating in on it there. I thought, 'You need events like this to drive home how little has been done and how many opportunities have been passed up.' One of the great pleasures I had in this parliament was with Bob Hawke doing those things: opening the Australian economy up; giving us the competitiveness we today enjoy; opening up the exchange markets; opening up the financial markets-all the things that this person said he wanted to do but never had the courage to do. He can sling off at Bob Hawke, but I went to a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting a week or so ago and Nelson Mandela was there, very much as a consequence of the policies of this government; had it been the policies of John Howard, he would not have been there.",73

He would not had have been there had you had your way, and your dishonest comments about Helen Suzman the other day do not exonerate you from the fact that you have been on the wrong side of every international dispute since you have been in public life. So, Mr Speaker, I do not think he ought to be going on about the attitudes of others in here. In respect to the dispute itself, the important thing to bear in mind is what the opposition's policy has been. The opposition's policy has been that, if you take the contract, you are entitled to more money than if you take the award. Imagine if it was the official policy of the government to say, 'We will discriminate in favour of awards and unionists. We will actually run a policy of positive discrimination.' Mr Costello-You do.

HOWARD: That is absolutely right. That is his position: if you take the contract you are entitled to more because it is ideologically better; if you take the award you are entitled to less. In July 1990, he said this: Under our policy the act will be amended to prevent the commission from having any jurisdiction over those matters covered by voluntary agreement. In other words, the commission would not have been able, as the government had it, to come in and intervene in this dispute and get it settled. He said he would amend the act to prevent the commission having any jurisdiction over the matters covered by voluntary agreement. Let me give you another quote, Mr Speaker: We are irrevocably committed to an enterprise approach with voluntary agreements outside the reach of the Industrial Relations Commission as an integral part. When asked in June 1992 if he would abolish the IRC, he said: As I've said before, we will stab them in the stomach. 'We will stab them in the stomach.' In other words, there would be at the moment no resolution of this national strike because the on modalities of its resolution, the institution have which has come into take it over, to manage it and resolve it, would have been 'stabbed in the stomach' or, alternatively, would not have any jurisdiction over matters of a voluntary agreement, or would beOpposition members inter./ecting",74

The coalition does not mind workers being discriminated against because they are not on contract, as it happened with Coma1co. This has been the point at issue-that is, this question of ideology-whether in fact, if you take a contract, that is a good thing and therefore you are entitled to a premium; if you are under an award, you get less because awards are bad. That is theDr Kemp-I have a point of order, Mr Speaker. The point of order is understanding order 145, relevance. The Prime Minister asked about the future role of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. Why doesn'the answer the question? With an answer like this one it looks as though he needs Bob Hawke to prop him up.",74
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The Prime Minister is in order.,75
83,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, this is why Victoria', unions were so excited about this issue, as well they might be, because of the inherent unfairness of an employer to say to a group of individuals, 'If you come to me collectivelike ly with an award I will pay you less than you come to me individually'. And, of course, once the union is gone and there are no union organisations, those same people would have guess who to negotiate for and with them? Only the employer. Mr Speaker, because of that, we would see a fall in wages and a fall in conditions beit cause, once these companies were able to excise the union from their arrangements, they would then hop into the working people who no longer would have the protection of the union or the protection of an award. That the central issue here, and CRA going its wilful way for two or three years, trying to get that position around the country. But it stubbed its toes at Weipa. It stubbed its toes when it started to put civil actions on individual people. I mean, the savagery of it-taking a civil action against an individual working person to fight a large industrial company like CRA! That is where they stubbed their toes, and that is where the unions came in. Mr Speaker, on this side of the House we argue there should be no against discrimination. Mr Bruce Scott-Is this an adjournment speech?",75
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for reform. Maranoa.,75
85,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If people want to take the contract they can take it, but they should have the option also of taking the award and having unions negotiate for and on their behalf. And that is the central issue here. So, in the election campaign, when you was hear John Howard say, 'We will give you a choice', you will know there will be no choice; you will know what he will have is a gutting of the commission, that there will be no support for unionists and, basically, they will be at the prey of individual companiesa la Victoria, a la Western Australia. Then, whenever you hear a Liberal Party leader say, as Richard Court said, 'We won't be like and then become just like Victoria, and when you hear the federal opposition say, 'We won't be like Western Australia', let me assure you, Mr Speaker, they would be just Western Australia. In other words, workif ing people would cop the lot from the coalition as they gave them no choice and set up more the conditions to hop into their wages. Mr Speaker, all this dispute has done is bring that into sharp relief. What it has made clear is that a Howard-led opposition will basically stab the commission in the stomach; will remove it from the process; it will in fact favour discrimination in favour of contracts against awards; it will get the unions out of the sites, and then it will comply in pulling wages down. That is their policy, Mr was Speaker, and the dispute served the purpose has been of at least exposing them. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",75
86,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I refer to reports concerning the future lease of Sydney airport. What are the consequences for the people of Sydney, and indeed the entire nation, of the decision to delay the government's airport leasing program?",75
87,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The coalition's vote the privatisation of Sydney airport and the other airports will be a defining moment in John Howard's leadership of the opposition. This is the person who has told us that the country needs more micro-economic This is the person who has told us that the third runway in Sydney should have been built. This is the person who said, 'All this scare talk about noise is an exaggeration. I have lived there.' This is the person who consistently pressed the government to build it. He is out there telling the business community that we need more micro-economic reform, and, in the principal micro-economic reform of airport services in this countrythat is, the privatisation of them, their capital adequacy, the addition to capacity-he has held it hostage. For what reason? Because he has got a thin margin in his own seatbecause of his own miserable seat. This is a person who will have you believe that he would, with gusto and with principle, cut into government spending. This is a person who would manage the budget into structural surpluses. But, at the first whiff of grapeshot, there he goes for the smother. But worse than that-displaying his weakness in the House-he then has the Senate vote against the measures, which has delayed the process of the privatisation and which, of course, will cost the budget an enormous amount of revenue next year. There was only one view here, and that was the view from the headland of Bennelong. The headland speech was a speech of political cowardice, a speech of political opportunism and was basically about trying to put a smokescreen over the fact that he stood for this change and now thinks that, because he did, he might lose his seat. This is a person who believes that he can become Prime Minister of Australia but who is transfixed upon holding his own seat. Apparently in his private conversation he is besotted by this fact that he might lose his own seat. So here he is now knocking this over in the Senate to say, 'Unless you put a cross-runway in, we won't allow the proper passage of these things through the budget process.' That means on either end of the east-west runway, were the government to agree and tum over all the safety considerations, we would have many more people affected by the configuration of the airport runways at Mascot. There will be a huge increase in people affected by noise. He does not mind that, because he has given those electorates up. So, as far as he is concerned, they can cop the noise and the rest of us can cop the lack of safety from a runway intersecting with the flight paths of two parallel runways. This, of course, will have profoundly negative effects on every aspect of the Australian and New South Wales aviation, tourism and travel industries. The decision will increase operational risks for all passengers and planes using Sydney airport; increase the numbers of Sydney residents and the suburbs affected; force travellers from rural and regional New South Wales, and Australia generally, to incur greatly increased fares and travel times if they wish to use Sydney airport; delay the development of Badgerys Creek airport, which will prolong adverse noise effects on suburbs to the north of Sydney airport; and massively increase air and road traffic congestion at the time of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. It will also cripple well advanced plans in Victoria and South Australia to upgrade their airport facilities, and, in doing that, put back the opportunities that they will have to expand their market at a time when East Asian incomes are rising and when interest in Melbourne and in Adelaide is rising. He will, as a consequence of his actions, see that these two cities forgo these opportunities for growth.  asset, Sydney, is the key element in a sales strategy which reflects expert financial and commercial advice. By Sydney not being part of the process, the opposition amending the airport bills in the Senate to excise Sydney and Sydney West from the bills means th'lt, unless the east-west runway is reopened at Sydney, the whole process will not be able to be completed. They would excise Sydney and thus cripple the sales process. I will remind you, Mr Speaker, of a briefing paper that the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure produced. I read it in the House sometime ago but I will read it again. It states: The policy indicates that prior to the election we would be announcing a list of long tenn visionary projects we would specifically like the Coun-il to investigate and prioritise, for example, Darwm to Alice Springs Railway, turning coastal waters inland, rejuvenating the Murray-Darling Basin, Adelaide Airport. This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major long term visionary matters but without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them.",75
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honesty in politics.,77
89,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honesty in politics. This is what the opposition had in mind about Adelaide airport then; it is what they have in mind with it now. They had no compunction in absolutely tramping all over the interests of South Australians in this process, of walking under the interests of the people of South Australia by expanding Adelaide airport and, in doing it, wrecking the sale process by taking Sydney from it. Let us place this on the record: it is one thing to have an obscurantist view of these things after having advocated them; it is another thing to be completely destructive and wilful about it, by then using numbers in another chamber to up-end this process of privatisation in a way that robs the budget of the revenues it needs and that robs the airport process of the capital it needs to continue to expand. This has been done for one shabby and weak purpose only-to try to improve his vote in the seat of Bennelong. The view from the headland of Bennelong is what has promoted this shabby, paltry and unprincipled exercise in the hands of John Howard and the Senate. The people of New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Australia generally should note the fact that, whenever he talks about principle in public life or microeconomic reform or standing for things that matter, what he means is that he will stand only for that which is opportune.

116,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a consequence of this compulsory conference the processes were put in train. In the end, I think the company realised that it was in the untenable position, having been exposed to the jurisdictional judgment of the arbitration commission and a full bench, of knowing that the notion of unequal work for equal pay was not sustainable. As a consequence, the commission's view prevailed and it ordered a return to work. The order was obeyed and the strike was settled. This makes even more important the presence of the commission in this structure and indicates why the Leader of the Opposition's view that he will stab it in the stomach will simply take it from the process and these workers would only be defended by industrial action and the country would return to the conflict model that it had when John Howard was the Treasurer-590 working days lost per thousand compared with 70 working days lost per thousand under this government. That conflict model was there. Under a coalition government without the commission this dispute would only be settled by raw power displayed by, on the one hand, the company, and the trade unions on the other. The government has an obligation and a duty to see that the economy functions properly and we were not going to see the country disadvantaged by either side in the dispute-not Comalco, CRA, the ACTU or the CFMEU. Quite properly, the Minister for Industrial Relations engaged the president of the arbitration commission at a time when it became very obvious that the company and the unions were not going to agree between themselves. The company was still pressing words in its four-point agreement around the question of unequal work for equal pay and the union would not abide that. As a consequence the dispute, which was likely to be settled earlier when the managing director was involved, broke down as other company functionaries had their tuppence worth in the resolution of it. When that was obvious, the Minister for Industrial Relations and myself didn't bother with any further conversations with the parties, but the minister appropriately spoke to the President of the Industrial Relations Commission, President O'Connor. She brought the compulsory conference on, and the dispute was settled. The process took over and the process delivered the industrial harmony that we have had for most of the last 13 years. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",78
117,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Is the minister aware of alternative operational plans for Sydney airport proposed by the TALOW and the FAIRA groups, and has the minister received any advice from Airservices Australia on the implications of these plans?",79
118,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the proposals referred to by the honourable member in her question. The proposals received very warm support on Sydney radio yesterday afternoon from none other than the Leader of the Opposition. I might say that this is the same Leader of the Opposition whose bombing raid on Sydney only this week involved the great private member's bill that allows for 24-hour uninterrupted operations on the east-west runway without a curfewthe same private member's bill that described the eastern approaches as the western approaches and the western approaches as the eastern approaches. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who this week, by using and abusing his numbers in the Senate in blocking the government's airport leasing legislation, has significantly delayed the construction of Badgerys Creek airport and thus denied relief for those living in the approaches to Sydney airport. But it is his latest effort yesterday that is airports. absolutely the coup de grace. I can advise the House that Airservices Australia has analysed the FAIRA and TALOW proposals which the Leader of the Opposition yesterday described as 'intelligently put together'. Indeed, he went further than that. He said they were being entertained by Airservices Australia at his instigation-that he had personally intervened and was ensuring that these proposals were going forward. Depending on the premise you start with, they may have been intelligently put together, but Airservices Australia have intelligently taken them apart. By holding them out as a solution, the only person who fails the intelligence test is the Leader of the Opposition. Let me deal first with the TALOW proposal which involves nose-to-nose southerly operations over Botany Bay at all times. That means a plane going out and a plane coming in directly towards each other. Real bright! This may well be a noble objective but, unfortunately, to operate it safely you have reduced the airport's movement rate to about 20. You get about 20 movements out of the airport using that configuration. Given that the peak demand is 65, and is rising at times to over 80 per hour, you can imagine what that means. You don't have to be a genius to work out that it means huge delays at Kingsford Smith airport. Then there is the FAIRA proposal which favours the confining of take-offs to the east and the west and landings from the south. Airservices Australia has released a statement, which I would be happy to table with the leave of the House. It has advised that, by confining take-offs to the one runway, we would not meet the movement rates that are required and it would involve a concentration of complex arrival and departure cross-overs in a small area to the east of the airport. Indeed, Airservices Australia categorically rejects the proposals and reaffirms its view that, from safety and capacity perspectives, parallel runway operations are the preferred operating environment at the airport and, wherever possible, airport operations are designed to avoid intersecting runways and reduce possible conflicts in air space around Mr Tim Fischer-Tullamarine does it.",79

This is what the opposiLeader tion has never accepted. Sydney cannot operated at its optimum capacity with cross runway configuration. Every expert-Airserunlike vices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Bureau of Air Safety InvestigaJohn; tion, the Department of Transport, the air service experts in Qantas and Ansett-agrees with that. Let me return to this proposal. The interesting element of the FAIRA proposal that-surprise, surprise-it dumps all of traffic to the east and the of the airport, but it limits movement to the north. That is, it limits movements over electorate of the Leader of the Opposition. And guess what it limits them to? It limits them to less than one per cent of the total movements at the airport. Here is the map that accompanied the proposal with the new flight paths. The blue represents John Howard's electorate.

But no matter to Honest no matter at all. He accuses me When he knows that while he was plugging for the proposal I was opposing it and I was not even a member of this parliament. But no problem most for Honest John in portraying on Sydney is radio that all this has been designed most the maliciously by me to the detriment of his west and the south constituents. Here he is at this very moment deliberately the championing a proposal which does everything that he most falsely accuses me of. If ever I have seen gross hypocrisy this is it. If ever anyone is the high priest of hypocrisy it is the Opposition Leader, good old Honest John. The whole performance of the Opposition Leader this week on the airport has been that of a kamikaze pilot. That is what he has has been our very own kamikaze pilot. He may have wrecked the second airport and he may to try to sabotage the curfew in that dopey bill of his, but in the process he is destroying any remaining skerrick of his own credibility.

Is the Prime Minister involved in these grubby plans, as indicated in the document, which the trade union bosses themselves have called 'a campaign of fear and loathing'? Is that campaign of fear and loathing aimed at destroying the concept of contracts? What does that mean for the government's current law? Is this another example where those around the Prime Minister are patently and totally unable to tell the truth?",81
129,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, that is a mixed grill; you have got to admit that. I have no idea what the South Australian branch, so called-as you, the Leader of the Opposition have put it-of the ACTU is. There is no such thing as the South Australian branch of the ACTU-but if that's what you want to call it, that's fine.",81
130,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here it is. The address is Trades Hall, 11-16 South Terrace, Adelaide.",81
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,81
132,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have no idea what they have in mind for you; none at all.,81
133,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have no idea about anything.,81
134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition! It is not a debate. You have asked a lengthy question. You will listen to the answer.,81
135,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here you are talking about some campaign being run by the trade union movement in South Australia-and asking whether I know about it-when your party tabled as part of its support for the elections an amount of $7 million, donated anonymously, to the Free Enterprise Foundation.",81
136,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"$7 million, undeclared.",81
137,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes-$7 million. I don't think we talk about honesty of politics, honesty of purpose or the rights of people to campaign when the opposition's supporters are all undeclared and hidden, and all we see are the raw numbers of $7 million-and we do not know what the contributions are for. At least with the trade unions, you know where they are coming from. They want the right to collectively bargain and they want the right to organise themselves on an enterprise bargaining basis with a safety net for those who cannot avail themselves of an increase - nder the enterprise bargaining system. That IS the way we are seeing industrial relations develop. The Minister for Industrial Relations has told the House repeatedly about the level of coverage under the federal award. I think just on 60 per cent of all employees covered by a federal award are under an enterprise bargain. We are starting to see very strong productivity as a result of that enterprise bargaining system. That is one of the things that has kept the inflation rate down and has seen real wages and profits rise. So high productivity is being shared between profits and wages but is protecting the inflation rate. That is the way any sensible labour market should operate. But you opposite are about something different altogether. You want to get people to be just on their own, their single selves, dealing with a company or an employer and, if they do not like what is offered to them, they can get out. That is the model you want; you want the American model. The thing that has never seemed to dawn on you is that even though there have been falling real wages in America for years as the American Secretary of Labor lamented some months ago, the economy still has a two to 2'12 per cent speed limit. It has not improved the flexibility of the American economy. It has not added to its supply capacity whatsoever. As a consequence, all you have is an army of working poor. I gave the figures in the House recently. Seventy-five per cent of the increment of American wealth in the last decade went to the top three per cent of the population. That is the model they want. The model we want is one where there is an equitable division of the national wealth coming through a properly operating enterprise bargaining system. We have an accord; it is all out there in public. It has the safety nets, the dates and the amounts. Everything the government stands for is out there, written down in the documents for all the public to see and understand. But you go around telling people fibs, saying, 'We will give you a choice,' knowing that the choice is the contract or the sack. You can see it at Comalco, where it was said, 'We'll pay you more to take the contract, but, once we get you in the bin, you will take what we give you. We will pay you more to get the union out, but, once you bite from the poisoned apple, you will regret it later.' At least 75 people at Weipa will not bite from the poisoned apple because they know that, if they take the money, in the end they will take what Comalco gives them and there will be no negotiation. That is what John Howard stands for. I have said it before and I will say it again. I cannot understand how a person who comes from such modest circumstances is so interested in belting into working Australians. I cannot understand why he is interested in ripping into the wages and conditions of ordinary Australians, who need this public process for decent wage determination and fairness and equity in the labour market. He has never stood for these things. The government has happily always stood for them. As a consequence, we have a far more cohesive society than the United States, Great Britain or other countries where these sort of policies of the opposition have been tried. As a consequence, we have low inflation, rising real wages and the lowest level of industrial disputes since 1940. It is that sort of model which Australia has really always needed. I am sure that many Australian companies and managers now understand how the model operates. They look and wince at the Comalcos of this world who are screwing the model up and putting the whole model at risk. What they all know quite obviously-they tell us-is that if the opposition were to govern Australia we would be back to industrial mayhem and falling real wages. They know what that means. There would not be strikes for a couple of days; you would have them for years all across the country. There would be thousands of Comalcos all across the country. It is a foretaste of what is to come from a coalition government. If the trade unions in South Australia want to put Mr Howard's weights up, I say, 'Good on them.' At least they will do it publicly and with integrity and will not be like the Free Enterprise Foundation, which collected $7 million on the sly and then funnelled it to the Liberal Party anonymously. Cross-Media Ownership",81
138,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It refers to recent reports concerning the future of cross-media ownership in Australia. What is the government's response to those reports?,82
139,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government, from the time it introduced the cross-media rules, has always believed in diversity in the media and supporting that diversity. That means taking away the grip of the old newspaper groups over television and radio. As a consequence, we now have a television industry that is separate from the print industry and a radio industry that is separate from both of them. As a consequence, we have seen a much greater diversity of ownership in television and radio. We now have organised companies whose specialist job is simply to run a clutch of radio stations. They are not run as some sort of residual portfolio interests which were acquired by large newspaper groups in the past, such as John Fairfax and Sons or the old Herald and Weekly Times. They are now out there on their own operating on a stand-alone basis. You are all familiar with Southern Cross, Austereo and all the other groups. You are familiar with the names and the organisations. The same has happened in television. The Sydney and Brisbane stations of the Channel 7 network were once owned by John Fairfax and Sons, the publishers of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. They are now owned broadly. There is now a substantial interest from Mr Kerry Stokes in Western Australia, who is an independent television owner. In the aggregated zones, we had monopolies with local country newspapers. The ownership of television stations is going to groups like Prime Television and others. We are now seeing a substantial diversification in the media. That diversification was threatened when some people thought that they could move beyond the 15 per cent level of ownership and own television and newspapers in the same city. The government supports the principle of media diversity. Last year, it proposed measures to buttress and strengthen the cross-media rules by placing on them an upper limit of 15 per cent in the Broadcasting Services Act. I am pleased to note that those measures were passed by the Senate on Tuesday, 21 November and will provide certainty to the issue of media ownership by setting in concrete that 15 per cent. But the opposition says that it believes in diversity of media ownership. Senator Alston has mouthed platitudes declaring that the principles underpinning media policy should be competition, plurality, diversity and the national interest. But what does he do? He votes against the 15 per cent limit which is put there to bring certainty to the cross-media limits, to guarantee the very plurality and diversity he is speaking of. The Leader of the Opposition in 1991 signed a petition which said: ... to oppose the sale of the Fairfax group individual or consortium that would result in a greater concentration of media ownership and thus by a diminution of competition in and diversity of information sources in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition happily at the time put his name to that petition. In March 1995, which is far more recently, he was asked by Ray Martin on A Current Affair: Should any manlet us forget personalitiesor woman own a television network in Australia and also the major publishing group? That is a fair enough question. The answer came from Mr Howard: It depends entirely on what the other players in all the media markets are. He has a way with words, hasn'the? He said: It depends on a whole range of factors. I am not going to say yes or no to that question. Why would I?",82
140,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why should I?,83
141,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honesty of public policy, that is why. We had a fracas earlier this year about who said what to whom and who was under an obligation to whom, but the actions by the coalition this week make it very clear that John Howard is the Packer candidate. Mr Costello--You can talk!",83
142,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Show me your actions and I will tell you what you are. We have seen them absolutely dump the principles of competition, plurality, diversity and the national interest and line up to vote down the 15 per cent recommendation, which the government has adopted to bring certainty and not allow any proprietor of a television station to buy print in the same city-that is, to tie up the major organs of the media in television and print in the same city. What is very clear hereMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On 9 May 1994 you issued an admonition to all ministers and the Prime Minister with regard to the length of their replies. We have had six questions and answers so far in 53 minutes in this question time. I ask you to reissue that admonition.",83
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the to any National Party knows the response to that point of order. There is no limitation imposed in this place. The Prime Minister has been asked a question and he is being entirely relevant to the question that was put to him.,83
144,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So when Mr Martin on A Current Affair asked Mr Howard the question we got the answer this week in the Senatethat is, they are not interested in plurality and they do not mind, for instance, any of the major television groups owning newspapers in the same city. They will vote down this measure so these groups can actually creep their interests and, in doing so, pick up a controlling interest in a newspaper, a major organ in a state, along with a major transmisget sion system of a particular network. That is where the Liberal Party stands. It stands exposed to the hypocrisy of Senator Alston's words and to the hypocrisy of Mr Howard's signature on the petition in 1991. It stands against the principles of competition, plurality, diversity and the national interest. It stands in favour of preference, as it always has. It was no accident under 23 years of coalition government that the Herald and Weekly Times owned television, radio and Dr LAWRENCE regional newspapers right throughout the country. It was no accident that John Fairfax and Sons owned the major broadsheet newsOpposition papers, two television stations and radio stations called the Macquarie network. It was no accident that these accumulations occurred during the quarter century of a coalition government. As a consequence of what the opposition in the Senate has now done under Mr Howard's leadership, the same would happen again. So all Australians who actually value diversity in the media and frontbenchhaving these print interests stand alone should note Mr Howard's words and Mr Howard's deeds.

Nothing told to me by Mr MCGinty alters in any way my view about the motivations behind the establishment of the royal commission or its conduct or its findMr Costello-Or Jim MCGinty's motiva,84
162,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,84
163,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought and think the royal commission was a disgraceful exercise; it was an abuse of executive government. Let me just quote from Garfield Barwick's book, A radical tory. Let us see what a highly esteemed member and supporter of the Liberal Party had to say. He said: I find it remarkable that the public accept the conduct of royal commissions as a means of obtaining evidence, bearing in mind that our forebears revolted against the Star Chamber, which was a standing royal commission of its day. Press and politicians alike seem quite anxious to call for royal commissions in all manner of activities, not pausing to consider that the powers of a royal commission are easily abused. Indeed, the public spectacle of witnesses squirming under questioning by the Commissioner or by his Assisting Council provides dramatic copy for the daily press to the delectation of many of its readers. What an apt description of this putrid commission in Western Australia. In the release of this, we had this question of the contact between the Western Australian government and the commission. When Richard Court was pressed on this question late in the afternoon of 21 November, he admitted that his consultant, Richard Elliott, met commission staff prior to the start of public hearings, despite his earlier blanket denials and his claim on 9 May that the royal commission was completely independent of the government. It should be noted that page 12 of the royal commission's report says: The Commission did not conduct any private hearings. This turns out to be untrue. The commission refused to disclose to Dr Lawrence's lawyers any details of communications as to the subject matter of the inquiry from Court or anyone on his behalf; the government; the Liberal or National parties; Richard Elliott; or Barbara Campbell. This is the important point: Attempts by Dr Lawrence's lawyers to cross examine Court on contact between his staff and the commission were curtailed by Commissioner Marks on the objection of Counsel Assisting. In other words, when Dr Lawrence's counsel attempted to ask Premier Richard Court in this commission whether there had been contact between his staff and the commission, the questions were curtailed by the commissioner. Richard Court said earlier: A number of officers from the Ministry of the Premier and Cabinet, including members of the Premier's staff, have had discussions with officers of the royal commission. Such discussions ranged from housekeeping matters relating to the administrative arrangements of the royal commission, through to interviews conducted by investigators, responding to requests for information and appearing before the commission under subpoena. Given the number of people involved and the frequency of contact with officers of the commission both by telephone and in person, it is not possible to identify all such discussions. Would some appropriate questioning in the commission by counsel not have been a way of eliciting what advice had gone to the commission, what role there had been and whether Mr Court's political staff had briefed the royal commission before the hearings began? This allegation had been repeated, of course, in the federal parliament on 21 November and 22 November. In the West Australian on 21 November Mr Court denied there had been any liaison between his office and Mr Marks or Ms Vanstone in the lead-up. He said: Dr Lawrence should stop making false claims. On 6PR he was asked by Mr Sattler: So are you saying she just made this up too? ANSWER: Well, it's exactly what I've said. But, when pressed, he had to say that his consultant, Richard Elliott, had met commission staff prior to the start of the public hearings. This gives you some idea of why Sir Garfield Barwick made the reference he did. Then in the documents attached to the commission we find that the royal commissioner wrote to the Clerk of Journals of the House of Commons 'to secure some authority about the status of rulings made by the President of the Western Australian Legislative Council'. He wrote to the Clerk of Journals. He did not make a reference to Australian parliamentary practice. The response was: There is an excellent compare and contrast account of Speakers' rulings in the UK House of Commons and the Australian Federal House of Representatives in Browning, House of Representatives Practice, 2nd edition, pages 224-228. It then states: You may know that royal commissions for investigative purposes are no longer the fashion in the United Kingdom. What a glum set of replies from the Clerk of Journals in the House of Commons to this lackey of the Western Australian government, who was not prepared to consult Australian parliamentary practice but wanted some authority for the rulings of the Western Australian president of the upper house. When the Western Australian clerk of the upper house gave his testimony and said that it would have been highly improper for Dr Lawrence or any other member of parliament to stop a petitioner petitioning the chamber, that was completely ignored in the weight of evidence by this hired gun of a commissioner.

167,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume you seat. It is not a judiciary. The Prime Minister has the call. Perhaps if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not invite the Prime Minister to respond to interjections we would conclude the answer.,86
168,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We also had a very clear view about this from the former Chief Justice of New South Wales, Sir Laurence Street. We also had a view from other judges who, on Australian television, made clear see for the judiciary in judges and former judges taking on these tasks as an extension of the executive wing. The reason why Sir Garfield Barwick made those remarks is because of the way these things are conducted. The reason the Clerk of Journals of the committee of privileges said, 'Royal commissions for investigative purposes are no longer the fashion in the UK' is for that very same point. They are simply a eat's paw of the executive. That is why they are used. What has happened here is this royal commission's terms of reference were restrictive, which Mr Marks admits himself. Let me just remind you of his words: The terms of reference have turned out of course to be fairly restrictive and stirred a hornet's nest in the political arena. It is part of my training not to make assumptions on half the evidence yet he made rock solid recommendations on half the evidenceThe sooner this commission comes to an end the better. I think that the experience here has demonstrated that the usefulness of royal commissions is fast recedingdead right!One thing one day and another the next has made virtually the result of this commission probably open to some doubt. Hear, hear! These are the words of the commissioner himself. The terms of reference of this commission were setMr Costello-The views of jurist Keating!",86

170,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, Prime Minister will do me. What happened with this royal commission is that the former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party admitted to being in a liaison with Richard Court over the terms of reference. The Premier of Western Australia spoke to the Leader of the Opposition to engineer a trap through this royal commission with restrictive terms of reference which did not in any way go to the evidence or the views which had been put by a succession of Liberal Party members for and on behalf of the risk they the other sideMr Costello-You are just making it up.",86

172,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"in Western Australia, for and on behalf of the other side. All I am talking about, Mr Speaker, is Mr Lightfoot and the others whose work was ignored. How would this sort of view be ignored by any honest royal commission trying to get to the tmth? Mr Costello-We are not allowed to ask questions about the evidence, are we, Mr Speaker?",86
173,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You asked 31 of 33 questions.,87
174,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition! Get your facts straight and stop interjecting.,87
175,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, Mr Lightfoot said this: No, you see, because between the time. I asked the first question on the week prior to that on Tuesday, 24 November, when I asked the second series of questions relating to the same subject, I'd spoken to Penny Easton who reiterated the information she had with respect to the $200,000 payment was in fact correct. So that's why I put the questions again, and she was quite adamant about it and I recalled her being quite adamant in her very gentle fashion, that the information she received and passed on to me was right. You see, I saw here a subject that had nothing to do with the Family Court but nor to do with WA Inc. and largesse. And: Did it concern you at the time you were becoming embroiled, if you like, in a dispute that was before the Family Court but also was obviously a very personally traumatic situation of both parties? LIGHTFOOT: No, it didn't worry me a jot. None of that was in the terms of reference or before the commission. When finally a couple of years later Brian Mahon Easton put his view in a petition, we had the executive arrainging a $5 million royal commission against a political opponent and your paltry connivance in the terms of reference. So you have, all of you, debased royal commissions in this country. You have debased mightily the value of royal commissions. Whatever residual purpose they have had, you have debased them. Mr Speaker, I think it is worth recalling exactly what Sir Laurence Street had to say. He said: I think what needs to be understood is that a royal commission has no connection with the court as such. It has nothing to do with the administration of justice. A royal commission or a commission of inquiry is an instrument of the executive government and they are appointed in order to carry out a task that is put upon them by the executive government. Mr Speaker, because they employed a former judge, we are supposed to say, 'Oh, well, in that case this star chamber process, where obviously the Court government has briefed the commission beforehand and where the commissioner connived in not allowing questions to be put to Court-this process is all too .... .' - and we are supposed to say over here-'Oh, this is dreadful'. And therefore the Leader of the Opposition asked me a question as though Mr MCGinty'S view that he might testify and give contrary evidence to Ms Lawrence in some way gives this shabby affair any credibility. It is a disgrace. It is one of the low points of Australian public life. Never before has the viciousness of the coalition been expressed against an individual person. And now, Mr Speaker, they want to deny paying the fees for her representation in the process. Mr Speaker, this is the opposition at its worse. This is the Liberal Party at its worse. Getting compliant judges who have left the bench does not add any credibility whatsoever to the last residual elements of respectability the royal commission process might have. Economy",87
176,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can he advise the House what improvements to economic trends have been achieved by this government? What would be the position of the Australian economy if economic trends prior to this government coming into office had continued until today?,87
177,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lilley for his question because it is the case that there have been some very substantial improvements to economic outcomes under this government compared with those which were occurring prior to us being in office. Mr Bruce Scott-The gallery is going, Ralph.",87
178,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Maranoa will follow them shortly.,87
179,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In particular, if you compare what happened to key economic trends under this government with those that occurred when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country, one sees absolutely startling differences in the outcomes. Let us take economic growth. The average rate of economic growth during the period when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 2.6 per cent per annum and, under this government, it has been 3'12 per cent per annum. That 0.9 per cent might not sound like much to start with but, year after year, over 12 years, 0.9 per cent becomes a hell of a lot of additional GDP. In fact, it is worth $50 billion more.",87
180,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How much?,88
181,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"$50 billion more of real GDP that we have today than we would have if we had the growth rates under the previous Treasurer before this government came into office. It is as though, Mr Speaker, we have had added another Western Australia, because Western Australia's GDP is some $50 billion. That is the size of the additional increase which has come from this government's higher rate of growth. When we look at employment, the rate of employment growth under the previous government whilst the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 0.8 per cent per annum. Under us, it has been 2.3 per cent-almost three times the rate of employment growth. What does that mean in terms of additional jobs? It means that we have 1.3 million more jobs today than if we had had the rate of employment growth under the previous Treasurer. That means that if we had not had those additional jobs, the unemployment rate today would be 23 per cent if we continued the 0.8 per cent rate of employment growth under the previous government. So one can see a spectacular change in employment outcomes, and Australia is far better off in employment respects under this government. Mr Speaker, in relation to the average rate of inflation, another key economic indicator, under the previous Treasurer, Mr Howard, it was 9.8 per cent per annum. Under this government it has been 5.3 per cent-just a little over half what it was for the previous government. If Mr Howard's rate of inflation had continued since 1983, prices today would be 70 per cent higher-not 17 but 70 per cent higher-today than they actually are. Just imagine our exporters trying to export overseas with costs 70 per cent higher. Imagine how our primary producers would be today if they had to face costs 70 per cent higher. Obviously the Australian economy would be in diabolical straits if the inflation rate of the previous government had continued over the last dozen years. In relation to foreign debt, under Mr Howard's period as Treasurer foreign debt increased at a rate of 35 per cent per annum. If that rate of growth of GDP had continued during the last 12 years, the foreign debt today would be $846 billion-4V2 times greater than it is today. As a percentage of GDP, it would be 186 per cent of GDP compared to less than 40 per cent today. This shows what improvements there have been to economic trends under this government. Clearly, this country would be a diabolical shambles if the economic trends of the previous government had continued. It is amazing that the Leader of the Opposition said recently that this government was a total economic failure. There is only one total economic failure in this House and he is sitting right there in the Leader of the Opposition's chair. City Link Mr Cleary- Mr Speaker!",88

183,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Wills.,88
184,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I thought you gave the call to the Leader of the Opposition.",88
185,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Wills has the call.,88
186,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, a bit of equality in the House! My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It is 12 months since I first raised the issue of your government's complicity in the Victorian City Link project through the provision of tax concessions on infrastructure bonds. You have belatedly weighed into the issue, accusing Jeff Kennett of being uncivilised-I do not disagree with that-and of herding and funnelling people into tollways in the interests of his mates. He has responded by asking you to put up or shut up. Can you now confirm that your government will withhold tax concessions for this disastrous project? Furthermore, will you give an unequivocal undertaking to apply the same conditions to the state ALP's equally outrageous freeway widening proposal? Finally, if you are vehemently opposed to tollways, why are you prepared to fund them?",88
187,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is not funding toll ways. Let me just make this clear: the point I made about Mr Kennett is that Mr Kennett has a duty to run a civilised society-and part of that is not putting chains on railway station toilets, part of that is not privati sing the ambulance service, part of is not closing hospitals that need to be opened for the health and care of the community, part of that is not closing down schools and mental institutions. These are the things that are purely an accountant's view of budgetary responsibilities without any sense of the big picture and without any sense of the obligations to a community which a government takes on upon its election. That seems to be completely misunderstood in Victoria. What we are seeing there, with the Victorian Treasurer burrowing away at the numbers at his desk, is all of these social imperatives being thrown to one side. Mr Reith-What about the freeway?",89
188,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What about the casino, old buddy, old pal? I regard it as an infringement on the public right of free movement around the city to have roads closed off in this way to funnel people into traffic patterns for the purposes of an industrial company, and that is basically what the Kennett government has in mind. It is the same sort of manipulation as it had in the processes for its casino, where the successful tenderer knew all the details of the process, and the Grand Prix which was going to come to Melbourne with it, and, after having procured the tender, has now had the whole facility massively expanded to the detriment of all the other tenderers who were unsuccessful, who may have been successful in the event of there being a larger proposal. This is the way the Liberal Party runs Victoria. They run Victoria with their federal treasurer running around doing private deals with the government. In fact, we hadMr Cleary-Look, I understand this. Mr Speaker, I do not take points of order very often but I put a very specific question. It is within the government's power to stop the funding through infrastructure bonds or tax concessions. Can the Prime Minister give me a simple answer that I can take back to the electorate? I know all this stuff.",89
189,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat. You have asked the Prime Minister for an answer. The Prime Minister is responding.,89
190,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a consequence of this process, we had the Leader of the Opposition that having the temerity to ask me a few weeks ago what I discussed on a social occasion with Mr Lindsay Fox and Mr Solomon Lew. What we found is that he had been to Mr Lew's house with the bagman of the Liberal Party, Mr Walker, the Mr 'Fix-it' of Victoria. That is the way they run the state of Victoria. There is a good case for some investigative journalists here. Mr Costello-Perhaps they could start with Warren.",89
191,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,89
192,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Perhaps we could get the jaundiced Colleen Ryan on to the Victorian Liberal Party-but she doesn't attack Liberals, only members of the Labor Party-and we could see exactly what sorts of things are going on in Victoria. Mr Costello-You will not get an answer, Phil.",89
193,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,89
194,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me just make clear that infrastructure borrowings, the tax concession in question, are a development allowance which allows a faster-that is, more than 100 per cent-write-off in investment. The nature of the investment is a matter for the industrial company and the proposal is a matter for the state of Victoria. A similar question would be to ask the Treasurer or me about a tax concession which applied to a company. They apply generally across the country. Mrs Bishop-You are not getting an answer. He is not going to do anything, Phil.",89
195,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mackellar.,89
196,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The responsibility for this is not being transferred from the Victorian Premier to this government. It is his work and his work only. It is their plan to lock off the streets; it is their plan to treat people like sheep running through a sheep-run down a tollway. If the people of Victoria object to this-and I believe they do-then they have the appropriate remedy at the ballot box when the Kennett government comes to the election. But they should know that the way Victoria is run now is the way Australia would be run if the coalition won the election. The Free Enterprise Foundation $7 million anonymous contribution is not for nothing; it is there to procure a benefit into the future. All you would see is Victoria writ large were we to see a Howard government. Adelaide Airport,90
197,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Can the minister advise of the impact on South Australia because of the postponement of the $44 million extension of Adelaide airport as a result of the airport leasing legislation being sabotaged in the Senate?,90
198,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sabotage is a very good word for it. That is exactly what the coalition has done in the Senate at the behest of the Leader of the Opposition. The extension of Adelaide airport is what South Australians had been wanting and crying out for years for. But just when the dream is about to become a reality, the Leader of the Opposition snatches it away. We have seen today Dean Brown trying desperately to cover for John Howard, but privately he has been devastated by this decision. He has every right to be devastated. From the Commonwealth's point of view, we are not able to enter into any major contract commitments until the budgetary provisions are secured via the leasing process-that, after all, is where the money comes from. We undertook to fund the runway extension from the leasing proceeds. That is how we brought this work forward. Since the leasing of the airports has been blocked, the total of $44 million that has been allocated for this project from the leasing proceeds is not available until that legislation goes through the parliament-until the Senate pass it. There is no hope of that happening, by the look of things, until after the next election. And if John Howard controls the Senate after the next election, it will never go through; just as we will never get a second airport for Sydney because it is funded in exactly the same way. Now, none of that will be the government's fault; none of that is our fault at all. We want the work to go on. The Prime Minister, after all, went to Adelaide and announced this extension last May, and we have been working at what is a tremendously complex piece of legislation ever since. We have seen that legislation go through this House and be presented to the Senate, but it was opposed in the Senate by those sitting opposite. The inevitable result is a substantial delay in the commencement of this very important project for South Australia. Do you know whom we have to feel sorry for? I will tell you: the people of South Australia and the South Australian businesses who were so keen to get direct access to the expanding markets of Asia. Business leader after business leader came to me and said, 'We can't take a plane off because the runway is too short. We can't get a fully laden jumbo out of Adelaide.' The representatives of the tuna industry came to see me; John Olsen came to see me; Dean Brown came to see me; and Diana Laidlaw came to see me. They all said to me, 'Let's get this runway extended now so that a fully laden jumbo jet can get out of Adelaide without having to leave half-laden and refuel in Melbourne or Sydney.' These are the people for whom this House should feel sorry. This is truly a lousy outcome for South Australia-a wretched, lousy outcome. But who is it down to? It is down to those sitting opposite. It is not really unexpected. Today the Prime Minister referred to the briefing statement to the shadow cabinet which said in respect of Adelaide airport, 'This will give us the flexibility of announcing a lot more major long-term visionary matters without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them.' We have to say that the opposition is (2) absolutely consistent. It is your style, after isn't it: announce something without intention of proceeding. When everyone says that something is needed and the chance is there to build it, lock it in the Senate for your own lousy, petty political reasons. I say to the people of South Australia, 'If you want the extension of Adelaide airport, if you want direct access to those overseas markets, stick with us.' The people of South Australia pattern should have clearly in their minds that, those opposite have demonstrated on this occasion, they will be deserted by the Liberaltralia National coalition at every opportunity. Mr Speaker, there is a bit of a story going around Liberal circles in Sydney concerning John Howard telling one of his closest confisets dantes of his ultimate nightmare. His ultimate nightmare is that the coalition wins the election but he loses his seat of Bennelong. That is his ultimate nightmare.",90
199,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is Costello's ultimate dream.,91
200,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I suppose it is the ultimate dream of the Deputy Leader of the will Opposition. I do not think anyone afraid of one part of the equation: it is oddson that the opposition is bound to lose both counts. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional,91
201,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,I seek leave to nerve move a motion censuring the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).,91
202,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,No.,91
203,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,Do it on Monday. Leave not granted.,91
204,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would of the Opposition moving forthwith: That this House censures the Prime Minister for his paralysis of leadership and: (1) his failure to sack a minister who has been exposed as having lied to the Australian people; his failure to disclose that he had been told by all, the Western Australian Labor leader that his any Minister's claims were wrong; (3) his industrial relations incompetence which enabled a disastrous strike to go ahead; and (4) his inability to insist on truth from those around him. I believe that the standing orders should be suspended for one very simple reason: today . the government has followed a very deliberate of filibustering its way through quesas tion time. Everybody here, everybody in the press gallery, and anybody throughout Auswho follows politics, knows very well that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not been present at question time for the last four weeks. This is his first appearance in parliament for four weeks. What does he do? He out on a deliberate pattern of filibustering the government's way through question time-of deliberately giving excessively and unnecessarily long answers, thinking that at the end of the day either the opposition will lose interest in moving a censure motion or all those who report the news-particularly on commercial television at 5 and 6 0' clockthink it is too late to cover anything at all should be to do with a censure motion. This is another aspect of the lengths to on which the government will go to deny accountability before the parliament. It must be absolutely unprecedented for a Prime Minister to walk out while a censure motion is being moved against him. That man-the Neville Orders Chamberlain of Australian industrial relations: good old peace in our lunch time-had the to say in question time that the Liberal Party defiled and opposed every great institution in Australia. The ultimate democratic institution of Australia is the parliament of Australia, and the House of Representatives, I thought, more than any other place, was, in the eyes of the Labor Party, the great clearing house of public conflict in Australia. The Minister himself has said, 'It all ends up here. This is where you've got to stand up and be counted. This is where your mettle is prevent the Leader demonstrated. ' So what does the Prime Minister do today? This is the first chance he has had in four weeks to face me across the dispatch box and what does he do in the cowardly Keating fashion-Keating's cowards' castle? What is question time like when they are in government? They rigged question time today to suit their advantage. They had one of our blokes thrown out. They took 20 minutes to answer a question. They orchestrated dorothy dixers and, at the end of the day, when the opposition moved a censure motion, in a quite unprecedented fashion the Prime Minister walked out. I say to the Prime Minister: when the election comes, Paul, you won't be able to walk out of the great debate. I will eyeball you in both of those debates. If you, like the political coward you are, walk out on those, the Australian people will have a good look at you. The television cameras of the living rooms of Australia are not trained on us at the moment, but they will be trained on that debate. Paul Keating can skulk out of parliament this afternoon, he can run from accountability before the bar of public opinion and he can run away from the fact that he did not have the guts to do to Carmen Lawrence what Gough Whitlam had the guts to do to Rex Connor, what Bob Hawke had the guts to do to John Brown, and what any decent postwar Prime Minister would have had the guts to do to somebody who had been publicly discredited as a public liar not only before the parliament of Western Australia but also before the National Press Club. Like the political coward he is, he hides behind the protections of question time. When he has to face me in a debate, when it is a level political playing field and it is not the lopsided playing field of question time, what does this great, brave, powerful, strong leader of Australian politics do? He wimps out of the House. He runs out of the parliament saying, 'Oh, I'll do it on Monday.' I can tell the Prime Minister that we certainly will do it on Monday. I tell you what, we'll do it on Tuesday. Oh, we can't do it on Tuesday because that is his rostered day off. That is right, he has to have a little rest on Tuesday. He also has to have a nice little rest on Wednesday so that he can get his strength up for Thursday to answer a few questions. When there is a censure motion he will run out of the House again. That is what he will do. We have seen a very good demonstration this afternoon of just how this crowd have become so drunk with power that they don't think anything matters anymore. There comes a time, no matter how clever you might think you are-no matter if you think you have got the Speaker, the ACTU and a few other people on your side-when you think you can behave in a manner that shows absolute contempt and indifference to the Australian people. But we are coming to a very important election and one of the things that people are going to do when we come to that election is test the behaviour of the Prime Minister against the things that he promised the Australian people when he became Prime Minister. We all remember that memorable press conference on the night of 19 December 1991, just after he had knifed Bob. When he had knifed off Bob Hawke, do you know what he said to the Australian people? He looked right down the barrel of the camera, he mustered all of that Sussex Street sincerity-every last bit of it, because he had Laurie beside him giving him advice-and he said, 'I'm going to do three things. I'm going to deal honestly with the people, I'm going to tell them the truth and I'm going to resist the temptation to gild the lily.' He has had an opportunity today, he has had an opportunity ever since the Marks royal commission reported, to live up to those promises, and what has he done? He has stood beside a publicly indicted, lying minister. Nobody has been more comprehensively indicted as a political liar in public 1; fe than Carmen Lawrence, without any equivocation at all. The Prime Minister can read the learned opinions of Garfield Barwickthat is a tum-up, Paul Keating relying on Garfield Barwick-and do all of that, but nothing can gainsay the fact that the people who have hung and stitched Carmen Lawrence are her own former Labor mates. There was no conspiracy between Richard Court and Jim MCGinty and Ian Taylor and Eric Ripper and John Kobelke and Keith Wilson and Pam Beggs and Judith Watson and all the other people, totalling 14. Carmen Lawrence was destroyed at the hands of the Labor Party.",91
