Mr Tim Fischer-Are your socks red?",11
3,Mr COBB,NATIONAL WOOL WEEK,"They are. I am deeply honoured that the parliament has generously agreed to suspend its normal business for one and a half hours to allow me to move my private member's motion relating to National Wool Week and the Australian wool industry. I am particularly grateful to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) for the energy and initiative he has displayed to ensure that wool week is properly observed in Parliament House. NA I am also grateful. to two governmenr members-the honourable member for EdepOrders . Monaro (Mr Snow) and the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland)-for the vital part they have played in facilitating this motion and in assisting with the displays of woollen products in this House. Indeed, I urge all honourable members to step out of the House later this morning to observe the flock of sheep that will be grazing on the lawns of the roof of Parliament House and that will be kept in order there by sheepdogs. It is also pleasing to know that this motion will have strong bipartisan support. I am sure that that will earn the gratitude of the many thousands of people who are associated with the wool industry throughout Australia. My electorate of Parkes, which takes in 40 per cent of New South Wales, contains a great number of sheep farmers, and it contains some of the oldest and most famous sheep studs in Australia. I grew up on a sheep property and, as a farmer-grazier and a veterinarian, I have been associated with the wool industry all my life. At a time like this, it is interesting to look back on the rather modest origins of our wool industry. The first sheep that set foot in Australia came out with the First Fleet in 1788. Governor Phillip had obtained them from the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. Those sheep, known as Cape fat tails, had fat tailsas their name implies-and hairy fleece. They were raised more for their meat than for their wool. However, what is not so welI known is that the merino, which rapidly took Australia to the position of the world's leading wool .producer, also came from South Africa at the end of the 18th century. Chance played a large role here as the Dutch Cape Colony had not long passed to British rule. Two ships which had sailed from Sydney to Cape Town in 1797 to buy cattle and other supplies ended up purchasing a small flock of Spanish merinos, which were descended from a gift of sheep given by the King of Spain to the Dutch government. Mrs Gordon, widow of the Scot who had governed the Cape on behalf of the Dutch East India Company, was disposing of the sheep. Captain Waterhouse and Captain Kent of the two supply ships from Australia bought 13 of these sheep at a cost of $8.40 a head. Rarely, if ever, has a better purchase and investment been made in the history of the world. Regrettably, most of Kent's sheep on his ship, the Supply, were lost on the trip back, and the remainder that were presented to the governor also died. However, most of those on Waterhouse's ship, the Reliance, survived and he sold them to landowners in the colony, including officers in the New South Wales Corps. Among these were Captain John Macarthur, the Reverend Samuel Marsden, William Cox and Captain Rowley, all of whom were to become pioneers in the Australian merino breeding industry. We all know the Macarthur success story which subsequently unfolded. He originally obtained four ewes and two rams believed to be of the escurial type, the finest wool strain owned by the Spanish royalty. Before this Macarthur had been breeding from 60 Bengal ewes and lambs he had bought in 1793 and later two Irish ewes and a young ram. Macarthur and his wife-I believe his wife deserves more recognition than she has had for the role she played-were both visionaries. He returned to England in 1803, when his flock totalled about 4,000, and persuaded the authorities there of the potential of our wool industry. In 1807 Macarthur delivered bale of wool from Australia to London, which he sold, incidentally, for $2.27 a kilogram. Quality rapidly improved and by 1822, which was a turning point in the Australian wool industry, Macarthur received two gold medals from the Society of Arts for importing wool as good as the finest Saxon wool. 1 remind honourable members that at that time Saxony and Silesia in Germany had taken over from Spain and were producing the best wool in the world. Australia was on the way. In 1821 we exported 80,000 kilograms of wool; in 1823 we exported 180,000 kilograms; in 1830 exports had climbed to half a million kilograms; 10 years later there was an eightfold increase to four million kilograms; and by 1844 we were exporting six million kilograms of wool. In recent years, of course, we have exported in excess of 1,000 million kilograms. By 1845 Australia had broken the back of the German wool industry, and some of the manufacturers there were even importing Australian wool. We were doing this not just by opening up more land; we were improving the quality of our wool here: the density, the length, the colour qualities, the micron measure, the yield and the cut per head. In 1800 the average purebred Spanish ewes cut less than two kilograms a head; today the average stud ewe cuts in excess of seven kilograms a head. Seventy-five per cent of Australia's 140 million to 150 million sheep-we have been up over 180 million in recent years-are merinos. We produce a third of the world's raw wool and half of the world's merino wool, but it is in the quality area that we really shine. We produce around 80 per cent of the world's apparel wool. We have been so successful at this because not only do we have the genetic material here but, even more importantly, we have the management expertise and the hard work of the 60,000 farmers that raise sheep in Australia. We also have the environment. We have cheap land relative to the rest of the world and we have a climate that is unmatched. If others try to grow this wool elsewhere they cannot do so, because either they have not got the environment or it is more profitable to produce something else, the first such as meat or grain. Today there are basically four strains of merinos in Australia. The Peppin strain is the most popular. It is a large-framed sheep which thrives in the drier inland regions of Australia. We have the South Australian merino, which is the largest strain-longer, taller, heavier and plainer-and is bred to thrive in the more arid pastoral areas. We have the Spanish merinos, which are directly descended from the Spanish flocks. They are soft handling and have a: similar distribution to the Peppin strain. Then we have the Saxons, which tend to run in the high rainfall, cooler country of the tablelands in Tasmania. They have very fine, high quality wool. The tale of building our merino wool industry to the stage it is at today is the story of Australia itself. It is a story synonymous with our famous pioneering spirit. It is a story of hardship; it is a story of perseverance. It a story of joy through boom; it is a story of despair through bust. It is a story of droughts, floods and fire, of high prices and low prices. It has inspired much of our literature and poetry. It has supported and boosted our economy as no other product we have seen before in this country has. It has been our number one export industry for more than a century and it has given us, all of us, a standard of living which is the' envy of the world and which we would not otherwise have attained without this wonderful product. The wool industry, which has adapted in the past, is about to move into a new era. It will experience new and increased competition from cotton; it will experience new and increased competition from synthetics. I believe it is about to undergo a revamp of its marketing methods. It will survive this, and we will see in this country an expansion of the value adding industry in Australia; Recently, the world best practice wool processing plant, Austop, was set up in Parkes in my electorate. Roger Fletcher at the abattoir in Dubbo is producing in excess of 500 bales of fellmongered wool a week. He is about to set up his own scouring plant there. These are two examples of what is happening in this country. I believe the future for wool is as bright now as it was 200 years ago, and I believe the next 200 years of wool production.in Australia will in many ways be just as successful as the 200 years that have gone before, I commend the motion to honourable members in this chamber.",11
4,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Is the motion seconded?,13
5,Mr SNOW,BUSINESS,"I am pleased to second the motion moved by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I compliment him and other honourable mem- . bers from the wool-growing areas: the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), and my colleague on this side of the House the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), who has taken a great initiative as one of the gang of four and is who has organised today's displays in coordination with the honourable member for O'Connor, the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and my colleague from Tasmania sitting next to me here, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams). All of these people have a substantial wool industry in their electorates. Many innovations have taken place since the decline and removal of the reserve price scheme for wool. The result of one such initiative was displayed in this parliament by the honourable member for O'Connor: a combination of artificial and wool fibres which provides excellent insulation and is made into products such as doonas. At the time, I recall, the then member for Stirling, Mr Ron Edwards, was in the chair and took up the challenge of the honourable member for O'Connor. The two of them coopted a team which included the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and me and coordinated national wool day in 1992. This was a very spectacular day which included a wool auction. The only complaint about the wool auction was that, although some buyers were prepared to pay a good price to say they bought it here in Parliament House, other buyers were very upset that they had to bid higher and pay more than they would have paid in Newcastle. That may not happen again. We are talking about having a bigger day and a great display next year, in 1995, if we can. A lot of things have happened to wool. We have been forced into looking for some alternatives; We have seen wool used not only for insulation but also for mulch. It is less hazardous than some other insulation materials. We have seen the development of garments which are suitable for hot as well as cold climates; We have seen excellent blends, some of which are on display on the Senate side of Parliament House, on the first floor in the public area. I would urge all honourable members and members of the public to visit the displays and to say hello to the people from all over Australia who have been prepared to come and show what they cando with wool. ' We can see a combination of wool with that diamond fibre, mchair, which absorbs dyes well and which is light yet warm. When wool is combined with another fibre, we get the best of both fibres. It can be combined with· many other fibres: with angora from rabbits, with alpaca, with cashmere' from the bush goat around Australia. There have been some great combinations. Mounting displays are firms like Wool Wise Buying of Queanbeyan and Tooralli from Bombala in the electorate of Eden-Monaro. Peter and Clare Smith, farmers at Bombala, were driving one day and despairing at the wool price, which was down as low as 150c and 180c. They said, 'What are we going to do?'. 'We still have to pay good prices for woollen garments; let us take it right through', they thought. So Peter and Clare Smith took the initiative. They took over a. disused movie theatre Bombala and they now have people working there 24 hours a day making woollen garments. Theykilow what to outsource for dyeing and so on. They are· doing what they are good at. They get the product at the start of the process, off the sheep's back, and they take it to the end of the process,. when they weave it and produce the final product. They do what they and their large staff at Bombala are good at. A lot of wool is produced in south-east New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Today Gordon Allen and his family are here at Parliament House. Gordon Allen is from Cobargo, which is also in the electorgood signs. ate of Eden-Monaro. He has a farm in this region. He is prepared to allow his sheep walk all over us! They are walking over the roof of Parliament House just to show how wool .is still a dominant factor and how it one of our major exports. It is great to see him here. It is also great tei see people here from other areas of Australia; Firms such as Textilities, Topnotch, the Australian Wool Shop at Hall, Primac raw wool, the Spotted Iumbuck and Heirloom Bears all have displays here today. I have been farming for 17 years and my first livestock were sheep. They gave me a great deal of experience and were a good initiation experience. Goats are not quite like sheep, .but at least I had some preparation Jor working with animals. In April 1993, bur market indicator showed 181c for wool. Therehas been progress. Now the price is about 564c. In 1989-90, the amount of wool we exported was 1.1 million tonnes, but by 1991-92 it had dropped to 875,000 tonnes. The value of exports dropped from $4,647 million in 1988-89 to $2,560 million in 1991-92. However, the market is in their car now quite strong. lust to indicate what has happened, I indicate that last night a couple of members and I were pleased to associate with a visiting former Prime Minister of Poland. While we were there Eugene Bajkowski of the Australian Polish Business Council told me that wool exports to Poland had dropped from $160 million to $25 million. That just shows what in has happened to wool exports into the CIS. The honourable member for MCEwen has just appeared looking very presentable, I must say, in a wool-combination garment. I hope he is wearing his red socks. To continue: in the ·past year we have seen Russia pay cash for a,large purchase of wool. That is a good sign. China is now back in the market for over-20-micron wool. Korea and Taiwan have shown great interest. While 564c is not as much as we would like, it is close to the amount needed for a medium sized farm to' be profitable. It is below the amount needed by small farms and it is above the amount needed by large farms; so we are seeing some I have talked about the international chanto ges which have helped the wool industry. The honourable member for.Parkeshas dealt with much of the history ,of the industry, but other is measures have been taken. They include the establishment of new industry bodies with a clear commercial focus. We have seen the establishment of new mechanisms formarketing wool. We, have seen an Australian trade and investment package to expand the intemational wool trade, with bipartisan and grower support to build demand, promote quality and reliability to clients, and build new markets which spread the risk. That is very important. We have also seen the establishment of the Australian trade and investment package, or ATIP. The co-chairs' of that are the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, and the Minister for Trade, Senator MCMullan. ATIP brings the government and industry together. The aim is to complement the greater international competitiveness of our wool producing and processing industries by ensuring access to markets and bypromoting industry and conSl}mer commitment to wool. At about this time last year when the government announced the package of measures to provide relief to the wool industry the market was 381c. So it is very fitting we are having this debate now. It is due to that great . combination-the bipartisan support in the political system, the initiatives taken as a result of that bipartisan support, the resolution of the industry and the resolution of individual farmers in the electorates of those who are speaking in this debate-that we have seen the progress we have, an increase of over 35c in that one year. 'The market indicator is forecast to maintain a general upward trend during the second half of the season with the greatest recovery being seen in the finer micron wools and the carding types. The superfine indicator is at 1,100c per kilogram in that area compared with 450c per kilogram this time last year. There is a clear message to us all. The uncertainty of the past has to make way for the opportunities of the future, to quote Senator Collins, and I am delighted that I am being associated with honourable members in this House who are prepared to join with that optimism.",13
6,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS," Mr Acting' Speaker, I commence my speech by thanking you personally for your cooperation and your attendance in the parliament today to listen to the speeches associated with this very important motion. There is no doubt that historically the wool industry has contributed dramatically to Australia's wealth. In fact, as I have pointed out to the parliament before, when I was a child our history and geography books made reference to Australia living off the sheep's back. I can still visualise the drawing of the sheep grazing with the Great Australian Bight over its back. It has been a wonderful contributor. When I spoke to the parliament back in December 1991 first proposing that the House should take a particular interest and arrange National Wool Day, which this parliament did, I pointed out that at that time, 1991-I am afraid things have changed slightly since then-in the 25 years prior to 1991, wool has been our major export commodity in eight of the 25 years. It had been our second major export commodity after coal in seven of those 25 years; our third major export commodity after coal and wheat and other agricultural products on seven occasions and' after coal and iron ore on one occasion; and our fourth major export commodity after coal, wheat and iron ore on two occasions. In other words, in the 25 years prior to 1991, wool as an export commodity has never been further back than fourth, and in fact that was only on two occasions. Unfortunately we have got to add a couple of occasions to that list today. I see in the statistics for 1992-93· that wool came in at No.6. Nevertheless, that is still a very important contributor to our national economy, to paying off the debt that we contract with the world whenever we buy more from the world than we export. Mr Acting Speaker, I thank you and your office which have been generally very cooperative. The honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) mentioned the efforts of ,Ron Edwards when we got the first National Wool Day off the ground. They were significant. The honourable member for Eden Monaro, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and I clearly understand that without the cooperation of the Presiding Officers we would not be able to achieve the suc-ess we have with this day. So I thank you agaIn. . !recall-the honourable member for EderiMonaro might also remember it-that there Was one permission we did not get last time but it had a great effect when those sheep suddenly started grazing on the lawns of Parliament House and proved a point that they would do no damage. I am delighted.to think that I believe it will take place at 11 o'clock this morning-some sheep will be unloaded again. We are now so confident of our sheep handling techniques that we are not even going to put a fence up; the dogs will cont.rol them. I think it is probably worth puttmg on the record that when a previous Speaker told me to get rid of them. I said that he could do that but that. I have the dogs. It was a great day and I am delighted to think the parliament, albeit in a less spectacular way, is choosing to recognise this industry today. Australia recognises all sorts of things through national days. I have drawn to the attention of the parliament that we even have a red nose day, and that is for a good cause. But we have a responsibility to recognise the wool industry, particularly in this particular era when 'it is under a lot of financial pressure. I know that by people making speeches and commitments here today, it adds to the confidence of the industry. J would like to thank my fellow committeemen, whom I have already mentioned, for their role. This is a· great example of how both side-of the parliament can get together and do thmgs together in the national interest. There is no doubt that supporting the industry is in the national interest. I would like to further thank Holeproof for donating 200-odd pairs of socks so that every member of both houses could. wear a pair of red socks to the parliament today. The minister at the table the Minister' for Consumer Affairs (MMCHugh), is apologising to me because she did not wear trousers so that she could wear red soc-. I do not think that is a real problem. I smcerely hope that at least for question time she will pull a pair of red socks on over her stockings, if only because it would be good fun. We can be in these things, as the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) has just demonstrated, coming in wearing that magnificent garment. Having heard of the demise of a minister, I think he really wants to be the count or counter whichever way one wants to put it. On thother hand, it demonstrates that people can in fact join in this day in a light-hearted \yay and have some fun.' It is only when we do such things that Uhink we appear human 'on that. machine that constantIyrecords our activities. Holeproof Heroes have become a byword in Australian advertising, I think all of us recognise the sheep with the red socks. I think - hat has made red socks synonymous with the use of wool, and the company should be congratulated on that. Mini Jumbuk of Naracoorte in South Australia has sent - s some souvenir sheep, which others can dIsplay, The Australian Wool Corporation has given us some of its magnificent posters and things of that nature. We will never forget its contribution on the inaugural day when it filled the Great Hall and made a great contribution. It is to be thanked. There has been quite a lot of change in that area as' was mentioned by the honourable member'for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), and I am hopeful t?at in future years we will see the corporat-on able to make an even greater contribubon. Making a contribution does not have to involve spending large amounts of money or putting on another display of the magnitude of the one in the Great Hall, but the corporation's people are thenetworkers; they are the people who must encourage a community involvement so that National Wool Day becomes part of our calendar. This is happening and there are some excellent displays here today. I hope that our committee next year will be able to go to some of our major retailers and media people and demonstrate to them that they can even make money by being involved in National Wool Week. It is no accident that we seek to celebrate National Wool Week at this time of the year when consumers are making their decisions about their winter wardrobe. It is now that this industry should be highlighting its products and drawing people's attention to all the wonderful things that they can buy in wool to protect them during the winter. Wool will protect them from cold; it will protect them from rain. lam sure that in that wonderful cloak that the honourable member for MCEwen is wearing he could go out in any stonn, political or otherwise, and it would protect him. It is a fact that wool has all those qualities. It is natural and it is free of chemicals, and all of those factors need to be understood and promoted, because it is such a wonderful product. The CSIRO Division. of Wool Technology in Geelong is another contributor"" to our displays today. It is to be congratulated on its role in bringing technology to the industry, taking away shrinkage and all those things that some of us remember about wool but that younger members in the House would not. I hope that when we See the budget in May its efforts will be properly recognised in the maintenance of. the government's dollar for dollar contribution to go along with the research contribution of wool growers in maintaining their excellent efforts .. The honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) may be"" making a"" contribution during this debate. I hope he is, because Geeltmg and CSIRO are major contributors and represent a substantial part of the future for the industry, Australia and Australian workers. Value adding is not a solution in itself. It is not a solution unless the technology and the effort of those people value adding bring more resources to Australia, and it is not a process which creates some jobs at the .cost of somebody else. I believe it can be done and that CSIRO will continue to be a major contributor, bringing forward the magnificent machinery that it has. I have travelled to other parts of the world and have seen what that machinery is doing in practice and how the wool industry and the spinning and the weaving industry use it so much. I have not referred to a lot of the statistics that I thought I might have to, but I would like to close by making the point that the magnificent growth in prosperity in Asia and other areas is a wonderful message for wool. In Korea it was pointed out to me that originally the Koreans re-exportednearly every kilo of wool they imported. Today 50 percent of it stays in the country. People's standards of living have risen and they want to consume the product themselves. Surely, our target.is to see these countries rise in prosperity and spend their money on such superior products as wool. I am sure. it is going to happen. I thank my colleagues and express my pleasure that together we are celebrating and recognising an industry of such importance. "" Mr Acting SPEAKER-I thank ·the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) for his generous remarks acknowledging the cooperation of the Presiding Officers. I commend him and his colleagues for their cooperative effort in today's presentation. I also acknowledge the fashion statement by the honourable member for MCEwen (Mt Cleeland) in his impromptu fashion parade on entry into the chamber. I now invite him to make a verbal statement on the motion.",15
7,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,"MCEwen) (10.02 a.m.)I join with other members of this House in recognising the valuable contribution the wool industry has made. to Australia in the past, is making at present and will, I anticipate, make in its future role. I also draw the attention of the House to the role that women have played in this industry. In my electorate, at the dawn of Victoria as a constitutional entity, a lady known as Elizabeth Furlong entered into the Strathbogie-Euroa areas, as they are now known, and introduced the first major wool flock into that region. In fact she established what is now known as the - Seven Creek Run' , one of the most famous of Victorian sheep properties, a merino property;"". which is stiII in existence today though vastly smaller than what it was originally. In speaking of. the industry in Australia we should never forget "" the contribution that many women have made to this industry over the years. Even today women are very much involved in the wool industry. They are involved in value adding, and there is no doubt whatsoever. that the future of the industry lies very much in not looking at its past but looking at what it can do today and at its future. Its future lies in value adding. As has aiready been mentioned in the House today, on the first floor near the theatrette, members, visitors-and indeed the press, I hope-will take the time to look at a display of what Australia is now. doing in wool. When I say 'wool' I mean sheep's wool, mchair wool and alpaca wool. There is such a vast array of wool now being produced in Australia that many people just do not understand the changes that are occurring. They are important changes. I should acknowledge some people at today's display: the. Australiim Wool Shop from the Australian Capital Territory, Textilities from Seymour-Pam is in the gallery today; Woolshed Yams from Broadford; Topnotch Mchair Australia of Sey. mour-Margaret Currey is one of those women I spoke about, a woman who does not take no for an answer and is leading a revolutionary change in value adding wool products in Australia today; Heirloom Mchair Bears from Gundaroo; Woolwise Buying from Queanbeyan; Toorallie from Bombala; Spotted Jumbuks from Seymour; Lidner Socks from Goulburn; and Capalba Park Alpacas from Seymour. We all talk about value adding in this country. We say it is something we have to do. But unless it is properly designed, properly marketed and the product itself is of value and of quality value adding will not be successful. I am making a fashion statement. I am wearing a cloak which is made of mchair wool and sheep's wool: all the mchair is grown in Australia; all the wool is grown in Australia. All the wool is scoured in Australia and the yam is manufactured in Australia. The product is designed and made in Australia. It is a statement of fashion; it is a statement of quality; it is a statement of where the industry must go. It· is a unique fabric. Very few countries can produce a mchair wool blend. Indeed it is not a secret that .some honourable members of this parliament like to travel overseas and spend many thousands of dollars on suits made from mchair wool. There is no need for any Australian today to travel overSeas to buy the best fabrics that the world can produce because they are all produced and made in Australia. Honourable members of this House should have a look. They will find on display mchair wool suits; they will find on display alpaca wool. They will find on display fine wool, superfine wools, sweaters and garments made of the best quality wool available in the world. My message to the House and, indeed, my message· to Australia is, firstly, not to be frightened of change. The wool industry has been through a very traumatic experience in the last few years and those of us who have electorates with wool growers in them know i this full well. Indeed, my colleague Jim Snow and I were in Europe last year. In Europe, we met with the International Wool Trading Organisation and we visited a factory in Aalst in Belgium. It is using some 40 tonnes of Australian wool a week, as I recall, and it is only working at roughly two-thirds capacity. The factory produces a beautiful fibre. The message we got in Europe was very clear: the future of wool is assured. I come back to my message to the House today. I do not want to see the value get added elsewhere. I do not want to see products like this imported into Australia. I do not want to see Australians buying fabric made overseas, and the value added overseas by producing suits which are then imported and sold here, when we can do that ourselves and arguably do it better. There is no doubt that we have some of the best fashion designers in the world. There is no doubt about that. It is interesting that it is small business which is pushing this drive for value adding. Small business is prepared to take a punt and put its money where its mouth is. I know it has not been easy for many of them. They are prepared to value add and produce niche marketing products. Garments· like this will not be commonly sold over the K Mart range of stores. It is a niGhe quality product. It is a valuable, fine, beautiful product. Again I invite honourable members to have a look. Within my electorate, the Down Under Mchair, as it is known, is now producing superfine quality yam and fabrics. Also in my electorate is the Spotted Jumbuk. The Spotted Jumbuk runs a unique herd of sheep with spotted colours. It specialises in one particular type of sheep which produces a spotted fleece and it . uses thal fleece as a value added product. I notice the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) looking interested. He should look at these spotted. fleeces; they are really quite magical. Another product, again from my electorate, is the alpaca product. It is an alpaca wool blend. Alpacas are beasts which are. not widely known in Australia today. Indeed the Halpin fa-i1y in Seymour was among the first Australians to introduce alpacas. It is running a very successful breeding herd and selling those alpacas. Alpaca wool is certainly a superfine soft product; it blends beautifully with sheep wool. It produces this marvellous combined fabric: the alpaca giving it the very fine softness. and the wool adding both strength and its own special quality at the saine time. One of my concerns is the difficulty which these businesses are facing in getting finance. I am very critical of the Commonwealth Development Bank. Small business in Australia is driving the economy at the moment. Large business is not driving the economy; small business is. Inevitably, small business people have little or no capital base to start with. They have ideas, they have their hands and they have everything required except capital. My experience in more recent years has been that, since the Commonwealth Bank has taken over the state banks involved, the Commonwealth Development Bank. has basically been operating under the same .guidelines as any other commercial bank. It wants full and top security. Hence, the availability of any risk or venture capital to these types of industries which are leading Australia into the future is very limited. I have a very strong view that government has a major interventionist role to play in assisting these types of industries with capital and with marketing skills and expertise. It is all very well for a small firm to be innovative and courageous but, without assistance in marketing and without assistance in finance, its role is-very much diminished. Finally, honourable members, members of the press gallery and members of the public, please have a look at the displays. We should be . very proud of what Australian small businesses can do with wool. Wool is a magical fibre. It is not a fibre of the past; it is a fibre of the present and a fibre of the future. As other speakers have said, wool is natural, wool is clean and wool is a very good product.",17
8,Mr KATTER,BUSINESS,"In the late 1960s the wool industry collapsed. We were selling wool for 25c to 28c a kilo. I remember the horrific stories my father used to come home with when he was a newly elected member of parliament. He would tell us just how grim things were. We lost almost an entire generation of wool producers during that period. I was a young person at the time and I could clearly see that there was no future for wool. Nothing could have looked . grimmer. Labour costs in Australia were going through the roof, and wool is a very high labour input commodity because of shearing costs. The rate of the Australian dollar was soaring because of the minerals boom. Synthetics, wool's competitor, were hitting their straps. A combination of those things, plus the continuous cycle of droughts that had occurred during the 1960s, indicated to me that there was no future in wool. Some people I knew bought 20,000 old female sheep at $1 per head, and they still had a couple of lambs. That herd of 20,000 grew to 40,000, and I saw the price go to $17 per headsome three or four years later. That indicated to me very graphically the cyclical nature of our internationally traded commodities, of which wool was by far and away the most prominent. It is interesting that today, whilst the sun shines-and I emphasise that-with the new breakthroughs, solar energy is actually competitive with coal. So, in terms of 'sustainable' production into the future,. a better commodity than wool cannot be found. Even when things have been at their grimmest, wool has made a magical comeback and been the great bulwark of the Australian economy-as the previous speakers have outlined. In the late 1960s the then Minister for Primary Industry, Doug Anthony, in a desperate effort to try to save the wool producers, started a buying-in scheme for wool. That was the only real course left to him because so many elements of the industry were trenchantly opposed to any form of statutory marketing. So Mr Anthony introduced that form of minimum pricing, and that gave us a price for our product. It was the first time in the history of the industry that we had· seen stability. It was the first time that there had been long-term stability in prices in the wool industry. People could plan for improvements in their stations and in their flocks over a long period without having to worry about the dreadful dangers of market collapse, on top of the other scourges of Amltralian agriculturefire and flood. I can remember Sir Joseph MCEvoy, the legendary leader of the sugar industry, saying at the time of the cattle crash, 'Always remember with statutory marketing that there hasn't been one single case in Australian history where the borrowings to introduce some form of minimum pricing scheme have not been paid back and the interest paid back as well'. He said that occurred in the wool industry, and nothing could have looked grimmer there. He said it had occurred twice in the sugar industry, and to bear that in mind whenever there were decisions to make in the future. The tremendous success of that great industry in Queensland, the sugar industry, is a very firm monument and tribute to the work of Sir Joseph MCEvoy and those people that believe in some form of minimum pricing. When my father died I gave the panegyric at the funeral. I was trying to think of what was the most important thing that had happened in his lifetime. I said on that occasion that the most important thing that ever happened to us people that live west of the Great Dividing Range was the introduction of the minimum price scheme jn wool. Whilst we could do nothing about droughts or fires or floods, we most certainly could do something about the marketing arrangements. There was absolute proof of that in the fact that the price, for the first time in 20 years, stayed stable and above a given minimum. The importance of a minimum price scheme is that when the price starts to fall it holds the price at a minimum. The minute the price started to fall, instead of attempting to hold it at the minimum price, the government cut and ran. I am not making a political point. This is a fairly apolitical debate today. Both sides of the House agreed with that, but I have to make the point with as much conviction as I can that it was a dreadful mistake. I was on the national body that looked into any the beef crisis, minimum pricing in the beef industry and the problems of the beef industry in Australia. We went all over Australia, and it was very clear to me what needed to be done in the beef industry at the time .. We never got ariy form of minimum pricing arrangements in the beef industry and many hundreds, maybe thousands, of producers in Queensland were left with absolutely nothing after three and four generations of sacrifice on the land. They were utterly destroyed. I do not think that that is the way we want to run agriculture. No other country in the world runs agriculture that way. The difference between Australia and other countries is that we do not have a protected home market. Almost all of our product in such things as sugar, wool and beef goes overseas and we have to ride· a terrible roller-coaster in the international marketplace. In talking about the wool industry, I must point out the hardship that the pioneers endured and the sacrifices they made in this area. One of the stories that always leaps to my mind is the case of the Thompsons. Mr and Mrs Thompson took some 6,000 head of sheep from the Darling Downs into the midwest area of North Queensland. They both died, and they Were found by a black tracker and a neighbouring grazier some time later. There was hardly any of their herd left by the time they had got to North Queensland. The black tracker was able to work out what had happened. The people had gone without water for four or five days in the northern heat and they were apparently quite demented. The wife was in a terrible physical condition and the husband had shot her and then staggered on himself. Some two miles later he fell into a billabong. He had his water bottle with him. He then dragged himself on all fours back to his wife to give her a drink. But he was in such a demented condition that he had forgotten that he had answered his wife's pleas and put her out of her misery. When he realised that she was dead and that he· had shot her, he then shot himself and fell over her body. These are the sorts of sacrifices that had been made. Another story involved a grazing family in my area, at a place called Alston Vale. One of them had been away droving a big mob of sheep. When he came home for holidays, he saw that there had been a huge flood and he saw sheep hanging up in the trees. As he went to the homestead, he saw that there was nobody there and that the flood had run over the top of the homestead. In looking around, he realised that a number of the bodies up in the trees that he thought were dried out sheep were in fact his mother, his father and his three brothers and sisters. These are the sacrifices that have been made by these people generation after generation. We have lost 25 per cent of our national flock. By the year 2009 there will be an extra 300 million people in the countries we trade with in the Pacific basin, and certainly they will need wool. They have the fastest growing economies in the world; they will be very rich people. In fact, a third of the Pacific basin eountries are already the richest on earth-the United States, Canada and Japan-but other countries, such as Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, are not far behind them. So the markets wilI be there and yet we have lost 25 per cent of our flock. We have lost thousands of· people with skills and expertise to maximise our production effort and minimise our cost levels. There have been two reports, one by the Arid Zone Centre at Longreach-an update of debt levels and stock numbers in western Queensland-and the other by the Careforce committee at Longreach in'cluding the DPI, the ABC, churches, trade unions and a number of other groups. This report says that 72 per cent of sheepmen are living off non-farm production. They are going further and further into debt or they have off-farm means of income or they are using some other method of financing themselves on the farm-and this is happening when the price's 500c a kilo, not 350c a kilo as it has been in some of the years we have just gone through. The other report says that the average debt level is $371,000 and debt is accruing at $70,000 a year. That means that within two or three years most of those people with debt will be declared insolvent by the banks-at least two-thirds of them-and one-third of them are probably already insolvent. And for the first time .ever in Australian history we have done nothing about this problem. (TIme expired)",19
9,Mr OCONNOR,BUSINESS,"It gives me great pleasure to participate in this debate today and my congratulations go to members on both sides of the House who also are participating in the debate. I will not speak at length on the wool industry in a global sense. Rather, I will relate my comments to the area that I represent, the seat of Corio, which takes in the greater part of the city of Gee1ong. I also draw the attention of the House to the fact that my opposite number on the other side of the river and on the other side of the political fence, the honourable member for Corangamite (MrMCArthur), is also participating in this debate. He has had a long association with the wool industry and he has the interest of the industry at heart, as I have. We might differ from time to time on the means by which this industry might develop, but essentially both of us see great potential for the Geelong region through the growth of the wool industry. Many regional centres throughout the length and breadth of Australia identify with particular commodities, particular products and particular processes. Our neighbour in the state of Victoria, the great city of Ballarat, is strongly identified with gold. Geelong's major identification is with wool. It is not just a regional. identification in that Australians might acknowledge Geelong as a great wool production and distribution centre, but also it has international identification. Many of the brand names of manufacturers in Europe refer to Geelong wool, not Australian wool. I am referring to Zegna and Pringle of Scotland who use the brand name 'Geelong wool'. Geelong has a great asset already in the name 'Oeelong wool' and the city and the region can develop it even further. Geelong has had a long association with wool production and distribution. I will not go into the ins and outs of the history, but recent times we have seen a significant decline in the wool industry in the Geelong region. However, lam pleased to say that moves are under way, both within the indusfacility try and government circles, to place Geelong again at the forefront of industry development place. of this commodity. If we look at the city of Geelong we . that this city and its immediate hinterland lJaye some great wool assets that they bUIld upon and develop. As I mentioned before, Geelong already has an international brand image. It ha!1 one Gf the most tive wool hinterlands in Australia, for production of both coarse wools and fine wools. We have an excellent transport infraat structure-road, rail and sea-which has capacity to transport wool from the hinterland to the major production centre and then distribute the value added product to the of the world. In the past we have also been a major centre for the distribution of wool, with sales located in the city. The use of the 'Geelong' is a fairly contentious issue is one that I hope the honourable member Corangamite will take up in some detail the speech that he will deliver later on in debate. Geelong also has one of the great wool research and development facilities. There are some 300 people employed at the CSIRO Division of Wool Technology. It is the largest wool research facility in the world, with an asset value in excess of $100 million. It has extensive laboratories and even has a modern processing mill. In the development of machicarpet nery it has achieved successes which have been adapted by. textile manufacturers right around the world. Of course, the way in which the CSIRO has been able to match the chemical processes with the needs of the environment is one of the great strengths this particular facility. With the downturn in the wool industry there is significant pressure on this facility, but we· must retain the core research staff there. I have had discussions with the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) on this matter, and I would in be hopeful in the context of the budget that some arrangements can be made to retain. the core research facility in Geelong. I think it is time that a rationalisation of that research took place and that the Sydney facility was brought down to Geelong, to a central . Geelong in the past was, and is even now, see a major value added wool processing centre. .It is this area that offers great potential for can further development and employment growth. The value adding activities in Geelong include the wool scouring at BWK and producRobinsons, tops making at BWK, carpet the manufacture at Godfrey Hirst and Brintons, the production of woven upholstered fabrics Classweave and a range of smaller comthe panies producing automotive upholstery, clothing and fashion garments as well. I mention here one particular firm which rest has had outstanding success in the last five years: Godfrey Hirst Australia. Its turnover in the last five years has almost doubled. Its wool export sales have increased by over 500 per name cent. Its employees have increased by 900, and it with a 300 increase since June 1993. The for company recently acquired Homfray-Hycraft in in a rationalisation which was supported by this the federal government through the TCFDA. The company has expanded in line with the government's vision for this part of the textile industry. I pay particular tribute to the owner, Mr George MCKendrick, who has taken up the challenge that was issued to this section of the textile industry by ex-Minister Button when he. was in the industry·· chair. The company is now the largest manufacturer of wool yarns in the world. Its monthly usage of scoured wool is some 1,000 tonnes. To put that into an equivalent production capacity off the sheep's back, that is some four million sheep. We have a great future in the value added of production of fine wools-not so much the coarse wools but the fine wools-and I would like to mention a small firm called Hedrena Textiles; which is starting to grow. It has some difficulties with its production processes, but is finally in a position to launch the marketplace in many avenues. The firm produces fine woollen baby blankets, fine woollen dressing gowns, fine woollen underwear, fine woollen sports and leisure wear and, of course, industrial wear. My great hope is one day to see Gary Ablett taking one of the most spectacular marks that the Australian Rules code has ever seen, while he is wearing a fine woollen Geelong football jumper produced from fine wools in the Geelong hinterland and value added in the Geelong region. . There is one matter that I would like to mention here in my concluding remarks in this debate, and that is this: there has been lot of criticism of the International Wool Secretariat. It is time that it was brought home to Australia, and it ought to be located in Geelong. Geelong is the wool capital of Australia and of the southern hemisphere. Indeed, if we could bring that facility back, Geelong would be the wool capital of the world, and an appropriate place to locate that particular facility. In the moments remaining to me in this debate, let me say that the honourable member for Corangamite and I have sparred across the river and across the political fence on many occasions in the past. Over a decade now we have been engaging in political battle, but this particular industry is one which is close to both our hearts. He did assure me today that he would wear the red socks and I would imagine, given his political complexion, this would be about the only time he would wear a red garment. I have got my red socks on today, and he has got his on, over there. I think that is a first. But gone one better: not only am I wearing the socks,I am wearing the jocks-but I am not going tei show them here today. (Time expired)",21
10,Mr WAKELIN,BUSINESS,"I am pleased to be part of this debate during National Wool Week, and certainly it is a , particular pleasure to enjoy the bipartisan nature of the debate and the good humour across the chamber this morning. I suppose had my first memory of the wool industry as a young fellow in the wool boom is that of into going around picking up the remains from the paddock for pocket money. That little story tells people about my beginnings in the wool industry. I should have been prepared for the great price fluctuations. There we were, going around the paddock picking up the dead wool: such was the nature of the demand at that time. When I started farming in 1969, the wool prices were the lowest ever, and the late 1980s and early 1990s also had pretty disastrous effects for the wool industry, particularly at the grower level. But wool is more than just an industry and more than just a commodity. It is pait of Australia's culture, as we well know. I am a thinking of some of the great storytellers of this place: people like Clyde Cameron and Mick Young, both of them South Australians. One of Clyde's stories that I loved was from when he· was a learner shearer. When Clyde first started shearing he was battling along, as we all do as learner shearers. It was a pretty tough season and, as Clyde tells it, he took so long to shear an old cracker ewe that it had died while it was on the board. In those days, a shearer did not get paid, as I understand it, if the sheep passed away on the board. It was a pretty long board, and the boss was at the other end, so Clyde shot out and dragged the sheep out into the let-out pen and stood it up on a stick. The sheep stood up there till the end of the run, when the boss went and counted them out. The boss came back to Clyde and said, 'That sheep is dead!' . 'No', said Clyde, 'not when I put it out!'. That story is part of the humour and enjoyment that we have all shared on the wool I have board at shearing time over the years. As a sheep farmer, of course, one does see the other side of it, when one is responsible for showing a profit and loss each year and each season. At this point, it is worth having a look at what Ross Garnaut said in the summer 1994 edition of Sydney Papers, when he described wool in the context of the contemporary economic and political culture of Australia. I am not exactly sure of the date, but, it would be in the last few months, which I think makes it still current. He said: The discussion over the past several weeks provided some interesting insights into the political economy of contemporary Australia. Discussion the Report reveals the separationthat is, the Garnaut report:of rural and urban Australia. The intensive discusits sion of .the Report is very much a rural phenomsaid, enon. Sydney so far hasn't focused on it. The discussion provided. some important insights more specifically into the political economy of the been. Australian wool industry. Despite the wool industry's tragically diminished current circumlast stances, its members are turning to government for assistance less than other sections of the Australian economy that are not experiencing such severe· problems. The wool industry, for all its problems, is still prepared to face structural change more readily than many parts of the economy; The Report was prepared at a time of crisis. the wool industry. On the day announced the real price of wooilit auction was the lowest this century. In the financial year just ended, most farmers' incomes were negative, and most wool farmers are currently experiencing financial difficulties in some degree. We all understand that. He later says: It is significant that at a time of wool industry crisis, a Report which sees no part of a solution increasing government subsidy has been mostly warmly welcomed by the wool-growing communithe ty. Here the bush has a lesson for Sydney. wool industry, now little subsidised and tively not subsidised at all, contirtuesto pay share of the subsidies and protection that others still get. It continues to pay its share of the cost increasas ing regulatory arrangements in many other indusing tries. The wool industry is not demanding subsidies comparable to other industries. In these circumwho stances, Sydney owes the bush a commitment to get on with cost-reducing restructuring in the rest of the economy. The least that urban Australia do for the bush, is to continue the process past decade; to continue getting off the sheep's back. That is in the political economic climate, and I thought that was worth putting in this morning. 'The sheep's back' is a commOn phrase used and Garnaut putting it in that context was, I thought, quite valuable. We all know about the income levels, et cetera. I will not dwell on that. The real price of wool is showing some improvement, which is to be welcomed. One thing about the wool market share is quite interesting when we look back over the last 50 years: in 1940 hils wool made up 12.38.per cent of the world textile market compared to 12.17 per cent for of synthetics; in 1988-89, the wool share fell to 4.86 per cent-and no doubt has picked upa little since then-while synthetics increased share to 45.77 per cent. Of course, as I it is winning back more of its share today and the price relativities with cotton and synthetics are as good as they have ever If there is anything I have learned from the 12 months or two years in this whole business with our wool industry it is that, when times get tough, the industry really has an opportunity to have a good hard Jook at itself and tries to do the best it can to dig itself out. One of the catalysts for promotion in here today is the drastic circumstances that it our commission was found itself in. We look at the old perennials, I supposeas they almost seem after two or three years or longer of talking about them-the lighter weight wool knitwear; the younger, casual jeans generation knitwear; the contemporary lightweight suits; and the women's wear and in menswear. What I always remember about the women in the downturn of the late 1960s is wool awareness groups that sprang up all The over Australia and how they in their own way prospeccontributed to a greater wool awareness its throughout the nation. Quality is going to be important as it has ever been. It is interestto note that the market is currently prepared to pay premiums to those producers are producing that premium quality wool. When we look at Asia we think about value can adding and things like that. However, I am of the cautious about that area because I do. not think we are doing enough value adding in our own backyard. I welcome the comments of previous speakers about areas where we are making a success of it, however we still need to focus on research and development and on the most effective way to develop the technol. ogy which will give us arnarket advantage. In terms of the industry itself, in the way we get the wool off the sheep's back, in the shearing plant, even in the yards-and that is a bit of an art in itself-it seems that we are not putting enough effort into developing a value added approach. We do not have the commitment or the hunger to develop the value adding techniques that are so important mercially. for the Australian economy to have as we move into the next century. It has been a pleasure to be part of debate today. As I have said, I come from growing side of the wool industry. I ain but one part of a long chain. It is a pleasure see the wool industry on the up a little bit. Some people will today be able to see sheep grazing on the grass on the top of Parliament House, and they may even see the sheep dog belonging to the honourable member for , O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in action.",23
11,Mr CAMPBELL,BUSINESS,"It is a pleasure to join what might described as an orgy of self-congratulation. want to pay a special tribute to the honourIn able member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). The honourable member was one of the first people in this House to recognise the comings of the Australian Wool Corporation 'and to argue for its demise. I know that had a lot of epithets hurled at him over that. History has proved. him right, and I am wool. pleased to see that his electorate of Parkes, like ,Geelong, is becoming a centre of wool excellence. I want to dwell for a little while on the history of wool. The honourable member Parkes mentioned the part played by Macarthere'. thur. From my reading of history he should, more properly, as so often is the case, mentioned the part played by Macarthur's wife. There are other people who should mentioned. For example, Thomas Shaw came to Australia 150 years ago from Bradford. taught Australian farmers how woolclip. He played a large part in developing the future of the Australian wool trade. There were the people responsible for Peppin bloodlines. There were also the Merrimans who, in 1920, saved the merino getting rid of the vermont genes that were foolishly included in the breed. Other unsung heroes include the small family company in France of Slumberjay, which makes the will combs that comb the long Australian wool. That company makes those combs for the industry entire world. It has stuck to this task through thick and thin. Without that company no fine Australian merino wool would be used comI also want to mention people whom I think are latter-day heroes. I have a special regard the for Jonathan Todhunter, because in my view the Mr Todhunter is unique in the Australian wool industry. There is no-one·· that I have to met with the breadth of vision that Jonathan Todhunter brings to the wool industry. I am pleased to see that a company with which he is closely associated, Austops in .Parkes, appears to be going from strength to strength. I want to talk about the politics of wool. I have here a copy of the front page of the Wool Record. The Wool Record is produced be in Bradford and it is, without a doubt, the I inost authoritative wool journal in the world. it is a copy of a speech given in Bradford to the textile producers by Jo Modiano. Mr Modiano is very important to the Australian shortwool industry because his company, G. Modiano Ltd,imports about 250,000 bales of he Australian wool every year. He is a significant purchaser and processor of Australian At this conference he virtually said to the Europeans,'The game is up. The processing industry will move to Australia, not just because Australia is where the merinos grow, for but because of technological advancements The truth is that the new plants in Australia, those owned by Austops and by have Bremmer won Kammeri in Geelong, are producing at the rate of 100 tonnes per man be per year, whereas those in Europe and Japan are averaging about 50 tonnes per year. It is He that productivity that has given Australia an to prepare their enormous advantage. This is going to have big political implications because we will see exports of wool the from Australia go from around $5 billion a year to $20 billion within the next 15 years. by It will be without a doubt Australia's major so export once again. The important thing is that this will occur in regional Australia; it will not be centred on the cities of Australia. It restore enormous political clout to country towns. One of the troubles of the wool is that it has had no political representation; the numbers are small and by and large it has been represented by the National Party, and everyone can understand what that means. The wool industry will now have a lot of allies in the manufacturing industry. We are going to see workers have a direct vested interest in the welfare of the wool industry, and I am sure that it will go from strength to strength. It is going to restore prosperity to country towns, because these wool processing plants are going to employ lots of people. There is going to be work once again in country areas. Over time governments in Australia, whether they are Liberal Party or whether they are Labor Party, have tended to be city dominated and, worse of all, Melbourne and Sydney dominated. But this is going to change, for the reality is that once we get 50 kilometres out of Melbourne and Sydney the people there probably have more in common with the people of my state than they do with people in their capital cities. I want to touch on a point made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) about the banks. There is no doubt that the wool industry is going to prosper. It is going to happen for a lot of reasons which give us an advantage. It is going to happen because of people's vision. The truth is that so often in the past that vision has come from very few people. I see people in this House singing a different song from the song they were singing in the early 1990s-in 1990-91. It is that bugle call qf change from a few people that is going to lead rural Australia and Australia as a whole back to prosperity. It is important that the banks realise this. When I was at school many years ago, there was a rule of thumb: if you were bright you went on to tertiary education; if you were not so bright you took the public service examination, and if you failed that you went into banking. Unfortunately, those people of my generation who failed the public service examination are now at the top of the banking industry. I think this is a problem, because if the banks do not realise the potential of the wool industry in Australia they are likely to foreclose on the industry. We need a lot mOre common sense and a lot more faithfaith in Australians, faith in the future of Australia and faith in the wool industry-from the banks. As the honourable member for' Kennedy said,there are people who will be foreclosed'outofthe wool industry, who are in desperate plight through no real fault of their own. The reality is that the Wool CorPoration did, in my estimation, three Alan Bonds' worth of damage to the economy. The difference is that Alan did most of his damage to German, French and Swiss investors, and I think that is probably not so bad. The Wool Corporation did most of its damage to Australians. It is absolutely puerile-it is wrongto blame wool growers for what happened. The whole industry, the government and the opposition are all singing that same song. It is true that wool growers were enormously ignorant of their industry. Now that is changing. I think wool growers are becoming more aware. When we see people of the stature of Joe Mondiano in the Bradford Wool Record making these statements, the future must be bright for Australia. We have to get our thinking in perspective. We are going to host the Olympic Games in the year 2000 in Sydney, which is on the extreme east coast of Australia. I say to the Olympic committee that it ought to think seriously about making the Australian merino the symbol for the Olympic Games. A toast current in Spain around the 1580s was along the lines, 'Phillip may reign but the merino is our king'. If that were true for Spain in the 1580s, it is much more true for Australia today. In the Australian merino we have a unique fibre, yet we have seen Australian wool producers' money used to promote the generic term 'wool'. Generically, wool is just not the same; Australian wool cannot be compared with coarse fibre wool. When I did wool classing in 1956, I was told that the greatest market was in the United States; it still is. The United States isa small per capita user of wool because people there believe wool is coarse and prickly-an army uniform material. US wool is, but Australian wool is not. Through the Wool Corporation, we spent $3 billion promoting that message in the United States without appreciably increasing the sales of wool there. The potential is enormous; the Australian wool industry will go from strength to strength. I pay tribute to the often lone voices that are the bugle call for change and advancement in the Australian wool industry.",25
12,Mr MCARTHUR,BUSINESS,"I am delighted, as all other speakers are,that the parliament has seen fit to support the wool industry. This gives an indication of the confidence that this parliament has in the wool· industry after the turbulent days of the last decade. We have seen the boom times of 1988 and then the tremendous slump that affected all wool growers. I compliment the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) on his initiative in keeping this project going. I thank the Joint House Department and· the southern wool Primac in New South Wales for allowing the display of five varieties of wool at the parliament. All those people have contributed to making this a very important event at the national parliament for an industry that is most important, both in terms of exports and, historically, to Australia. . All people associated with the wool industry are concerned about the stockpile of 3.8 million bales·that overhangs the market. That is a problem about which there has been much discussion in this parliament and amongst all those associated with the wool industry.  Wool Council of Australia, who is in the gallery. I am delighted to see him here representing all wool growers and all the arguments that have taken place over the years. As well, I thank the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) for his kind remarks and support for the wool industry and the role that Geelong has played in the wool industry. The new scheme to deal with· the wool stockpile is a fixed release arrangement. Over the next six months, 28,000 bales will be released each month and,after January 1995, 187,000 bales will be released each quarter. The problem the wool industry faces is what to do about the stockpile if the market rises dramatically. Will it stick with the fixed price schedule or will the system be changed yet again? Of course, we have been through that debate. One of the real problems facing the wool industry is the amount of wool that it is going to produce. Some estimates suggest that we will produce 690 million kilograms in the current year, and some others suggest that the figure will be 751 million kilograms. There are more sheep than that in New South Wales and in Western Australia. The future. price affects all wool growers. As honourable members have said, the industry is at this stage almost unprofitable, but the price indicator at 556c on March 15 was encouraging compared with this time last year. The 19micron wools have led the way with· a remarkable recovery in price, which perhaps has given a false impression of the market indicator compared to that for the broader wools. ABARE is suggesting a long-term price of 545c. Generally, I have found that ABARE has been dead wrong-.,..it was predicting continuing booms in 1988. Hopefully wool will improve in price; and that indicator could even go up 50c or 100c. The recovery in most nations around the world, except in Japan and Germany, augurs well for the future of the wool· industry, particularly with the buying strength of China now coming back into the market. Wool fibre is now at a historic low which is encouraging people to return to the use of the wool fibre, particularly as there is now a two to one ratio with synthetics. This encourages the processors to come back to the wool fibre. At long last the wool industry is now being controlled by the private sector and hopefully we will never return to a reserve price arrangement. Could I just in the last few minutes avaihible to me commend the futures market. Hopefully that will even out the fluctuations in the wool market as growers come to fully understand it. As the honourable member for Corio said, we both have a vested interest in maintaining wool sales at Geelong. There is a great argument going on about centralising wool selling in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. Those of us in Geelong are suggesting that there is a very sound argument for retaining wool selling there. That is supported by the honourable member for Corio and me. There are approximately 500,000 bales of wool sold in Geelong and out of Portland compared to about 500,000 bales sold in Melbourne, just 35 minutes away. Both the honourable member for Corio and I support strongly the wool sales being continued in Geelong while the wool is sold by sample. (TIme expired)",27
13,Mr ADAMS,BUSINESS,"I rise to support the concept of National Wool Week. In fact, I think that it could be wool month or even wool year in the future. I congratulate the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) for his motion. Wool is a most versatile commodity. Its value is in its raw state, especially in the superfine wools. It is valuable as slightly processed into tops and it has additional value as a yarn. It has further v-lue as it is made into articles. From then on one can go into all sorts of flights of fantasy about what one can do with wool. Designer use of wool could yield the most specific and spectacular ideas and garments which would add great value to the woollen product. I hope everybody here today will be visiting the display that is here in the parliament and I congratulate everybody who has brought along their wares and put the display together. There is also a fashion parade later in the day. I would like to mention the designers in Tasmania, the Richmond collection. They are one of our local groups in Tasmania which have been promoting wool made up into garments and I know they are well sought after throughout the state. I think the main thing which we have not done with wool, and which we are starting to get to now, is to market it and to market it as a Tasmanian wool. My colleague the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) touched on a lot of those issues quite well. We should get it down to an Australian wool and into specific areas and regions within Australia. I mentioned in my first speech in the House and again in supporting the Garnaut report recommendations that Australian wool should be recognised not only as Australian but as quality, as value, as the top of the range of any natural fibre. And it should be Australian wool. By using regions from which the wool comes there can also be the added description of that wool. I used as examples Cressy tweed and Campbell Town worsted. Carpet wool production in Tasmania has grown and we have a carpet factory. Some of the coarser wools of the state of Tasmania and some of the carpet in Parliament House here come from that carpet factory in Tasmania. I do not know whether Tasmanian carpets will ever go on and become the modern equivalent of Persian carpets, with the influence and the history that they have in selling. Tasmania is also known for its fishing potential. Fisherman need warm clothes to cope with the harsh conditions they face down there in the roaring forties, so here is an up ideal opportunity to develop a line of knitwear for work. The Australian bluey is made of felted wool. It is also very popular in most work gangs in colder climates, but I do not see it marketed very well in that line. We do not seem to market wool in some of those lines very well at all-I do not think we market them at all. The bush shirts from New Zealand seem to have a name that bush shirts that are made in Australia do not have. It would seem that only New Zealand made bush shirts. In fact we make a considerable quantity of bush shirts of high quality in this country, but we do not seem to have established our name in that area. We need to stimulate wool demand in a traditional sense of selling it in its raw or slightly processed state but we also need to specialise. We need to research the market better and more; we need more research on the quality of our fibre to come up with what else we can use wool for. It is known for its non flammability and strength; in Tasmania another factory, Waverley Woollen Mills, has looked at aircraft seat covers over some time. Research should continue into the use of sheepskins in beds, particularly for those in hospitals, to help prevent bedsores. Similarly, research into many other products in that area should proceed. I have an article from the UK about mattresses for babies. (TIme expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. .DELEGATION REPORTS Delegation to India, Bangladesh and",28
14,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to India, Bangladesh and Nepal, November to December 1993, entitled Parliaments, progress and poverty: facts and impressions from· South Asia. As leader of the delegation I wish to make some short remarks in relation to the report. This was the first parliamentary delegation from Australia to India since 1986, the first to Bangladesh since 1978 and the first to Nepal since 1974. The delegation had broad terms of reference, and individuals had particular interests and concerns which we were also anxious to pursue. It was a great challenge in what was.a relatively short period to come to grips with the political complexities in each country and the sheer scale of the problems of south Asia. It is a natural tendency to perhaps be overwhelmed by the size of the challenges governments face in the part of the world that we visited in coping with intensive development and providing for people's basic needs. The delegation visited south Asia at an important period in the history of the three countries. The visit coincided with economic policy changes and the affirmation or establishment of democratic institutions. India, of ,course, is a robust democracy. It has a highly sophisticated political culture, as one would expect from its constitutional tradition and its achievement of unity in diversity. Since the end of the Cold War, India has been searching for new spheres of influence, with the end of its special relationship with the former Soviet Union. This is occurring at a time of great changes in the way in which it goes about the control of its· economy. In his recent book, The Work of Nations, Robert Reich coincidentally makes the following observation: Mahatma Gandhi, rejecting the pleasures of materidifficulties al well-being, denounced manufacturing machinery as ""the chief symbol of modem civilizations,"" representing Ita great sin"". From what we observed, there have been great changes in attitude within the leadership of India. India is constructing a market econNepal omy which on the surface appears to be working well. The name of Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, whom the delegation had the pleasure to meet, is one which is often mentioned in the world's financial press. This is an unprecedented occurrence. As we mention in the report, another first was the recent news that the Indian Revenue Bank has had to sell rupees in order to keep the value of the currency down. That is a very telling performance indicator for India. Of course, there is great potential in what is happening in the area of trade and in the economic changes in India. The delegation was also interested in the social effect of these changes to a market economy. This was true not only of India but also of Bangladesh and Nepal. Many of those with whom the delegation was able to speak, and this included representatives of trade organisations, were concerned about the adverse effects that economic reforms might have on those already living at a depressed level. I stress that the delegation found that government leaders were sensitive to the political problems that might arise in the change to a market economy. They were quite willing to be challenged by members of the delegation when we asked what was the relationship between the economic changes that were occurring and what social outcomes were going to be achieved by those changes. India, it should be noted, has encouraged investment in the new and heavy end of its industry. It has also indicated that light industry, the large scale employing and exporting industries, to a great extent will be insulated from the effects of economic changes for sociopolitical reasons, while the pressure upon them to perform well will be maintained. As I said earlier, one of the delegation's was that, in a three-week period while visiting three countries, it had little time to fully expose itself to the depth and breadth of the problems that confronted the countries. We couch our remarks in the report in the context of understanding that difficulty. We would hope that the report is not seen to be us preaching to others about things of which we were only able to gain superficial knowledge. For instance, we highlight the question of child labour in each of the three countries. I hope that our comments are seen as observations of a problem that each of those countries must tackle. I would hope that the comments are not seen as our presuming to dictate to those who are responsible for making policy. The comments I have made about economic changes in India are also true for Bangladesh and Nepal. It was a bit of a surprise to members of the delegation that each of the countries had similar policy outlooks. The delegation was also interested in other matters in Bangladesh and Nepal, principally the prospects for the sustainability and stability of newly established democratic institutions. The delegation found' much optimism in both Bangladesh and Nepal that democratic solutions to the problems of development appeared to offer the most hope for these countries. I will not take the liberty of highlighting a number of the incidents throughout our visit. Perhaps my colleagues will do that I hope not too much to my chagrin. Of course, these delegations take a great deal 6f organisation. With great emphasis, I should place on record our thanks to the host parliaments, particularly the presiding officers and officials for inviting us and putting together not only interesting but also rewarding programs. I also place on record our thanks to our representatives in our missions in New Delhi, Dhaka and Kathmandu. Ata debriefing session held in December on our return, we were able to make fulsome comments about how we saw the operation of the representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in those countries. We also made some comments about how we saw officers of the south Asia desk approaching their job. Most importantly, I would like to place on record-I think it is often overlooked in delegation reports-our thanks to the parliamentary research office for its briefings before we went, in particular to Dr Ravi Tomar, who runs the parliament's south Asia desk. Also, we should place on record our thanks for the efforts of the Parliamentary Relations Office staff. Sometimes' I think that we gave them a bit more of a problem than they really deserved, but they did in the end come through and we are grateful. Finally, I would like to thank my parliamentary colleagues on the delegation. Sometimes in this place we hear a lot of the lack of harmony that some parliamentary delegations are afflicted with. But to the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), who was the deputy leader, to the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) and the honourable member for 'Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith), I would like to place on record the my thanks for their cooperation throughout the whole visit. In hearing those names, people would understand that that delegation represents a rather diverse group in political views. Having said that, the way in which the delegation was able to operate in harmony and present a united front on almost all occasions is a credit to each of the individuals. However, I do not think that we left any of our hosts or the people that we spoke to with the impression that we did not have diverse views. It was not as if for the duration of the delegation's visit we said that we were all as one but, as the earlier events of NationalWool, Day have shown, often in this place we can see a great deal of cooperation for a mutually ·positive outcome. . I would also like to express not only the delegation's gratitude but my personal gratitude to Mr John Carter, who was secretary to the delegation. He works in the parliamentary education office. Again, from time to time the delegation perhaps gave him a few headaches, but he was able to handle that with a great degree of good humour. During the visit and also since our return, in the preparation of the report, John has made a great contribution to the success of the delegation. I think I can say that this delegation was a good team. I thank everyone, including the two spouses that accompanied us, Mrs Beverly MCArthur and Mr Jack Smith, for rallying around when it was required, contributing their share of good humour and comradeship. fu conClusion, may I say that our delegation was impressed with its reception in all three countries. In India and Nepal we received hospitality at the highest levels and indications from ministers that Australia should be taking more interest in the affairs of south Asia. The delegation came away with the impression that south Asia has been neglected by our foreign policy makers and that more resources and commitment should be devoted to improving ties with this part of the world. While in no way questioning stronger links with the so-called tiger nations of the Pacific rim, the· delegation would like to say that there are trade and investment opportunities elsewhere in Asia and that the tiger nations the future will include countries on the Indian subcontinent more obviously identified with these magnificent animals. I commend the report to the House.",29
15,Mr MCARTHUR,BUSINESS,"by leave- Mr Acting Speaker, I add my commendation to you as leader of the delegation, and to my parliamentary colleagues. I support the remarks that you made by saying that the parliamentary delegation worked very well as a representative of this parliament. As you said, there was a divergence of views, although maybe at the conclusion of the delegation's visit I might have agreed with the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and his political viewpoint because he was so persuasive. Apart from that, I do think that it was a very united team in representing the parliament to those three countries, and I compliment you as leader for your handling of many sensitive situations and issues in those countries on behalf of the parliamentary delegation. I also compliment our secretary, Mr John Carter, on his assistance during the trip and his production of our final report. This of the best parliamentary reports that I have seen in terms of its interpretation and presenof tation of the discussions we had with those high-level leaders and with other members of the community in those three countries. The sensitivities of the political discussions we had throughout those three weeks have been well covered. The highlights of our visit to the fledging democracies include the deeper awareness we gained of the poverty of those three nations, the new global outlook in terms of economic matters, the foreign aid issue, the refugee camps, the eye camp in Nepal, water and sanitation and, of course, the issue of child labour. This parliament has often taken for granted that it will go on and on, that ministers will come and go, that prime ministers will be elected and defeated and that, inevitably, the parliament will remain solid and strong. That is not always the case. India has had a long parliamentary tradition whereas on the subof continent in Bangladesh and Nepal, the delegation felt concern about whether the parliamentary system as we know it would continue for years to come in view of its more recent history. In Bangladesh, democratic elections were held in February 1991 following a history of military control. We hope that we might have had a minor influence as a delegation and that our contribution may help that parliamentary system to continue in good faith. Obviously, it is fragile and it will only be with the goodwill of people involved that the Bangladesh parliament will continue. Our hope is that it will prosper. The Acting Speaker commented on the world economy and the attitude of finance ministers in Bangladesh and in India. Our meeting with Saifur Rahman, the Bangladesh finance minister, was enlightening, to say the least. In that very small country of 120 million people the finance minister was talking about free economy, cutting taxes, creating wealth and encouraging foreign investment to that country so that Bangladesh, which is regarded as one of the poorest is one countries in the world, could make some economic progress and improve the standard living of its people. It came to our attention that foreign aid was a key factor in the maintaining of the current standard of living, and one wondered whether that would be that sustained forever and a day. India has a population of 870 million people, and this number increases by the total population of Australia each year. Historically, it is a closed economy with the dead hand of the socialist approach of the Soviet Union but it has now moved to a freer and more open economy. The delegation· met with the finance minister, Man Singh, a most impressive world figure, in my view, who conveyed to the delegation India's attitude to international investment, privatisation programs, fiscal and monetat), responsibility, population control, the attitude of the IMF and, of course, infrastructure improvement in terms of roads and communications. It was indicated to us that India could become a major trading partner with Australia. The refugee camps provided an insight and an understanding to those of us who had never seen the human side of those persons displaced from the Burmese border. There were 20 refugee camps with 250,000 refugees as at September 1992. It is a remarkable experience to see so many humans confined to such a small space, with problems of housing, nutrition and the many human problems. It seemed to us that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees were doing a pretty good job under fairly difficult circumstances. In Nepal, which has a population of 20 million people, we enjoyed the hospitality and great understanding of Ambassador Les Douglas and his wife, Una Douglas. We understood their contribution to the Australian-Nepalese relationships, and his practical approach is to be commended. The poverty and the lack of industry in Nepal were all too apparent throughout the countryside. Democracy appeared there only in 1990 after 30 years of benign rule by the king, and it was of concern that democracy continue. The highlight of our visit to Nepal was the eye program being carried out there. It was initiated by Fred Hollows, a fact well known to many Australians. Dr Sanduk Ruit is now the leader of that program. We were most impressed with the eye camp that we visited. We saw the tremendous human joy of some of the patients who could see for the first in 10 years-or 20 years in some cases-after the marvellous operation carried out by Dr Ruit on the day that we visited. The eye factory in Nepal, to which Australians have contributed quite significantly through Australian aid money, produces cheap lenses-for $1O-which means that many of the poorer Nepalese people can have their sight returned. Finally, I refer to the forestry project in Nepal where Australian aid workers, led by Bill Jackson, have turned around the attitude of the local economy. This project has encouraged villagers to look after their forests, to repic1nt and cultivate their trees in a meaningful way to provide fuel for households.and to provide sawlogs, and to take a better approach to the conservation of the whole countryside. I think the goodwill and political understanding that the delegation provided between Australia and the Indian subcontinent were very worthwhile. Some of the comments that you, Mr Acting Speaker, have made about the senior government leaders that we met were very much appreciated by the delegation. I hope that the activities of the delegation. will be the basis of continuing good relationships between those three countries and this parliament as well as the Australian nation as a whole.",31
16,Mr HOLLIS,BUSINESS,"by leave-We have a very short time in which to speaJ< meaningfully on the problems and diversity, or indeed the potential, of the countries we visited. At the outset, let me. pay tribute to you for your leadership, Mr Acting Speaker, and to the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), the deputy leader. I believe that we all worked very well as a team. I have been on a delegation where the members did not work as a team, and I know the difficulties that that creates. The delegation members all came from very divergent political philosophies, but occasionally we saw eye to eye and we all had the opportunity to put our point of view. Despite the criticism that the media inevitably like to engage in about overseas trips, I believe that the taxpayers of Australia and, indeed, this parliament got value from this delegation. As you have said, Mr Acting Speaker, the time comments we have made in our report are just that: comments. It is not for us to preach, and we do not seek to do so, to the countries we visited. It is almost impossible to meet all the interests of members of such delegations...,....we saw three countries of great interest and diversity in 18 days. One problem faced by each country is that of a rapidly increasing population. The economic changes in all three, especially India, will mean little unless something is done about the population. For example, as has been said, and as our report mentions-and it was pointed out to us many times-India adds the equivalent of the population of Australia to its population each year. Just to keep pace with that population growth, India has to create something like six to seven million new jobs each year. Even with an economic growth of up to five per cent, India can create only four million jobs. So·that means that there is a cumulative pool of some two miIlion unemployed on top of what the country already has each year. I was disappointed that we did not see any of the population programs. As populati()n is so important to each of these c()untries, I thought we sh()uld have seen those programs. I know some members of the delegation got a religious buzz out of seeing Mother Teresa in Calcutta. However, I think it would have given us a better appreciation of the problems if we had seen s()me of the programs that were being implemented to come to terms with population growth. One problem is that India and Australia have always taken each other far too much for granted. On most issues there is no dispute between the two countries, and I sometimes think that the only dispute we have with India is on the cricket field. Our business people view India from a height of some 30,000 feet as they fly over the country to and from Europe, trying to break into a market that is closed to us. In India-depending on whose figures are used-there is a large middle-class population. When average Australians think of India, they think of poverty-and, of course, there is a great deal of poverty there-but there is also a middle class in India of between 60 million and 80 million people with a disposable income as great as ours. Our business people must do more to become involved in that area. Many people have referred to the finance minister of India. When we visited the various ministers in India, I felt that we could have been talking to some of the Australian ministers, so similar were their views. In fact, when we were talking to the finance minister of india-and that was at the time when the honourable member for. Gellibrand (Mr WiIIis) was our finance minister--:-I thought it was the honourable member wearing a turban speaking to us. I suppose one. would have to say now that it would have been the honourable member for Swan (MrBeazley) in a turban speaking to us. The point is that their views were very similar. I must add that I felt that we spent too much of out time in Delhi. We should have had the opportunity to visit places outside Delhi. . In Bangladesh we were· able to appreciate the problems that that country faces with refugees. In many respects; I think it is handling its refugee problem a lot better than Australia is handling its refugee problem. Nepal was particularly interesting. As it was for others, for me the highlight was a visit to the eye camp. I am not sure that I could have witnessed more than one eye operation, but I think one of the highlights of the visit was to be with you, Mr Acting Speaker, when someone who had not been able to see for many years had the bandages removed from his eyes and the first thing he saw after many years of darkness was your face. I am not sure whether that person wanted to be blind again or not! Nevertheless, the joy expressed on that person'sface-'-even though your face was the first thing he saw-showed how much he appreciated heingable to see.again. I have a particular interest in this eye program. A lot of the work that has been carried out in that area and in the production of the lenses-which will be made in Nepal in the future-has been done at my local university, the University of Wollongong, with which Professor Fred Hollows had a very close association. So I had a particular interest in that. As I said, for me one of the highlights of the visit was to see Australian aid bringing so much benefit to so many people. One issue that will have to be addressed in Australia is the question of child labour. I hoped my friend and colleague the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary), who took a particular interest in this, would have been here. I am sure he is going to raise that issue in this parliament, if not today, then at some other time. r would like to thank my colleagues on the delegation. As I said before, we worked well together under the leadership of you, Mr Acting Speaker, and the deputy leader. I would also lik- to thank the host parliaments and the missions, especially· the mission in Nepal which I thought went out of its way to be of assistance to us, as indeed· did the mission in Bangladesh. I am not quite so sure about the mission in India; I think we interrupted too many gins and tonics. I would also like to thank the secretary of the delegation, Mr John Carter, for putting up with us and for his sterling work.",32
17,Mr BRADFORD,BUSINESS,"by leave-This was my first official delegation as a member of parliament, having served almost four years here. I must say I found it very enjoyable. I enjoyed not only the visits to the countries and the exchange of views we had within those countries but also, as other members of the delegation have said, the exchange or views that we experienced within the delegation. I agree with the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Ho11is), who observed that he, I, and the honourable member for Wi11s (Mr Cleary) actually spent time together and enjoyed each other's company, although our political views would be almost the extremes in this place. Occasionally, we even agreed on some things although I guess that we saw the world's problems from very different perspectives most of the time. From my point of view, that was a very valuable part of the delegation. Along with other honourable members, I would like to add my congratulations to you, Mr Acting Speaker, on your leadership of the delegation. You did an outstanding job, and that was really one of the underlying reasons for the success of the delegation. I believe I am a better member. of parliament for having been on this delegation .. It has added to the perspective I have on my work here and, had indeed, in my electorate. As a result of going on this trip-which, after all, is funded by the Australian taxpayer-I feel I can make a better contribution in this place. I was surprised by the warmth of the reception afforded us in each country. I am not sure that·· I would have expected it to be otherwise. It was, in fact, very warm in each country-literally and otherwise. We were really welcomed by each of the countries that we went to. In each country there was a real desire for an exchange of views, particularly in the new democracies of Bangladesh and Nepa1. They were anxious to find out how democracy worked.· I thought at times that perhaps we were not the best people to tell them, and that if they came here and saw democracy working they might wonder whether it worked at all. The fact is that Australia is well regarded as one of the world's oldest democracies and those countries were anxious to find out how our parliament worked as much as we were to learn from them about theirs and about their country. I was also impressed, as other members of the delegation were, with the reputation of our overseas posts. In aU of the countries the members of our diplomatic corps were well respected and well informed. As the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) said, this was particularly so in Nepal, where Les Douglas and his wife, Una, are nearing the end of a fairly long term and have made a very real and valuable contribution to relations between our two countries. Each of the countries we visited had problems which make ours in Australia pale into insignificance. Each is underdevelopedalthough we now call them developing countries-and,· for each, overpopulation is an underlying problem. There are various perspectives on this problem, and the members of the delegation did not necessarily agree on the solutions, but there are obvious strong connections between standards of living and birth rates. The challenge is to help these countries break out of the trap which is created by rapid population growth. My own view-and I must say this was confirmed by those I spoke to-was that education is the best contraceptive and is a vital component in decreasing birth rates in those countries. In my view, the highlight of the visit to India was our meeting with Mother Teresa, and I take issue with what the honourable member for Throsby has said. I am a little sad that he should cast aspersions on that aspect of the trip, because for me it· really was the highlight. I was able to see for the first time what Christianity in practice is really like. In the work that Mother Teresa and the Sisters of Charity are doing in the squalor of Calcutta I saw perhaps for the first time what love for one's neighbour is really all about. I need to place that on record because I do feel that the· honourable member for Throsby totally missed the point of those few minutes that we spent there. Nepal was also a wonderful experienceeverything one would expect from that country. I might just do my little bit for promoting tourism in Nepal by saying that it really is a country that Australians should take the opportunity to visit. It is everything one would expect. The backdrop to the city of Kathmandu, the Himalayas, is magnificent and I would recommend that to all Australians. The only problem Kathmandu has is air pollution. It has become a big problem and I am pleased that the government is addressing that issue, otherwise it will have an adverse effect on the tourism industry. Finally, I say once again how much I enjoyed being a part of this delegation. It was a real privilege to be an Australian member of parliament representing the Australian people on a delegation such as this and I am pleased to have been able to make a contribution in that way.",34
18,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,BUSINESS,"by leaveAs part of the delegation and the only woman representative from this parliament, I have several things to add to what my friends have already said. Firstly, Mr Acting Speaker, I would like to once again endorse others' sentiments on the fact that you led our delegation in such superb style. Without your leadership, I too wonder how our delegation might have held together under some of the circumstances we encountered. I would also like to place on record my thanks to our secretary, Mr John Carter. He did a sterling job throughout the visit and also in assisting you since we have been back in putting together this report. It was quite unexpected that at an early stage of being a parliamentarian in this place one would be afforded the opportunity to go on this visit. In visiting those three countries I think I have had one of the greatest learning experiences of the last 12 months of my life. As the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) mentioned, he has had a . similar experience.. The three countries we visited afforded us an insight into the huge problems facing· Third World nations. I think it struck us all that population was one of the major problems. As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) mentioned, India adds an Australia to its population each year. That is quite an astounding figure. So there is a lot to be done but those nations are developing; they are developing well. They are developing by looking towards countries such as our own for guidance and assistance; Within the country of India, I suspect that each of us found something that was outstanding. The outstanding parts of my visit to that country were, first of all, seeing how the - omen of the country lived. I think I found that most astonishing in the industrial estate of Faridabad, where the conditions for women working would absolutely appal the women of Australia. I think that we can offer assistance in that area to India, on the industrial relations opportunities and the work practices we have here in Australia. Opportunities for trade, as other members of the delegation have said, are open to Australia-and we should grab every opportunity. As the honourable member for Throsby said, it is not enough to n-r over it at 30,000 feet. I think we need to ask our business people to look with renection at those countries and in particular India. They are looking for our trade. Let us grab that opportunity. The honourable member for MCPherson mentioned the visit with Mother Teresa. It also stood out in my memory. There is a diminutive lady who is doing something. So many people in this world tum the other way and do absolutely nothing. We should look to our neighbours not only here but across the waters of the world and do something. Therefore, I exhort this government to continue looking at the opportunities for increasing foreign aid. Foreign aid is the lifeblood of developing countries . From India we went to Bangladesh. In Bangladesh we were afforded some wonderful hospitality and assistance from the Australian High Commission by Mr and Mrs Kenneth Aspinall. They had been in 'the job for only a very short time when they were landed with this delegation. They did not have much background knowledge about us, and yet they did a marvellous job in showing us around. The refugee camps at Cox's Bazaar, as the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) mentioned, did stand out. They are a huge problem. The United Nations is doing a marvellous job accommodating that problem. I was also impressed by the women's project outside Dacca where women are taken onto a project and taught life skills. They are taught how to look after themselves and they are afforded an opportunity to be self-sustaining in the future. That project is run with foreign aid. Before I leave the topic of Bangladesh, I would like to mention a unique opportunity I had. Through World Vision, I was able to meet one of the children that my husband and I sponsor. That child lives south of Dacca. It was just wonderful to be given the opportunity to speak with the child that we foster through World Vision. I was able to talk to that child, to find out what the child's aspiraabout tions for the future were and to find out just what the small amount of money in Australian terms that I give each month can do, not only for the child, but also for the family and for the whole community. That was an astounding experience, and one that I am very glad I was given the opportunity to have. If I get that opportunity again, I will do it again. Our second sponsored child is in Madras in southern India. From Bangladesh we went to Nepal, as other speakers have already mentioned. The thing that stood out there was the Fred Hollows eye camp under Dr Ruit. I do not know about the other members of the delegation, but I watched 21/2 operations. I was amazed not only by the conditions, but also by the speed with which those operations were done. It was great to know that our foreign aid is affording people in such incredible poverty the opportunity to see the world. Their world, in our eyes, is something that we do not want to live in, but at least they are given the opportunity. As the honourable member for Corangamite said, it was an amazing experience to stand in the room after the operation and watch the doctor remove the eye patch and to see the reaction of the person who had been operated on. On the day we were there we saw an old man who had been blind for years. One eye was operated on that day, and the second eye was to be done the next day. Just seeing that man's face when the eye patch came off was a miracle in itself. Our foreign aid is creating some of those miracles. The backdrop of the Himalayas was certainly something that we needed to be reminded of. It is a tourist opportunity, but also it is an opportunity for us to assist people. There is a population problem in Kathmandu, and we have the expertise to assist them there. I commend this report to this parliament. I commend my fellow parliamentarians for their friendship, assistance and guidance on the delegation, and I thank the leader of the delegation, the Acting Speaker.",35
19,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Order! With a little bit of embarrassment I thank the members of the delegation for their kind words me. I thank the House for allowing us the time to present the report. I thank the members of the delegation for confirming and illustrating the point that I made that we came to things from divergent viewpoints, but we were able to do that with a great deal of good humour. I am sure that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary), had he been able to be here today, would have given another plank to indicate the breadth of our viewpoints. INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",36
20,Mr WALKER,INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time; This bill proposes an amendment to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. Details of the amendment are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill. The bill has been made necessary by the issue of letters Hon. Gordon Samuels AC, QC and also to Mr Michael Codd AC to conduct an inquiry into the operation and management of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. That inquiry has been asked by the government to report if possible by 30 September 1994 and in any case by 31 December 1994. As the terms of reference include the effectiveness and suitability of existing arrangements for control and accountability of ASIS and the resolution of grievances and complaints relating to ASIS, it is likely that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will have information and documents which would be of considerable relevance to the inquiry. Advice from the Attorney General's Department is that provisions in the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act which were intended to give the maximum possible protection to information held by the inspector-general may actually preclude the Inspector-General from providing information or documents to the inquiry, therefore substantially impeding the ability the inspector-general to cooperate with the quiry. Subsection 34(1) of the act precludes the inspector-general and his or her staff from disclosing or communicating to any person any information obtained by reason of the person having held one of those positions, except in the performance of duties and the exercise of powers under the act. The inspector-general's powers and functions. are listed comprehensively in the act, and do not include the giving of evidence to royal commissions and similar inquiries. The effect of this is that the inspector-general may not lawfully disclose information or give documents to the inquiry. The bill is intended to remove this difficulty. It will permit the current and former inspector-general and the current and former staff of the inspector-general to give information and evidence to commissions of inquiry conducted by the Hon. Gordon Samuels and Mr Michael Codd without risking prosecution. In that way, it will ensure that the commissions have access to a class of information which would be among the most patent to the relevant available. The point should be emphasised that the amendment made by the bill will not permit the disclosure of information or the giving of documents by the Inspector-General or staff other than to the specified commissions of inquiry just referred to. In that way, the present position, which emphasises the need to maintain the greatest possible protection for the privacy of individuals and for information about matters related to security, will be preserved as far as possible. The introduction of the bill is a measure of the importance which the government attaches to enabling the commissions' of inquiry to conduct the fullest examination of the matters within their terms of reference. I commend the bill to the House.  The opposition supports and welcomes this legislation, the purpose of which is to permit the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and his staff to provide information to the forthcoming judicial inquiry into the Australian Secret IntelIigenceService. I of welcome it not least because it was in part the incalls for the investigation of ASIS from the coalition-in particular, from me-which led to the government's decision to set up such an inquiry. The other impetus to the establishment of the inquiry was, of course, the allegations made by former AS IS officers on the. Four Corners program on the· ABe.on 21 February. I very much d.oubt that with.out these stimuli' the··g.overnment w.ould· have established an independent judicial inquiry int.o ASIS. . Just as the g.overnment had t.o be prodded int.o h.olding the inquiry in the first place, s.o is its current attitude t.o theiriquiry-and; in particular, to the issues which led t.o··its establishment-quite. unsatisfact.ory.<· In fact this legislati.on is the first sign .of glasnost -'-""""if I may use an appr.opriate term-in the g.overnment's .handling .of the issue.' The g.overnmenCs decisi.on t.oh.oldan inquiry int.o ASIS presents the .opp.ortunity t.o allay cerns about the serVice; t.o r-ress what in my view are genuine grievances against it; and t.o carry .out whatever changes may be necessary; However, I very much fear that if the arrangeh.ow ments f.or the inquiry are perceived t.o be' unfair .or too narr.ow, then this .opp.ortunity may be l.ost. . I believe the inquiry must be able t.o effecgated. tively allay c.oncerns ab.out ASIS and that in .order t.o d.o s.o these c.oncerns must be pr.operly ventilated. I repeat that the intr.oducti.on .of this legislati.on is the first indicati.on .that I have had that. the g.overnment is seri.ously attempting t.o clear the air. I have stated .on a number.of .occasi.ons I have reservati.ons about· the arrangements the inquiry as they stand at present, and have three maj.or c.oncerns. First, I Mr Michael C.odd, wh.o is referred' t.o in the legisiati.on bef.ore the HHouse, has been s.o cl.osely as.ociated with the g.overnment's .oversight .of the intelligence services by virtue 9fhis presiding .over the Secretaries C.ommittee .on Intelligence and Security as well as Office .of Security and Intelligerice C.o.ordinati.on as t.o disqualify him fr.om the p.ositi.on.of c.ommissi.onerassisting. Ikn.ow Mr C.odd pers.onally. I kn.ow hiin professi.onally. I kn.ow him t.o. be a public the servant .of great ability and integrity. Of that there can be n.o d.oubt at all. ButId.o n.ot think itreas.onable t.o put him a' p.ositi.on where. he .may be' asked t.o tively judge his .own perf.ormance at the head h.oped the inquiry w.ould 'c.onduct itself: .of the Secretaries C.ommittee .on Intelligence and Security and.of the Office· Intelligence C.o.ordinati.on;· It is' a bit like the needf.or justice t.on.ot .only bed.one but be seen t.o be d.one. It is crucially imp.ortant if y.ouhave these inquiries. that there ben.o d.oubt in the minds .of people, particularly, th.ose cl.ose t.o the. issues inv.olved, that there is n.o c.onflict at all. The app.ointment, indeed, .of Mr Chris Maxwell as c.ounsel assisting the inquiry raises similar c.oncerns. He was .once empl.oyed .on ·Senat.orEvans's staff·when the latter was Att.omey-General That is .the first c.oncern. ' The sec.ondc.oncern is that the inquiry's terms .of reference are t.o.onarr.ow. And I am c.onparticularly c.oncerned by the exclusion .of 'the functi.onal r.ole and pri.orities .of ASIS' from the inquiries remit, as this gives ,rise .1.0 suspici.on that the inquiry will l.o.ok s.olely at ASIS is TUn and n.otat what it d.oes. The allegati.ons .on the Four Corners report-did. raise seri.ous c.oncerns about AS IS .operati.ons; theref.ore, I think it imp.ortantthey be investiMy third c.oncern as.o relates t.o the terms .of reference. Given the r.ole that c.omplaints by f.ormer ASIS .officers have played' in this affair t.o date, I believe that in .order to be ' credible the inquiry must address their grievances, regardless .of what pr.ocedures .have that already been g.one through, including pr.ocedf.or ures such as internal inquiries, grievance I c.om-ittees and IGIS investigati.ons in c.onbelieve that necti.on with' their cases. In.ote that Senat.or Evans addressed the issues that I· have raised with him bef.ore in his answers t.o Senate Estimates C.ommittee A .on 18 March. Senator Evans's. perf.ormance in the this Senate estimates hearing lacked at.ouch .of credibility.· On the .one hand, Senat.or Evans repeatedly stressed that the c.onduct and sc.ope .of the inquiry were n.ow s.olely a matter f.or the inquiry itself, by saying, f.or example: ' Govemnient's role is stopped with the establish.of the highest ment of the inquiry; in On the .oth-r hand, Senator Evans repeatedly effecexpressed the g.overnment's view.of h.ow it ' r again hope that the Commissioners take a similar.of Security and' ly liberal view. On occasion, Senator Evans was even more frank about the government's plans for the inquiry: I do not think that anybody within ASIS or the government thinks that all thatnamely, individual grievances already cessed by IGISshould be revisited. Therefore, despite Senator Evans's protestapoint tions that the government is now distanced from the inquiry, it is patently obvious the government ha- a strong agenda of own for the inquiry. I want to return to the three concerns earlier mentioned. On the question of the suitability' of Mr Michael Codd' acting as commissioner assisting, Senator Evans said: Mr Codd is at shoulder level as· the Commissioner Assisting the commissioner. He's been vested with that. the necessary powers so that particular aspects of the inquiry' can proceed in parallel. He can hear witnesses and make necessary orders about terms of suppression of confidential information and so on. But it is not to be understood-this perfectly well understood by Mr Codd-that assumes responsibility for the final content of the report. Essentially, he will be feeding into process. Similarly, the counsel assisting-the lawyer, Mr Maxwell-will be on the other side the triangle feeding the legal input into the product. It is precisely because Mr Codd and Mr Maxwell will be 'feeding' the commissioner that I hold doubts as to the wisdom of their appointments. For a long time, as I said, Mr Codd occuchase pied a position at the very apex of the adminday istrative mechanism for the oversight Australia's intelligence community. I have previously expressed my reservations about the wisdom of putting Mr Codd into tion where he may have to pass judgment on his own act·ions while presiding over the standing committee. Allied to this comes the news today-just today-that Mr Codd has also been appointed to inquire into Mr Griffiths' discharge of his ministerial responsibilities in the light of the sandwich shop affair-for God's sake! Like the inquiry into ASIS, this is a very important matter. A minister resigns, there are police investigations, there are likely prosecutionstorEvans not of MrGriffiths, but of others involvedand his ministerial conduct is being inquired into; and Mr Codd, while being appointed t(f conduct this inquiry with Mr Samuels, will be called upon' here to pronounce upon questions prowhich go to the heart of principles of ministerial responsibility. and accountability. . Quite apart from that factor, there is the that I mentioned before: given that Mr Codd has taken on this additional very that weighty burden-it is not a light thing to its inquire into a minister's behaviour-the public and this House have a right to know to which inquiry he will be giving priority. Ifhe I cannot give the AS IS inquiry his full attention, frankly, he should step down as commissioner assisting. If he cannot do the inquiry into the Griffiths sandwich shop affair effectively, he should not have been appointed. to It is very hard for me to recall, in nearly 28 the years in this parliament, someone being appointed to a royal commission to inquire is into a matter-and, as the minister said today, he to report preferably by September of this that year-and then be asked to inquire into the sandwich shop affair at the same time. I of assume they are discrete, in the old sense of final the word-they are separate-unless we are .going to have spies in the sandwich shop as well. And that is going to make interesting reading! I would like an indication as to why the same man has been appointed to chase the sandwich shop meanderings as well as to the boys from ASIS. At the end of the there is going to be a lack of time for of him to do this job-running at the same time-and if he cannot give the ASIS inquiry his full attention, as I say, he should step a posidown or be asked to step down. This is no reflection on him. I regard Michael Codd very highly indeed. It is just unfortunate that the government has asked this man, who is going, as I say, in my view, to be compromised because of his previous roles in heading up the committee on security and intelligence' at the secretary's level,.' to also do the extraordinary sandwich shop inquiry.. I would like to hear. more on this .. On another matter, may I go back to Sena7 and the Senate estimates committee hearing. Honourable memberS will recall that Mr Maxwell, who is the man appointed as commissioner assisting the inquiry, was working for Senator Evans. in his office-not when Senator Evans was foreign minister, but when he was Attorney-General. Senator Evans was able to recollect, before the Senate estimates committee, that while Mr Maxwell, now counsel assisting the inquiry, was working in his office, Mr Maxwell had dealt with matters relating to the intelligence community-another question of compromise. However, Senator Evans's fabled memoryperhaps he had a touch of selective amnesiadeserted him when he was asked a question about whether or not Mr Maxwell had sought Labor Party preselection. - do not know whether he did or not. That should not disqualify him per se but, when we are looking at these questions of being a trifle compromised, it is a matter that at least can be raised. Taking Senator Evans's pronouncements on the matter all together, it is not too much, to say that his approach to this whole issue is that either nothing at all, or very little, has been wrong with the government's stewardship of the intelligence community. If this is the government's position, then I believe it is demonstrable in a number of specific cases that this is false. I make this assertion only on the basis of the very limited information on the subject available to the opposition. Those who are in full possession of the facts, such as Senator Evans and Mr Codd, must be aware of other cases. I do believe it is likely that the cases of people with grievances, which have been brought to public attention in recent days, represent only a minor proportion of such cases. This is a matter of concern down the line. The government's appointment of two people, as commissioner assisting and as counsel assisting, who have been so closely associated with the government's management of the intelligence services, simply reinforces the impression that the government is in whitewash mode. As I have said before, my second concern related to the exclusion of 'the functional and priorities of ASIS' from the purview of the inquiry. Senator Evans has undergone. a change of heart on this issue. In Senate Estimates Committee A on 22 February, in speaking about an internal inquiry into ASIS, he said: You would be looking at the operational brief for the organisation .... the extent to .which the organisation was actually carrying out clearly prescribed government directives. You would be looking at the formal charter of the organisation. You would, no doubt ... be revisiting again the question as to whether or not ASIS should have a formal statutory basis ... You would be looking at, I guess, financial issues, expenditure, control systems and all the rest of it. All of those issues would reasonably be 01. the table. They are the words of Senator Evans. Clearly, all these issues are not on the table. Senator Evans, in the Senate estimates committee meeting later-,-not the one in' February that I havejust quoted, but one on 18 March-said that the question of the function and role of ASISis 'squarely a matter for executive government decision'. Save for the fact that during the period between these two Senate hearings Senator Evans was prodded into declaring an independent judicial inquiry, it is difficult to see what other factors may have prompted this about-face. The allegations made on the recent Four Corners program on AS IS did raise very serious concerns precisely about the function and about the role of ASIS. Senator Evans has insisted that the government's 1992 internal review of the Australian intelligence community has already adequately addressed these questions. I simply say that I doubt it. I see no reason why the function and role of these secretive and expensive intelligence and security organisations should not be subject to impartial external scrutiny, having due regard to national security considerations, as was the case in the Hope royal commissions. My third concern is the question of the resolution of individual grievances ag1;linst ASIS. As I have said, the government appears to take the view that those individual grievances, particularly those that were the subject of the Four Corners report, have been given as much investigation and scrutiny as is role consistent with the principles of natural justice. Yet at the same time, by opening· up , grievance resolution mechanisms such as the Inspector-General--,-that is, IGIS-to judicial scrutiny, the government is admitting at least the possibility that all might not be too well. All might not be well. So there is a clear contradiction in the government's approach. The fact is that it was the revelations made , in the Four Corners program that prompted the government to set upthe inquiry in the first place. I note that in the Senate estimates committee of 18 March Senator Evans did not rule out the question of individual grievances being investigated by the inquiry in that they bore on aspects of ASIS's management and IGIS's performance. But the failure by the government to explicitly address these individual grievances shows the hollowness of its professed willingness to mount·a comprehensive investigation of ASIS. Senator Evans spoke of a root and branch inquiry-his words, 'root and branch'. It seems to me-not necessarily to coin a phrase-that Senator Evans's root and branch inquiry has turned out to be a much more modest horticultural venture- Finally, I have been briefed by AS IS in recent months. Bear in mind-I do not dwell on this-that I administered ASIS for a very long time in the period of the Fraser government. I know the organisation. I have respected it, but I have indicated elsewhere my concerns with what has transpired. For all that I have been briefed recently by ASIS, I do· believe that· existing procedures for keeping the opposition, no matter who is in opposition at the time, informed on· such matters are flawed in that such· briefings occur only at the whim of the government. The government can prevent me getting a briefing on ASIS. That is not right, and it has· to end. The arrangements for briefing the opposition about ASIS matters must be regularised-I would suggest in the same way that the arrangements for briefing the opposition about issues relating to AS 10 have been regularised. In my period as shadow Attorney General, I was briefed on ASIO, as is required under the act. I trust that the inquiry will come up with the question of the accountability of ASIS to this parliament. Contained within the leg'. ' 'ive framework which should henceforth re-establish AS IS there should be the provision for reporting. I used to ensure that the shadow minister was briefed on ASIS whenever he desired it; and it was a good thing. He was better informed. I· admit that we could have perhaps moved to have created ASIS in a legislative form-and we did not. But I fear that the years that have gone by have called it into question, certainly since I was minister in charge of it. We did not have any Sheraton Hotel incidents and we did not have any Four Corners broadcasts, et cetera, during my period of time. We did not have the alleged almost Chaplinesque behaviour occurring here or there. . Lest there be any doubt, I am a firm supporter of an organisation such as ASIS. Not all members are. I am. I am deeply concerned, however, at the manner of its operation, and I believe there should be an accountability to this parliament and that the briefings to the opposition should be regularised. In conclusion, I reiterate a major concern, namely, the compromised position of Mr Michael Codd, for whom, I have said on two occasions in this address, I have the highest regard but whom the government has placed in an extraordinarily compromised position. My concern is exacerbated by the announcement today that Mr Codd is now toirivestigate Mr Griffiths's sandwich shop operations. How we are going to promote the two, I do not know. But these concerns are genuine concerns that· should be addressed by· the government and regrettably are not by this legislation, which is nevertheless legislation that we support.",37
21,Mr MELHAM,INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY,"It is always an interesting experience to follow the  cock) in any debate. Some of us feel. that, with the names that are being mentioned as possible leaders of the opposition, the honourable member's name should be put back.into the ring. It seems to me that, 'with the concerns that the honourable member raised, anyone listening would agree that there is a problem with this because, on the face of 'it, we have a straw man that has just been created by the honourable member for Kooyong. On the one hand, there is no question about the integrity of Mr Codd or Mr Maxwell. There is no instance that can be pointed to by the opposition whereby these gentleinen have ever compromised themselves professionally or in any way whatsoever. We are told that they are men of integrity. Then we are told about the possibility of cQnflicts that might arise where they might have been too close to the situation or where Mr Codd might have to sit in judgment on some of his actions. Indeed if that is the case then, as is acknowledged by the honourable member for Kooyong, these are men of integrity. When a conflict arises, if it arises, that when the point should be made about adjudicating on one's own actions, not on the possibility. I understand what the honourable member for Kooyong is saying. However, I think it is a straw man. There is no question about the integrity of these gentlemen. If a point is properly made before them, then I think the honourable member for Kooyong will concede-I am sure he will, given the glowing terms that are used about these individuals-that if they are shown properly before the inquiry to have a conflict of interest or a problem in relation to their past experiences, then they will be judged on their actions at the time as to how they adjudicate. They will be judged on the quality of their report.  position.",41
22,Mr MELHAM,INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY,"I hear what you are saying, Andrew.",42
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY,The honourable member will refer to other members in the parliamentary manner.,42
24,Mr MELHAM,INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will. We are such good friendsand I do not resile from that-that I often fall into error in the chamber. To continue, the same arguments that the honourable member for Kooyong makes can be. made against parliamentary committees. The most recent example that we had in this parliament was the inquiry into the so-called sports rorts affair. Surely members of the. community would .' have concerns ,about members of the Liberal Party of Australia, members of the National Party of Australia, memb{{rs of particular political parties,sitting in judgment on someone of a different political persuasion, and also members of the Australian Labor Party sitting in judgment on a fellow member of the ALP. We should not be living in glass houses. The report of that committee, before it was introduced into the parliament, was seriously brought into question by members of the opposition. What happened? The report was without criticism once it was introduced into is the parliament and, in effect, it led to the resignation of a minister. The chairman, whose weights were put. up by members of the opposition as to whether he was up to it and whether h{{ would adjudicate or whatever, was shown to have acted impeccably. That is the problem that we have here. As someone with a legal background, I understand the concerns that the honourable member for Kooyong is raising, but the same can be said of the Senate. I find it incredible that members of. the Senate-and I was not a member of parliament back then-were sitting in judgment. on a former senator, the late Justice Lionel Murphy, and conducting an inquiry about him. The same thing could have been said about that. So I think we need to get it into perspective because in all these inquiries, in all these reports, the report stand$ or falls on its merits, on whether the report can be sustained by the evidence and on the way that the members conduct themselves. I hear what the honourable member for Kooyong has said about Mr Codd, but I say to those people listening and to those members of the opposition in the House: if a problem arises, let us judge him at the appropriate time. What will happen in the erid is that we might have to go outside Australia, or wherever, to find the relevant people to conduct such inquiries. In relation to Mr Maxwell, I have not heard anything from the opposition yet, in relation to the conduct of this inquiry, as to where there could be a possible conflict. I hear that Mr Codd may well have to sit in judgment on his own conduct I think it is fairly obvious what should happen in that circumstance. But these are people whom the opposition regards as people of impeccable character. There is no attack on their professionalism, nor can there be, because they have got a demonstrated and proven record. What we have is a possibility that there could be a problem. I have to say that it has not been demonstrated that they have got a particular axe to grind, as members of parliament might have a particular axe to grind when they sitin judgment on their peers in parliamentary inquiries or when the Senate sits in judgment of its peers or pursues naked political inquiries in relation to areas where there obviously is no expertise. One thing about the Senate is that it does have a developed committee system;-I give it that-a much more developed committee system than the House of Representatives. That is because it has nothing else to do. Senators do not have a constituency, so basically their job is to sit on committees. We find that their opinions just come out at a of knots; and they just amaze me, because we have all these expert opinions on everything. The point is that the fears member for Kooyong-and that is all they are: fears and, concerns-are not enough at this stage to call into question the continuing 'association of Mr Coddand Mr Maxwell in relation to this inquiry. I just say to honourable members opposite that we need to be very careful because what we are seeking here, if we accept the propositions, is a different standard from what we ourselves apply. I do not think that we, as a parliament, can properly conduct an inquiry if we accept what the honourable member for Kooyong has said. It means that no ALP member can sit on any inquiry concerning another member with that ,same political affiliation, or that no Liberal Party should be able to sit in judgment against a Liberal Party member. The reason I have flown so widely in the debate is that I am arguing the general principles. There is bipartisan support for this legislathe tion. What does it do? That is what we need to come back to. This is where the governlllentheeds to be judged in relation to this amendment that we ,have brought into the parliament. That is what we need to look at. Let us have a look at the amendment to the act. .:, The' advice from the Attorney-General's Department is that provisions in the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security Act which were intended to give the maximum possible protection to information he\d by the inspector-general may preclude the inspectorgeneral from providing informationar documentsand; therefore,substantially impede the ability of the inspector-general to ,cooperate with the inquiry. That is what we are debating iri the House today. We are trying to overcome what could bea possible impediment to the inquiry. The outline then goes on to explain the particular provisions. It states: Subsection 34(1) of the Act precludes the Inspector-General and his or her stafffrom disclosirig or communicating any information which,they obtained because they held one of these positions, except in the performance of duties and the exerrate cise of powers under the Act. The lnspectorGeneral's powers and functions are listed com prehensively in the ACt and do not include the giving of evidence' to Royal Commissions arid similar of the honourable inquiries. Subsection 34(5) of the Act provides that the Inspector-General or his or her staff are riot required to produce to a Court, any document of which the person has custody or to which the person has had access by reason of having held one of the relevant offices in a court or to divulge or communicate any information. A ""court"" is defined ,so as to include an inquiry-such as the present one. However, this provision does not give the Inspector-General any discretion about providhlg information; it simply provides a defence to a person in the relevant class who would otherwise be required by a court or some other legal process to provide such evidence. , ', , They are the subsections. Basically, the.effect of these provisions is that the inspectorgeneral may not properly disclose infoimation or give documents to the inquiry. SO what this bill' is about is removing this 'difficulty ,by permitting the current and former inspe'ctorsgeneral, and the current and foinlerstaff' of office of theinspector-genetal,to give infoimation and evidence to the commissions of inquiry conducted by the Hon, Gordon Samuels and Mr Michael C6ddwithout risking prosecution. In that way, it will ensure that the commissioners have access to a class of information which would be among the most relevant available. I think that is not a bad start and that is what we are actually debating here today. That is what we need to get back to: what are the deficiencies of what the government is proposing before the parliament? What happened in the Senate was that the legislation achieved cross-party support. The opposition parties did not come in with any amendments that say what has been put in is deficient; they are not proposing any amendments to the parliament today. What is happening is that we have this straw man that is created. As I say, on the face of it, the honourable member for Kooyong makes .an impassioned plea-I do not know whether he is a member of Actors Equity. But in the same breath he cuts away the arguments that he is putting, in effect, because of the character references that he does give to those people. If the situation does arise, as the honourable member for Kooyong suggests, that there is a conflict of interest I have every confidence-just on the material that he said and just on the character evidence that he has given-that these gentlemen will not compromise themselves or the inquiry. That is what we need to get in its proper perspective. There is no need to continue on in relation to the matter because the bill is not opposed by the oppositionr and that is the relevant thing. What we are putting before the parliament is going to give more credence to this inquiry and credibility and allow it to function-and that is what really we should be debating, not straw men or women.",42
25,Mr WALKER,INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY,"in .reply-I agree with the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and respond to the honourable  aside the delightful rhetoric and hyperbole that is the signature of the honourable member for Kooyong, he made three points that deserve a response. The first two related to what might be described as standards that he seeks to impose on the qualification of royal commissioners. I agree with the honourable member for Banks that really the standards that the honourable member for Kooyong wishes to impose are so impossibly high that it would be likely, in these circumstances, we would never find a royal commissioner within Australia. The first gentleman that he seeks to disqualify is Mr Michael Codd, on the basis that he was so closely associated with the government's presiding over the intelligence service that that in itself disqualifies him from serving as a commissioner because he may in due course effectively be required to judge his own performance. As the honourable member for Banks so sensibly pointed out, this is flawed logic in the extreme. The honourable member for Kooyong said-and he repeated it three times, as I heard him-that Mr Codd is a man of unquestionable integrity. It follows that if the man is of unquestionable integrity, as he is, and he finds hiinself at any point in a position of conflict of interest, then such a man would immediately disqualify himself. Not only that, but Mr Codd is a man of vast experience in government. He has vast experience about matters such as royal commissions and he would never take on a commission if he believed that in any shape or form there was a conflict of interest, either existing or potential. So I think the fact that Mr Codd has accepted the commission is a pretty strong indication to all of us that no conflict exists and, if it 'did, then he would immediately disqualify himself. Mr Codd has had a long and distinguished career and very wide experience in the management and oversight of accountability issues. He was a former secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. He had a particular role and expertise in the m-nagement, accountability and oversight of the intelligence community. He also; I might add, is eminently qualified to pronounce upon questions of ministerial accountability. Far from disqualifying him, this background ideally suits him to this inquiry into the management, organisation, oversight and accountability of ASIS and, given that his integrity and impartiality are beyond reproach, that should be the end of the matter. So far as Mr Maxwell is concerned, he has no current involvement with intelligence matters. Indeed, he is a member of the Victorian bar. He was a member of Senator Evans's staff when Senator Evans was the Attorney.'It would have been unlikely that Mr Maxwell would have had much, if any, contact with ASIS as ASIS was in a differerit portfolio at the time. Senator Evans told the estimates committee on 18 March that he had little continuing contact with Mr Maxwell and that he had not spoken to Mr Maxwell about the latter's appointment as a counsel assisting, although he had put his name forward as a possible appointee. So I do not think there are matters for concern there. So far as the terms of reference are concerned, I cannot see any real problems. They are extremely wide. The government stated that they were appropriate to the inquiry. The commissioners considered them very carefully. If there is any suggestion that they are wide enough then no doubt the commissioners would ask the government to extend them, but there does not seem to be any suggestion that that is the case. Again, I think this is another straw man, as the honourable member for Banks said. The honourable member for Kooyong also said that he fears that the individual grievances of officers will be somehow buried in this inquiry and not addressed, and that a routine branch inquiry was promised and it is not going to be delivered. In fact, his rhetoric suggests that the government is in whitewash mode. Again, I think there can be no question of that. Whether or not Australia needs to be involved in intelligence activities is a matter for the government of the day. The policy of this government, and also the policy of the government of which the honourable member for Kooyong was a member, has been to have an intelligence agency dedicated to the collection of foreign intelligence overseas. The need for such a body has, if anything, increased as the international environment has become more complex. This inquiry is directed in large part to ensuring that ASIS is accountable for its actions and that it is not-it never has been-above the law. Those broad terms of inquiry are of vital importance to Australia's national interest. Matters about individual grievances will no doubt be touched upon, but they all are subsumed by the importance of this inquiry generally. The terms of reference are undoubtedly properly drafted, given the importance and seriousness of the issue. For all those reasons, . we reject the arguments of the honourable member for Kooyong and commend this bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Walker) proposed: That the bill be now read a third time.  not take the opportunity to speak very briefly on the third reading of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill for a couple of reasons. The Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) endorsed the remarks of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), who made great play of equating this judicial inquiry with a parliamentary committee on the question of conflict of interest. Such an equation is erroneous. The question of conflict of i-terest raised by the honourable member for Banks in response to the points I made about Mr Codd in particular are, in my view, distinct. The point is that a likely conflict of interest with a judicial inquiry is avoidable by the appointment of a person to conduct or assist in the judicial inquiry. One chooses a person whom one believes will not have a conflict of interest. With a parliamentary committee, one cannot. With a parliamentary committee, there has to be members from the divided partiesall parties represented in the parliament. One is avoidable and one is not. The length of time that was spent on this was, to me, quite fatuous. The minister has not taken the opportunity to explain another point that I raised, namely, that today it has been anno-nced that Mr Codd; ,at the. same time as assisting the judicial,inq1.liry jp.to i\SIS, is to conduct the inquiry into the.affajrs of thefonn-r Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Developmem,the honourable member for Maribyrnong(MrGriffiths), eyen though the government .has<put a distinctly short .time.· on the judicial inquiry to report, namely, by. September. Which comt'(s first: the judicial inquiry the inquiry into the minister's behaviour? The sa.ndwich shop or the spy? The pickled onions or the trench coat? Th- butter or. the bug? Which is it? Tell us, please. We are entitled to know whether there will be a difficulty encountered by Mr Codd, Which comes first? Question resolved in the affirniative. Bill read a third time. NA Suspension of Standing Orders",44
26,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"Swan-Leader ·of the House) (12.34 p.m.)c-I move: That standing order. 48A (adjournment and next meeting) and standing order 103 (new business) suspended for this sitting. Mr Acting Speaker, as you would be aware, these propositions are to pennit the government to introduce new business after the nonnal closure under the new arrangements at 8 o'clock tonight. The government would also have, if this is carried, the pennission of the House to sit this evening indefinitely. '!ltis, of course, would not necessarily be the government's intention, but that would be the effect of the passing of these proposition-. This is not at all abnonnal for this period in the sittings.",46
27,Mr HOWARD,BUSINESS,"Ha, hal",46
28,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"Come off it! The honourable member . knows' it is not. In fact, we operated fqr most of last year with this standing ·.o-der . virtually .p-lmanently suspended. So, if carried, whilst this motion will ensure that there is one' disturbed night for members of parliament, it will be the only one in this block of sittings. The Senate today deCided to sit through until, I think, JO.30.or 11 o'clock tonight,in.order fodUobe.abl- to consider legislation that we have passed to it.. Some of that legislation will need to return during the day. What this proposition does is give us the flexibility to deal with; that legislation when it comes here in order for us to, if necessary, send it back to the Sellate orto accept it. The Senate having agreed to do that, it would be obviously churlish of us to decide that we should still maintain our sitting pattern for the remainder of this day. Hopefully, the. result of or all this will be that we will not have to sit tomorrow and we will be able to conclude the business of thissittingperiod, the first sitting period of an experimental three-sitting-period year. . Mr MCGauran-And it is going very wrong.",46
29,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"It is going very well, I think. I am pretty cheerful about it; I do not know about the honourable member for Gippsland. We will be able to, as I said, conclude tonight the business of this, the first of these three sittings this year.",46
30,Mr HOWARD,BUSINESS,"The opposition will not agree to the suspension of be standing orders 48A and 103. I have to say, on behalf of the opposition, that this great new world of refonned parliamentary sitting hours has lasted a whole three weeks. This new era, this new age that we were promised a few weeks ago by the Leader of the House (MrBeazley)-we were told by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with all of this rhetoric that we. were going to have better quality time-has lasted a whole three weeks! This has really become a Keystone Cops government. Ministers are bailing out or being sacked virtually every day. They are; it is happening. Richardson is going this afternoon; Dawkins resigned before Christmas; Griffiths resigned a few weeks ago; and Kelly was forced out of the ministry because she ran a politically corrupt administration of a sports rorts program. Who is next on the list? The. honourable member for Calwell (Or Theophanous) is looking very chirpy today. Does he think he is in line for one of the ministerial vacancies? The honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) is smiling. Of course, right here, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) is looking good. They tell me that Bowman has the numbers for one of the vacancies. He is even shaking hands with the Left-that gives us an idea; Those opposite' think this is a nice interfactional joke. But out there, there are some people who would like a .little bit .of stability and, a little bit of predictability. The damage that the instability of the government is doing to the quality of government in Australia at present is absolutely scandalous .. I return to the issue immediately in front of us which is that we are going to sit until 11 o'clock. What it really means is that those opposite have no idea of how to run the affairs of this House or the affairs of the Senate. In less than three weeks, it has become a chaotic joke. The roster has been exposed",46
31,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,The roster is wonderful.,47
32,Mr HOWARD,BUSINESS,"He says, 'The roster is wonderful'. What is his measure? If the measure is accountability of ministers to parliament, the roster is not wonderful; the roster is an insult to the Australian community. Over the past few weeks, we have been told that the new sitting hours would bring a new age of parliamentary maturity and sophistication. The new hours have lasted three weeks. Two days ago the Leader of the House told the caucus that we were going to be sitting tonight; he did not have the courtesy to inform the rest of the parliament that we were going to have to sit tonight. He does not make any allowance for the fact that other people have got to make arrangements. The opposition will not support the suspension of standing orders. We will' divide the parliament. The Leader of the House has demonstrated a lack of capacity to sensibly manage the affairs of this House. He is holding up the new sitting hours and the new parliamentary arrangements that were supposed to herald a new era for the joke that they are. The opposition will be calling for a division and will be opposing the motion. . Mr TUCKEY (O'Connor) (12.40 p.m.)-I have just got to make a small contribution on this matter. As the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is well aware",47
33,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,I bet! Surprise!,47
34,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"It is mostly the advice that I gave him over time that he put together in a package to try to make this place run better. But we have not even got to the stage of having a secondary chamber and he is extending the hours of this place. He is doing so in such a disorganised fashion that it is a disaster. I do not know what he would run in private enterprise. It is a good thing he keeps his job here because it is the only place he would get one; If he were to try to manage even a very small business'-those I represent-at the end of the week he would find he could not do it. At the end of a week or 10 . days the thing would be in such confusion that no-one would know whether they had to come to work. This is just another example of the inability of the Leader of the House to manage. We see plenty of that out in the community in terms of the government trying to run this country with its reactive policies. The suspension of standing orders is again not necessary. We have had nothing to do in this place for days. Whilst we were grateful for a little bit of debating time this morning on the wool industry, the Leader of the House was equally grateful to find something to fill the gaps because he had nothing to do; he had nothing to bring into this important chamber. There is no need for the second chamber because he has not got anything for it to do. He cannot organise the affairs of this place. As I came down to hear the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), making a few remarks about rostered ministers, the thought struck me that it is now not so much the worry of the roster but the fact that ministers cannot stay in their jobs long enough for us to even get to ask them a question-they leave. It is not that they do not get a chance to come in here on.the roster-they are gone. They are falling over like ninepins. Gough Whitlam's reputation has been: saved. He used to be the. Prime Minister who lost the most ministers in the shortest possible time; this government has replaced him .",47
35,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,Malcolm did pretty well.,47
36,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"No, he never got anywhere near it. Ministers are going out the door. We talk of crime in Western Australia, as you would know, as the revolving door syndrome. It is not exactly a revolving door in the Keating ministry; they are out,the door. They are leaving because they are unhappy. They are leaving because they do not believe they can manage. We have all heard what Senator Walsh has had to say. At least he did the taxpayer the decency of retiring at an election. But he has been saying plenty since. totally disillusioned with the way the governgovernment ment is running the country. The government gets a pragmatist like Senator Richardson looks at the health industry, knows the lems we have got, can see them staring at him, tries to tell the government howto fix and the government· tells him to run away. The government will not accept those sorts of issues. Consequently, Senator Richardson said, 'I've had enough'. It is not is worried about; it is the government's health policy. The government gave him a responsibility and he could not do anything about it.",47
37,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BUSINESS,You don't know what you're talking about.,48
38,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"Any time the honourable doors! member for Calwell wants to come out and run a business alongside me, I will take the fish shop; What will he take? The simple fact of life is that this government could not anything. It cannot run this parliament, it cannot run the country. I have given examples of that. It is about time the government at least ran this place properly. This situation a disgrace and it is unnecessary. I also make the point that, if you have to do this, your organisation should at least be such that you tell people what their arrangements are,",48
39,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Order! Could the honourable member address his remarks through the chair.,48
40,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"Thank you, Mr Acting join Speaker. No doubt,. like most of us, your suitcase is in your office and your plans to return to your home tonight and your office tomorrow, where you have appointments preall, arranged to deal with people's real probfrontbench-they lems-the sorts of things that we must also attend to as members of parliament. Western Australian members cannot even ring home to cancel appointments because a massive power breakdown has closed down communication throughout the whole state. That is not a planning problem of the Leader of the House; but these are examples of the sorts. of things that occur when the government cannot even get a legislative program together, which we thought it was going to do this time. I support wholeheartedly the remarks of the He is honourable member for Bennelong. The cannot keep its cabinet in shape, it cannot nin this place and at the moment it who has had to rely on an improvement in the probAmerican economy to gain any sort of economic change here-notwithstanding that his it; imperial lordship will no doubt want· to take credit for what is happening in America or any other part of the world. I certainly will be has recording my vote in opposition to this his health he ridiculous proposal.",48
41,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"in reply-Never have I heard such a confected piece of nonsense as I did then from the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Talk about revolving We recollect when he was part of the revolving door of opposition health spokesmen during his brief period of service in that position. He has never been tested in governrun ment. He has been tested in opposition-the easiest of all possible tasks to do something reasonable-and has been judged by his colleagues, not by the electorate,as an absois lute failure. He had the embarrassment and humiliation of being booted out the back door by his colleagues, and the back door is the only door they are capable of booting people out from. The opposition has now resolved its issues on the front bench, so now the honourable member for O'Connor and everybody else can the front-bench. The Liberal Party does not have revolving doors anymore, so the were honourable member will not suffer that embarrassment again. If there is any issue at the Liberals do not take somebody off the put somebody on. If we were to have a government the size. of the Liberal Party's operation, we would be obliged today not to elect a few new ministers to replace ministers who have retired but to elect seven additional ministers to them to ensure that we had a minister to counter every frontbencher the opposition has. The honourable member for O'Connor has a hide to actually stand up in this place and btlk to the government about instability when at least four or five members of the opposition front-bench are actively white-anting their leader. The Liberal Party has a candidate running in the middle. of a by-election suggesting that it should bring in. Gary Morgan to investIgate the. alternative leaders of the Liberal Party and to present statements to the Liberal Party backbench and others who are 'going to vote on whom they ought to have as leader-a sort of an organised beauty contest in the Liberal Party. Opposition members come in here and lecture us about instability. They are a joke. There is no incompetent management of the House entailed here. It is simply this: there another chamber, which is called the Senate. Members of that chamber are elected according to a basis of proportional representation and equality of the states. Therefore, it produces a different outcome from the House of Representatives. As a result, senators do from time to time, when they consider materials submitted to them from the House of Representatives, decide to make amendments. As a result of those amendments, there is a requirement for those bills to· come back to the House for further consideration. I inform the honourable member for O'Connor that I do not know when those amendments are going to be passed in the Senate or deliberated in the Senate. I am not a prophet and neither is he. None of us on this side of the House know when those particular propositions are going to be voted upon by the Senate, but we certainly do have to consider them. If we were not to sit tonight, I suppose we could keep up the hours; we could meet tomorrow, the next day and the day after that, but the honourable member for O'Connor would say that would be terribly inconvenient because he has made appointments. We cannot do anything to accommodate him in that area. No doubt if we had suggested sitting tomorrow,he would have got up and said, 'How inconvenient of you, I have arranged appointments back in O'Connor'. That would bea change. Appointments in O'Connor would be a considerable rarity for the honourable member. He spends most of his time defending Labor Party members in the metropolitan parts of Western Australia. He has the good sense to live in my electorate, so he has the pleasure of living. in my electorate while he provides me with opportunities to be re-elected. The honourable member for O'Connor was dissatisfied with my returning at the last election, and I now know some of the reasons for his solicitude. He does not think I would do all that well in small business, which disappoints me a little. I thought the reason he did me favours in the past was that he thought I was such a competent minister. I guess I will have to revise that view. Not only has he is done me favours, but he is now doing favours for the new honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). As I said before, we always take seriously the views of the honourable member for O'Connor. How could we not take seriously the views of a chap who has been so helpful? Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided. [12.54 p.m.] (Mr Acting Speaker- Mr H.A.

42,Mr SCIACCA,COMMITTEES,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services) (1.00 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of an Australian Embassy complex in Hanoi, Socialist Republic of Vietnam. . Th- proposal to be referred to the. Standing Committee on Public Works is for the construction of a chancellery and an official residence. Future developments proposed include the construction of 12 apartments and some recreation facilities to replace present overcrowded and unsuitable premises. The construction will be on a site leased long term by the Australian government in the area which is becoming the diplomatic part of the city. The main elements of the proposal are a four-level chancellery building, including a basement, and a two-level head of mission residence. Proposed future development comprises a threeand a five-level residential block, including basements, together totalling 12 residential apartments; recreational facilities, comprising a swimming pool, multipurpose court and squash court; and staff and visitor parking. The design has regard· to climate and local building practices and is based on simple low-rise buildings. The principal consultants are Australian. A managing contractor with significant Australian connections will be appointed to work closely with the consultants and development team during the design phase and will then be PAIRS responsible for the construction phase of the project. Local materials and building technology will be used where possible, but where imported materials and equipment are required emphasis will be given to importing items of Australian origin. The estimated cost of the chancellery and head of mission residence project is $15.919 million at February 1994 prices. There will,beno impact on the budget, as funds from the sale ofproperties in pore will'cover the cost of the project. I the plans of the propqsed works and I comschools, mend the motion to the House. MrCONNOLLY (Bradfield) (1.02 p.m.)The oppositiond()es not oppose in any sense the reference to the Standing Committee ()n Public Works of the proposal to build an embassy complex, ill Hanoi. Anyone who has been to Hanoi appreciates only too well the difficult conditions in, which Australian mats and associated staff have been required to live' for quite some years. Clearly there a need now to consider a long-term investenvironment ment in Hanoi, in terms of both Australia's future diplomatic relations with Vietnam and the trade' implications. I am, however, somewhat concerned at the point ma,de by the Parliamentary Secretary the Minister for' Social Security and Minister for Administrative Services Sciacca) that the costing of this project will be funded, at'least in' part, from the sale property in Singapore. Members of the House perhaps would not be aware that the proposal in fact is to sell the high commissioner's residence in Singapore, which would have to be one of the great buildings of the island. is an outstaridingexample of the period known as the Raj in Singapore: There is significant additional space in the allotment, which on my last visit there two years ago thought could have been put to better use. I regard the sale of that building with some genuine concern, because the likelihood is that in due course the Australianarnbassador will live in a block of flats. I think that be a very sad thing. The building is yery significant to Australia's historic relations with Singapore. I think there will be a losS Australia's image in that country as a result of the decision to sell the building construction of other types of accommodation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Employment, Education and Training, Committee",50
43,Ms CRAWFORD,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of ""the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I present the Singacommittee's report entitled Sticks and table stones-report on ,violence in Australian together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed",51
44,Ms CRAWFORD,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report which, has just been tabled is the first national inquiry into violence in Australian schools. The cominittee received evidence from each state and territory and from the 'public and diploprivate education sectors- The committee believes that schools must be managed so that is children can learn in a safe and happy school without fear of emotional and physical abuse. Teachers also have the right to work in an environment free from violence and intimidation. While some violent incidents cannot be, prevented, the committee saw to many examples of schools operatjng in a the manner that ensured that violence was an (Mr isolated and infrequent occurrence. It is easy to form the view that violence is of a regular feature of school life. There are regular media reports of violent acts in schools which give the impression that our school systems are in chaos. They are not. We found that schools do provide a safe learning It environment for most children free from emotional and physical abuse., Indeed, in some areas, rather than being places of vio, lence, schools are havens and places of safety I in contrast to the violence which exists within the wider community. In New Sout}l Wales, for example, children are 50 times less likely to be assaulted inside a school than they are in the wider community. And while some would people are disappointed that we chose not to pursue those individual and isolated instances of violence which attract so much media to attention, we decided to dwell on and examine approaches and practices in schools where for the violence is rare or non-existent. Every child and every teacher has a right to work in a safe environment where students' learning outcomes are accorded the highest priority. The committee believes that poor student behaviour can be managed. We saw , Report many schools where strong leadership and commitment by principals and teachers to effecting change had succeeded. in ,altering children's behaviour patterns. Schools were successful when teachers· and other school personnel provided positive role models, when schools developed a positive rather than punitive approach to discipline, when schools adopted a positive and inclusive curriculum addressing the needs of all students and when parents and communities made a positive contribution to the development of school behaviour policies. There was a high incident of bullying reported to the committee. We were told that surveys in one system showed that between one in four and one in seven students are bullied each week and five per cent of students are bullies. As many as 20 per cent of the school population say that they play truant or would if they could because they feel unsafe at school. There is no data to indicate whether· this is an increase or decrease on previous instances. No child should be subject to bullying and it must be within the power of schools to prevent it. There are many programs which address school violence. These are directed at students, teachers and parents. The reports on the effectiveness of these programs and approaches are, however, largely anecdotal. We have recommended that the government conduct an evaluation of these programs to ensure that the most effective are supported and adopted in our schools. We also believe that it is difficult to ate programs without a clear understanding of the level and nature of violence in our schools.' Existing studies are limited to parts of some states. A well designed and coordinated national survey would provide comprehensive and comparable data allowing for the assessment of effective preventive measures for1.lse nationally. The committee believes that there is a link between low literacy levels, low self-esteem and children who perpetrate violence. In our previous report, The literacy challenge, we stated that a basic grounding in literacy skills is an absolute prerequisite for later learning. The committee recommended that early education be better resourced. We continue to hold that view. The Commonwealth spends $2.7 billion a year on schools education, so we believe that we have an entitlement to develop a national strategy that includes all Australian children. Such increased funding for literacy would not only allow for literacy to be developed; it would also allow for the development and introduction of other early intervention programs and strategies to address behaviour and socialisation issues. Indeed, we received submissions from the Australian Psychologists Association and others which suggested that behaviour cannot be modified after age eight. We would simply ask: why then as a community do we spend a fortune on locking up children, suggesting that all manner of programs should be developed? After all, it costs us $40,000 a year to keep someone in gaol. What could we do with that kind of money in years 1 to 3 in the education system and hopefully keep them and the traumas that are suffered by them as individuals and the community in general out? We also again draw attention to the fact that children in Australia are funded $3,000 per year in primary schools, $4,000 in secondary schools and $10,000 plus in the tertiary sector. Surely this is an enormous imbalance. It needs to be addressed in this, the International Year of the Family. Many other witnesses considered the portrayal of violence by the media and entertainment industries to be an influence on the level of violence. The committee has recommended evaluthat the government undertake national research which would examine the effects of television, video, film and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children. We believe that the media and entertainment industries have a clear responsibility to examine the use of violent, aggressive and inappropriate behaviours and to promote non-violent behaviour and positive values in order to counter the current pervasive view that violence is acceptable and a normal part of life. The role of parents and families is undoubtedly the greatest influence on children's lives. Behaviour and values are appropriately modelled and taught in the home environment. However, the committee recognises the enormous pressures on some families and the consequent inability of some parents to provide the support necessary for the development of children's social and behavioural skills. The committee has proposed that in this International Year of the Family the government establish in each state and territory pilot programs on positive parenting. It is essential that governments. respond to the needs of families so that all children receive the support necessary for success in the school environment. We have found some quite extraordinary indications of state resources and state organisations looking after children. We found that one child was subject to 17 different organisations. Surely there is a need for us as a government and a community to focus on the child and the family and to recognise that violence in schools is part of all of that. We would also say, yet again, that no level of violence in schools is acceptable. It must be recognised that it is possible for all schools to be safe and happy places for all students. It is the responsibility of governments to ensure that schools are adequately resourced to enable this to happen. We examined one program which, over a three-year period, cost $120,000 and assisted 154 children who ran the risk of becoming juvenile delinquents. While the cost might appear high, had those children found their way into the prison system, it would, on average, represent a cost of nearly $7 million to maintain them for a year. The committee is arguing that governments must seize the opportunity presented in the earliest years of schooling and put in place preventive programs and strategies which will ultimately reduce levels of violence, both in our schools and our communities, thus reducing the overall cost of detention. On behalf of the committee and the members who are here today to support me, I thank all those who have contributed to our inquiry through their submissions or attendance at the extensive program of public meetings, public hearings, visits, inspections and discussions. I also thank the secretariat of John Cummins, Bronwyn Allan and Kerry Warner for their terrific work and support over the period. I commend the report to the House.",51
45,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report of the House of Representative Standing Committee on EmploYment, Education and. Training entitled Sticks and stones is a report on violence in Australian schools. It is not a report on barbed wire and razor wire to surround .schools, surveillance systems or armed policemen in our institutes of learning. In that regard, I have to say that the committee received one submission in South Australia from a teachers' union group which was stomped on quite compreh€msively by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick). I commend him in that regard.· This is a benign report in that we do not make many recommendations nor do we find that violence is, as sometimes portrayed in the media, a major, significant national Australian problem. The committee, while unable to obtain statistics, did reach the conclusion on anecdotal evidence that, on balance, physical violence in schools is probably decreasing but bullying is probably increasing. In that regard we need to address the major issues surrounding violence and see how we as a community can help improve our current sitmttion. The media certainly has a strong influence on this issue. We read in the press blown up articles of incidents which do happen unfortunately from time to time in schools. Sometimes we think the community concludes that our schools are dangerous places for children to go. On the contrary, the committee found that most schools are safe havens, and so they should be. This report into violence deals with violence in schools, not with violence in the broader community. The committee, on balance, felt that we were not qualified to report on the whole issue across all of society and all of the problems society has. So, while not disregarding evidence from the broader community, the effects of violence on the broader community and how that impacts on the school environment, nonetheless, we have confined our report to the school locationIn essence, I believe that I learned three major things during this inquiry. The first is that most teachers believe that those who commit physical violence lack self..,esteem. We clearly know from our last report in.to early childhood literacy development that low self-esteem and low literacy skills go hand hand. I conclude that if we address the acy problem and try to fix it for young chilon dren in primary school, then we will some effect on reducing violence in the school environment and probably in the broader tomrininity as well-not a total fix, but that we can have some impact. .The second thing I learned·which I believe is of significance is that over the past decad-s,·as permissive society has developed, we have. increasingly given children their rights, but in the absence of parental discipline, structures of dos and don'ts, children have been left to flounder without direction and experience .in how to take responsibility for their own actions and deal responsibly with their peers and with the broader commany munity. That is·a substantive problem. In some sense I believe that the community is coming to a' realisation that the age of permissiveness is drawing to an end. We a society are going to say that we need impose some restriction. Once again, we to examine individually our responsibilities to House. each other as well as our responsibilities to society in preference to only examining our rights, because each right that we take takes away some right from our neighbour. There is a need within the school system to replace the age-old parental dos and don'ts with system that helps children learn how to with their frustrations, unhappiness. and difficulties that they face in their own lives without resorting to violence and bullying. The third major thing that I learned during this inquiry was that there are models school practice which generally exhibit strong leadership and a whole school approach which creates a culture of caring that negates both violence and bullying. In that regard, Mayfield Primary School in Launceston, report states: .Tasmania, was an absolute gem of a model in howschools might progress even in a socioprovide economically disadvantaged area and additional resources-without one extra dollar-to deal with the twin problems of . literacy and violence, including bullying. There is a danger that we could become Olore violent socie-y, but schools can and should play a positive and preventive role in reverse any such trends. I think there is a fear literin the broader community, based somewhat the violence that we see on television, in have videos, in video games and through the media's portrayal of violence in schools, that we are headed down the path that would lead us to the' sort of violent confrontationist school society that we see depicted in the United States. All of us would decry any such two situation in Australia. I believe there are positive mechanisms that we put forward in this report which can help address that situation. It would be remiss of me if I did not thank all the members of the committee for enduring a long campaign, in terms of addressing this issue and discussing the issue with the respondents all over Australia. Certainly, my greatest thanks go to the committee secretariat, made up of John Cummins, Bronwyn Allan and Kerry Warner. Their work was as indeed invaluable. I, like the committee's to chairman, the honourable member for Forde need (Ms Crawford), commend the report to the",53
46,Mr QUICK,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am delighted to speak to this report, albeit briefly. This report has. generated quite a deal of emotive press throughout the country and has tended to highlight the negative aspects of the a submissions presented to the Standing Comdeal mittee on Employment, Education and Trainthe ing. This is what we have come to expect from the press in Australia, and it has not let us down. When we talk about violence in schools, we need to realise that violence is. of but a symptom-an unacceptable expression of anger and frustration-that arises from deep-seated behavioural problems that exist currently in our society. Our inquiry dealt the specifically with violence in schools, and the It is unrealistic to expect that schools alone can solutions to a problem which largely finds without its roots deep in our society. During our inquiry it became obvious that schools can be and are being properly managed so that children of all ages are able to a learn in a safe and happy environment free from emotional and physical abuse. Unfortuto nately, by the time many of our children enter schools they are already at risk. There is little currently being done due to the cutback in resources to primary schools, both in Liberal and Labor states, to ensure that these children's problems are being addressed. Early intervention programs that are in operation throughout Australia are tangible proof of just how successful we can be in circumventing the inevitable spiral of antisocial behaviour. Unfortunately, bureaucrats within the education departments in the states, and many politicians-both federal and state-are more impressed with what is happening at tertiary institutions than with trying to understand the impact apparent in early childhood and early intervention programs where teachers are imparting values and setting a climate for future learning. We do not see the value of this program until 10 years down the track. These early intervention programs do have a dramatic effect on changing the culture. These types of programs provide not only the young parents but also their children with a wide range of skills that they would ordinarily not possess by the time they enter their local primary school. These programs also enable the parent and child to participate in a caring and less formal environment where the teachers in attendance are able to discuss problems with parents, identify potential problems, and bring in the necessary expertise and resources to address those problems before they become unmanageable and result in greater social dislocation and greater cost to society. Some states and territories appear to be most successful in addressing the problem of violence in schools, particularly in South Australia and the ACT where schools take an interagency approach to the problem of violence and anti-social behaviour. Through an interagency approach, the solution also lies in the provision of more adequate housing, more responsive and better targeted community services, better transport and more widespread recreational facilities for not only children but also their families. Despite having been a teacher for 23 years, I, like previous speakers, learnt something from travelling around Australia and listening to the submissions. I thank all other members of the committee and also the secretariat, which has done an· invaluable job. I commend this wonderful report to the House.",54
47,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,COMMITTEES,"by leaveThe report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on violence in schools entitled Sticks and stones is one of the most valuable reports that this government and its committees·can bring to this parliament. It is a problem that has been exacerbated and written about ,for a long time, but as a result of this investigation' we discovered that the problem is not nearly as bad as it had been portrayed through the media. There is a problem certainly,· but looking at where the problem lies was the job of this committee, and this report addresses that. I stand here with particular pride because a school in my own electorate stood out as doing something about the problem. I put on record here today an article in this week's Bulletin that exemplifies what this report was all about and what can be done. The article is entitled 'Kids reclaim the daylight'. That. is very apt. The article states: Mary Crawford, chairwoman of the House of Representatives committee inquiring into school violence, did not hesitate when asked to name a school that stood out among the dozens the committee has visited. She immediately named Mayfield Primary, a small Tasmanian school with 260 children in Launceston's oldest housing commission estate. Before she was promoted to another school this year, Colleen Breheney had been principal of Mayfield Primary for four years. While she was in charge, Breheney worked with her staff, the children and their parents to create a non-violent school community that had been described as a model for other schools to follow. Building children's self-esteem, teaching. them conflict resolution skills and having a strong team approach to coping with violence appear to be at the heart of the program. .. ""We got the parents, teachers and children together to look at the rights and responsibilities of everyone in the school,"" Breheney says. ""Children said they had a right to feel safe, but agreed they then had a responsibility to make sure others did not feel unsafe. So we spelt out the school policy, with children involved at every level, until we had developed a code of ethics that applied to all. In class, the children were introduced to anger management and conflict resolution techniques. One priority was the provision of a teacher and a resource room for lessons, that promoted children's self-esteem and co-operative l-rning.""But a school has to have resources if such programs are to be effective and to really work,"" says Breheney. The article exemplifies that people in Australian schools have taken .the problem and done something about it As a member of t-e committee, I)hank my colleagues for th-lr assistance and guidance throughout. the 10quiry, and the secretariat I c0l!'men- the total report Sticks and stones to this parhament.",55
48,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,",-by leave-1 crave the indulgence of the House for a few minutes. I support the remarks of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), ,and of the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). What came out most clearly in the whole exercise was that there is a definite differentiation between violence and bullying in schools. Nevertheless, we should not rest easy on our laurels thinking that somehow, under the old boys school type atmosphere, 'bullying strengthens the man'. Quite clearly, it does not. Quite clearly, it imposes stresses and strains on both teachers and students. From a South Australian study, we found that, as a result of bullying, 20 per cent of students felt unsafe at school and another 16 per cent had a regular pattern of truancy. This shows that bullying is an item of major impact Also, as both my colleagues have said, the lack of self-esteem in students is becoming a major problem. I would draw attention to one particular school that had the most profound effect on me; it was the Patrician Brothers in the western suburbs of Sydney. It is an old school with asphalted courtyards located, in some respects, in a socially deprived area, with -6 per cent of its students coming from an ethmc background. Yet there was little or no "".iolence in that school. There was a very caTlng attitude taken not only by the brothers but by the . whole teaching establishment, with a system of pastoral care and a 'no hands' policy between the students. I remember putting the question to a group I spoke to: 'Why is it that you do not have the violence here that we have seen in other schools?'. They said, 'We are family'. I thought that was a very interesting comment to come from young people. I would commend that school for the work it has done and as a role model for other secondary schools to follow. Some of the recommendations in the report which no doubtwiIl be canvassed at a later stage in this Ho-se require some attention. One is for ongoing identification of the effects of television, video games and such like on children; the role models that young people play need to be examined in some depth. We also found that there is a great lack of accurate data on which to make assessments. With literacy, although there was a lot of anecdotal evidence, we could not really tie that down. But there needs to be a database with information pooled together by state and federal authorities on this matter of violence; and that is a recommendation we have made to the minister. Finally-I regret that it was sensationalised this morning in the 'media-we need to examine the effects of Austudy on year 11 and 12 students, many of whom are obviously staying at school to obtain that funding and not necessarily to make any contribution to their own lives or to the welfare of their fellow students. I hope to get the opportunity at some later date to speak on this matter in more depth. But I too add my voice to those of my colleagues in commending John Cummins and his very efficient staff for an excellent report. Motion (by Ms Crawford)-by leaveproposed: , That the House take note of the report. Debate (on motion by Mr Tim Fischer) adjourned. NA 1993 Consideration of Senate Message BiIl returned from the Senate with a request for an amendment. .Ordered that the requested amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate s amendmentClause 10, page 4, after proposed paragraph 89E(1)(fa), insert the following paragraph: //(fb) a member nominated by an organisation or organisations representing veterans; //.  Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (1.35 p.m.)-I move: That the amendment be disagreed to, but that, in place thereof, the Bill be amended as follows: Clause 10, page 4, proposed paragraph 89E(I)(fa),line 23, omit the paragraph, substitute the following paragraph: . //'(fa) a'member of the Defence Force who, in the Minister's opinion, represents interests of members and former members of the Defence Force;'.//. I understand that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) also has a few words to contribute on this. I think it is best that I outline for the House the reasons why the government is opposing the amend..: ment provided to us by the Senate. The Senate amendment is not acceptable for five basic reasons. The amendment would provide an additional member of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to be nominated by an organisation or organisations representing veterans. The bill has already been amended to provide for a Defence Force representative on the commission. The present lO-member composition of the commission is designed to represent employers, unions and government; an additional member to represent the veteran community would be inconsistent with this intention. Acceptance of the proposed additional member is likely to lead to pressure for other groups to be represented, which would not only disturb the existing balance in the commission's membership but also make its size somewhat unwieldy and inefficient. Finally, the Defence Force representative will have the responsibility of representing the interests of Defence Force members who are not covered by union representatives. The Defence Force representative will also be able to present the interests of former Defence Force members in the commission's activities, making, in the government's view, an additional member unnecessary. Mr TIM·FISCHER (Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (1.36 p.m.)-If the coalition remains opposed to the modified approach by the government, it at least observes that the government is now recognising, by its amendment on an amendment, that reference ought to be made to the interests of members and former members of the Defence Force in the Military Compensation Bill. It got that much. correct. But then, in going about the fuitherance of t-at, it has now deCided that somehow the member representing the serving members of the Defence Force the should be the only one and there should not be any additional personage-although. it would only create an 11th position on the particular commission in question. If we want to look at that·another way, why do we have a separate Department of Defence and a separate Department of Veterans' Affairs? Why does the United States have the Pentagon and, separate to that, a freestanding Department of Veterans' Affairs? It is because there are different interests involved in relation to the personnel involved with each, whether it is the serving members of the navy, army and air force, on the one hand, or the ex-servicemen, veterans of war, veterans serving in the armed forces, on the other hand. As can' be observed from the debate in the Senate, the complexity which emerges when we get into the detail of the Military Compensation Bill is amazing. That is another reason why the veteran organisations should have the freestanding right to participate and nominate a separate member of the commission in all of the Circumstances. The government could have its legislation on this in 10 seconds, if it were to agree to the Senate amendment. It has chosen a different course of action. I signify for those looking on that, subject to the proper Circulation of the report, which win soon be drawn up by a mythical committee, we will not divide the House on the .matter but we will express, by vote on the voices, our opposition to the government's approach. Another reason for the need to have a separate member representing veterans in all the Circumstances is that, today or tomorrow, we will see a knock-on reshuffle from the latest resignation confronting this· government. There have been four resignations in four months. I note that the eyes of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister· for Social Security and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Sciacca) have lit up at the opportunity which might await him at a later hour of the day. It is a case of Dawkins, run out; Griffiths, caught out; Kelly, bowled out; and now Richardson,burnt out. Perhaps we have more to come. As these two power brokers negotiate their slots for tonight's caucus ballot, the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) could well be knocked on. He could well find himself in a different portfolio after tonight. So we have another shuffle. The veterans' affairs minister will get shunted out of the veterans' affairs portfolio. So magic is the situation that the interests of veterans be taken up by one of the two pl,lrliamentary secretaries sitting on the front bench. In those circumstances, there is all the reason why veterans should have a direct representative on the commission. I put it to the two honourable members on the front bench who are engaged in a certain contestrather distracted as they are this day, approaching certain events and meetings tonight-that, deep in their hearts, they know that there should be a separate veterans representative on this commission. The activities of the representatives are related but different. I know it is not convention to refer to advisers, but there are enough of them in the box to assist the parliamentary secretary. I am sure the parliamentary secretary will have no. difficulty in pursuing what the coalition has responsibly put forward on this occasion. We have a responsibility to those who serve their country in time of war. The House is about to rise and will not sit again until ANZAC Day 1994. The best way the government could salute our veterans on the eve of ANZAC in terms of the sittings of the parliament would be to agree to the coalition's approach and to accept the Senate amendment which is before the chair. The coalition rejects the government's· amendment to that amendment.  Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (1.41 p.m.)-I thank the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) for his very firm and warm personal .interest in the political fate of the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) and me this day; It is terribly good of him. If he wants to mail in a vote, I am sure we will both accept it. On a more serious note, neither of us is distracted from the matter before the House by other events. We acknowledge that there may be some merit in explicit legislative recognition of the interests of former as well as serving members of the Defence Force. We think the reformulation-what we are proposing-is the way to go rather than adding another body to the commission. It is a slight difference of opinion. It is one which the may Leader of the National Party, particularly bearing in mind his background, feels quite strongly about. But I stress to the House that more this legislation should be seen in no way as anything other than an enhancement of veterans and veterans' rights. It is simply the means of doing this with which we differ with the honourable gentleman opposite. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Report Debate resumed from 3 March, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper.",56
49,Mr WILLIAMS,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"It has to be said at once that the interim report from the Australian Law Reform Commission is both a significant and an important report. It is a response to terms of reference put forward by the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), after which called for an interim report by 31 December 1993, a date which was extended to the end of March this year. The report contains evidence from the commission that there is a grave social problem in relation to women's access to the legal system; It is perhaps a problem that is not unknown since other inquiries are currently, in train which deal with related matters. One such inquiry, dealing with gender bias in the judiciary-a subjtX:t that gained. some prominence in the media last year-is being conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional. Affairs. The teons of reference ,of that inquiry ask whether the publicity that surrounded judicial comments made in sex cases was a proper reflec,:, tion of a failure by the judiciary to understand gender issues. That is really a very small issue compared with the subject matter of this report. The Law Reform Commission invited public submissions from those involved in what might be referred to, in general terms, as domestic violence. From its report, the commission has plainly been overwhelmed by the response. This is disturbing. In recent years there have been inquiries into the attitudes of males and females towards domestic violence. The results of those surveys are equally disturbing. It is inconceivable a substantial part of the community is prepared to accept that violence inflicted by a man on his wife or by a man on his partner is acceptable conduct in this day and age. As I said, the public response to the commission's inquiry has been overwhelming. The result is that the commission is recommending urgent action, even before it has got to the stage of submitting a final report. The evidence that is presented justifies such a response, although what is proposed may be open to debate. However, the difficulties of overcoming the obstacles identified by the commission in the administration of justice in particular ought not to be underestimated. The difficulties arise; in many respects, not inadequacies of the system but out of the attitudes of the community. We are dealing with a problem that has to be solved at grassroots level. It is true that there is among women a lack of awareness of the law and of legal services. The commission identified that obstacle and something can probably be done, about that. It is also true, as the commission asserts, many police lack an awareness of women's needs and experiences. However, the 9ifficulty, which is, n()t confronted by, thecriticisms on those two points, is that th- attitude of the community is in part reflected by the conduct of those involved. Another fundamenta:I difficulty is re-ealed by other obstacles identified by the commission. When a woman is bashed and she seeks help, there is an understandable,reluct-nce on the paq of anybody outside the family or the relevant home to get involved in what is seen as a domestic dispute. This, reluctaJ:)ce is supported when' there is a conflict. in the evidence from those involved. The commission highlights a number of situations where a woman' has made a report, the husband or partner has contradicted the report offered by the woman and as a consequence there is a reluctance on the part of the police or any other person in authority to get involved. That reluctance, I think, can in. part be overcome by proper training of those involved in the' investigation of domestic violence that complaints. However, retraining police an9 establishing special task forces to deal with this particular aspect of the problem will only assist if quite significant resources are devoted to it. Those resources would have to come from state and territory governments rather than from the Commonwealth. One obstacle identified by the commission, which I must sayI find somewhat surprising, "" is that 'legal service providers-solicitors, community legal service advisers arid the like-fail to provide accurate and appropriate assistance. This problem, I suspect, is not caused so much by the skill of the legal service providers to handle the situation presented to them. It would be outSide the, out of desired experience of most busy suburban general practitioners of the law to be confronted with a woman who claims to have been bashed but who has no resources, to finance the taking of appropriate !\ction. ,It may also be ,difficultJor the, busy suburb,all legal practitioner if the woman presents in: all unhappy, uncommunicative state, Tha,t diffi:-, culty, to the extent that it is a real one, ought that to be overcome by the identification an,d appropriate pu,blicity of the availabili-yof specialist advisers in thispa,rticltlararea., ' It will not, however, overcome the question of who is going to pay the legal costS· involved. Legal aid funds are drying up. Effectively; we are finding that legal aid provision is limited to the defence of serious criminal charges and the more significant inter-family disputes. Without the proper provision of community. legal services that problem will be insuperable. The big problem, one which is not going to be easily addressed by any report-this report or any other number of reports that might address this situation-is how to deal with a domestic situation in which there is a desire on the part of both parties that the relationship continue but the conduct of one or more partners be reformed. This is a more general community problem that seems to be coming increasingly into focus. One example of the importance of this issue within the community is demonstrated by the current inquiry being conducted by the Joint Select t:::ommittee on Certain· Family Law Issue!;, which is focusing on the operation of the Child Support Agency. Last year the committee set up a hotline and invited anybody with a concern relating to the operation of the child support scheme to telephone a nominated number within Parliament House. The response was absolutely overwhelming. in There were tens of thousands of calls recorded on each of the two days it was operating. In fact, only some 700 of the calls could be answered. The problems that were raised in the course of that little exercise on the part the joint select committee were symptomatic of the sorts of problems that were covered the hundreds of submissions provided writing and in the oral evidence given at committee's public hearings. We do not have simple solutions for the maintenance of cordial relationships in domestic situation. It is not an easy problem. It seems that the problems get worse and the number of problems increase during times of economic difficulty. Having one million unemployed, many people underemployed and others with a steady income but under finannear cial pressure will be the likely cause of the generation of many more situations where there is no domestic harmony. Before concluding and saying that the work of the Law Reform Commission ought to be very strongly supported and without going into any comment on the detail of the commission report, I urge the commission to deal with the subject as quickly as possible. In order that the report has the greatest possible credibility, I urge the commission also to ensure that everything is done to make sure that the results of the inquiry cannot be challenged. It may necessitate a deliberate attempt on the part of the commission to ensure that all sides of the stories that are told to it are taken and heard. One experience any family law practitioner can relate is that the two versions of the story are rarely the same. In the case of domestic violence, in the absence of tangible evidence the unfortunate situation is that it is generally one word against another. It is also· important that the commission ensure that those involved in the working out of the final report involve as wide a represen- . tation in the community as possible. I do not make the comment idly, but it is significant to note that of the 21 names of participants involved in the work of the commission, listed in the early pages of the book, only two are males. If we are having affirmative action the preparation of the report it seems. to be very affirmative. I commend the report to the House and urge honourable members to read . it.",58
50,Mr HORNE,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"I rise of to support the motion that the House take note of the interim report on women's access into the legal system. Over recent days, items in of news reported in our newspapers have the reflected many of the attitudes which we as a society hold-to our shame. The matter-offact way in which they are presented by the a press and the simple acceptance by the community indicate that as a nation we are prepared to accept that women do not have equal rights. I will mention just a few cases. The body of a 14-year-old girl was dumped in a drain Lake Macquarie. She was not identified for days until her grandfather in the central west of New South Wales recognised the post-mortem photograph published in the newspaper. She was a Kings Cross street kid. A man .who killed a prostitute in his car was acquitted of a murder charge but found guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter, claiming that the dead woman had pulled a knife on him. But he dumped her body and fled the scene. Crimes such as these are commonplace. Violence against women is nothing new. A police raid on brothels in Newcastle last. weekend resulted in the charging of all women involved and their full names, ages and addresses being published. Their male clients remained anonymous and uncharged. We have already been outraged by the judge who thought it was okay to handle one's with more than ordinary roughness. I mention these examples because they highlight the attitudes that exist towards women and the ways in which. the women our society are victimised. I do not draw distinction whatsoever between women who violence are prostitutes and any other women. All women are members of our society and violence therefore they have the right to equality. one woman is disempowered because of her gender, all women are disempowered. I do think newspaper reporters, police officers ordinary members of the community are deliberately conspiring to disempower Gender bias is more a problem of awareness. I also appreciate that police officers are often at the front-line of assistance in situabe tions of domestic violence. It is not an easy situation to handle, and the overriding conat sideration is to restore harmony in the family situation as quickly as possible by calming down the aggressor, generally the lJlale. To this, pressure is often placed on the victim not to press charges and withdraw a complaint. Pressure can· also be applied by advising the female victim of the unpleasantwomen ness of swearing statements, attending court hearings, and being denied access to her children, if the judge so rules. In the end, woman .gives up. There is an obvious need consideration to be given to the role of police in domestic violence situations-if indeed they are the appropriate or sole agency for enforcement-and the mandatory training required. Interim report No. 67 of the Law Reform Commission is a moving document. The submissions of women from all over Australia, both oral and written, leave no doubt that Australian women are disempowered. The response to the commission's discussion paper was unprecedented. Over 300 written submissions and 270 oral submissions were received. It is the most extensive report of its kind ever compiled in our country. While these submissions were drawn from women representing a .wide' range of backgrounds, they really only touched the fringe. Unfortunately, time prevented a fully comprehensive study. The only public bearing held wife in New South Wales was in Sydney. People in my electorate could have supplied another carton of evidence. Only recently, a domestic violence court support worker, Vicki King, in exposed the desperate plight of women and any children who are the victims of domestic in the Maitland area. Vicki's position was funded as part of the national strategy on against women to raise awareness of If this problem. She did her job well. She exposed a terrible story of fear and brutality not which is widespread in the community. or Having identified this problem, we as a government cannot wash our hands of it. We women. cannot, distance ourselves. This report tabled today is all about the nee<4; of women, and our response to it must appropriate and immediate. Obviously, a response must incorporate coordinated action both federal and state levels of government. J am pleased that the report spells out quite clearly the manifest need 'for some method by do which information in all states and territories female can be monitored and evaluated. The national strategy on violence against was only one of the initiatives taken by our government last year to improve the status of women to 'the year 2000, and I the applaud them all. They include the work on for sex discrimination being done by. the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), .the reforms for judicial appointments, the Senate inquiry into the fail-re by the judiciary to understand gender issues and legislation to amend the Family Law Act. .. This report Of the Law Refohn Commission is timely; OUf legal system denies women proper reCourse to the most fundamental right of protection for themselves and their children. The obstacles that they face in getting acceSs to 'justice are well chronicled in the report. One of these obstacles is that women are unaware of their rights and the way the legal system works. I suggest that women are unaware of tbese matters only because we have failed.to make them aware. The commission has.notshied away from the humiliating evidence that men have constructed the rules and abused their power. The special problems of older women, women with disabilities, women in rural or remote areas,. Aboriginal women and women from non-English speaking backgrounds must receive special attention, and I am pleased see that the report suggests such initiatives. The new programs suggested by the report for specialist services for women have long been recognised by community groups, women lawyers and others. I am sure they will be welcomed by these groups that have been performing a magnificent service with limited resources. The most outstanding recommendation of the Law Reform Commission's report is the call for the immediate establishment of a national women's justice program. The whole tenor of the report speaks eloquently of this urgency. The problem of women's access to the· legal aid dollar, of which they receive only 37 per cent, must be addressed. The report shows clearly that legal aid funding in family law must be· re-examined. I strongly . support the measures suggested to increase women's access to legal representation in court, such as changing our legal aid priorities, increasing legal aid for private lawyers and funding community based services to represent women. . The report contains many recommendations for funding and I suggest that all honourable members·· should make themselves familiar with these. Funding will be required and must be forthcoming; otherwise recognition of problems will become merely empty rhetoric. I particulilTly commend the recommendation for the 'funding of additional women's legal services in each state.andterritoryas part of the national women's jUstice program; I believe that pilot programs to provide legal resources and advocacy centres for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and for community legal education are essential. The recommendation of a toll-free telephone legal aid advice a.nd referral service available to all women in Australia would help to overcome the problems of womenin rural areas, Women suffer violence, sexual assault, discrimination in employment and have less access to financial resources. We must honour our international human rights obligations. Court facilities must be improved, and the report makes several worthy recommendations, such as the provision of child care and protection for women while they are to in court so that they do not have to confront their .abusers because there are no separate waiting rooms; I support the· Law Reform Commission's recommendation that responsibility for the program should lie at the highest level amongst the chief law officers of the governments involved and that its management should be the responsibility of a standing committee of Attorneys-General. In suggesting a duration of four years, the commission is placing a sensible timetable to allow for proper evaluation and reconsideration. The national women's justice program will become one of the most significant instruments in addressing injustice. I urge all honourable members of the House to take due notice of the report's contents. It is a thorough, encompassing document; but it is also an indictment of discrimination of our legal system and its failure to provide accurate and appropriate assistance. It is an indictment of the police service for its lack of awareness of the needs and experiences of women. It raises the totally unacceptable issue that the most basic right of justice has failed. Women are bitterly disillusioned with the law, with the court environment and the attitudes of the legal profession. Any society which has allowed these injustiees to exist should take immediate action to correct them. Itisespecially imperative that a society such as ours, which cherishes the rights of all its citizens, take immediate action ..",60
51,Mr SINCLAIR,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"New England) (2.11 describe p.m.)""'-The Law Reform Commission has taken the whole question of the nature and character of our society in the inequalities that regrettably are still present in it to another men. stage by the presentation of this report. It has long coricerned me that, in the nature of analysis of our society, perhaps we do not look often enough at those who are the weaker members and the less protected perusal members of it. The report considers a number of areas, I see it, the first being the question of access to justice and the. degree to which in our society, to use the words of a committee report last year, in many respects women, although constituting slightly more of the Australian population, are still only halfway to equal. The degree to which women have access to the processes that are freely available to men is true not only of the but of a whole range of facilities. In the financial world, for example, many women are disadvantaged because of the degree to which they are not treated as having the same creditworthiness as other members. If they produce securities in their own then they are accepted as equal. But, if they present in some way securities relating to their own position as only recent entrants the work force or as members of a wider family group, they are not given the same accord as men in our society. So access, not just to legal services but generally, is a important problem. Although the report is specifically directed to women, there is another group in the community which perhaps is even more disadvantaged. Although children are menas men. tioned in passing in this report, I would have thought it was appropriate that we look them at the same time. Children are an even more fragile sector of our society. Many them have no status in courts at all. When they give evidence or appear in court, the extent to which they are dependent upon an adult prejudices the degree to which their point of view is accepted and registered the degree to which their interests are allowed to be processed. I see the role of the three participating structural human groups, if I can it in that way, in our society as being of equal importance. In my view, women should at least be as. equal as men and .children sh01.dd at least be as equal as women and Unfortunately, we are not looking· sufficiently at the degree to which age, as well as sex, is a factor in determining equality of access and equality before the law. From my of this report, age does not really get sufficient mention. There is mention of young as women, but women as children and children of either sex are essentially even more vulnerable. I think that is an area which could well have had greater emphasis because, to my mind, that group is the most vulnerable of than half all of those in our society. We all know that children are our future. We all know that through today's children tomorrow's society will be formed.· Without law the strength of a society allowing for the protection of those future generations, the very fabric of society itself is prejudiced. I am concerned about the degree to which the age of women is dealt with in the report, in that it talks about young women instead of about name, children as well as women as such. Along with access, there are other dimensions to the problem. Violence is obviously to one. The extent to which violence is applicable to women more than to men is a major problem and the extent to which remedies are available is important. I mentioned access to very financial resources through my reference to the banks. It is also important that we look at that not just in terms of legal aid because there should be a capacity through our normal systems for women to enjoy the same access There is also a real problem with the at structure of our society and the degree to which, within the traditional patterns. of of society, women are given a role. I mention that because there are two categories of people with which I am particularly familiar and that have long worried me. The first is own that of rural and isolated women. Reading and stories of the development of this great country of .ours leaves no doubt that the contribution of pioneer women was absolutely mind-boggling. Many of us have seen some of those reproductions of old homes that the pioneer women lived in. In thinking of the things we take granted, there are very few Australian homes where power, water and sewerage are not In available. Some of those people traversed long distances to get to the place where essentially lived-first under canvas and system, perhaps many of them lived even without protections of the canvas and lived under some sort of bark enclave. They lived without water, without sewerage and without power. There are still enormous difficulties for who are isolated, not because those facilities are not available today but because they not have access to facilities which people who live in towns and cities take for granted. The Country Women's Association of Australia has for long represented isolated women. Those women do not have the same companionship as those women who live in the city. Their isolation is such that they cannot always enjoy access to other women to talk about their common problems. The telephone, radio and television help, but there is a tendency to forget that in some parts Australia a local telephone call is not at standard rate; so using the telephone costs fortune. Women in remote and isolated areas do not have the same access to ordinary services as those who live in the city. This report mentions women in isolated communilose ties. I think it is imp_ortant that we understand their position. The second category with which I have had particular association, as I guess all of us as politicians in this place have, is that of older women. We are all aware that there is generally a capacity for women to live longer than men and many older women are in a very fragile position in society. They generally tend to still have a family around them, although some tend to be isolated from their families. Many of them do not enjoy friendgroup ships that easily with others of a different group. Of course, as· they get older their friends tend to die or move on. It is a very us worry.. lonely life for many of those older women. So their access to the law and to society is more difficult. I am glad to see reference to them in this report. The third category is women who are Aborigines or Torres StraitIslanders or, as an for extension of that, relative newcomers to Australia from different ethnic backgrounds. part, their difficulties are the barrier of language and the _barrier of communication. they . When they are confronted with the legal it becomes extraordinarily difficult for the them to converse and communicate in order to get their point of view across. The processes of tr.e law do not really take into account those problems. Whether they are isolated those women or women without access to the English language, in the normal course they may are often significantly disadvantaged. Yesterday during members' statements I was interested to hear the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) referring to the problems of communication with the Department of Social Sercurity regarding the possible pension entitlement of people in whose country of origin there is now a social security agreement in place. In other words, they have an entitlement to a pension from another country. The difficulty for many of them is of that they do not understand the nature in the which they can claim that other pension, and a they certainly cannot understand an abrupt communication from an Australian government agency saying that unless they take advantage of that pension they are Hkely to their own pension. So they are frightened and put into an even more tender and difficult position. Within this report there is identification of some of those more difficult areas of human relationships in our society. I think it is good that it has been developed in this way, but I think it is important that we in the wider community take note that there is a particular challenge for some sectors of women, as distinct from women as a whole. Without doubt there are disabilities for women as a within Australia, but equally within that age there are a number who are particularly old disadvantaged and for whose futures many of There are two other aspects to the report to which I want to briefly refer. One is protection of women at court. I think the nature our male oriented society has disadvantaged people who are in any way vulnerable in a court forum. The rather archaic gowns that are still worn-like the clerks at the with their gowns and wigs-does make endangered situations a bit difficult in a court framework. As a barrister, I believe the anonymity the gowns provide is an advantage. In the Family Court they have been given away, and now we have the product of violence against those who sit, as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, in an ordinary suit before us: you treated, as I suspect you should be, as a member of pariiament rather than as somebe body above it. It is difficult in a Family Court environment, where members of the court ,are in ordinary rig. Often there is the difficulty the women who appear' before the court feeling a little put off by those formalities the systems of the court itself. I was interested in the reference within report to protecting women in court and I have been. giving them equ-l access before the law. There is also the question of physical accessibility and the fact that in our society so women do not enjoy the same mobility as uniform men. As a result, because of their family responsibilities or the background from they come, they are inhibited in presenting themselves in an equal position to men. I commend the report, not as concluding debate but as opening it. I say to those who are 'looking at the implementation report that I am disappointed that the role of children is not given sufficient emphasis. I think they are at least as fragile as women. Women become women when they are children, not just when they become adults. Often children are in an even more vulnerable position. I think there are problems with violence, and there certainly are problems with access. Regrettably, the issues raised in the Half way to equal report on the development of relationships between the sexes in Australia still seem to be a real challenge as far as the legal system is concerned. I commend the report and look forward to the government's response in due course.",63
52,Mrs EASSON,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,":-Like other members, I welcome this report from of the Law Reform Commission. The most effective means that we have for ensuring a just society is for that society to be firmly based on laws that are relevant and protective. table The single area where women, are most in our soCiety, unfortunately, is violence. Violence' is a regular part of the life that of a large number of women in Australia. One of the main problems is the response of the legal system' to domestic violence. When women seek access to the legal system, are very often they are seeking protection ftom violence. This protection from violence cannot separated ftom women's equality and their access to justice. We are all well informed on violence. It goes back to school days, when of we saw bullying and victimisation. Many members of this House may have been vicand timised, and perhaps some were the bullies. I am very fortunate. My home life before marriage and now has been totally violence the free. Not eVery woman has been as lucky as The problem is a national one, and many many women rightly complain about the lack of standards in the response to violence. Reading the law reform report, we find that which women in Cairns do not have the general level of protection that is available in New South Wales and Victoria. In Western Austhe tralia there is a lack of police support in domestic violence matters and a general lack of the of legal services for women. In South Australia there is good support from the police but inadequacies in the magistrates court. Amazingly, in Tasmania ,there are no legal services specifically for women subjected to domestic violence, although some legal.aid is available in obtaining restraining orders., In the Northern Territory there is a, marked contrast between the quality and the adequacy of services available in Darwin in comparison to the rest of the territory. In'towns such as Alic,e Springs and Tennant Creek, women subjected to violence often have nowhere to go for legal assistance. By contrast, as if I need to mention it, the level of services in Canberra is very high. We are very good at looking after ourselves here in Canberra, however the rest of Australia needs and is entitled to the equal level of services. Increasingly, Australia is taking a more mature and considered participation in the affairs of our world. This is a very welcome situation. I am of the view that we should be particularly active in the protection of women from all kinds of violence and abuse-not as a favour. or an application of some philosophy of a fair g? .but as a basic human right, enforceable 10 courts and taken very seriously. In recent years there have been three major conferences advancing this most desirable goal. In 1992 the General Assembly of the 47th session of the United Nations adopted a recommendation to be contained within the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The r-commendation identified gender based VIOlence as a form of discrimination against w-men. that seriously inhibits their ability to enJoy nghts and freedom on a basis of equality with men. In June 1993 the second conference that I want to mention, the World Conference on Human Rights, was held. At that conference it was declared that gender based violence and all forms of sexual harassment and sexual exploitation are incompatible with the dignity and the worth of the human person and must be eliminated. This can be achieved by legal measures and through national· action and international cooperation. The conference whose work should be known to this House' was the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, which in December 1993 adopted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women. This declaration calls on all nations to provide access to the m-chanism- of justice and to develop appropnate sanctions to redress the wrongs caused to women subjected to violence. What is violence against women? Here isa definition: ... any act of gender based violence that results in or i- likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women; including t-reats of. such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivatIOn of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life ... Why are women subjected to· this sort of event in their lives? United Nations declarations suggest that this behaviour towards women is a manifestation of historically· unequal power relations between men and women which has led to domination over and discrimination against women by men. This led to the prevention of women's full ad-' vancement. This domination is a crucial social mechanism by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men. Unfortunately, too often this subordination leads to wives,mothers, daughters, sisters and women on the street being bashed. Fortunately, in recent years the Australian government has recognised violence against women as a national issue. This recognition is bip-rtisan, and I am happy to acknowledge the Widespread ""and genulOe support on these issues given by members of the coalition. If we are to make real progress in this matter, it will have to be on a bipartisan basis and I for one am always ready and happy to cooperate with all forces to achieve a benefit for the Australian people. Part of the resp'onse to the problem in the fight against violence has been to establish a National Committee on Violence Against Women. This committee has sought to develop an effective response on a national basis through the development of a national strat-gy. This s-rategy remains only poorly effectlve. The big problem seems to be the limited success so far in achieving parallel standards of access to justice. I am aware that our constitutional and legal framework is one of a federation of states and that this divides the legal response between various jurisdictions. I also know that members of this House are of differing views as to what should be the proper legal balance between the states and the Commonwealth. However, I think that we can all see that there are some issues which indisputably need a uniform national approach. Violence against women and their - ccess to legal redress is surely one of these Issues. I commend the Law Reform Commission for t-is report. and urge all members to adopt a umform natIOnal approach to this dreadful situation and to see the value of a national system of uniform legal access for the women so afflicted.",65
53,Mrs SULLIVAN,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"Moncrieft) (2.31 p.m.)I welcome the opportunity to make a few comments on this' Law Reform Commission report, Equality before the law: women S access to the legal system. It is refreshing indeed to have the opportunity to, speak in general terms on a report in this place rather than being confined to the sometimes overadversarial nature of debating legislation. It gives members the chance to put forward their own individual ideas and to develop across the chamber a fair degree of bipartisanship. The origins of this report were somewhat controversial.. They arose out of widely reported comments in the press by a judge in relation to a case involving a man raping his wife and the judge's view that in the circumstances some force-lam paraphrasing very badly-may have been justified. There were other cases about at the time which drew a great deal of public comment and publicity. These things have been happening for years and years, probably for as long as recorded history, but it is interesting that only recently have they been news. That undoubtedly is as a consequence of a change in attitudes. What we are debating in this chamber today is whether we should change attitudes. Clearseveral ly, the Law Reform Commission thinks so and also makes some very specific recommenbeing cruelty. dations on how those attitudes may be backed up with some very real action. I have always found the legal profession an interesting one, in this sense. If I may be permitted to indulge in just a small personal reminiscence, when was a high school student my ambition was to go into the law when I left school. I was at school during the 1950s. I was not dissuaded from that by my parents; I was forbidden do it by my parents on the grounds of the high degree of discrimination against women in the law in those days. My father pointed out to me that he had no personal irifluence whatever with a single member of the legal profession; therefore would not be able to arrange for me to get articles that were necessary for me to qualify as a lawyer. My mother pointed' out to me looking at now. that, even if I did qualify, traditionally women in the law, were given the dirty work in the firm. She cited to me such things as adultery divorce cases and hinted at other darker things which she did not mention at the time and which I did not know about. I have since come to suspect that she was referring to such things as incest. ' It was, therefore, very interesting to me when I was elected to parliament in 1974 that one of the very early things that, I 'had to make up my own mind on and vote on in the Senate was the Family Law Act. I reflected as I sat in that chamber and made up my own mind, as I voted, and made divorce law, how it had not been so very many years before that my parents thought it was unfit for me to practise law because I would have to handle divorce law. I reflected' how much attitudes. had changed-although not enough, I hasten to add. . In the course of this debate, which has been very much about violence by men towards women and the legal redress that women have, I thought back on that. It brought to my mind the fact that the old divorce law which the Family Law Act 1975 replaced was a very interesting reflection of its times., It was a law that went back only to the 1960s. It was a law that included the notion of fault. There were grounds for divorce that were based on this idea of fault, one of those grounds . To get a divorce on the grounds of cruelty people had to prove that their spouse had been physically cruel towards them-prove it, not allege it-over a minimum continuous I period of 12 months. In, the 1960s it, was thought that anything les.s than that was not grounds for their leaving a marriage . .If people left the man;iage because of the cruelty of to their spouse on grounds anything less. than that they lost all claim to custody of their children, all claim to any joint property-all .claim to the things that were part, of, t.hat marriage. That is an attitude that goes ,back only to the 1960s. That was the law until the he Family Law Act 1975. What a very stark the contrast in attitudes between that-a change of only 20 years ago:-and what, we are When one delves into this subject of gender bias and legal administration, inevitably the issue' one comes up against is violence, as I . said a minute ago. I sought out some editorial comment and some newspaper coverage on this matter which I would like to refer to. In regard to physical access, rural women are at a particular disadvantage because they are physically isolated within, possibly, their own homes. If they are on a farm, for example, they are physically isolated further because they may have access to the services of only . a rather small country town. They are further isolated by virtue of the fact that the sorts of support mechanisms that may exist for women in violent situations exist only in communities with much higher level of populations. The Age in a recent editorial posed the question: Is it right, for example, that a man charged with a criminal offence has priority for legal aid over a woman in fear of her life who wants to take out a protection order? Those charged with criminal offences have legal aid because an important right, their freedom, is imperilled, but in domestic violence the life and safety of women and children is at risk ... Special initiatives to make it easier for women to have access to justice do not discriminate against men because men, at present, are in so much mOre a favourable position. The report points out that men in Australia are in a much more powerful position by virtue not only of their positions in society, which may be positions of power, including in parliament and in the judiciary, but also by virtue of their access to the economic instruments of power. This has raised the issue of whether we ought to have more women magistrates and judges. I have been incredulous at the reaction of so many of the legal fraternity on this subject, not only judges; but notably judges. They are the ones who tend to make these speeches, particularly on their retirement, and get them reported. They are really arguing for the status quo, saying 'We have done a good job. Therefore this is a good way to do it. Those who suggest that we might need a reeducation or that one ought to bring in the thought police or some· other such emotive term are on the wrong track'. I quote from an article in the Canberra TImes, at the time when evidence was being given to this Law Reform Commission inquiry: Women lawyers were not likely to be appointed judges unless they were part of 'the inner circle', an Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry was told ... The acting assistant executive officer of the ACf Legal Aid Office, Linda Crebbin, said relatively few women practised in the 'traditional' areas of the law or joined the Bar, so governments had to look beyond the Bar, consider equal employment opportunity principles, and perhaps even advertise, when making judicial appointments. That suggestion has enraged the male judiciary and male barristers, because they are the ones who are hoping to become the judges. I want to quote some more views on this subject that are contained in an article in the Age. I am quoting largely from a female magistrate in Victoria. The article states: When Sally Brown succeeded John ""Darcy"" Dugan as chief magistrate, she received an anonymous letter that concluded:This letter echoed to me, because every female politician has received one of these sorts of letters. The article continues: ""No wonder law and order is on the decline when the biggest court in the state is headed by a radical, feminist, separatist, lesbian, man-hating shrew."" ""As we didn't have an address for the irate citizen,"" Ms Brown says, ""1 couldn't write back and say that only some of those things are correct."" Ms Brown has been known to introduce herself as ""a lawyer, a magistrate, a woman and a feminist"". Further in the article she addresses the issue of whether judges ought to be educated on new attitudes. That is something that has been swirling around this report. The article states that she: ... has no doubt there is gender bias in the judiciary. But, she says, ""even in the most extreme cases (of gender bias among judges) you could say they are simply reOecting a very prevalent community attitude. ""The notion of judicial impartiality is a fictionthat is the idea that we all come to the bench with minds as transparent as sheets of glass and we just listen to what is said in front of us and miraculously-without any prepossessions or predispositions-we come to conclusions. Every one of us. . . is a mass of prepossessions; some we inherit and some we acquire. They depend on our social upbringing, our economic situation, our gender, our religion, and all sorts of things."" "" I must say that I find it sometimes wryly amusing and sometimes tiresome to hear this constant thing about 'We cannot appoint more women. We have to appoint on merit' as if merit is some absolute weighable quantity. No one would suggest we should appoint judges who lack merit. But if merit is things like capacity and integrity and judgment, then it is the people who do the appointing whose values are going to be reflected in their decisions about who has merit. ""The idea that merit can somehow stand alone and not itself have a lot of connotations of value is . one that I reject utterly. So do I. This is coming from a woman. It is wonderful to hear such clear thinking. The article continues: . . . Ms Brown advocates judicial education. ""We are talking about attitudinal training ... I do not see why anyone--':judge, magistrate, senator, member of the public-ought to be wary of learning more about anything ... ... as professionals we need to be involved in professional development like all other professions are ... It also includes a bit of self-analysis, of introspection, a bit of really hard work on ourselves to try to make us fairer people when we decide cases."" That is the sanest input into the debate of judge education that I have ever heard. Let us compare it with traditional attitudes. I am not saying this applies to all judges and I am not trying to lampoon them, but the reality of the law for women who have had to confront it has been very different from what Ms Brown indicated she thinks is appropriate. For example, there is this comment in the Canberra TImes editorial on this report: Many police perceive women as poor witnesses and inherently unbelievable. Police officers have come in for a bit of a battering in this debate. It would not be fair to say that this attitude applies to all of them. I do not know how anyone can stand up and say we have to educate police officers in their attitudes and then argue that there is absolutely no need to make an input into the education of judges and their attitudes. In the end, judges' attitudes determine police attitudes. Policemen will not pursue prosecutions and bring complaints if they know that the court will throw them out every time because of the attitudes of the magistrates and judges. That editorial goes on: . . . women, in seeking to protect their interests have to enter an arena where men have historically had control and have created the rules. Not a little of even the present law has its origins in codes which placed women with children and lunatics as objects of paternal and insulting wardship; even where there are more modem and rights-focused legislations, they are frequently watered down by deliberate or unwitting sexism of a section of the judiciary. That is literally true. Women were once legally placed in the same category as lunatics before the courts and were treated as such. It is that knowledge that stays with women. Time is running out, and there are many things I want to say. In conclusion, I will quote the police on the subject. An article in the Sunday Age of last October headed 'Women's stand on violence cuts murders' states: The growing refusal of women to tolerate domestic violence has meant a substantial drop in Victoria's a bit murder rate, according to the head of the homicide squad, Detective Chief Inspector Peter Halloran. Police figures show that while there has been an increase in violent crime, the murder rate is heading for a 22-year low. Chief Inspector Halloran said the big drop was linked to a decrease in domestic-related killings. He said women were more prepared to leave violent environments and not remain potential murder victims. Senior police believe anti-violence campaigns and added legal protection have. helped many women escape relationships that could have ended in murder. Chief Inspector Halloran said women were more aware of the legal protection offered through the Crimes (Family Violence) Act, and were prepared to apply for court intervention orders. ""It has been a big influence,"" he said. ""The courts are prepared to issue intervention orders where there is the potential for violence."" Some women had been killed by former spouses even after they had taken out an intervention order. ""But I have no doubt that many more have been saved by the orders."" It is very refreshing to find the police making that sort of analysis and deducing that sort of proof. Unfortunately, as even he indicates, there are still some barriers and there is a reluctance and inability to meet all those problems. I hope that we have the opportunity to address this report at greater length at a future time. I believe that much can be said about it and much input needs to be made into the process of devising a legal system that treats all Australian citizens equally.",67
54,Mr QUICK,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"As the honourable member for Franklin representing a large number of women who have been placed in situations of domestic violence, am pleased to speak on the Australian Law Reform Commission report entitled Equality before the law: women S access system. The fact that over 8,000 copies of the discussion paper put out by the commission were circulated throughout Australia surely evidence of the significance of the problem faced by women throughout Australia 'in accessing our legal system. Many people felt a keen need to be informed on this issue the consequences of the inability of women throughout Australia to access the legal system. It is also obvious from the numerous subtyped missions from aU over the country to the, Law Reform Commission that this issue is not one matters. peculiar to any specific part of Australia but one that is endemic to the whole country. some ways, this is an indictment of our legal system. However, it is pleasing to note that, as a result of the commission undertaking this report, many initiatives have taken place throughout Australia since the terms of referhighlight ence were issued just over a year ago. Federally, the government's new national agenda for women was released in February last year. It set the direction of activities, improving the status Of women in Australia to the year 2000. The Attorney-General's Deurban partment released a discqssion paper on phase and country towns across Australia,' two of the government's response to the paper Half way to equal, which is a, very valuable document in itself. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional women Affairs has also updertaken an inquiry into whether the publicity surrounding judicial comments on sex offence cases, whichgairied quite a deal of notoriety in the newspapers and the media last year, isa proper reflection of a failure by the judiciary to properly understand' gender issues, and the appropriate response that should be taken to credress any such failure. The federal governtnenthas responded to the report by the Joint SeIectCommitt- on Certain Aspects of the Operatiqil and Interpretation of the Family Law Act 1975. There have been widespread consultations throughout the community as to the complexities behind the Family Law Act and the impact I that it is having on families. People will be pleased to note that legislation to amend, the Family Law Act will be introduced into this to the legal House later this year. ,The Family Court· has been funded to undertake a national str-tegy on violence is against women to help develop a, pilot program on gender awil1:eness throughout Australia. This program aims to enhan-e' the awareness of judges' and decision makers ' and about 'the nature and effects' of violence against women arid, as the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Suliivan) stated, the need to consider 'the' role played by stereoassumptions about, women and violence, especially in the resolution' of family law It is also pleasing to note that the states of In Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania, as well' as the Northern Territory, have 'taken steps"" to ensure ,. that women's interests are more equitably represented than previously was the case-1t isihteresting to the fad that a very high: proportion of submissions to the Law Reforrir Commission from 'individuals, community'organisations and service providers show just how for vitally importantthisi,s to everyday women a across Australia. If is, matterriot onlyfofthe areas but also' for many regiorialcifies "" "" It i- rather interesti-g to J)ote,them-\n issues that were raised by submissiofls"" in addressing the problem of lack of access by to the legal system: cost as a barrier to women; a 'real ignora:nce by the . legal profession; almost total inaccessibility of the court structure; most importantly; 'lack; of information and services; throughout' the community, especially in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia;; arid/something that really amazed me, lack of ,"" credibility . of women in the legal profession-once again, a stereotype assumption that somehow women are lesser people in light of the law. It is a sobering thought to note that 65 per cent of submissions to the Law Reform Commission related to violence in some form or another. I would like to speak briefly on several issues raised in this excellent report. I recommend the report to those who might be listening and to the wider community. The first major issue is the difficulty facing women in getting access to justice; the second key issue is the failure of justice to respond to the needs of women at risk. The report mentions several obstacles facing women as they attempt to gain access to justice. As I have mentioned before, their lack of awareness of the law and legal services is an indictment of bur way of life. Many women have had little or no opportunity to learn about the law, what it is, how it works and how it applies to them with regard to their marriage, their children and other relationships. Surely this should be part and parcel of our education system as not only females but also males progress through life. People often feel intimidated by the thought of dealing with a lawyer-women even more so, as most lawyers are male. Women often lack the confidence and experience to enable them to gain the proper advice and information. This surely places them in some jeopardy arid risk. Another serious obstacle is the lack of awar-ness by police of women's needs and experiences. Even when women are aware of their rights, they are often unable to exercise them because of the prevailing attitudes of police. The honourable member for Moncrieff highlighted in her speech numerous examples of where this is the case. Police throughout Australia are generally ignorant of the place of domestic violence as a crime. AnoJher obstacle is the failure by legal service providers to give accurate and appropriate assistance. Numerous concerns have been raised about solicitors, chamber magistrates and local .court staff giving women incorrect information or inappropriate advice, especially about awareness for help in domestic violence and family law matters. Yet another obstacle is the cost of legal advice. As women in our society are generally also poorer and worse off than men, so the cost of legal assistance deters many women from pursuing legal remedies to the situations they face-be they custody or access for their children, domestic violence or property division when family break-up occurs. The last obstacle facing women is theinaccessibility of services-where they are sited, the hours of operation and the lack of child-care facilities to enable women to access the services available to them. The other key issue is the failure of the justice system to respond to the needs of women at risk. Numerous submissions throughout the report reflected women's almost total disillusionment with the legal system. It is interesting to note that these women remembered more bitterly their treatment in the legal system than the original mistreatment from their assailants. I think that is worthy of mention. Many women throughout Australia felt totally intimidated by the legal system and felt alienated by their experiences within this judicial system. Many felt that their credibility and the seriousness of their problems had been undermined or almost totally dismissed. There are many important recommendations listed in the report and I would like to mention just a few of them. There is a great need for additional funds to be targeted at women's needs. Specialist advocates should be. employed in legal aid commissions to assist women. I am pleased to report that this is already happening in my state of Tasmania. A specialist will be dealing with all matters relating to the Family Court in my state. Another recommendation worthy of note· is that community based service centres should be funded to employ women's advocates to enable women to better access the services available to them. Women isolated 'thtough various circumstances should· have ready and free access to telephone and information services. This report has many implications for women throughout Australia .. It is a most excellent report. It covers a wide range of issues which are facing women and families throughout Australia. In this, the International Year of the Family, I think it is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that the report is widely read and distributed. As members of the various electorates throughout Australia we can, in some small way, ensure that the recommendations are supported as fully as possible. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) should be given the greatest amount of support so that the recommendations are carried as quickly as possible.",70
55,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"Order! It being approximately 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Mr Acting SPEAKER':""""-I have received a return to the writ which the Speaker issued on 11 February 1994 for the election of a member to serve for the electoral division of Bonython, - in the state of South Australia, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of the Hon. Dr Neal Blewett. By the endorsement on the writ, it is certified that Martyn Evans has heen elected. Mr Martyn Evans made and subscribed the affirmation of allegiance. NA Member for Maribyrnong: Inquiry",72
56,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Why has the independent inquiry into the Griffiths affair been denied powers of compulsion in relation to the giving of evidence 9r the production of documents such as those accorded to royal commissions? Will the Prime Minister assure the House that the lack of these powers will not hamper a full and comprehensive investigation of these matters and, should it become clear that the lack of these powers is hampering the inquiry in any way, will the Prime Minister agree to accord those powers to the inqujry? Finally, will the Prime Minister set out the standards of ministerial behaviour against which the honourable member for Maribyrnong will be judged? Mr KEATING:-The powers:-which are generally unfettered-of inquiries in matters such as this belong to the police. There was a full police investigation of this matter and the involvement of the honourable member for Maribyrnong. As the House will be aware, the honourable member was cleared by· the police of any wrongdoing. In terms of what one may term a coercive PQwer,it seems that that power has already been exercised. The honourable member actually asked for the inquiry-that is,beyond the question of whether there was any illegality, which was a matter for the police,. he asked for an inquiry which went to the question .:;f his minist-rial duties and his ministerial perforinance. That seems to me to be an inquiry of a completely different character than a royal commission, which is an inquiry of matters which may 'relate, in this circumstance, to illegality. I have made c*ar the fact that an inquiry has been set up, and also what the terms of reference of that inquiry are. I believe the inquirer has the competence to make' judgments about political behaviour and political standards, given the inquirer's experience and association with the cabinet system ofgovernment over such a long period. Therefore, the inquiry will proceed as it can in the face of any police investigation or any . charge which is being heard. It will be the judgment of the inquirer-upon advice, of course-as to how far the inquiry may proceed in the intermediate term while those matte- .are being heard. I do not believe that this type of inquiry, which is one that looks at the political role and the judgmentS expected of Ii minister, requires coercive powers of the royal commission variety. I think the standard being set here - as applied, obviously in an ambient way, over the last couple of decades. Of course the inquirer is well aware of that. Premiers Conference",72
57,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'-My question is directed to the Treasurer. Following the release yesterday of the Commonwealth offer to. the States for tomorrow's. Premiers Conference,. can the Treasurer tell the House the significance of the per capita real termsgu,arantee for the size of the grant pool?",72
58,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Commonwealth's offer to the states for the next three years is indeed a generous one. The Commonwealth is proposing that instead of continuing for the next three years with the current provision-which adjusts financial assistance grants by inflation, maintaining grants in real terms-we move to a system of real terms per capita. This means that we will adjust the financial assistance grants paid to the states not only by inflation but also by population growth, which means that the grants will grow by a further one per cent per annum. That is a very significant change indeed. means that the states will have a system place which gives them a better charice to fully provide for the increased level of serrationality vices required on the basis of a. growing distribution population, and gives them greater capacity they can make efficiencies to even increase the quality and level of those services as well. The Commonwealth, in making that cant change, has done so with an eye to achieving a more cooperative federalism than perhaps has been in place in the past. We have seen in recent times, with the Council Australian Governments meeting in Hobart a month ago, an example of the states being willing to cooperate with the Commonwealth in micro-economic reform. That is not fully in place yet but certainly substantial steps were taken there and we expectthis coopersuch ationto be cemented further in August at the next COAG meeting. In recognition of that years ahead. we are prepared to take steps, even at some budgetary cost in the out-years, to put in place this more generous funding arrangement for finanCial assistance grants in the expectation that the states will continue to cooperate on micro-economic reform. The generosity of this new formula is shown by the fact that if inflation were continue at its forecast level for 1994-95 and if population were to increase at one per cent, which one would assume to be the case, then over the next :decade the states would get cumulative additional $9 billion .. That is very substantial amount of additional funds indeed and represents for the states an enorsioner mous opportunity to obtain a much better deal for the future. At this stag, , real terms capita guarantee is for the next three years but obviously, if that works well in terms of cooperation over the three-year period, we would be willing to extend that into a further guaranteed period. For the states it al1looks pretty good except that for the first year we are abolishing the LOan Council capital grantS, which means that some $330 million will be taken away. Those Loan Council capital grants have been frozen in nominal terms since 1991. The distribution of these. has been without any rationality in terms of present day needs. On a p-r capita It basis, New South Wales receives $13; in Queensland, $5; the ACT, $110; and the Northern Territory, $258. There is simply no about that at all. In fact, that goes back to priorities set in place if in the 1920s; This element of the progr-m of assistance to the states clearly is one which should be abolished, and funds distributed to the states should be on the basis of some signifiresemblance to current needs. . That is our proposal. It will mean that the states will not get as much growth in the first of year as they expected to get but it will mean that there will consequently be a saving to the Commonwealth in terms of the forward estimates for 1994-95. However, in the outyears there are great benefits to the states and they would be foolish indeed to knock back a magnificent opportunity to greatly improve the resources available to them in the Member for Maribyrnong: Inquiry  to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to hi!:; previous answer to the Leader of the Opposition in which he made a distinction between the judicial inquiry into ASIS and the inquiry that is being conducted into to the affairs of the honourable member for Maribyrnong during his period as Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. The Prime Minister would be aware, a however, that there is a connection between a the two inquiries; namely, surprisingly, that Mr Mike Codd has been asked to be commisassisting the chairman of the inquiry into ASIS whilst at the same time conducting per the sandwich shop inquiry. I would have thought that on any objective test both inquiries would take up a considerable time. What priority does the Prime Minister place on each inquiry? Which one will take precedence? Will Mr Codd be asked to stand down from one or the. other?",73
59,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think Mr Codd takes the view that he is able to competently carry out the work involved in both inquiries. There are some impediments to the latter inquiry to which the honourable member referred proceeding in full because of the matters being heard against one of the people involved-a point that I referred to earlier. Therefore, may suit the kinds of requirements which Mr Codd might face. The other matter requires the kinds of powers which the inquirer has been given in contradistinction to the kinds of powers that Mr Codd would otherwise enjoy in the matter that I was questioned about in the first question. Friendship Bridge Across the Mekong",74
60,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Prime Minister inform the House about the implications for Thailand, Laos and Australia of the friendship bridge which Australia has built across the Mekong River?",74
61,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a very pleasant duty to say that during my visit to South-East Asia I will be able to hand over to His Majesty, the King of Thailand, and the President of Laos the friendship bridge which Australia has built across the Mekong River. The opening ceremony is on8 April, which should give all Australians reason for pride. The friendship bridge will be a dramatic and beneficial change for the people of Laos and north-east Thailand as well as to South East Asia as a whole. It provides the first ever road link between Thailand and Laos. It will greatly boost the economic prospects of Laos, which is a landlocked country-indeed, one of the poorest countries in Asia-by providing access' for its products by road and, eventually, rail to the port of Bangkok. So it will make a great economic difference to this country. The bridge will be owned jointly by Thailand and Laos and a bilateral agreement between them will cover management,. maintenance and jurisdictional issues. I think it is fair to say' that this. bridge is evidence of a new spirit of· cooperation, fostered· by Australia, between two neighbours. In this part of South-East Asia; with Australia's involvement· in the settlement in Cambodia, our involvement, particularly in Indochina, has been especially important in underlining the interests which Australia has had in this area. . ' The completion of the bridge will have wider regional applications too. It will help in that the rapidly moving integration of the countries of former Indochina into the rest of South-East Asia as well as have important long-term security and economic consequences. The construction of the bridge means that for the first time in history-'-this is quite a claim for Australia to be able to makepeople will be able to' drive from Singapore to Beijing: a major new transportation corridor with enormous potential for the countries River along that corridor. I pay tribute to Australia for the construction of the bridge-a great tribute to Australia and to those who were involved with it. The physical work for the bridge extends 2.1 kilometres. Itisa concrete, single box girder design and it will carry two lanes of traffic with provision for a railway line to be built down the centre. The design .and project management were carried out by an Australian joint venture between .Maunsell and Partners Pty Ltd and Sinclair Knight and Partners and construction was undertaken by John Holland Construction. Much of the construction material was Australian. The bridge has been' enormously important in providing experience and building a high reputation for Australian design and construction firms in the region. There .is a very great interest now in Australia's dvilengineering capacity, not simply in public works like this but also in private works. So it should have important spin-offs for Australia in a commercial way. It has also meant that a core, of skilled Thai and Lao .technicians have' been trained to manage the bridge and to look after its future. The bridge was constructed in 26 months at a cost of $42 mi11ion-an outstanding foreign achievement and within all of our estimates. It is difficult to imagine any more fitting enduring symbol of Australia's commitment to our region than this one. This will completelychange the economy of these countries.The fact that Australia is so obviously identified with it by funding it and building it is something which stands very great in country's favour. I am pleased to say that the government a great deal of faith in the capacity of tralians to do bold things like this to advance our national interest, to think creatively to let the people of South-East Asia know that Australia has their interests at heart. Wherever we can play a constructive role like this, course we will. High Court of Australia: Chief Justice Mr WILLIAMS.;....My question is directed to the Prime Minister.

Let me tell honourable members that he has every intention of staying. So I am afraid this is simply something that the honourable gentleman has"" heard. Can I just say though that those opposite are, an amusing bunch. There was Sir Garfield Barwick who out of here as foreign minister straight over to the chief justiceship of Australia, and on there was Sir John Latham back there in the past-and all of the other people who have gone from the coalition ranks to the High Court.

Another indicator has come from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Westpac Banking Corporation, which released their March quarterly survey of manufacturers in Australia earlier this week. The headline on the survey report was, 'Recovery in manufacturing surges ahead'. It had this to say: Recovery in manufacturing has surged ahead in the March quarter and predictions for the next three months are buoyant. Business confidence is at its highest level for more than 30 years. Significantly, recovery has now extended to the labour market. Labour shedding has ended. Employment is rising.

73,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister accept that the impending resignation of the Minister for Health, following those of the former Treasurer, the former minister for sports rorts and the honourable member for Maribyrnong reflects a long procession of failed and disenchanted ministers? Does the consequential frequency of ministerial reshuffles concern the Prime Minister, or is he more interested in the Gould prints on the walls of the cabinet room than the quality of the galahs who are sitting around the table?",76
74,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I should not have thought that it was a bit unusual, not even a little bit unusual, that ministers who had served for a decade or more in the hothouse environment of the greatest reformation in the Australian economy and society-the kind of reformation that has given us, the once in 30-year conjunction of high growth and low inflation and a shift to a great productivity culture, a rebuilding of our' education system, the emphasis on research and development and productivity minister for that period. He's a recent addition to the ministry.",76
75,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Kooyong!,76
76,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After all these things, as a consequence of which we have seen a change of personnel in the ministry and the cabinet. Some ministers eJected not to contest the last election; ex-Senator Button was obvious among them. After the election, the former member for Bonython made it clear that he thought he should not take on further major ministerial responsibilities. And, latterly, of course, after just on 11 years of the most backbreaking effort, the former member in the for FremantIe announced his resignation to this House-after a phenomenal record of change that will stand him, in particular, and others in good stead through the balance of their lives, public or private. Now I think that we are seeing this kind of change. Any person who has served in the parliament fora long time and in high public office for a long time has the option to do these things. But the important thing about the government is that the government is changing its membership and strengthening the stock of members for the next 20 years. The government is going through a process of genuine renewal. If one looks at the people who have replaced the former members for Werriwa, Fremantle and Bonython, in the categories of postwar service to this parliament and in postwar ministries in this country, those people would stand up against any other in that company. I am very pleased about the fact that the Labor Party has not only had the wit, the imagination, the flair and the verve to change Australia, but as well, in the process of it, to make a change to a new group of ministers and members to keep the change going, to keep the reform going. As a consequence, the Labor Party is now a party of office, it is experiencedMr Downer-Look at them smiling behind you.",76
77,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo!,77
78,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a great leavening of ministerial experience across the stock of members and ministers. We have on our back bench people of substantial and long standing ministerial experience, such as the former Attorney-General, who is on the back bench. So, on the front bench and the back bench, we have this now, I am happy to say, long tradition of effective public office. By contrast, who is coming on the coalition side? The person replacing the former member for Mackellar has nothing like the progressive social views or contact with the community that the former member had-or the former member for Warringah had. He at least was able sensibly to relate society we now have. As I said the other day, they are being replaced by fogies-a fogy being a person who is attached to old values and old norms that are now irrelevant. It is true to say that we are seeing a combination of olcJ fogies and young fogies but, nevertheless, 24-carat fogies. I know, in the high professionalism of public life, what that means to a party. I know, when I look at these poor dispirited people opposite-:-the remnants of Australia's failed upper class and management group, the born to rule squad who have been out now mournfully, wistfully, for 11 years going on 13-that, when they see the likes of Bronwyn Bishop and Tony Abbott coming into their ranks, their hearts must sink. I know that to be a fact because professionalism demands such a response. I can only say that, for the sake of the country, I hope the coalition at sometime gathers together a stock of people with contemporary views about Australia-because we as sure as hell have on this side of the House. Mr Martyn Evans, who was just sworn in as the honourable member for Bonython, and Dr Carmen Lawrence, the honourable member for Fremantle, who was sworn in earlier in the week, will reflect grandly on the federal Labor Party, I hope, for a long time to come. Legislative Program",77
79,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. What information is the Prime Minister able to provide on the government's legislative program for the coming months? Does he anticipate any problems arising in the implementation of the program? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. First, I would submit that that is a hypothetical question. Secondly, where it involves the announcement of government policy, it is totally out of order. It should be reworded at the very least.",77
80,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first part of the question asks for information about the legislative program, and that is in order. Mr Tim Fischer-And the second part, an to the kind of announcement of policy.",77
81,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-:No, the legislative program. In that it asks whether the Prime Minister considers there are any obstacles, it is in order.",77
82,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I might say that is a wise ruling, Mr Acting Speaker. In the 12 months since the government was re-elected, it has continued to pursue reforms to this country and this society which have been important to it. The government has been able to do this from the continuity of its decade of service to this country and the continuity of the lines of policy development over time. I referred earlier to the work of the foreign minister. One of the things that we should bear in mind is that the government has not only created structures within Australia, but it has created structures for Australia outside of Australia. It has done this with the development of APEC as the primary organisatIon outside of the GATT to look at issues of trade, trade development and trade facilitation in the Asia-Pacific area. It has now succeeded in having that body meet at a leadership level, at a heads of government level. It is meeting again in November this year in Indonesia. I should think that, in the annals of Australian foreign policy, that is a pretty reasonable achievement for this country. I also refer to that historic piece of property and cultural legislation, that is, the Native Title Act-the Mabo legislation""':""""which has overturned the lie of terra nullius, righted a wrong, and done iUn such a way as to make this country. feel better about itself in giving indigenous Australians the justice they should always have had. It has come late, but better late than never, in the form of a very highly principled piece of legislation. The government has also seen the presentation of the green paper on unemployment. It is now considering that and acting upori that to see it become a white paper so that we can do in this country something which is important, creative and permanent about the problems of the long-term unemployed, that is, deal with the problems of the social inequity and the loss to national efficiency from having a pool of unemployed persons. The government has put through the parliament very far-reaching and. constructive, innovative industrial relations legislation, as a consequence of which we will see far more flexibility in enterprises around this country. All this has been done in the last year, including the legislation and payment of the tax cuts, including the home child.:.care rebate, and including the generalised rebate for childcare expenses, as promised by.the government in the election campaign. The process of reform is. continuing with the renewal of the program of reform which the government has both announced and is working on. This builds on the first decade of the government's work and, in bald terms, we can find it by reference to the economic indicators publish- each week in the Economist magazine. In the week the Australian dollar was floated on 17 December 1983, Australia's growth rate for the year was the lowest in the developed world. It was minus 3.9 per cent. Today, by contrast-as stated in the same magazine-it is the highest in the world, at four per cent. The survey of economic forecasters in last week's Economist predicted that it would stay the highest. Mr Downer-It is slower than New Zealand- You are pathetic.· .",77
83,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mayo has had about 16 minutes of the half-hour of question time.,78
84,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"':He is an enthusiast, Mr Acting Speaker. You have to admit that. In December 1983, the Australian inflation rate was amongst the highest in the world; today it is amongst the lowest. We have had a great change in the last decade.· As I said, it is the best conjunction in 30 years. On foreign debt, our debt service component-'-the component of our exports servieing our foreign debt-hasfallen from 21 per cent in the mid-1980s to 11 per cent today. That is what has happened to it. We have seen nothing of policy in the last year from the other side. We had Malcolm Fraser say, I thought damningly, of the opposition: Twelve months since the loss of the March 1993 election, we are as ·much in the dark about what the party stands for as we Were the day Fightback was buried. There is· no policy. There are no' positive suggestions. Leadership problems on the other side of the House are deflecting the opposition from considering the society, its economy or how it might .relate to the contemporary issues of Australians. And all we have seen in by-elections in the last month or two is a constant drift either away from the Liberal Party or, with the most modest of changes, towards it""'-:nothing sufficient in a real contest. It is nothing that, if you started the gun on a general election, would not evaporate in the first 24 hours. . Yesterday, of course, we had the high point of the opposition concentrating on my dog at the Lodge. We had the high point of whether we had the back vestibule heated or not, or whether the publk purse was carrying the cost of the dog's food-which it is not, I might say. As.I said, that matter was first raised a couple oLmonths ago. The people on the gates at the 'Lodge frequently mention that a person with ash<;>ck of grey hair is continuing to rifle through' the Lodge garbage cans and is continuing to hand out little press statements as a consequence. I round up on this point: the government's record in the last year, a record of change in one year-I sat here for 14 years of coalition govequnent-is more than we would see from a coalition government in· over a decade, in over nearly 20 years. As we go on into this year and the balance of this term of bur office; with this huge and important change in policy, we will be continuing that reform agenda with pride-with pride in our accomplishment and with hope and expectation for the Australian people while we are doing it. Prime Minister",78
85,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister with regard to his responsibility in the area of potential ministerial conflict. The Prime Minister will remember that the important Danish company Danpork issued a press release in August 1991 in which it announced an international investment in Australia on a joint venture basis 'with local, financially strong meat wholesalers and pig producers'. Is it a fact that what it got as a partner was a loss making, undercapitalised, late reporting, inefficient, polluting, financial failure half-owned by the Prime Minister of this country? What it got was the Prime Minister and his halfowned Brown and Hatton group, which is broke. Furthermore, is it a fact that the Prime Minister has a partner who is under a huge clpud? Are these the reasons why the Prime Minister is now attempting to bail out of this insolvent mess, whereas a fortnight ago he was telling us what a wonderful investment it was? Or is it that he now acknowledges on this matter, at last, that there is Ii conflict between his private interests and the performance of his public duties? Mr KEATING'-See what I mean about the Lodge garbage cans and the dog in the corridor. It is just Ii different sort of political canine over here· with this. sort of question. Firstly, this business, as Senator Baunie continues. to claim, does not have negative assets. He seeks to do consolidations of the accounts, which he cannot do, because they are not consolidated. As to the inter-company loans, he counted them all twice. It is all wrong. The joint venture, which I put together with a colleague of mine back in 1991 when I was on the back bench, believing then that I would not assume the office of leader of my partyOppositionmembers-Oh! Ha, hal",79

88,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Wait for it.,79
89,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Those on my left will come to order. MrKEATING-It was to bring to this country a brand new industry-an industry it does not currently have. I should have thought that members of the coalition, both of the Liberal Party and especially the National Party-which prides itself on seeing, it says, the development of rural industry-would like to marry the comparative advantage of the Australian pig industry with the high technology of the world leaders. I should not imagine there was a problem with that. The honourable gentleman seems to know so much, but he does not know that I disposed of my interest in this business nearly two weeks ago. He does not know that, but I am telling him. Let me. tell you, Mr Acting Speaker: I was not going to subject the partners in that business""'-that is, the pork industry of the nation of Denmark; the two industrial companies which sit on the huge cooperatives of farmers that sit beneath it-to the unprincipled taunts of an unprincipled opposition in the House of Representatives and the Senate, which are affecting the business, its prospects, and all of the other questions· which come along. It is a gross indictment of the opposition that it has baselessly attacked a primary industry and a primary industry development consistently in the Senate now for 22 months-particularly at the hands of Senator Baume-and now latterly in the House of Representatives. The Leader of the Opposition is neither brave enough to order his troops out of the gutter nor courageous enough to get down there to do the dirty work himself. The fact is that he does not mind what benefit he can draw from it, as long as his own hands do not get dirty from it. One of the people who has greater interests in the pastoral industry than. anyone in the parliament, and who knows himself the value of seeing these industries developed and the markets of South-East and north-east Asia exploited, has asked the questions. Is it any wonder that the newspaper, the Land, wrote this piece a week or two ago about the opposition, titled 'Wallowing in mud'. It says: Voters have every tight to ask what it is that the coalition, supposedly the ideological stronghol- of free enterprise, finds so distasteful about Minister having an interest in a commercIal pIg meat business. I can only add to that the absolute humbug and double standards of the Leader of the National Party in attacking this project when he has, in his own electorate, a piggery five times the size that this one will eventually be; that is, it is currently eight times the size of the current business-halfthe distance from the city of Corowa. It just shows the complete hypocrisy of the opposition. Mobile Telephone Transmission Towers",79
90,Mr CHYNOWETH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Has the minister's attention been drawn to the concerns raised by many citizens regarding the construction of mobile telephone transmission towers? Can the - iI1ister inform the House whether the mobtle telephone companies-Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone-have to carry out environmental impact statements or community consultations before construction on the site begins? Are there guidelines or a code of practice in place that must be followed before these towers can be erected? If not, when would such guidelines be established and implemented?",80
91,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure the honourable member for Dunkley that, yes, I am aware that some people, some local councils and communities have expressed concern about the sites for proposed towers for mobile telecommunications antennae-not least because the honourable member made a speech or two in this House and has let my office know his views on this particular issue. The honourable member's concerns are mainly directed to the proposed tower at Mount Eliza, but I know it is an issue that he is going to take a keen interest in. All three carriers-Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone-have been granted exemption from certain state and territory laws for specified activities, and those activitie- .include the construction of towers for provtdmg new antennae for mobile telecommunications. The parliament provided these exemptions because we believe it is important that we roll out that mobile telephone network as soon as a. Prl-e possible to provide a competitive mobile telecommunications market for Australians. When carrying out these exempt activities all three carriers are bound by the provisions of the draft telecommunications national code, which was determined in December 1991. Under that code the carriers are required to notify local councils of their proposals, with full details, and to provide the local councils with an opportunity to comment. The co-e also requires the carriers to assess the enVIronmental significance of their activities and, in addition, they must inform CEPA-the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency-if any of the proposals are considered to be environmentally significant. If members of the public think that there has been a breach of the code then they have the right to go to Austel and Austel can direct the carrier to take the matter up with CEPA, which will have a certain period to investigate the proposal. If necessary, carriers can be required to comply with any recommendations. which CEPA may believe are necessary. In connection with the proposed tower at Mount Eliza I understand that that is now before CEPA for its consideration. I can inform the honourable member that the revised final code is expected to be tabled in the House in the budget sittings. Wool MrANDERSON-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. With the government's $20 million annual contribution to wool promotion due to expire by the end of June this year, why is it that the 'government has so far failed to develop the Australian trade and investment packages, otherwise known as ATIP, .which were recommended by the·Garnaut wool report, hailed by the government-and, in particular, by. the then minister, Mr Crean-as the alternative and qetter way to promote wool .usage in developing countries?",80
92,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his congratulations on the previous minister's contribution to this industry. As he does out,the $75 million that the government has contributed to the wool industry expires, I think, on 30 June this year.

96,Mr GORMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Will the Assistant Treasurer explain how newsagents will be affected by the adoption of the recommendations of the Hilmer report into competition policy? Is it true that the assets of newsagents are threatened?,81
97,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I start by pointing out to the honourable member for Greenway that newsagent distribution arrangements are already covered by the Trade Practices Act and; as he would know, the act allows for authorisation for anti-competitive conduct where there is an overriding public benefit. In the early 1980s the Trade Practices Commission authorised a territorial monopoly for newsagents-that is, a discrete area where newsagents had the monopoly to distribute· papers, books and magazines. It did so because the newsagents argued on public' benefit that they could guarantee the delivery of newspapers. The Hilmer recommendations retain that authorisation process where a public benefit can be shown. But times have changed. Even before the Hilmer recommendations are implemented, here in the ACT the Canberra Times has gone point on a very aggressive campaign for direct home delivery offering consumers a $100 saving per year if it can deliver their papers. This has been matched by newsagents themselves who have cut their costs in a bid to retain the business of customers. In Victoria aU parties to the Victorian distribution system have sought a new authorisation which will free up the system, and that has been granted. But appeals against this new authorisation have been lodged with the Trade Practices Tribuna1. On the one hand, we have convenience stores arguing that the new authorisation does not go far enough and, on the other hand, we have Queensland newsagents saying that there should be no change, because they believe that any reform in Victoria will travel up to Queensland eventually. I point out to the House that this is now a matter for the tribunal, but there is nothing in the Hilmer report that wi11 affect newsagents because they are already covered By the Trade Practices Act. I can say that their businesses and their assets are not threatened by the Hilmer reforms. Instead, it is in the areas that are not currently covered by the Trade Practices Act where· there is the potential for cheaper prices and improved services which will flow from those reforms. I believe that . will be good news for consumers, good news for industry and, ultimately, good news for Australia. Australian National Audit Office",81

99,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ah, here he is!",81
100,Mr CONNOLLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Don't worry; my question is not for you. My question is directedto the Minister for Finance. Is it a fact that the inquiry into Centenary House, announced on 20 February last, has not started because the inquirers, Messrs MCPherson and Boymal, have not been given specific powers to examine witnesses within and outside the Public Service, to compel them to. answer questions, to subpoena documents and to take evidence under privilege? Will the government give the inquiry these powers in order that the question of the future of the audit office and its lease of Centenary House, which is owned by the ALP, can be resolved?",81
101,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I understand it, the Auditor-General is conducting discussions with Mr MCPherson and Mr Boymal on the terms of the conduct of the inquiry. As the honourable member would know, the powers that he described are available to Mr Boymal through his role as the Auditor's auditor, if you like. That gives him ample powers to conduct the affairs that the honourable member described. This is obviously an inquiry which we want to see getting under way as rapidly as possible. We have absolutely no problems with this inquiry at all-none whatsoever. We have absolutely no concerns about the outcome of this inquiry. We want to see this inquiry getting under way as soon as possible. I hope that there will be a capacity for the Auditor General to resolve these issues with the two inquirers over the next little confidence Jhat he is capable of doing so. Were that not to be the case, those opposite can be assured that we would absolutely want to ensure that an effective inquiry which is capable of discerning the issues involved here, without becoming absolutely absurd about its conduct, will take place. At the moment, however, we are prepared to see that proceed on the basis of the initiative of the Auditor General himself and what he is able to arrange in that regard with Mr MCPherson and Mr Boymal, who, as I said, have all the powers that the honourable member described. Asia: Business Activity",82
102,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Special Minister of State. Is the minister aware of statements that no-one outside Australia took seriously the view that establishing regional headquarters in Australia offered a central path to Asia? What is his response to that proposition?,82
103,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for his question. I am aware of the statement which was reportedly made by an influential journalist at the economists' round table being conducted with the government at the Hyatt Hotel. The journalist is no doubt speaking from his personal experience, but I must say that his impressions certainly do not accord with the facts as I know them. What we are talking about here is multinational corporations interested in doing business in the rapidly growing Asian market from headquarters in Australia. Last September I launched a government campaign under the banner, 'Australia: your business location in Asia'. That campaign has excited a great deal of interest, both in the Australian business community and with multinationals. Perhaps the best way to put the issue into perspective is to let the record to date speak for itself. Already 60 multinational corporations· have established their headquarters in Australia and are servicing markets throughout Asia. They are all very significant companies and their decision clearly demonstrates that someone seriously holds the view that Australia offers a central while, and I have path to Asia. In recent months, another 14 multinationals have indicated their decision to relocate their headquarters here, confirming that the campaign is paying dividends. The government has targeted over 600 companies in North America and Europe and opened up negotiations with them about regional headquarters. Only 57 have indicated that they were not interested and contact continues with the rest. About 100 have expressed a very high level of interest in coming to Australia, and naturally we are concentrating our efforts on them. I have been particularly heartened by the support the government has been offered by Australia's business leaders in this campaign. For example, late last year a regional headquarters leaders' network was established with 20 of Australia's chief executives, including leading figures from the opposition of the past, those ex-cutive,s forming an alliance promote Australia as a regional headquarters destination. These busy executives. are not that indeed. about wasting 'their time and they obviously agree that Australia is a competitive alternafurther tiveto investment destinations such as Hong Paper. Konir or Singapore. . I think the government campaign emphasises the many reasons why Australia. does represent. a springboard into, Asia. The spoJ)se to date - onvinces us. that the rest of seat. the world is beginning toreaIise the truth of that proposition. I only hope that the oppositionwould al-o realise that that proposition is true and get behind this call1paign and support it. In the past, the opposition has opposed government's measures in regard to regional headquarters. I now understand, however, that there has been a breach-Mr Downer--Such as? Which ones?

113,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism)-by leave-Honourable members will recall allegations made in January this year that Telecom had monitored and recorded telephone conversations of certain customers without their consent. These relate primarily to customers known as COT-casualties of Telecom-cases. Honourable members will also recall that, when I first became aware of these very serious allegations in January, I immediately made clear the gravity with which the government views any such breach of customer privacy. I immediately wrote to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) asking that he investigate whether a breach of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act had occurred, and he in tum referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police. Since that time, in answer to many inquiries from members and senators from all parties, I have undertaken to provide information to the parliament once the police investigation was completed. The purpose of my brief statement today is to honour my commitment to report progress in this matter before the House breaks for its recess, even though police inquiries are continuing. While it is not appropriate for me to comment on what progress the police have made to date, I am pleased to be able to report that my colleague the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has informed me that Telecom is cooperating fully with the extensive investigation being undertaken. Other inquiries relating to these allegations are also outstanding. Telecom is conducting its own internal disciplinary investigations, Austel is investigating the general service complaints of COT customers against Telecom, the financial claims of COT customers are being dealt with by an independent arbitration process conducted under the auspices of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and, at my request, the Attorney General has directed that the current legislation be examined to determine whether amendments are necessary to limit the breadth of the exemption given to carrier employees intercepting telephone calls in the course of their duties. Clearly, it would be inappropriate for me to traverse any of these areas while they are still the subject of further inquiry and examination, but I can assure honourable members that I will report back to the House once they are finalised. In the meantime, however, I can inform honourable members that steps are already being taken by Telecom to ensure that customer service is improved and customer privacy more fully protected. On the more general area of customer service, Telecom has already responded to the report of the independent consultant, Coopers and Lybrand, on fault reporting and complaints handling received in November last year. Steps taken include new procedures for fault diagnosis and rectification; improved customer complaint procedures; a system of management review of complaints and fault actions, oversighted by a national customer response unit; and wider dissemination of information to customers on how to contact Telecom about complaints and faults. These new procedures will be implemented progressively over the rest of 1994 and are expected to be in place by 31 December. On the specific issue of customer privacy, at my request Telecom has undertaken a thorough examination of what action needs to be taken to prevent any future breaches of customer privacy when voice monitoring of customer calls is undertaken. I am pleased to report that Telecom has prepared a revised privacy protection policy and revised guidelines for voice monitoring of customer calls. These documents are currently being reviewed by the Commonwealth Privacy Commissioner aqd the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman prior to their finalisation and implementation .. Before outlining what is proposed under these new policy guidelines, it is important to acknowledge the necessity for telecommunications carriers to be able to monitor customer lines to conduct their business properly, to provide quality service to customers. It is also important to note that in the vast majority of cases inquiries into service quality and difficulties either do not involve monitoring of customer voices at all or involve only 'incidental' listening across customer lines which takes place for no more than a few seconds. To put it into perspective, Telecom conducts more than four million tests a year in response to customer requests which involve incidental listening. These tests simply involve cutting across the telephone line to check whether a line is engaged before testing to determine the location and· nature of the fault: for example, whether a line is crossed or the reason for no dial tone or noisy lines. In some of these cases, the customer call analysis system might also be subsequently used to monitor technical features of the call, but not voices. While these testing procedures are, of course, also subject to statutory control and strict privacy guidelines, they are not those to which the current allegations relate and they are not those I am addressing today. The new guidelines will riot apply to voice monitoring for law enforcement purposes, which require warrants authorised by a Federal Court judge, or to the maritime service and calls to the emergency services, all of which are dealt with separately. The cases which led to the allegations currently under investigation involve instances where voice monitoring and/or recording of customer conversations has been used to investigate difficult faults and it is to such cases that revised privacy rules will apply. The proposed guidelines acknowledge that, in dealing with service complaints which are difficult to locate, it may be necessary to consider voice monitoring of a customer's line but that before such monitoring takes place the customer's written consent must be obtained. Such consent must be specific to the nature of the activity and the time frame involved. Written approval must first be obtained from a senior authorised Telecom employee who must inform the exchange supervisor in writing that monitoring has been approved and for what time frame and procedure. All equipment used in voice monitoring will carry pip tones at three-second intervals to indicate to both parties to a call that monitoring is taking place. This latter point is particularly important for the privacy protection of the second party to monitored calls; that is, the people whose conversations are monitored while they are talking on the . telephone to customers who have given their consent to the monitoring. There are further more stringent requirements proposed where voice recording, as well as monitoring, is used in the diagnosis and substantiation of faults. The proposed guidelines require that recording will not be permitted except in the following circumstances. If a customer specifically requests Telecom in writing to undertake voice recording to assist in finding faults, the matter must be raised with Telecom's legal department for consideration and approval. Voice recording may only be approved by written sign-off by the chief executive officer, the group managing director of the commercial and consumer division or the group managing director of network and technology, after receiving written advice from Telecom's legal department. Security arrangements covering both physical and privacy aspects will be applied in each case. The period of the recording and the identity of all officers proposed to have access to the recording will need to be documerited as part, of the approval process. Analysis of the recording will be confined to the approved technical analysis and no copies or transcripts the of recorded information are permitted. Finally, all recordings will be required to carry threesecond pip tones and will be erased immediately .on completion of the testing process. I believe it is important that, once finalised, such stringent rules are adopted by all telecommunications carriers in Australia. I shall be pursuing this during the parliamentary recess. Telecom's revised privacy protection policy provides for a regular, independent compliance audit and I will also be urging carriers to adopt a similar requirement. I will also be examining options for further tightening customer privacy safeguards, possibly by inCluding appropriate requirements in telecommunications carrier licences, through legislation or through the introduction of an industry code of practice supervised by an independent authority such as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. In summary, these safeguards will require the written' consent of a customer before any voice monitoring or recording takes place and a three-second pip to protect' the privacy of the second party to the call. I undertake to report back to honourable members and telephone consumers on all of these areas once the outstanding matters have been resolved and the relevant bodies have been consulted. I am optimistic that the development of comprehensive and stringent rules which are transparent to consumers and binding on all carriers can fully restore customer confidence that privacy will be safeguarded while service is maintained and improved.",84
114,Mr SINCLAIR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The statement bytbe Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) is welcome, a:lthough I must admit that on reading through it there seems to be one glaring omission, which I point out to the minister and to Telecom. In my view there should be a record kept of all occasions on which there has been, for one reason or another, a telephone conversation recorded. Obviously there cannot necessarily be the same register around the states, but I would think it would not be difficult, in a central exchange in each state or territory, for to be a list made of those authorised occasions when persons have had their telephone cmlVersationsrecorded. On that could be put the number of the telephone, the duration of the recording and the date and the time so that it is possible for there to be reference back. I do not think there are many people who from time to time have not wondered from the nature of their telephone reception whetha er or not there was somebody else at the end of the line. Quite often I have said,'Hello Paul' - and people would understand why. There are many instances wheri the security and privacy of conversations on the telephone are important such that people do like to·feel that they are not in any way having their private conversations intruded upon. I note that in the new procedures there is a suggestion that there should be approval given for voice monitoring of a customer's line when service complaints require a linesman to intervene. I wish the minister well in that, although I should tell him that the very nature of the way in which the present analog copper wire system works is that a linesman will be able-quite simply, by ,climbing a pole and trying to check faults in the normal course of duty-unexpectedly and not necessarily intentionally to tap into a line. The practice has been that if a linesman is out somewhere he uses that line in order to phone in and report where he is and whether there are crossed wires. That is all in the normal course of maintenance. While I accept that the guidelines the minister has indicated have an advantage, I suggest to him that in the practical day-today operations of linesmen' there inevitably will be some intrusion. I know it is unintentional. I think people have to accept it. The fact that there are guidelines,"" as the minister has promulgated in this place, should provide protection. The third thing that worries me is whether in the natur.e of the changed processes-and, not being an engineer like the minister, I cannot say that I am exactly sure-with fibre optics and the satellite, the same technical procedures will necessarily be possible. For example, my understanding is that fibre optics there carry a large number of messages along a wire. I am not too sure how they are separatedif the wire is picked up at any. point and intruded upon. Again, this unintentional intrusion on a private conversation is something that I suspect it will facilitate. Certainly that is true with the satellite. It is a problem that many of us encounter in our day-today telephone conversations; It is very rarecertainly in the bush, where I live-'-topick up line and not pick up onsomebody's. telephone conversation. I was quite intrigued the other night when ringing a number i- Victoria to pick up a number in Tenterfield, in my own' electorate. }<'or various reasons there are crossed lines.",86
115,Mr KERR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"You are just using your old telephone book, Ian.",86
116,Mr SINCLAIR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"That is quite possible. In the bush it takes some time to get the sort of service to which the honourable member for Denison is accustomed-even in Hobart. I , think there is a problem in unintentional intervention; there is a' problem in crossed lines; and there is a real problem in trying to maintain customer privacy. The processes the minister has outlined seem to make sense. The opposition has no objection to them. The first of the two other matters to which I want to briefly refer is the difficulty as other operators are operating on the telephone network. At the moment, while Austel is the principal competitor, there are a number of other operators, operating on select frequencies in select areas, which will have virtually their own telephone service. Demonstrably, the interventions that this statement refers to are by Telecom. I think it needs to be understood that, as we get more operators, it is possible that there will need to be a recognition by those who operate those other lines that the same restraints will apply to them. I have no doubt that the minister intends that that should be so. The other area is that, as the minister has mentioned, there are legitimate phone-tapping processes and procedures undertaken by warrant. I am interested that the new guidelines apparently require warrants authorised by a Federal Court judge for cans to the maritime service and the emergency services. They are all dealt with separately. At one stage there were warrants issued by supreme courts exercising federal jurisdiction. I presume that this is still so. I think it is important that it is' understood that there is a range of people-for example, customs and migration-who have a capacity for law enforcement purposes, with the authority of a court order, to monitor telephone conversations. It needs to be understood that those conditions will apply. Having been a minister in this field, I am not too sure that I have ever been completely happy that these were completely accurately recorded. I know that there is a great deal of interfactional jealousy between law enforcing agencies in Australia, but I believe it is important that there again be a central register of those cases where there is an official warrant to intercept telephone calls. Obviously, because of their very nature, it is important that they be kept in a secure way. I would think it might be appropriate that that responsibility be given to a registrar of the Federal Court, because that court would have a register of any warrants that are issued. It may well be that it should be a person within the domain of one of the law officers of this place-be it the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice-who keeps that register. It is important, not just at the time when the intervention takes place but subsequently, that there is an exact record, and one that can be believed, of where and when it happened. Having been fairly actively involved as a minister in the field, I am worried that there have been occasions when I have not known that the recording of those official interceptions 'Yas as good as it might be. I think it needs to be looked at. While the opposition supports the statement by the minister, I hope theminister might take on board and pursue those other dimensions. I thank him for nodding his head in affirmation. Terrorism: Review of Law Enforcements",87
117,Mr KERR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The government and the overwhelming majority of Australians were greatly disturbed by the violent attack upon the premises of the Iranian Embassy in Canberra on 6 April 1992 in which the chancellery was vandalised and members of the staff were assaulted. ,The attack was one of a number of incidents carried out against Iranian missions in several countries. Such incidents undermine one of the basic premises of civilised international relations-that diplomatic missions will be protected from intrusion and violence. It is most regrettable that an incident like this could occur in Australia. The Australian government has apologised to the government of Iran for the attack upon its embassy and has paid compensation for the injuries and damage which occurred. Law enforcement agencies acted very quickly after the incident to make arrests. As honourable members will be aware, a number of persons were recently convicted over the incident. Following the incident, however, the government was concerned that the responsible Australian authorities had failed to come to grips with prior indications that an attack upon the Iranian Embassy was possible. The Canberra incident occurred several hours after attacks overseas and after the Iranian Embassy notified Australian officials that the embassy staff had received threatening phone calls. ,Ministers acted immediately to direct departments and agencies to take steps to improve their internal procedures. III addition, the government commissioned Mr Michael Codd, a former secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to carry out a ftdl and searching examination of plans and arrangements to counter terrorism, including the security of foreign diplomatic and consular missions. ' Mr Codd found that Australia has invested considerable effort and resources into arrangements for countering politically motivated violence and that a commendable degree of cooperation has been achieved between 1992 Commonwealth and state agencies. But Mr Codd also concluded there were serious weaknesses'in Commonwealth arrangements for the period prior to the commencement of the incident-that is to say in the area of journed. prevention. Mr Codd made a number of wideranging recommendations to correct weaknesses. The critical elements of Mr Codd's recommendations have been implemented. Arrangements for passing critical information between agencies have been overhauled and responsibilities for determining the need to provide extra guarding for missions under special threat have. been changed. Much has been done to improve our capacity to monitor events overseas and local ,community tions to them. The national anti-terrorist has been reworked to reflect these changes and better address the prevention, of incidents. The ability of agencies to deal with problems occurring outside normal business hours is placesnow regularly tested. . , The Codd review also suggests that the Commonwealth conduct a coordinated review of the distribution of total resources applied to counter-terrorism, politically motivated violence and diplomatic and consular protection functions. The govell1ment will carry out such an examination once other reviews into Commonwealth law' enforcement arrangements already under way are completed; No country is asked, or is able, to guarantee that no act of violence will ever occur against diplomatic or consular missions. But the Commonwealth, in cooperation with the state and 'territory 'governments, must provide a safe environment in which foreign missions can function. There is no hiding from the fact that Australian authorities did not do all they could have done to prevent the attack, upon the Iranian embassy in April 1992. The government believes that the Codd review provides an open and full assessment of the reasons for this failure and that, with the implementation of Mr Codd's recommendations, arrangements for the protection of foreign missions have been significantly improved. I present the following paper: Attack on Iranian Embassy-report, 25 May Motion (by Mr Snowdon) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.

He never sticks around for major matters of debate in this parliament. This is one of the rare days he has come into this parliament. Honourable members will remember that before Senator Richardson became a senator and before he became. a minister he owned a very famous watch. I think, from memory, it was referred to in the Stewart royal commission. It was a rolled gold Rolex watch. Apparently, it was a gift from one of his mates in the New South Wales Labor Party, one Danny Casey, who had a famous business-honourable members might remember it-called Balmain Welding.",88
120,Unknown,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Government members interjecting,89
121,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"These guys on the other side do not like us digging up Senator Richardson's colourful past. It is my view that yesterday Senator Richardson had a look at that watch and decided that time was up. The Keating cabinet is voting with its feet. It is a government that is in terminal decline. A succession of ministers have now voted with their feet. The government is racked with unprecedented instability. If we look back over the last nearly 21/2 years, at the some 15 people who have resigned or left or been forced to go,· we have seen a whole succession of ministers go for a host of reasons. Some of them were forced to resign in disgrace. Some were told to take a walk because they were operating under some cloud or were awaiting the outcome of some inquiry. Others were simply frustrated, bitter and fed up, and gave it away. Senator Richardson became one of those yesterday when he made a decision that he had had enough; the government was in decline; there was no point trying to ·work with the Prime· Minister and his imperial style; . it was time to move on. All we have seen in the last 24 hours is the factions at work trying to divide up the spoils, to see who is going to get what, tearing themselves apart-a government in decline. The Prime Minister, as he did in the parliament today, would have us believe that this is orchestrated, that this is all part of a natural flow. Today he was talking about a government with the imagination, the flair, the verve and the wit to change Australia. It is supposed to be a sort of normal flow going on het:e. We are supposed to be witnessing· generational change. In fact, he calls it 'invigorating generational change'. But of those who have gone, three of the recent departures are younger than the Prime Minister himself. That is not generational change-it is degenerational change. There is no natural change going on here. There is nothing short of a purge taking place. It is not orchestrated. It is about as controlled or planned as a runaway train. They are leaving in droves because they cannot work with. this man and his imperial style. The Prime Minister promised us a touch of excitement. What he has produced is a touch of chaos. Let us look at the ministers who have gone over the last nearly 21/2 years: Blewett, Brown, Button, Duffy, Falin, Hand, Humphreys; Kerin, Simmons, Staples, Tate, Dawkins, Griffiths, Kelly and Richardson-15 in less than 21/2 years. As we saw today, that is not the end it; we have at least two more on the way. Senator Evans is clearly on the way, either to the United Nations or to the High Court. The Prime Minister would not rule out the possibility that Senator Evans was off to the High Court. And poor old Brian Howe sits there knowing that he is about to be removed. The government has· been running the rumours around the gallery that Brian Howe is on his way out and Carmen Lawrence is. on her way into the deputy leadership of the ALP to try to offset, to give some sort of sensitivity to, this megalomaniac we have today as Prime Minister. What we are seeing is an extraordinary and very unhealthy concentration of power in the hands of the Prime Minister, a person who is visibly out of touch, who has lost sight of what matters to the people of Australia. He is now in the process of surrounding himself with yes men. If you want to be a courtier in his court, in the emperor's court, you have to fawn; you have to walk around saying 'Yes, sir; no, sir; three bags full, sir'. There is no . way you can criticise because then you will be on your way out. Look at Senator Richardson-a classic example of one who dared to take on the Prime Minister and stand him to his ground and tell him what was wrong with the way he was running this government. The reason you cannot criticise is that the Prime Minister is incredibly sensitive to criticism. He is so thin-skinned. I was reminded when I was thinking about this today of a wonderful quote by Paddy MCGuiness that summarises the sensitivity of our Prime Minister: His boots-and-all attacks on his critics are the result of his extreme sensitivity, his inability to accept criticism or deflect it, his very thin skin. He questions, however, our proposition that the Prime Minister is an emperor; Paddy MCGuiness thinks the Prime Minister is a princess. He says: He is the original princess who slept on 25 mattresses and still ended up black and blue from the pea underneath. That. is how thin the Prime Minister's skin really is. Why has this alI come about? Why has this all started to happen? Why has the Labor Party come to this? The facts are very simple. This is not a true Labor Party. It is not led by a true Labor man or a true Labor person. I could not summarise it better than the Pryor cartoon today in the Canberra Times, a wonderful summary of the situation. Graham Richardson is dressed in a Mafia-style outfit with a violin case under his arm coming up to the coach, to the royal carriage. Inside is the Prime Minister, with alI his trappings and trinkets and gowns. He has his footmen up on top of the c.arriage and so on, and Graham Richardson says to the Prime Minister, 'Sorry boss, but things just ain't the same no more'. That is dead right. Today's Labor Party is not the Labor Party that people like John Dawkins knew or grew up under. It is not the Labor Party that Neal Blewett, John Kerin, Graham Richardson or Kim Beazley Sr grew up under. This Labor, Party is not in touch with the people of Australia. It is led by a man who has cut himself off from the people. He locks himself up in the Lodge and is visibly out of touch. He is often lost in his own little world, obsessed by the spoils of his office and position. The true believers in all of this have been forgotten. They have been expected to bear the budget that the government' brought down last year. It was a complete breach of faith in the commitments it made at election - time. These people were left to deal with the problems of the one million unemployed. It is not a Labor Party that throws one million people out of work. It cannot call itself a Labor government when it is led by somebody like the Prime Minister. He obviously has no understanding of the hopes and aspirations of the so-called true believers that the government claims to represent. During the recent by-election campaigns, which person was not allowed into the Labor heartlands to any significant extent? Which bloke would they not let in there; who they thought was a major political minus? We are talking about hardcore Labor territory. Labor holds 65 per cent of the vote in these seats. Labor members would not allow the Prime Minister to go there. They do not let him loose anywhere these days. Although the Prime Minister speaks to orchestrated audiences containing a few close Labor mates, we do not see him anywhere. He will not go out and walk down the street. He will not go to the supermarket. He cannot because, as I have said, he is so visibly away and out of touch with the hopes and aspirations of average' Australians. We are not today just focusing on the mutiny that is taking place against the dictatorial style of the Prime Minister. We are also witnessing the incredible damage being done to the policy framework in Australia and the processes of sensible policy. Just look at the case in point; just look at Senator Richardson. He dared to start to argue the case for some reform of the health system. He dared to say that the health system is facing a funding crisis. He dared to go in and tell the Prime Minister the truth to his face. He dared to criticise the existing policy of the government. He dared to go further and point out,that the system is unfair. He said that it is unfair for high income earners like the Prime Minister not to pay more and to take the place of lower income earners in hospital queues, hospital treatment and other aspects of health care. We know what has happened to Senator Graham Richardson. Out he has gone. Out goes anyone who disagrees with the Prime Minister and who is not a yes man. The biggest tragedy of this succession of walkouts that we are seeing is that it· is destroying the framework of sensible policy debate and discussion. Unless people are blatant sycophants of· this man and toe the line on what he says and does, they are better off out of the party. It is· very interesting that we are now expected to accept the argument briefed in the media in the last 24 hours that Laurie Brereton is going to replace Graham Richardson as the key man. He is going to be the key numbers man. Laurie is going to be the guy who pulls the factions together. He will be the one when there is a revolt after the next budget, lik- the last one, who goes in there. Laurie, who reached his absolute zenith on a motorcycle with a ballot box on the back, is going",89
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable leader will refer to ministers by their correct title.,91
123,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"We are told that the Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), is going to be the healer and handle the factions. What an absolute joke! Laurie Brereton is absolutely, without qmilification, the yes man's yes man. If Paul Keating said to him, 'Laurie, go and jump off the gap', he would ask whether he had time to go and get his incubator for. his cigars on the way. But he would go .. Laurie would do exactly what he was told ..",91
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Order! The honourable leader will refer to the minister by his correct title.,91
125,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am sorry, the Minister for Industrial Relations would do exactly as he was told. He reminds me very much of a ventrilOquist's doll that just sits there and never had an original thought or wOl""dofhis own. He is a total sycophant. He is the sort of person who would be least likely to be able to. handle. the factional problems of the ALP. The Minister for Industrial Relations has shirked every fair dinkum ballot that he has ever faced. I am sure that the Minister for Industrial Relations remembers Barry Unsworth. He did not run against Barry Unsworth because he did not have any votes. He will remember when he was going to run against Bob Carr. Mr Costello-He must have had one.",91
126,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"We are not. sure whether he had his own. Apparently, he did not have his sister'S, and they were not sure whether he had his own. This is the man who is going to be the numbers man. This is. the man who is going to look after the Prime' Minister's interests. He was too· spineless to test his standing on either of those two occasions when he was trying to run for the leadership in New South Wales. The Prime Minister is now shoehorning this guy into the team. He would not have got there on his own, he would not have got there on ability and he could not have got there on numbers.·But he is now going to be the one person. who is expected to look after the Prime Minister. The faithful pharaoh 's eunuch is supposed to be the man to keep this mutant caucus in control. That is an incredible and preposterous proposition. A cancer is consuming this government. This cancer is forcing out its best people. The good people in the Labor government of the last few years are starting to leave. They are fed up, bitter and frustrated. They cannot operate in a situation where the Prime Minister basically has nothing to do with them unless they are total sycophants and yes men. Imagine how Graham Richardson must have felt-having been in the inner sanctum of the ALP for so many years, having played a powerbroker role and a numbers .person role and having helped settle factional brawls and disputes-in the last couple of years since the Prime Minister has been in office. He has been increasingly frozen out· of the whole has process. For example, I am told that Graham Richardson had no contact with the Prime Minister in the last election campaign. It is no wonder that he is bitter and frustrated. It is no wonder that he is indicative of the worse feature of this government, which is in terminal decline and is on its way out. Its people know it. As I mentioned before, 15 people have voted with their feet in less than 2112 years. back and think about the Whitlam governplace, ment. It lost only four ministers. In the memread ory of most people, that was an horrific government that was in clear terminal decline. This one has lost 15 ministers in less than years. Two of the key ones who put the Prime Minister where he now is and who supported him through the last 21f2 years-John Dawkins and Graham Richardson-have left by choice because they were fed up and bitt-r. They.left because they know that this government is in terminal decline and that it is going to go nowhere with a Prime Minister that is visibly out of touch with the hopes and greatest aspirations of the average Australian. This Prime Minister runs the job for his own political and personal purposes at the expense of everyone else in this country. That his ministers are leaving, and that is why this government is in terminal decline.",91
127,Mr DEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"That speech was just a mild canter to let people know that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is still here. I love being lectured by the Leader of the. Opposition, who everybody in this chamber knows, including all those who sit behind him, sits where he does for one reason only: the majority of his party, which is against him, cannot agree on a successor. That is why he sits where he does. Everybody in Australian politics knows that, as does everybody on his back bench. The issues, in so far as there are any debate, were amply dispatched by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when the Leader of the Opposition was silly enough to get in his way at question time. The Prime Minister was able ation. to point out that our almost 11 years in office is now four years longer than the time experienced by ex-Fraser ministers. It a very long period in this country in a political atmosthe phere which is far busier than it certainly been at any time since Federation and which will continue to get busier over the years. Political careers get shorter and ministers need renewal far more often than in the past. As a result, changes are likely to take place. Of the list of ministers who have left the Go government since the time it was first put in which the Leader of the Opposition out, virtually all of those ministers left cheerfully and voluntarily after many years of service. After all the things we have heard the 21f2 opposition say about Graham Richardson and John Dawkins over the years and about their role in the management of the Australian economy and their role in Australian politics, was it not wonderful to hear the Leader of the Opposition stand up here and say, 'They are the heart and soul of a once great Labor Party .and obviously left office because suddenly, in so the space of six months, from being the political party ever, the Labor Party has declined to mere dross'. That is the proposition that the opposition leader puts forWard in his desultory argument in his is why absurd matter of public importance. The other reason why he has to let people know that he is still around other than the fact nobody on his side actually wants him around is that he has not really had a terrific set of weeks on the by-election front with either the seats the Liberals are likely to hold or the seats that they failed to win. What has been the performance? A 2112 per cent swing to the government in FremantIe and then moderate level swings in Bonython and in John Kerin's former seat. Let us compare and contrast those results with the results that the opposition was getting during the 1980s-13 per cent, I seem to recollect in one South Australian seat, 11 per cent to win in another case and something like 10 per cent, I recollect, during the leadership of the honourable in this member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). So he has managed to come under by between three and effectively 16 112 per cent the performances in those by-elections in his particular operIt also has to be remembered that, after the quite massive by-election swings in the 1980s, Labor government was subsequently re has turned. None of them actually turned out to be Bass by-elections; they all turned out to be just storms in a teacup. The particular bynow elections that we have had running lately-the bulk of the opposition's frontbenchers are running out of this chamber, before I have been able to explain it to them-provided the opposition in normal circumstances with enormous chances to demonstrate its effectiveness, to take the high ground. Any darned opposition can do that in a by-election, except one wallowing in unbelievable disunity and incompetence. What such an opposition turns in is the performance that the opposition leader has turned in in the last three byelections that I have just mentioned. What a joy those by-elections have been for the government in terms of reaffirmation of direction of government policy at a time when we would not actually expect it---.,well into a term when we have had to do on- or two unpopular things. But, even more than that, what a joy to this government is the acquisition of talent that we have in those three byelections. I cannot remember any string of byelections that has produced such a good crop, leavening the experience and the youth of a party in power, as we have had in those three by-elections. We have had coming in the first of them, in John Kerin's old seat, a very talented person, very experienced in local government, yet very young. He has had the misfortune at one level, arid the opportunity at another level, of serVing as the research officer, albeit later in life, of a very great Prime Minister of this country. He is tremendously versed in the heart arid soul of Labor politics both in the way in which the community has supported him through his life, in his youth and the way in which the community has supported him subsequently as he has come into this chamber. And then we had coming in from South Australia, in the Bonython by-election, a man who has served. that state well as a minister. A man actually capable of winning his seat in the first instance as an Independent-and that is· no mean feat in the context of Australian politics-is now gracing this chamber, leavening us with both experience and proven electoral talent. And then from Western Australia we have a person who actually had a swing to her during this campaign, Carmen Lawrence-the first woman to be a premier of a state in this country has now joined us here in federal parliament. What government could do anything other than review the outcome of those by-elections with joy in terms of what has been added to it and what those by-elections produced by way of results. Mr Bilney-If that's terminal decline, let's have more of it.",92
128,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"If that is terminal decline, as the minister at the table says, give us more. Then we have the opposition's by-election performances. Wha- do we see there? The two characters running are running against the Leader of the Opposition. That is the position of the two candidates in the by-elections for the Liberal held seats in New South Wales. Both candidates have as their principal claim to fame, and the reason for their endorsement, an absolute understanding that they will oppose the Leader of the Opposition when they get in this place. It is not an ancillary; it is why they were endorsed to contest those by-elections. In case we missed the point during these by-election campaigns when even normally the most shabby opponent of an existing party leadership will suspend shabbiness for a moment, for at least an occasional gesture of bonhomie to the party leadership, what do we get from these two candidates in the midst of these by-election campaigns? I am not surprised that the Leader of the Opposition has unusually departed cowardly from this debate",93
129,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Order!,93
130,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I withdraw. He has departed from this debate, UJlUsually for him-he does not usually walk out on a matter of public importance without bothering to hear the reply of the government. But he knew what was coming; he knew that he would have to confront a discussion of these by-elections and of his candidates in them. An article in the Australian Financial Review refers to Mr Abbott, the candidate for Michael MACKellar's old seat. It states: Instead of allowing the party to continue taking damage over the unresolved leadership, he has floated a proposal to carry out in-depth qualitative research to test the main contenders'that is for the Liberal Party leadershipstrengths and weaknesses with swing voters. Mr Abbott feels that this is an issue that he ought to raise in the campaign. 'What we need now is a public opinion poll"" says the candidate for Warringah, 'to determine whether or not we have a decent person on offer for leadership, somebody capable of a bit of public support'. That is unusual. Normally in the course of a by-election campaign we would expect a grand remonstrance against the government of the day from the opposition person in the box seat. But no, we do not get grand remonstrances against the government of the day in this case. What we get from that chap carrying the Liberal Party ,banner is a suggestion as, to how the Liberal Party might determine its leadership over the next few months by a public opinion poll. At least Mr Abbott has the grace to be only a voter in the leadership ballot. What about the other candidate? We actually have a contender in the other case-the case of Bronwyn Bishop. What does she do at this normal opportunity for false bonhomie as a candidate in a by-election? Occasionally she invited the Leader of the Opposition into her electorate in order to humiliate him, to provide opportunities, When the Leader of the Opposition stands up, to studiously ignore him, to make jokes at his expense, to take every opportunity that she can during that election campaign to upstage him. The opposition leader was critical of an alleged failure of the Prime Minister to appear during the election' campaigns in the' byelections I mentioned-which is, of course, complete nonsense; he did appear. But the Leader of the Opposition confronts a situation where the opposition candidates in those seats are determined that if he does appear he should not be regarded as having been there at all except as a butt of jest. In recent days Bronwyn Bishop was invited on Radio 3LO to do her self-denying ordinance a la John Howard",93
131,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Order! The minister will refer to members by their correct title.,94
132,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The honourable member for Bennelong said, 'No, I have not been counting heads for the last 12 months. Of course, I give this chap my loyalty'until the election or whenever' ,yet all of us know that he has been counting heads. It was put to Mrs Bishop on Radio 31.0, 'You have not said that you would give a guarantee as Mt Howard did'. In response, she said: Well Mr Howard obviously felt that was necessary. I have said all along I'm just running for the seat of Mackellar. ' '. , What does Bronwyn Bishop do? She declares her candidacy at some point of time in the future. That is her contribution, her statement of loyalty to the Leader of the Opposition; her gesture of confidence in him during her contribution to the by-election campaign. So we confront this. I must say this is being treated once over lightly. Neither the Leader of the Opposition nor I have yet indulged in a discussion of the policy issues that are of vital importance to the people of this nation. But, as the person who follows the Leader of the Opposition in this debate, I must follow the standard and position set' by the person who initiated the debate and answer him in his own terms, in which case this discussion will descend quickly into an' undergraduate debate. However, this discussion does offer an opportunity for some pretty useful analysis of the political scene as it now stands. Five byelections in a three-month block is an unusual test for government activity at any particular point. These by-elections have provided or will provide three great results for the Labor Party, including one outstanding result, and two opportunities for people who would be traitors-they are standing up to the leader'ship, anyway-to 'present themselves. What willthey get when they get here? A couplein attitudinal tel1Tls, as the Prime Minister said-of fogeys, old and young. We have an old fogey in the case of a senator who rarely had the confidence of ,her senatorial colleagues, who had to have people stand aside for her in order for her to get onto Senate committees because she could'not win ballots for them, and a young fogey in the case of the would be member for Warringah, who comes into this place with a set of attitudes which were out-of-date for conservatives at the time of Federation, let alone at this particular point.' .i It is small wonder that we have people like the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) wandering around allowing himself to be portrayed in the Border Watch in his electorate. He has given his second indication of discontent with the poor per.fotmance of the Leader of the Opposition. The .Border Watch reported the honourable member talking about unemployment, but he did not seem to get the point across. He said that the federal coalition had to have someone leading it who had the confidence of the public. I would have thought that was automatic in his mind as far as his leader was concerned. He said that he 'entered federal parliament to be in government, not in oppositipn for a term or two'. He refused, in the context of a question, to speculate on his future within the. Liberal Party. If ever there was a statement indicating 'I am, deserting a particular political party because I have lost confidence in the leadership', which is cer.: tainly not a position which applies to Senator Richardson or John Dawkins, that was it. The only propositions I have seen in recent times by anyone foreshadowing the Leader of the Opposition's demise because of lack of confidence in his leadership has come from an opposition frontbencher, that being the honourable member for Barker. He says, 'I didn't really mean to hang around in this damn place. If this damn fool can't get me into government, I'm off-or I will find somebody who can'. This is a ridiculous MPI given where it has come from. (TIme expired) Mr TIM FlSCHER(Farrer-Leader of the NaiionalParty of Australia) (4.53 p.m-)-The House is. considering as a. matter of public importance the damage caused to good government, and indeed to. the nation, and to economic recovery by the instability of the Keating ministry. The Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) has a very short memory, because I just happen to recall the day the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) revealed the Kirribilli delil in. the corridors of the parliatelevision a ment just couple of years ago. The Kirribilli deal, the shabbiest d-al of all time in Australian politics, was a secret deal for the succession of the Prime Minister of the day. Two politicians and two non-politicians stitched up the Kirribilli House deal in disgusting circumstances and never revealed it to the public at any stage. This minister wore all the traits of someone in real political trauma when I stumbled across him on the very day that shabby deal was revealed. This minister really ought to do his homework on those by-election results. Bonython was no rosy picture for the government; Fremantle has, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) correctly pointed out, the special ingredient of one Dr Carmen Lawrence-more of her later and her role in regard to WA Inc.",94
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I know you will use her correct title when you do.,95
134,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The honourable member for Fremantle. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was elected to the chamber despite a very sharp swing against the Labor Party. There are two more by-elections to come. I say of Tony Abbott, a Rhodes scholar: do not underestimate him. The government does so at its peril. I say of former Senator Bronwyn Bishop: she won a Senate seat twice, which is no mean achievement in the largest state of the Commonwealth. This matter of public importance comes about thtough the resignation of one Graham Richardson, who I can at this hour refer to as Graham Richardson. He is responsible for the creation of the cruel parody of a leader in Prime Minister Keating-a monster beyond the control of his party, the parliament or the people. That is the real tragedy of today. That is the real tragedy of Richardson's resignation. That is the real tragedy of this arrogant government, which, as the Leader of the Opposition correc;tly says, is now in terminal decline. Perhaps the most prophetic words Senator Richardson uttered were recorded on the program Labor in power: He said: Keating has more power in the Labor Party than Bob Hawke ever dreamed of having-and that too will affect him I suppose. There is the nub of it. It did affect him, in the way that absolute power does affect people. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. It feeds the monster. It feeds the arrogance. It feeds the insularity. It feeds the insufferable ego of . the Prime Minister of this day. The result is the resignation of Senator Richardson on this day. Richardson is the man who said of the Prime Minister: He has the capacity to make ministers cower him . . . He can bruise not just the ego but the spirit and that's when he goes too far and he occasionally does. Again, how prophetic did that turn out to be. Here was a minister trying to take on the Prime Minister, trying to make him see some sort of sense in the health debate, trying to make some common sense of a health policy which sees 422 country towns without a doctor as I speak this day. We have a Prime Minister who simply is out of touch-in. an isolated capsule, in a cocoon, a long way removed from the average person of Bankstown or even of Banks and the communities in those areas. The matter under discussion is the resignation of one Senator Graham Richardson-the fourth minister in four months, the 15th minister since the honourable member for Blaxland became Prime Minister. For the good governance of this country we need stability. There is a problem because as today's Age said: The toll of talent and experience now flowing out of the Labor ranks ... begs the question of when regeneration turns to rout. So let us have a look at the latest four resignations: Dawkins, run out; Griffiths, caught out; Kelly, bowled out and Richardson, burnt out. Senator Evans will soon be off to the High Court and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) is, of course, on a very fine gossamer thread, just hanging in there as the Left goes into caucus after caucus. We know the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) looked at the deal to trade off the Deputy Prime Minister for certain other gains. He stopped just short of it this time. The Deputy Prime Minister is hanging by the finest of gossamer threads-no comfort for the Deputy Prime Minister because the clock is ticking; the time for the tap on the shoulder is coming. The problem with all of this is that,. rather than having a fulsome debate in the cabinet room, rather than having a government coming .to grips· with divergent views, we are going to have a mealy-mouthed mob of sycophants. Who now will sit around the cabinet table and dare to look at the Prime before Minister eye to eye arid say, 'No, Prime Minister', from time to time when that has to be done. The native bird prints on the cabinet room walls should be removed and replaced by pictures of pigeons, because tame pigeons are wh-t the Prime Minister wants in his cabinet room-all sitting there cooing together; all cooing their reassuring 'Yes, Prime Minister; three bags full, Prime Minister. You are so wise, Prime Minister; you are so noble, Prime Minister'. It all means lousy government for the people of Australia-lousy government for those missing out on the economic recovery and for the families of Australia in this International Year of the Family. All of these ministerial pigeons fluttering out of the cabinet room will have little messages from the Prime Minister tied to their legs and nothing at all between their ears except a homing instinct of loyalty to the Prime Minister. Anyone who dares to fly his own idea will, like the now ex-Senator Richardson who was stabbed on the floor of the Senate 2,038 years and eight days after Julius Caesar got it on the floor of another Senate, be shot down. Senator Richardson's fatal mistake was to attempt to do his job properly. Is this a government with an energetic cabinet? No way. Is this a government with stability in key portfolios such as trade? No way. Is this a government with a cabinet that will stand up to a Prime Minister out of control? No way. Is this a government with a leader we can trust? No way. We have a tyrant emperor. Before all the stories are written about a possible reshuffle, one other issue should be borne in mind which will reflect very badly on the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the ex-Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, and the honourable member for Fremantle. I refer to a sham deal involving $8 million of taxpayers' money and political corruption at the highest levels.· My colleague Senator Grant Tambling has done a lot of work on this issue, which revolves around the approval in August 1992 from One Nation road funding of $8 million for the Subiaco Oval-a project in the electorate of the then Western Australian state Premier, now the honourable member for Fremantle. Some questions need to be answered about this matter. Firstly, did the former federal Treasurer reveal his personal links with the Western Australian football fraternity when he took part in the backroom deals involved in the $8 million deal? Secondly, will the government order an inquiry into Mr Dawkins's conduct if, as is widely rumoured,· he is appointed to either the Western Australian football commission or the Fremantle AFL club? Mr .Melham - Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order relating to relevance. The Leader of the National Party should know better. If he wants to cast aspersions against a m-mber of this parliament, then there are procedures under the standing orders for him to deal with it in a substantive fashion, and ask you to bring him to order.",95
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Mr Newell)'The discussion on the matter of public importance sometimes ranges very widely. I ask the honourable member for Farrer to get back to the topic at hand.,97
136,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I will comply with your ruling and just say that a certain odour exists in relation to the Subiaco Oval. There are questions that should be answered. There should be an investigation into the nature of secret discussions between Mr Dawkins, Dr Lawrence and Mr David Hatt-the author of the Hatt report. The question of $8 million of road funding being allocated.to Subiaco Oval is· relevant to all that is being deliberated on. As to the instability of this government, there have been four· resignations in four months. The government has much to answer for. The people of Australia are. missing out on the desirable stability of government, the leadership of government. and the absolute requirement of stability in key portfolios as trade where we have had several ministers in a short period and the loss of contacts. We have had a trade minister who never went to the Middle East at any stage during that period. That is why J support the matter of public importance.",97
137,Mr MELHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The performance by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia e Mr Tim Fischer) is ample evidence of why this government has been returned at five successive elections and will be returned a sixth ·time. A couple of minutes ago I witnessed the Leader of the Opposition walk in and read a document. I then saw it read out verbatim by the Leader of the National Party in this MPI debate in which what he has said has been of little relevance. Those opposite are in opposition because they are of little relevance to the electorate and to the people of Australia, and they. have been for the last decade. That is why Labor has been returned election after election for the past decade. Today is a significant day because it marks the fourth anniversary of my election to the I parliament-24 March 1990.. It is also significant in that, when the results of the two byelections on the weekend are counted, in just over four years 59 new members will have been elected to the House of Representatives-almost a 40. per cent turnover in the House in such a short time. Politics has changed. The first member for Banks, the late Eric Costa, who served from 1949 till 196920. years-did not sit on the government benches. He served his whole period in opposition. The second member for Banks, Vince Martin, served for 10 years and served for only three out of his 10 years in the Whitlam government. I have known only government since I have been the member for Banks. The way the opposition is going, I will know. only government in the next decade. Opposition members are giving it to us on a plate. One of the things that we have managed to. do successfully as a party in government, which has not been easy, is to regenerate .and produce quality members of parliasuch ment-witnessed by the results of the last couple of by-elections. The election of Dr Lawrence in Fremantle was a superb result. The by-elections in Bonython and Wen:iwa were exceptional results as far as by-elections go. The members are. all ministerial. material-all quality candIdates. That IS what frightens the opposition. That is why it is so desperate to replace the current Lea-er of the Opposition, who is on borrowed hme. The only reason he survived so long is .h-s shadow ministry. There are 37 shadow mtolsters and it is an interchange bench. Those opposite talk about the damage caused to good government by the instability of the Keating ministry. Out of 37 members in the shadow ministry-the alternative government-what do we have? Only three have ministerial experience: the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). That is not regeneration; it is recycling. The honourable member for Bennelong recently gave an undertaking that he would not challenge the current Leader of the Opp-­ sition in the life of this parliament. That IS okay. We will help him honour that undertaking. We will make sure that he can challenge the Leader of the Opposition in the next parliament. Those opposite are helping us by the way they are carrying on .. The greatest asset this government has is the opposition-a leaderless rabble. . What happens in a by-election campaign when the candidate is Tony Abbott, who preaches loyalty to the party and loyalty to the leader? His solution to overcome the leadership log jam in the opposition appears in an article entitled' Abbott's modest proposal for peace', which appeared in the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday, 23 March: Liberal parliamentary aspirant Tony Abbott has a bright idea. . Worried about the continuing leadership in his parliamentary party, Mr Abbott thinks he may have the answer to the problem. With the party room frozen over who should be leader Mr Abbott-a former personal adviser to Dr Hew-n who is standing for Saturday's by-election in the safe Liberal Sydney seat of Warringah-has come up with the ultimate back-room idea for sorting out the leadership . . . he has floated a proposal to carry out in-depth qualitative research to test the main contenders' strengths and weaknesses with swing voters. Mr Abbott has told his friends the research could be the way to break the federal Liberals' ""Ieadership log jam"". The results of the proposed exhaustive exploration of each contender's perceived strengths and weaknesses would be put to Liberal MPs to help. their deliberations. I have something to assist Mr Abbott's survey. He should add a square that states 'none of the above', because it would win by a country mile. The reality is that the Liberal Party does not have its future leader in this place at this time. That is. why the dogs a-e barking. Some people mIght hope that, If Bronwyn Bishop wins the by-election, she will be Carlton's revenge. That will be his legacy to the Liberal Party and his leader who dumped him. He resigned to enable former Senator Bishop to transfer to the lower house to complete the destabilisation campaign. It is all show and, frankly, no punch. . For the opposition to bring on an MPI on this day, the fourth anniversary of the government's 1990 election vict<;>ry,. is. such an act of hypocrisy, when the reahty IS, to the view of most objective observers, that it was the opposition's ineptitude which resulted in the Labor Party winning what many people thought was an 'unwinnable' election-and win it, we did. I must confess I was not one of the true believers. I thought we would have a hard job-and we did. But we won because the Labor Party is the only party that offers the people of Australia a vision and a hope for the future. The Labor Party is regenerating much better than the opposition is. If we go through the statistics of the members of parliament in the lower House predating the 1985 election, we can see t-at only three are left on the government SIde: the turmoil Prime Minister (Mr Keating), 1969; the Treasurer (Mr Willis), 1972; and the honour 1972. On the opposition side there are 15 of them. Those opposite do not regenerate in looking to the future. They regenerate on payback. They regenerate not to assist their party;. they walk away skulking and provide their party not with future leaders but with future destabilisers. I look forward to the other half of Abbott and Costello coming into this parliament because I was at Sydney University in the 1970s and I saw him first-hand. I am not surprised at what he, is doing in his by-election campaign-we ain't seen nothing yet.. It is unbelievable that the Liberal 'Party could be selecting' candidates with those sorts of philosophies and policies and, be saying that it is regenerating and offering us hope for the future. The truth is the exact opposite.· I am noW a true believer and I am convinced that we are going to hit those opposite for six at the next election, providing we get it right. Those opposite are irrelevant. They are so marginalised, they are so far off the political spectrum, that no-one looks at them any more-they look at us. And what do they see? They see regeneration; they see replacement of members of parliament with quality candidates; and they see people being brought through. How have former government members'left? My good friend Gerry Hand; the former minister for immigration, who is listening at this very moment, chose his own retiremen't,as all champions do. Where is he now? He, is on the hill, painting the horse fence. What is his philosophy on life? It is that there is life outside politics-and he has never looked better. That is what is happening on this side of the parliament: ministers are making way for the next generation and they are leaving on good terms. (TIme expired)",97

I suggest therefore that it may suit the convenience of the House to first consider amendments Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 and, when those amendments have been disposed of, to consider amendments Nos 3 and 8, then Nos 2, 4 and the further amendments. Mr Ruddock-There is no objection to that.",101

147,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (5.21 p.m.)The outline I had for the procedures to be followed suggested that the government was accepting Senate amendments Nos 1,5,6,8, 9 and 10, but the document that I now have suggests a different set of numbers. It is now suggested that amendment No. 7 be agreed to; previous advice was that it was not to be accepted. I regret, in a sense, that the government's outline has changed since the time l.was first apprised that the government intended to agree to some of the Senate amendments and to oppose others. If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General (Mr Duncan) would like to make it clear to the House which items are to be accepted and which items are to be disagreed to, perhaps I will be in a better position to debate the proposals.",101
148,Mr DUNCAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"On indulgence, can I say that Senate amendment No. 8 omits part 7 of the bill which relates to the value of assets used in primary production. As I understand it from my advice, that is the clause which the honourable member for Berowra was concerned about.",101
149,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I seek your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker.",101
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Mr NeweIl)Indulgence is granted.,101
151,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"There are two matters. I understood that the government was accept., ing the Senate's amendment in relation to that matter on the basis that it had an opinion that suggested that the amendment was no longer necessary because the government was going to achieve its objectives in other ways. If that is the case, I cannot understand why the government is not prepared to accept the amendment and why it is continuing to press the matter. If I am wrong in relation to that, that is fine. The opposition will press the position we have taken oil this matter. If it does not have the result that we anticipate, so be it, but I cannot understand why, if the government is confident in the advice that it has received-that it will achieve its objective by simply arguing that its original purpose was met in the way in which this clause was first drafted before the amendment that we have rejected-it is not prepared to accept that outcome. Why does it press the amendment? Why does it believe the amendment is essential if it believes that the amendment can be achieved in another way? If that is the issue, as to the view that was formed in the administrative tribunals that borrowings against a property exclude, for instance, a home and the curtilage in relation to that, the opposition is firmly of the opinion that, if the borrowings were undertaken for the' purpose of carrying on a business of primary industry, the whole of those borrowings ought to be subtracted from the value of the principal asset-the income producing asset, the farmless the house and the curtilage. The government wants to apportion the debt. It argues that if a debt is incurred for running a business we ought to apportion it so that part of it is apportioned to the value of the home. The government seeks by that subterfuge to raise the total value of the assets of the farmer gence. that might be taken into account for the purpose of the assets test. Our view in relation to assets testing of rural properties is that the provisions that are there at the moment are unnecessarily harsh and oppressive. That is why we argued before the last election that there should be a change in relation to that assets test.. For that reason we are not prepared to accede to' the government's request that that assets test be made more difficult for farmers to satisfy. I suspect that the reason the government presses this matter is that it is not happy with the advice that it has told me it thinks allows its objective to be achieved. That puts the matter beyond doubt if that is the question that we are debating. But my understanding was-and this is what I came in here - prepared to debate-that the government dirlnot accept another proposition that _the opposition had sought. I seek the parliamentary secretary's clarification in relation to this matter because it may contain the debate. My understanding was that the government was not prepared to accept our-suggestion that, in relation to the issue of the application of' the new penalty interest regime, certain guidelines - that will have to be drafted at some stage in the future to be used for testing people's obligations to pay - a penalty interest ought to be· disallowable instruments, so that the parliament might be able to assess the appropriateness of those guidelines for applying this new penalty interest regime. We in the opposition have put the yiew, and I do not think it was unreasonable, that' if guidelines were to be drafted at some future date they should be referred to in the legislation and the parliament ought to have an opportunity to look at them before they are put in place and become part of the regime that determines this obligation. I welcome the government's concurrence if it has accepted that amendment; that is, that the. guidelines will still be a requirement _and that they will be a disallowable instrument. I seek the parliamentary secretary's chuification.",101
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"--I call the parliamentary secretary, by indul",102
153,Mr DUNCAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The points the honourable member for Berowra (MrRuddock) has raised are interesting but they refer to amendments Nos 3 and 8. I will move in a few moments that·they be disagreed to. We will then have a debate about them. At the present time, I have moved that Senate amendments Nos 1, 5, 6; 7,9 and 10 be agreed to. In other words, we are agreeing with the propositions that were put up in the Senate; Mr Ruddock-And that includes disallowable instruments?",102
154,Mr DUNCAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, it does not. That is No. 3 of the Senate amendments. Mr Ruddock-I thought No. 3 of the Senate amendments dealt with the issue of garnisheeing.",103
155,Mr DUNCAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes, and the recovery of the penalty interest. Mr Ruddock-My understanding is that it was a different issue from the question of a disallowable instrument. I was prepared to accept amendment No. 3 if it was what I understood from the original document we had been furnished. The difficulty I have with this is that the Senate amendments relate to particular clauses and it is not necessarily easy to follow. Unfortunately, I was not given a formal briefing in relation to these matters which might have helped, particularly if there had been changes in relation to the numbering. Is the parliamentary secretary indicating that the issue of the disallowable instrument has been agreed to?",103
156,Mr DUNCAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes. Mr Ruddock-Thank you. Question resolved in the affirmative. MrDUNCAN (Makin-Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (5.33 p.m.)-I move: That Senate amendments Nos 3. and 8 be disagreed to. I will deal with Senate amendment No. 3 first. The government agrees with the principles that the department should use the garnishee power where it can rather than apply penalty interest and that penalty interest should not apply where effective recovery action is in progress under a garnishee notice. However, the amendments as drafted do not appear to achieve these objectives. In particucould lar, the government believes that Senate amendment No.3 is superfluous and that, further, it implies a condition on the use of the garnishee power which does not exist in the act. Section 1233-the garnishee powercontains no requirement to issue another type of notice; namely, a penalty charge notice, prior to a garnishee. If the department has already issued a garnishee notice, the amendment would not stop the department then applying penalty interest as well. The latter argument also applies to paragraph (a) of Senate amendment No.4. Since the government believes that Senate amendment No. 3 is superfluous, it opposes the amendment. Senate amendment No. 8 omits part 7 of the bill, which relates to the value of assets used in primary production. The amendments contained in part 7 were intended. to clarify the original intention and existing policy that, where primary production liabilities are related to primary production assets whose values are partly exempt under section 1U8 of the principal act, only that part of the liabilities relating to the non-exempt assets will be allowed as a deduction under the assets test. The objective of part 7 was merely to clarify the position as a result of the recent decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in the matter of Little. Legal advice received from the Attorney-General's Department confirms that the existing legislation authorises the department's existing treatment of primary production assets. As a result, there is strictly no need to proceed with part 7. However, the government considers that the amendments should be proceeded with so as to clarify the position. That position is strongly recommended by the Attorney-General's Department.",103
157,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I think I now understand precisely what we are doing. I would have preferred in relation to this particular matter-again, if there had been some consultation I might have suggested it-that the two amendments be dealt with separately because the approach which the opposition would take is to accept one and oppose the other. It may be, from the point of view of good order, that the government resubmit the matter and we could vote on the amendments separately, in which case I foreshadow that the opposition accepts amendment No.3. I will indicate why we are taking that view. I have already spoken to amendment No. 8 but I will briefly recapitulate my arguments on that matter.",103
158,Mr DUNCAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I seek leave to withdraw my motion. I will then put Senate amendments Nos 3 and 8 separately. Motion-by leave-withdrawn. Motion (by Mr Duncan) proposed: . That Senate amendment No. 3 be disagreed to.,103
159,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (5.37 p.m.)The opposition accepts the approach that the government has taken. I indicate that the government proposes to disagree later in this debate with Senate amendment No.2 and to substitute a new clause 8. In relation to that matter, there is a further effort to clarify garnishee notice period and to deal with, in a slightly different way, the issues that the Senate has seen fit to amend. We have closely examined the government's proposals and we have taken some advice from interested organisations. I understand that the Australian Democrats, who have an interest in the matter, have done the same. We will accept amendment No.2 and, on that basis, we see amendment No. 3 as being no longer necessary. It is part of the overall scheme that will be adopted in clause 8, which we find satisfactory, and therefore we will not oppose in this Ho-se the government's view that Senate amendment No. 3 be disagreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative.",104
160,Mr DUNCAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move:. That Senate amendment No.8 be disagreed to. As I have already made the government's position clear on that, I will not add further to it at this point.",104
161,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I will not add a great deal to the comments I made before. In my rather rushed attendance, I did not perhaps put as cogently as the parliamentary secretary has the issues involved in amendment No.8, but I think I did put clearly why we oppose the government's suggestion. We believe the government's efforts to proportion indebtedness to assets which are income producing and non-income producing in relation to loans that are undertaken for an income producing purpose unreasonably increase the value· of the assets of a primary producer. For that reason, we believe the following principle should be supported by the parliament: any indebtedness incurred for an income earning purpose ought to be apportioned totally against the income producing asset and not the home of a farmer, which is otherwise excluded. In relation to all assets testing, the home of a person who receives a benefit is excluded. In our view, it is unreasonable to boost the value of the assets by means of this technique. The government believes that it did that the successfully with amendments that have been previously proposed. But, when the matter went before a tribunal, the government found out that the tribunal did not accept that view. The reason we have this amendment is that the government wants to put the matter beyond doubt. That is the issue. The reason we have this amendment is that, notwithstanding the advice that the government has received, it wants to put the matter beyond doubt. It does not want to rely on advice it has been given. We have no intention of accommodating the· government in that matter. We are of the view that, if people are entitled, on the basis of the tribunal decision, to have their assets considered on the basis of the full debt being apportioned against the income producing asset owned by the farmer, that is the position that ought to be sustained. We may not be successful, even if we insist upon this amendment. But I regard the issue as one of substance. On that basis, the opposition will not accede to the government's request that this amendment be disagreed to and we will oppose the government's amendment. Question put: That the motion (Mr Duncan's) be agreed to. The House divided. [5.46 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr N.J.

164,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"To facilitate the passage of the matter, I indicate that the opposition accedes to the amendment on the basis of the reasoning that I previously articulated. Question resolved in the affirmative. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Duncan) agreed to: That Ms Deahm, Mr Dodd and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendments Nos 3 and 8 of the Senate.",106
165,Mr DUNCAN,PAIRS,"On behalf of the Committee of Reasons, appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendments Nos 3 and 8 of the Senate, I present the reasons which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsSenate amendment No.3 - The Government agrees with the principles that, where the Department can use the garnishee power, it should do so rather than apply penalty interest and that penalty interest should not apply when effective recovery is in progress under a garnishee notice. However, the amendments as drafted do not appear to achieve these objectives. In particular, the Government believes that Senate amendment No. 3 is superfluous and that, further, it implies a condition on the sue of the garnishee power which does not exit in the Act. Section 1233 (the garnishee power) contains no requirement to isSue another type of notice (ie a penalty charge notice) prior to a garnishee. If the Department has already issued a garnishee. notice, the amendment would not stop the Department then applying penalty interest as well. The latter argument also applies to paragraph (a) of Senate amendment No.4. Since the Government believes that Senate amendment No; 3 is superfluous it opposes the amendment. Senate amendment No.8 Senate amendment No. 8 omits Part 7 of the Bill that relates to the value of assets used in primary produ(,tion. The amendments contained in Part 7 were intended to clarify the original intention, and existing policy, that where primary production liabilities are related to primary production assets whose values are partly exempt under section 1118 of the Principal Act, only that part of the liabilities relating to the non-exempt assets will be allowed as a deduction under the assets test. The objective of Part 7 was merely to clarify the position as a result of the recent decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in Little. Indeed, legal advice received from the Attorney-General's Department confirms that the existing legislation authorises the Department's existing treatment of primary production assets. As a result, there is strictly no need to proceed with Part 7. However, the Government considers that the amendments should be proceeded with so as to clarify the position-a position strongly recommended by the Attorney-General's Department.",106
166,Mr DUNCAN,PAIRS,"The other two members of the committee and I worked long and hard at this task and as a result of our labours produced thoroughly excellent reasons, which I am sure the House will concur with. I move: That the committee's reasons be adopted.",106
167,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I had some difficulty in understanding this matter. This really does indicate the farce that these procedures are. As you would be well aware, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Newell, having been in the chair, Senate amendment No. 3 has already been accepted by the House. The matter is functus officio. What we know, of course, is that the government had drafted amendments in the expectation that another course might be followed. Mr Bollis'-He was just being prudent.",106
168,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"Prudent! We know that these procedures are a farce and that committees are not a. substantial process in which members go out and genuinely consider the issue and come back. and give us their considered reasons but that the government in its closets behind these doors prepares amendments and reasons in advance and comes in with an expectation that a certain course will be followed. I want to make it very clear that, so far as the opposition is concerned, Senate amendment No.3, which has already been agreed to, ought not to now be the subject of any adoption of a report by this House. I do not know what will be the outcome if reasons are adopted after the amendments have already been carried, but no doubt that is one of the reasons the clerks are now busily talking to Mr Deputy Speaker. The opposition disagrees with the reasons given for disagreeing with amendment No.8. I have articulated before the reasons the oppOsition takes the view that this matter should be disagreed with. It clearly joins with each of the pqints made in the notes that are before us in relation to Senate amendment No.8. I do not believe I need to further embellish those arguments, save to say that, so far as the opposition is concerned, if the government presses the matter that the House should adopt reasons for disagreeing with Senate amendment number 8, we will oppose it.",107
169,Mr DUNCAN,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) misunderstands what happened during the earlier debate on this matter. Initially, I moved that Senate amendments Nos 3 and 8 be disagreed to. He then raised the issue that the opposition was not going to disagree with the government's disagreeing to amendment No. 3 and suggested that I should split the consideration of Senate amendments Nos 3 and 8. I then withdrew my motion and moved that· Senate amendment No. 3 be disagreed to. He then spoke to it and the House voted. At that point we disagreed to No.3. We then proceeded with my motion that Senate amendment No. 8 be disagreed to. The honourable member for Berowra spoke in that debate and opposed that disagreement-in other words, supporting the Senate amendment. The procedure which I have now moved is in order in accordance with the decision that the House has made-that is, we have disagreed with amendments Nos 3 and 8. We disagreed with amendment No. 3 with the support of the opposition. We disagreed with amendment No.8 with the opposition in opposition to the disagreement.",107
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr NeweU)The parliamentary secretary has now closed the debate, but if the honourable member for Berowra wishes to seek indulgence then I will grant it. MrRUDDOCK (Berowra)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) for clarifying that matter. The opposition issue obviously having accepted passage of the proposal that we disagree with Senate amendment No.3, I have no objection to those reasons for that disagreement being given to the Senate. So far as Senate amendment No. 8 is concerned, as we maintain our opposition to it, obviously we maintain our opposition to the reasons that the government has givenbecause we disagree with those reasons. So far as voting on this matter is concerned, I have outlined our reason for accepting part and disagreeing with the other part. I will not ask that they be put separately. I think all members note our in principle disagreement in relation to the government's proposals to deal with Senate amendment No.. 8.. 0bviously if the passage of the reasons for disagreement occurs, it will not in any way oblige us or my colleagues in the Senate in relation to the way in which they deal with this matter.

173,Mr SIMMONS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, I present the report of the committee entitled Stand and deliver: inquiry into the efficiency dividend. arrangements, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",108
174,Mr SIMMONS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This inquiry into the efficiency dividend atrangements was conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration at the request of the then Minister for Finance, the Treasurer (Mr Willis). The committee received the reference at the end of August 1993. and the inquiry was advertised at the end of September 1993. A number of factors have made this a difficult task to finalise, not the least of which was changed budget arrangements. As the recommendations in this .report need to be considered in the context of the preparation of this year's budget, it was necessary that the committee report today. The efficiency dividend is a 1.25 per cent annual cut in the running cost appropriations of budget funded departments and agencies. The efficiency dividend is fairly unpopular in the public sector, particularly with small agencies. The purpose of the efficiency Report dividend is to ensure that the government receives a portion of the efficiency gains being generated in the public sector as a result of the management reforms of the last decade-in particular the· running cost arrangements. The dividend also focuses the minds of managers on the need to continue to strive for efficiencies, particularly in times of fiscal Report restraint. While many agencies are unhappy with the efficiency dividend, they are happy with the flexibility offered to them by the running cost arrangements, particularly the guaranteed funding over the forward estimates years. The committee was of the view that we do not get one without the other. Perhaps the most significant issue dealt with by the committee was the lack of data on productivity in the public sector-not just Report labour productivity but total factor productivity. If the efficiency dividend is to rely on anything more than anecdotal evidence of efficiency gains then greater emphasis needs to be placed on the better specification of qualitative and quantitative performance information. Without this data it is difficult to address concerns over the possible decline in service quality. It is also difficult to develop more sophisticated approaches than that provided by the efficiency dividend. The committee has recommended that the Department of Finance and the Department of Industrial Relations review the methods of assessing productivity in the public sector with a view to developing an approach which takes account of service quality as we)) as labour productivity. I will briefly touch on two areas that were raised with the committee. Workplace barthe gaining was cited by a number of agencies as an alternative to the efficiency dividend. The concern that the committee had was that current arrangements do not provide for a return to the budget. Furthermore, the progress to date has been insufficient to enable any conclusions to be drawn. The committee was of the view that the new arrangements for workplace bargaining should be negotiated from the view of ensuring that they provide for a return to the budget and so become a realistic alternative to the efficiency dividend. Another issue which was of concern to the committee was the situation of small agencies. It is obvious that some small agencies do have particular difficulties with the efficiency dividend; however, there is no evidence that any are in dire peril. The committee was concerned that some assistance be provided to small agencies. The recommendation to exempt section 35 receipts from the dividend should· assist agencies that rely on external receipts. The logic of this recommendation is that the budget benefits directly from agencies seeking external funding or through the application of user pays principles. An exemption will encourage agencies to seek alternative avenueS for funding and thus decrease their reliance on the budget. It also addresses the fact that there is no consistency in the application of the efficiency dividend to section 35 receipts, with numerous agencies being granted exemptions for no obvious logical reason. The committee has also recommended the application of the efficiency dividend to property operating expenses. This may cause some shivers in the bureaucracy; however, the committee has also recommended that the rate of the efficiency dividend be reduced to one per cent, which will offset the cost of the addition of property operating expenses. This will also· assist those agencies that already receive their property operating expenses in single-line appropriations and, as a consequence, are already subject to the efficiency dividend at 1.25 per cent. The committee was of the view that the efficiency dividend can be characterised as a blunt but effective instrument. It is unfair and takes no account of· ability to pay. It does, however, yield results. It also keeps up the pressure to look for efficiencies and it does return a portion of those efficiencies to the budget. The· time constraints on this inquiry have meant that the committee has focused fairly narrowly on the efficiency dividend and has not had the oppOrtunity to examine alternative approaches in any depth. That does not detract from the immediate task, as the committee was of the view that there is no alternative to the efficiency dividend at this time. However, the committee was also of the view that alternative approaches such as workplace bargaining, resource agreements, market type approaches, evaluation programs and benchmarking offer a longer term alternative to the efficiency dividend. A broader approach to advancing the reform agenda has been identified in the management advisory board's recent report entitled Building a better public service. The committee is interested in playing a continuing role in examining these issues. I take this opportunity to thank my fellow subcommittee members for their very strong support and valuable assistance in the conduct of this inquiry and the preparation of the report. I would also like to acknowledge the former chairman, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), for his valuable work in getting this inquiry under way prior to his appointment as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. I also wish to express thanks on behalf of the committee to the committee secretary, Chris Paterson, and to his staff for their work in the publication of this report. Finally, I would like to thank all of those \Xho have made submissions and appeared at public hearings and, in particular, I place on record the committee's appreciation for Mr Steve Davis from the Department of Finance for his valuable assistance as technical adviser to the committee.",108
175,Mr REITH,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I wanted to take the opportunity as deputy chairman and as a member of the subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration to add a few short words to those already contributed by the chairman, the honourable member for Cal are (Mr Simmons). I start by recording an appreciation of the constructive approach taken to the issue by those who appeared before the committee. Australians are fortunate that within the Australian Public Service there are so many people who uphold the highest professional standards. It is also appropriate to recognise that the Public Service has introduced many reforms in recent years. I have acknowledged those elsewhere and do not repeat them; except to say that, whilst recognising those achievements, more could and should be done. I also want to record the professionalism of the submission from Des Moore, a Senior Fellow at the Institute of Public Affairs. In my view, he provided an invaluable and independent overview of this issue. He recommended an approach which; as can be seen from the report, was found persuasive by the committee. I also thank the Centre for Australian Public Sector Management for its very useful discussion paper. I thank the chilirman and my colleagues and endorse the remarks of the chairman in respect of the professional and his staff. The report has the unanimous support of the committee. It is a quality product and I think it will be useful for the government in its budget deliberations. We have met the government's timetable for that very purpose. I hope that the government implements the recommendations. I want to make a few points by way of highlighting some aspects of the report. The efficiency dividend is a rough justice system but it should be retained; it should be amended. It should be managed with more flexibility. The critical point is that it should be set a rate that relates to labour productivity growth. The calculation of that figure is a vexed issue, so the committee has proposed a more careful analysis of the methodology to calculate such a figure. Setting the rate is a budget decision. It is a matter for the government. But the committee has agreed that it could range to two per cent. We have, with the assistance of the Depar:tment of Finance, provided figures to back that up. I would be remiss if I did not comment on the fact that this inquiry revisits an issue of contention about the possible gains from an increase in the efficiency dividend, which was the subject of political controversy when the opposition in its Fightback proposal suggested an increase of the efficiency dividend to two per cent. We calculated that it would bring in an extra $36 million in 1994 and the same amount in 1995-96. Finance at that time said it would only bring in $27 million and $36 million. We have now had the benefit of its further calculations on this matter.It says that it would actually bring in an extra$49 million in the first year and $48;8 million in the second year. The only thing I would say to our friends in Finance is that next time they are doing a costing for the government of an opposition's election policy they might do a more accurate job than they did last time. It just so happens that this time it suits them to up the figure and it is a very different figure from that which they gave us before. I think we can say now that next time they might be more careful, although the fact is that now we have the committee making it clear that a figure of two per cent is possible, and we have Finance figures giving us the revenue implications of that. If a political party decides to recommend that again we wiJI simply use the committee's substantial justification and Finance's own figures to back it up. The second point I want to make is that, whilst workplace bargaining is only in its early stages, the evidence that we took about the operation of it would be disappointing for the advocates of it as it is currently undertaken in the public sector. I think it is a process which has much potential, but the evidence at before the committee was basically damning. The committee went on to note that a more flexible system is needed. The committee also notes that more market type mechanisms are appropriate. In my view, this is very much an enlightened view which I strongly endorse. The third point I wanted to make is a more general one. I start with a brief quote from a United States federal public service report, which described the need for reform in the . United States public sector. It asserted: The movement to reinvent government is as bipartisan as it is widespread. It is not driven by political ideology but by necessity ... Government is broken and it is time to fix it. The committee in its report has called for a comprehensive framework for public sector reform. I believe that this conclusion contained within the committee's report is very significant. The committee has acknowledged reforms to date but has called for more and has pointed to one option for the government and policy makers to consider, and that is the further adoption of market type mechanisms. There are many options to introduce market type mechanisms, including privatisatiori, cOl""j:>oratisation, developing agencies, 'decentralising functions, vouchers, contracting out, devolving responsibilities, introducing user charges, developing performance objectives for agencies and, in that context similarly, introducing citizens charters. In fact, the committee has raised the prospect of citizens charters and suggested that this is an area that could be further examined. I again strongly endorse that recommendation. Not only does it hold out the prospect of providing government with a tool by which it can assess the Commonwealth on services delivered, but also it can give the customers a benchmark by which they can judge the quality of the service being provided by government.' That is' not, as the US quote really enforces, a,matter of political ideology; it ought to be a bipartisan view that can be shared within the parliament about the importance of delivering services in a quality way to the Australian taxpayer. As the chairman has noted, by the nature of the circumstances the committee's report was brought into the parliament at this time so that it could facilitate the government's budget decision processes. But we reported in the context of this broader reform agenda and indicated that the committee was prepared to have, and saw itself as having, a role in promoting further reforms. I am confident that, over time; that will be seen to be a far-sighted move by the committee to assist public debate and promote reform. My postscript to that is that, in addition to introducing market pressures, other related reforms could have been recommended if time had permitted and our terms of reference had been wider. The parliament has a role to play in developing and maintaining a public sector that meets the contemporary needs of Australia. The establishment of a more extensive committee system and the autumn introduction of the federal budget are policies that have been promoted by the coalition but which have now been adopted by the government. But there are other measures. Supporting the principle of a non-political public service, providing public servants with similar terms and conditions of employment as the private sector and transferring duplicated functions to the states are examples of additional measures that could be examined at a later time. In conclusion, Australians are entitled to demand value for money. It is a pretty simple proposition, but it is an important one. This report is' but one of the important means by which Australians can demand that value for money. It is pretty clear that they are not getting it. That is not a criticism of the efforts of those in the public sector today. I have already acknowledged the reforms that have been undertaken. But a lot more could be done. The committee had before it evidence and submissions to that effect. The examination of the efficiency dividends conducted by the committee concluded that it is a pretty rough system but one worth keeping and fixing, amending and changing. I hope that our report will be a spur to further reforms that are already under way. Further reforms could be undertaken which would provide a real dividend eventually to taxpayers, either through their having to pay less taxes and still receiving the same goods or; alternatively, by their continuing to pay the same level of taxes but obtaining a better result from the government. We have indicated some options. The committee has done a very professional job. I am very pleased to be associated with the report. I commend it to the House. Motion (by' Mr Simmons)-by leaveproposed: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Reith) adjourned. NA Report Debate resumed.",109
176,Mr KNOTT,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"I rise to support the Law Reform Commission's annual report No. 67 entitled Equality before the law: women S access to the legal system. I will go through some of the leading figures who have been responsible for this report, the general thrust of the government's actions in terms of women before the law, the general legal predicaments that women are faced with and the improvements which have been made under this government over the last 10 years. I draw attention to a speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 10 February 1993 before the federal election. The Labor government's role in women's access to the law and the duplicity of occurrences around the law which affect women indicate that this government under this Prime Minister and the previous one under Mr Hawke have been successful in not only putting forward rhetoric but delivering on that rhetoric. The national agenda for women that was put forward by the Prime Minister shows the extent to which there is a commitment within this government not only to talk about issues but to deliver on them. The real record for this government has been one of delivery. In the speech that I refer to, when the national agenda for women was launched, the Prime Minister indicated that women unanimously nominated three areas as being of pressing concern to them: child care; violence against women; and women's health. The record of this government in those areas has been exemplary. That is not to suggest that there is not a long way to go; there is. But there has been action by the government. Australia's recognition of women and their role within the law and the legal system goes back a long way. South Australia was the first state in the world to give women the vote. Australia continues to set the pace for democracy in issues relating to the status of women. The International Labour Organisation singled out Australia's achievement in reducing the gap between women's and men's wages. Under the centralised wage fixing system, with the protection of awards, women now earn up to 93c for every dollar of men's wages. By comparison, in Japan or the US, for example, women earn around 70c for every dollar that a man takes home. These are some things that the Prime Minister brought to our attention. Gough Whitlam was responsible for introducing the notion of equal pay for women. At that time, those opposite predicted that this would cause the vast unemployment of women. In fact, the employment prospects of women have not suffered. There has been an exceptional growth in female employment. In the past 10 years, the number of women in the labour force has increased by almost 40 per cent. Some benchmarks of this Labor government in the reform process include the Sex Discrimination Act and the affirmative action laws. Seventy-seven per cent of girls now stay at school to year 12. In 1983, when we took office, 40 per cent stayed. Fifty-two per cent of enrolments in higher education are now women, which is up from 46 per cent in . 1982. These are just some of the things in which we have been involved. Child care was identified by the Prime Minister as a paramount issue. It is a family issue which impacts very seriously on the ability of women· to play an equal and equitable role in the life of our nation. Women have sent out a very strong message about violence. The message they have sent out is that they need to feel safe in their homes and on the· streets. The Prime Minister was among the first to put forward this point. In fact, not only has it been put forward; the national strategy· on violence against women has been implemented. The report that I am talking about was headed by a remarkable Australian, Justice Elizabeth Evatt. She is not only a truly remarkable Australian on any assessment; she is also a remarkable woman. The Prime Minister recognised this and, to his credit, with the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), appointed her to head this very important report. Backed by those two people-Justice Eli-beth Evatt and Prime Minister Keatinganother tier of people deserves note. To bring to the attention of the House these peoplethey have not just been talkers in the political game; they have done things-I will q·uote from an article in the Bulletin of 22 March 1994 in which two of our ministers, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), are mentioned. It reads: They.are the caped crusaders of law reform, the federal government's own Batman and Robin come to save the country' from marauding lawyers: Attorney-General Michael Lavarch and Justice Minister Duncan Kerr. are .attempting to smash down the walls of money and privilege that have long divided the ordinary folk from the legal profession. The catch cry of these earnest young babyboomers in the Keating ministry is that justice should be fairer, cheaper and more accessible to ordinary Australians-even if it means taking on some powerful interests. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted;. debate adjourned.",111

178,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Order! The following message from the Senate has been received. The Senate returns to the House of Representatives the Bill for ""an Act to amend the law relating to taxation"", and requests the House to amend the bill as indicated by Schedule A annexed. The Senate has agreed to the following resolution: The Senate declares that its agreement, on the motion of the Government, to make requests to the House of Representatives for amendments of the bill, does not indicate that the Senate considers that requests are appropriate or that the Senate has formed a conclusive view on the application of section 53 or 55 of the Constitution to the bill; and that the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report on or before the last day of May 1994: the application and interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution in relation dealing with taxation. The Senate also desires to inform the House that the amendments indicated by Schedule B annexed have been made by the Senate in the bill. The proper interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution is of great importance to each house. Honourable members will realise that the application of this provision has been the source of some difficulty over many years. I note that the Senate has advised the House that it has referred to its Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs the application and interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution in relation to bills dealing with taxation. In view of the importance of this matter to each house, I suggest that the House may wish to consider the desirability of referring this matter to its Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and resolving to ask the Senate that its committee meet with the House of Representatives committee in relation to the matter, but perhaps not confining the consideration to bills dealing with taxation. Motion (by Mr Gear) proposed: (1) that the question of the interpretation and application of the provisions of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal _ and Constitutional Affairs; and (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and asking the Senate: (A) to consider broadening the terms of its reference of 24 March 1994 to its Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to allow its committee to consider the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 generally; and (B) agree to an order to permit its committee to confer with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on this matter with a view to reports being presented to both houses.",113

If it were the case that we were going to make the references as enumerated in the motion and still attempt to consider this bill, we would have great difficulties indeed. I would welcome some clarification.",113
180,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,in reply-We have adopted procedures that will allow the passage of this bill tonight. This is so that we do not have future doubts about the way in which we proceed with tax bills by introducing amendments and requests in the Senate. It will not have any effect on this bill but it will dear up what has been a doubt in the past about the way in which tax bills are treated between the House and the Senate.,113
181,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Curtin) I seek your indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker. It is hardly a principled position the government has taken.",114
182,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,It's a position you are adopting in the Senate.,114
183,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"No, it is a position we are adopting in .this House; this is a motion of this House. The government cannot subcontract what it has just proposed to the Senate. The House has to deal with it. Certainly we are reacting to something from the Senate, but it is not new; it has happened before. One . might suppose it could reasonably have been anticipated. I will not go over it chapter and verse, but certainly in the second reading and detailed stages of the debate in this House we did canvass some possible amendments and the Assistant Treasurer should not be unmindful of the possibility that we would have had difficulties. We did not specifically anticipate the constitutional problem that we now seemingly have. It is an empty gesture to now be talking about collaborating in some way between the relevant committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives to overcome a problem which you, Mr Acting Speaker, and the Assistant Treasurer have acknowledged is not new, and in the same breath to say, 'Although the measure arose out of a specific piece of legislation' - that is, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1993-'it shall have no relevance to it'. I am talking about the motion before the House to collaborate and refer to committees. Given the suggestion that has been made that the committee make its decision known before the end of May, we are now proposing quite dearly to pass a measure which gave rise to the concerns of the Senate, and gave rise to the measures now proposed, but to treat the concerns as if they do not exist in relation to the measure, which really is the initiating instrument-although that is a bad term. It is very difficult to understand how the government can, in all seriousness, divorce what is proposed by way of reference to committees of each chamber in an attempt to darify the issues involved from the decision and, nevertheless, proceed to ram through the bill, induding amendments from the Senate, in the circumstances described. It is outrageous and I think any reasonable person would have trouble understanding the logic of what the government proposes. I am wholeheartedly in support of the measure you have proposed, Mr Acting Speaker. I think the opposition would support it also-this is the first inkling the coalition has had of it, and we have not really discussed in any detail what is a tremendously important measure. The other thing I might ask-I will be brief because I do appreciate your indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker-is for the government to give this side of the House at least an hour or so to discuss how we might react. It is difficult for me to do so on the spur of the moment, as it were, but it is possible that we might reach an accommodation. Otherwise, we are in the dilemma that I have attempted to describe.",114
184,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"by leave-While I comprehend the position outlined by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), I think it would be unnecessarily disruptive of the processes of government were it to be adopted. It is not something to which the opposition has lent itself in the Senate. It has referred materials to us for us to consider. The way in which they were referred has been a matter of some discussion between us and the Senate for a period. Nevertheless, we have generally chosen to frame· a set of amendments along the lines of Senate requests and send it back to the Senate. That is what the government intends to do now. I understand that it is not the Senate's intention that consideration of the bill, as opposed to the issue, be delayed any further in that place-subject to the government agreeing with the amendments that the majority of the Senate agreed to. So the principle, not the bill, has gone to the committee of the Senate. We believe the same should apply here. rIte principle, not the bill, should be considered by our parliamentary committee and the committees ought to talk to each other and attempt to arrive at some unified position. It is not a proposition which we ought to have any· difficulty resolving. The problem we would have if we suggested delaying ihis legislation until this issue were resolved is ""lhat there would be a lengthy consideration: by Mr Rocher-Give us an hour.",114
185,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Let.me finish the point I was making. There would be a fairly lengthy consideration by the committee of the issue. It may take months for the committees to resolve the matter, and they may never resolve it satisfactorily. The issue may not be resolved until something is done that so offends a member of the public that that member of the public decides to challenge a piece of the legislatiori and take it to the Court. In that case, a resolution of this issue may be years away, unless there is an agreement, which I think is unlikely, between the House and the Senate on how these things should be handled in the future. Of course, we cannot set aside all taxation legislation between now and when that situation occurs. I think the opposition in the Senate, including the other' political parties that. formed the ,majority on the amendments, very sensibly recognised that. We propose in this' amendment to do more or less the same thing. I am most reluctant to delay the consideration of the bill any further, We have to consider the amendments them, selves, which require debate in this chamber, as well as this particular issue. When that is completed, the pill has to be referred back to the Senate for its consideration. The Senate is operating under a strict timetable and will shut down at 10.30 tonight. I am afraid we cannot delay consideration of this bill for an hour. Mr Downer-Why? Mr .BEAZLEY - Because the Senate is shutting down at 10.30 tonight, and the matter has to be concluded by that time. I suggest that this is'a very sensible way of handling it. It is a proper use of parliamentary committees. We are' accepting the Senate amendments, which are basically opposition based amendments .. That ought to be a satisfactory outcome to the opposition.",115
186,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"by leave-Like everybody else debating the motion on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), I have been caught a little short. Mr Downer-No consultation.",115
187,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"That is no reflection on anybody. I certainly do not reflect on the clerks or the officers. As I understand the situation, there are two separate propositions. One is that this House mirrors action taken by the Senate to refer the constitutional issue to a committee, and in the course of it",115
188,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Would you like us to adjourn this particular argument? , Mr HOWARD-I suggest that the Leader High of the House defer debate until 10 o'clock. I am not trying to be clever in saying that, but we would like a bit of time to look at and talk about this matter. I suggest that it be put over to a time that still enables the government to vote on the matter, if that is its .intention. My initial reaction is that, if there is some suggestion of constitutional doubt, the bill should be put aside until that matter is deliberated upon by the committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. I ask the Leader of the House whether he would agree to put this matter over until 9.30 or 10 o'clock. We will find the suitable procedural devices to do that. I have just engaged in conversation with the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who obviously· has an interest in this matter, and I would like the opportunity to seek the separate advice of the clerks. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) reminds me that we do not have any fundamental problems with the amendments. We are not arguing about the substance of the matter. If there is some doubt .about the constituti(,mality of a procedure attaching to this bill, it seems to me wrong in principle for this ,House to pass that bill until that doubt is resolved. I think that is a fairly sound argument.",115
189,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"by leave-We can adjourn this item until 10 o'clock tonight, if that suits the convenience of the opposition; but we cannot adjourn consideration of the bill. There are two separate issues involved, as I am sure the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) understands. Mr Downer-You are asking us to pass the biIl without knowing whether it is constitutional.",115
190,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,That will not be found out by 10 o'clock tonight.,116
191,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,That is the point: you have admitted that there is a constitutional issue.,116
192,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In our view, there is no constitutional issue.",116
193,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Why are you referring it to a committee?,116
194,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I can give indulgence to only one person at a time and that is the Leader of the House at this stage.,116
195,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,What has been referred to the committee by the Senate and what we propose to refer to the committee is not this bill.,116
196,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,No. I understand that.,116
197,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"What has been referred is the principle of the way in which the Senate contemplates legislation that it receives from the House and what amendments it is entitled to move to what type of legislation. That is the issue. It has nothing to do with this particular biIl as distinct from any other taxation bill. It is an issue that we have lived with now for the bulk of this century. It is not something that requires, or is capable of, resolution tonight. If we hold up the legislative process to arrive' at a conclusion that satisfies all of us unanimously on this, it will take till hell freezes over. The procedure used in this biIl satisfies the constitution by the way it has been presented; it has been presented by way of requests. There is no constitutional issue related to the presentation of this bill to us. The Senate resents having to present the bills to us in this form, but it has nevertheless chosen to do so whilst at the same time-which was obviously its compromise up there-referring the principle off to its committee. So what has been done here with the biIl itself'is thoroughly in keeping with everything that has been done in the past in the way these things have been handled. As to the bill itself, all the amendments that have been suggested by way of request, but not moved to the bill by the opposition and minor parties in the Senate, are· about to be accepted by the government; the suggestions that were put forward up there are to be accepted by the government. They have come to us in the form in which they would normally come to us and in the form that we would consider constitutionally appropriate. But the issue itself as to whether or not this is the appropriate way of dealing with the general proposition of amendments from the Senate is the issue that the Senate has referred off to its committee and it is the issue that we suggest we refer off too. But, as there is concern in the opposition in this regard, we cannot delay the bill itselfand there is no need, on any past practice, to delay the biIl, and no need to as far as the opposition is concerned because we are accepting all the opposition amendments. But, because this concern has been raised by the opposition, what I am prepared to do is to adjourn this item-the item that we are now discussing-so that the opposition can consider that between now and 10 o'clock tonight. Then, as soon as that item is adjourned, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) will stand and move the bill in the amended form responding to the Senate requests. Mr Rocher-They are our amendments.",116
198,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,They are the opposition's amendments.,116
199,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"by leave- Mr Acting Speaker, by indulgence, I would inquire, through you, from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley): what is the latest time to which we can delay the bill and yet still get the thing through? It cannot be straight away.",116
200,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Ten minutes.,116
201,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Thanks, mate!",116
202,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,There is nothing wrong with the bill. .,116
203,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I understand that, through you, Mr Acting Speaker.",116
204,Mr BEAZLEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,But there is a typing problem. It has to be typed and got back to the Senate. It takes about two hours.,117
205,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I understand that. I am informed and verily believe, as the lawyers say, that the amendments that have been carried are· opposition amendments. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), confirms that understanding. In those circumstances, I must say that I was persuaded by the argument put by the Leader of the House. My threshold reaction is to agree to the reference to the committee. But, seeing that no damage is done if this is deferred until 10 0' clock, I would be quite happy with that so I can have discussions with the shadow Treasurer and the clerk, whose advice' in these matters is always greatly valued by both sides of the parliament. If I have got that wrong, it is on my head. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned.

Mr Rocher-By way of clarification, what are the speaking arrangements? Will we take the amendments one by one; what speaking times are available?",117
206,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,That is to be resolved after we resolve this question. Question resolved in the affirmative.,127
207,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I understand that it is the wish of the House to consider the requested amendments together. Mr Rocher-I would ask that there be at least separate consideration for two of the clauses. These amendments have just come back into the House and I cannot tell honourable members which ones they are. Motion (by Mr Gear) proposed: That the requested amendments be made. Mr ROCHER' (Curtin) (7.56 p.m.)-As I understand it, and given all that has just gone before, it will be readily apparent to the chamber that ,there is a raft of amendments which have been agreed to by the Senate and transmitted to us, either in the form of worded amendments or requests. My first point is that it was both unnecessary and avoidable to have us discuss amendments from the Senate in this way. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) . and I had an exchange during detailed considerations earlier this week along the lines that we were quite we11 aware that we were going to be confronted with this. I remind him of that, although I know full we11 he understands the consequences of what we do in this place. There is absolutely no reason at all why we should not have considered these amendments in this place at the appropriate time. I know that at one stage, talking about a particular amendment I had moved-I think it was to clause 51, but time passes so slowly in this place that one tends to forget-the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said, 'Well, we're not going to take that amendment here because it'll go to the Senate and it'll make that amendment'. That is damn fool logic by anyone's estimation and merely reinforces the long-held view that we have abandoned oilr legislative duties in this place and allowed the Senate to be the sole legislative chamber-but particularly in relation to taxation matters. The classic example is clause 51A(ii) which we could have dealt with here. We could have dealt with the others too. We could have gone through the same process which the Senate has gone through, avoided the need for requests and the complications of a constitutional nature, which we have just been discussing, had we accepted our responsibilities in this chamber in the first place. It is an chestnut, but the simple truth is that the government's actions are making the situation worse with each year, with each piece of tax legislation that goes by. These amendments have been either requested or enumerated by the· Senate. They impact on the payment of, amongst other things, instalments by companies and certain trustees and the deductions allowable to life insurance companies and registered organisations. Other associated issues involve the way in which the Senate has requested the House to make these amendments and the limited time frame that the members of this chamber have had to examine the issues involved. I remind honourable members that we have been presented with a raft of paper-in the order of 22 pages-and that I have not seen this document until very recently. Is it any wonder that we are held in ill repute as a legislative body, particularly amongst the professionals who have to work with the product of our inefficiencies and inconsistency? The first of the amendments that I want to address concerns the payment of instalments by companies and certain trusts. It is a minor amendment to correct an error in the original bill which should have been picked up in this chamber in the first place. Had we had more of a history of it in recent times, I am sure that it would have been picked up, but no-one in this ?lace tries because of how it is treated. According to the supplementary explanatory memorandum, clause 48 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) provides that division 6 in the bill will apply from the 1994-95 income year. The explanatory memorandum to the bill stated that the grouping rules of division 6 should apply from the 1995-96 financial year. This amendment corrects the bill so that division 6 will apply only from 1995-96; hence it is a straightforward measure in that sense. One concern we in the coalition have, which Senator Watson has mentioned, is the bunching effect by which companies are increasingly having their cashflow tightened by these measures. The group test in terms of the company tax instalment rules differs from old the group test applicable to the transfer of losses and other taxation matters. I ask the Assistant· Treasurer: can the government explain why a uniform group test in the Income Tax Assessment Act is not the simplest and most efficient method? We would like some guidance on that matter. As those here should know, large companies are now required to lodge their tax returns on 1 December instead of on 15 March the following year, as was previously the case. This move will increasingly squeeze the cashflow of companies. It is made worse by the fact that companies must now cope with initial tax, quarterly instalmentscontained in this bill-and extra taxes arising from the fringe benefits tax changes. These arrangements are causing a major negative impact on the cashflow financing arrangements of many companies. It cannot be understated. From time to time, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as is his wont, berates the business community for not investing. Most recently he threatened wages pressure if the sort of investment he thinks should be occurring does not occur. In the same breath he and his ministers argue that, compared with other OECD countries, we are one of· the lowest taxing nations. Whilst the raw figures might-I emphasise 'might' - add some credibility to that claim, which is certainly arguable, we have the offsetting factor that the incidence of taxation here is quite abominable if it is compared with the OECD countries or, for that matter, with any other country. On top of that, we in this country have the highest compliance costs of any nation in the world, with the possible exception of the United States of America. So the argument that we are a low taxing country is relevant only when it stands on its ownnot when the total cost of taxation is taken into .account. This bill, in conjunction with other legislation, is smothering the business community in red tape and is a real disincentive for business to invest. The Prime Minister might well take that on board when he embarks on his bit of rhetorical blackmail in suggesting wages blow-outs in response to a failure by the business community to invest at levels which he thinks might be reasonable.",127
208,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Oh!,129
209,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Calwell should not say 'oh'. That is the measure of the man. I am surprised the honourable gentleman opposite, who has to have a word or two on something about which he knows very little, wants to get involved in this. Another Senate amendment which is before the House deals with deductions allowable to life companies and registered organisations. Again I refer to the supplementary explanatory memorandum, which states: The amendments will amend the income tax provisions that provide deductions for expenditure incurred by life insurance companies and registered organisations in obtaining premiums which are included from assessable income. It further states: The amendments will limit deductions to expenses incurred direCtly in getting in Australian premiums which are invested to produce assessable income. This amendment is clearly aimed at protecting the government's revenue position from what must be said to be an inadvertent loophole. The loophole would have allowed the deduction of expenditure which was never intended to be deductible, and the coalition accepts that. The amendment will limit deductions allowed under the provisions to the direct cOsts of getting in Australian ,prerpiums which are invested to produce assessable income. Furthermore,the amendment will be backdated to 1 July 1988. We understand that there is effectively no retrospective .impact. If there were, I can assure you, Mr Acting Speaker, that I would be adopting a different attitude. There is no retrospective impact because the tax commissioner has not allowed any claims. So no-one is in a position where he or she had soinething to pay back and could not reasonably have anticipated being in such a position. We do not oppose this amendment but we certainly have concerns relating to the government's claim of having consulted with the industry on this provision. In the limited time available to the government in drafting this amendment, and the even more limited time we had to consider it here, I seriously doubt whether the government has adequately consulted with the industry. To claim so is plainly fatuous. The industry has not come to the opposition to discuss this amendment, so we can only assume that it has no problem with it, although we would have liked the opportunity to consult with industry. The government should have got this bill right before it was introduced. It plainly has not got it right. This is not new; it happens time and time again with income tax legislation. If it were not so serious, I would be almost sick of saying so. The process by which this legislation has returned from the Senate is a cause of concern for any observer of the parliamentary process. The constitutional issues relating to sections 53 and 55 have been spoken of frequently in the other place and directly impact on this bill. Is this bill imposing a tax or not? That is the fundamental question. It is clear that, with the inclusion in the bill of the two amendments now before us, the bill becomes a bill for the imposition of tax. It seems to me that that ispatentIy unarguable, although I am sure the High Court would be able to arrive at a different conclusion; hence the Senate's decision not to amend the bill but instead to request that the House amend the bill. Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, has made the point: Moving the government amendments in the fonn of requests again draws attention to the difficulties involved in the classification of taxation bills expounded by the government's legal advisers. That is a matter of a separate motion, thank goodness. I observe that it is well known that the government and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs have differing opinions on whether a tax increase is legislation to impose taxation. It is a matter which should-and, I guess one of these days, will-be tested before the High Court. I acknowledge the comments of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that that might take quite a long time indeed. It should be tested eventually-and I am sure it will be-to avoid confusion, by clarifying the role of the Senate and, more importantly, the meanings of sections 53 and 55 of the constitution. The timing of this amendment is an abuse of good parliamentary practice. The bill has been rushed through the Senate and now, with requested amendments, it is back in the House for the amendments to be debated. Why the big rush? What is the big deal? It is obvious the government does not want to debate the amendments before us in a way that would do the amendments justice. If it did, we would have more time to examine the amendments and their implications. This is another example of Labor riding roughshod over the parliament and imposing its will. We have seen many examples of that. The House is being treated as nothing more than a rubber stamp of the executive, which will impose its imperial will, no matter what the cost to the democratic traditions of this country may be. This can be seen daily as the Prime Minister threatens the Senate and increasingly moves against the states and the constitutional monarchy. Thank God we have the Senate and thank God the states maintain their support for the Senate. The Senate and the states are the only institutions restricting the Prime Minister's arrogant pursuit of absolute power. (TIme expired)",129
210,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Before I answer the question posed by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), I point out to him that we have been negotiating with industries since December. Opposition members have not been approached because of that process we have been going through. I remind the honourable member for Curtin that, when we were debating this bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) one of the reasons I gave for the fact that these requests would be moved in the Senate was that those negotiations could go on for an extra two weeks. In relation to the question asked about grouping for company tax instalments: there are two tests, for two different purposes. The first one is a group test for losses, and it is 100 per cent. This is a narrower test because of the need to reduce the scope for avoidance. The second test, a 50 per cent test for company instalments, follows closely that used in accounting standards previously announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis). Question resolved in the affirmative.

211,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Cal wellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Parliamentary. Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (8.14 p.m.)-Ipresent the explanatory memorandum and move: That the bill be now read a second time. The .Migration Legislation Amendment BilI amends the Migration Act 1958 as amended by the Migration Reform Act 1992. The reforms effected by both the Migration Reform Act and this bill are to commence on 1 September 1994. The bill also provides for consequential technical amendments to other Commonwealth legi.slation. The Migration Reform Act 1992 makes important changes to the Migration Act 1958. It seeks to simplify the legal basis for administration of entry to and stay in Australia. It expands merits review by the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal, and modifies appeal rights to the courts. It also establishes a detailed code of procedures for the processing of visa applications and reviews and clarifies the procedures in relation to cancellation of visas. The commencement of those parts of the Migration Reform Act 1992 that were originally to commence on 1 November 1992 was deferred to 1 September 1994 by the Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1993. A major reason for seeking deferment was to allow for the making of a number of amendments, mainly of a technical nature, to ensure that the legislation operates smoothly. The bill now before the House contains the amendments which the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) foreshadowed last year. All the changes provided for in the bilI are consistent with the principles and scheme of the Migration Reform Act, as enunciated by the former minister. Most are of a technical nature, correcting drafting errors, ensuring consistency of language or, in some instances, rewriting provisions to achieve the same outcome with greater clarity. The remainder of the amendments will ensure that particular migration matters are administered in a way consistent with the scheme of the Migration Reform Act previously passed by parliament. For example, one of the key objectives of the reforms is to clarify the status of all noncitizens in Australia. In simple terms, a noncitizen in Australia will be required to have a visa to be lawful. A non-citizen who does not hold a valid visa must be detained and is then subject to removal from Australia. Grant of a bridging visa will provide a noncitizen, who would otherwise be subject to detention and removal, with lawful status for a limited period. The bill provides for more than one class of bridging visa. This reflects the fact that bridging visas will serve a number of different purposes and will be granted on the basis of a number of different sets of criteria. The detail of the bridging visa scheme will be contained in regulations. The creation of a class of visas to be called special purpose visas clarifies the status of persons currently exempt from the requirement to hold an entry pennit to enter and remain in Australia. Currently the Migration Act exempts from this requirement a variety of non-citizens, including representatives of foreign governments and their families, heads of state, military personnel from other countries engaged in military exercises, ship and airline crew in Australia for a brief period, and New Zealand citizens who present a valid New Zealand passport on entry. This exemption will not apply under the reforms as it is inconsistent with the principle that lawful status flows only from holding a visa. Special purpose visas will provide lawful status for non-citizens who are presently exempt non-citizens, other than New Zealand citizens, and will be held when, and for 'as long as, a non-citizen continues to be present in Australia for a specified purpose. These visas will not be subject to the usual provisions relating to visas such as the need for an application; the need for an administrative grant of the visa, and the need for the grant to be evidenced. This' reflects the fact that many of the non-citizens who will be holders of these visas enter Australia in a manner that makes it impractical for the usual administrative procedures to apply; for example, foreign military personnel engaged in joint military exercises. New Zealand citizens will be granted special category visas at the border on presentation of a valid New Zealand passport. Given that they arrive in Australia in the nonnal way it is appropriate that nonnal administrative processes requiring an application, grant and the issuing of evidence of grant, apply. Another amendment which is intended to clarify the status of non-citizens in Australia is the creation of a new class of visa to be known as an ex-citizen visa. This amendment will provide that, while in Australia, a person who loses their Australian citizenship, for example, by acquiring the citizenship of another cbuntry, will be taken to be the holder of visa entitling them to remain in Australia indefinitely. This visa will be subject to the same cancellation provisions as any other pennanent visa. Creation of this new class will avoid the situation where such persons could automatically become unlawful noncitizens, subject to mandatory detention and removal. Other areas where the bill provides for minor amendments are in regard to the procedures for considering visa applications and cancellations, clearance of arrivals at the border and in regard to review. Visa application procedures are to be amended to ensure that applicants can effectively nominate a representative to receive communications from the department and to ensure that applicants are given a greater opportunity to comment on adverse information about them which they may not previously have seen. The procedure for cancelling visas, where incorrect information has been provided, is refined in the bill to ensure that a visa holder has opportunity both to show that incorrect information has not been given and, if the decision maker concludes that incorrect information has been given by the applicant, to show that there are mitigating reasons why the visa should not be cancelled. The bill refines provisions relating to the clearance of arrivals at the border to ensure the smooth processing of both· citizens and non-citizens. For example, provision is made for the clearance of a person that a clearance officer knows or reasonably believes is an Australian citizen, even though the person may not have documentary evidence of their citizenship. There are also amendments to ensure that a consistent approach can be taken to all persons who arrive in Australia without a visa. The bill ensures that particular decisions that are currently reviewable on their merits remain amenable to review after 1 September 1994. These include decisions refusing close family visitor visas and resident return visas where the applicant is overseas, as well as review of points assessments where an application is put into a pool. Proposed amendments also enable expedited review of bridging visa decisions where the applicant is in detention. In order to provide for smoother implementation of the legislation it is proposed that the Migration Act 1958, as amended by the Migration Refonn Act, be renumbered. The insertion of a large number of new provisions into the Migration Act means that, without renumbering, awkward references to provisions such as section 26ZEA will result. The renumbering of the Migration Act will take effect on 1 September 1994. The bill also provides for consequential amendments to other Commonwealth acts, largely reflecting changes in tenninology, such as the substitution of the term 'entry pennit' with 'visa', and the creation of the special category visa for New Zealand citizens in Australia. Since the decision was made to defer the commencement of the Migration Refonn Act there has been considerable activity within the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in preparation for implementation of the the proposed changes. As well as the identification of necessary amendments to the Migration Reform Act and other related legislation, significant progress has been made towards the drafting of subordinate legislation, the preparation of procedural instructions, and the revision of computer systems and data bases. In addition, a strategy has been developed for the provision of information and training to target groups, both inside and outside the department. It is essential for the successful implementation of the changes contained in the Migration Refonn Act that many of these,_activities are completed well in advance of the 1 September 1994 commencement date. In particular, the act itself, the regulations and procedures, and appropriate forms need to be finalised, printed and distributed to all officers well before the commencement date so that they can become familiar with the reforms and be able to provide an effective and high quality service from the first day. Members of the public, including clients and registered migration agents, also need time to become familiar with the reforms. While much of the preparatory work being done concurrently with the considersuggest ation by parliament of this bill, none of these matters essential for effective implementation can be finalised until the amending legislation is settled by parliament. It is therefore that the bill passes through both houses parliament by early May. I commend this bill to the House.",130
212,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (8.24 p.m.}-It is a pleasure to follow immediately a second reading speech which puts clearly at issue number of matters. It is particularly interestrequest ing to do so in the light of the pious statewe ments made in the concluding remarks of parliamentary secretary, the honourable expectation member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), about what the government hopes to achieve through the prompt passage of this legislation. Let me say at the first instance that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, which makes changes to the Migration Act, as of amended by the Migration Reform Act, will have the support of the opposition in this place as it had in the Senate. I dare say should not come as a surprise to the governReform ment or the parliamentary secretary. I am glad that the parliamentary secretary and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) have placed their expectations on the record. I hope their expectations are realised, but it will be given the experience in recent years amendments to this legislation by this governpresence ment, some of which were of major subbe stance. The opposition has often facilitated passage of those amendments and cooperated with matters that, if tackled in other ways, some might have seen as having undesirable consequences. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that the hopes and expectations for the legislation have been largely unrealised. There has been an enormous amount of frustration and difficulty, largely because the government has attempted to undertake major reforms. Regrettably, either because of the complexity of the legislation or the lack of perspicacity on the part of the government, matters that ought to have been properly addressed were overlooked, and great difficulty flowed from that. The parliamentary secretary, as is his wont, is waves his hands and grunts and groans to a degree of difference of view on this 'matter, but my experience with this bill, which is now considerable, suggests very much to the contrary. Even when we had vital facilitated the passage of the Migration of Reform Act, the most major reform following the 1988 reforms, the government still could not get it right. It had to ask for the postponement of the Migration Reform Act in order to further consider the matter. The opposition, in a its usual cooperative fashion, acceded to a to postpone the implementation. Now have the legislation which presumably has the got it all right. I hope the government's that it has now got it right can be realised and that there will not be further legislation to try to clarify the matter. It is interesting to consider the matters that have been overlooked, and that is obviously the case. The first matter relates to a number classes of visa. This bill creates three new classes of visa to cover people that the government tells us are already legally in Australthat is, but who previously under the Migration Act would not have got a visa to evidence their legal entitlement to be here. So it is a pretty significant defect. What are these classes? The first class is the special purpose visa. The second reading speech contained a list of the people for novel, whom the government was not going to of provide documentation to evidence their in Australia. Obviously that needs to addressed. That is why we will not oppose the this legislation. Under these special purpose visas, people will be able to fly into Australia and, provided the minister gives them a prescribed status and makes them members of a prescribed class of persons who have that status and declares that they have been granted a·speciaJ purpose visa and has declared the class of persons of which they are a member to have been granted a special purpose visa, they will be taken to be here legally, regardless of whether they have something on their passports. I am told that that wiU apply particularly for overseas defence forces that might fly in and fly out on a special mission. I suppose that, as part of that mission; this to validate their presence in Australia. The next class of visa .is the absorbed person visa. The absorption principle. was something that we were very familiar with and which the government did away with not so long ago. but the parliamentary secretary would have liked to have seen it returned. I do not know whether he will want to boast about it tonight, but the courts have recognised the absorbed person, under a doctrine which they developed and which was accepted in the migration legislation, as someone who had come into Australia illegally and had been able to remain here for a sufficiently long period that a judgment' was formed that that person had been absorbed into the' Australian community and it was then unreasonable to ask that person to leave. If one accepted that absorption as a valid principle, we would be saying to people, 'At a certain point of time we are going to reward you for your action in making yourself an illegal entrant to Australia by granting you the entitlement to be here' . . Let us understand what has happened. People were or may have, been absorbed under. the principles that operated before 2 April 1984, which is when this principle was abandoned by legislative action. An absorbed person visa will be granted to a person if that person was in Australia on2 April 1984 and had ceased to be an immigrant before that date-that m-as that they had been absorbed before that date-and if on or after 2 April he or she had not left Australia and if before 1 September 1994 he or she was not otherwise an illegal entrant. . The parliamentary secretary might clarify this if he thinks it is otherWise, but'my under-withis standing is that this relates only to people who had been absorbed before 1984 under the provisions then operating. I want to be satisfied that there is noiJltention in this matter to introduce a new class of absorbed people who might be able to obtain this visa; My reading is that that ought not to· be the case, but knowing the parliamentary secretary's interest in this matter I would, not like to think he obtained his wayby some sleight of hand. I am sure that is not possible, but his assurance is on this matter would be 'of value to' the ' House. We then move to the ex-citizens visa. It is interesting that, under the Migration Reform Act-the most thorough piece of legislation to review the Migration Act-we had people who were ex-citizens of Australia who might then have been still. legally here not being able to have a visa that would evidence that. We are dealing with people who may have been in Australia and who, through some action on their part"" presumably renounced t-eir Australian citizenship but whQ ,are still here. We are trying. to validate their entitlement to be .in Australia. ,So this class of visa is to be for a perSon who hascease.d to bean Australian citizen while iti the migration zone before 1 September 1994,' did .not leave Australia after ceasing to pe a citizenbef9re 1 September 1994 and ceases to be an Australian citizen while in the migration,zone on or after 1 September 1994., . The rationale is ,that people may by some deliberate action have renounced their citizenship-particularly 'spouses of permanent residents.' They may. have renounced their citizenship under section 17 of the Citizenship Ad, but they may have done it because they want to maintain a property interest Qvef$eas which is, incompatible with, their Australian citizenship.. All of those' sorts of situations ari,se and I suppose there could be classes of people like that for wholJl it could apply. - ut it is intere-ting that when, we drafted this legislation it. took this enQrnlo1,ls effon, ,a whole lot of independent advisers and the postponement of the implementation of if to "" .. pick up such fundamental issues. . , The second major issue that has been dealt the removal of the dichotomy.between approval and grant so that there is only one decision making process leading to the grant of a visa. I hope that helps to also remove some opportunities. for doubling up in relation to, particularly in an appeal situation, an entitlement to a review of a decision. If it some way removes one level of decision making that can lead to further administrative review, it is a worthwhile advance. Provision is also made so that protection visas may be granted as permanent visas. This reflects the decision of the government on 1 November 1993 that persons recognised by Australia as refugees under the refugee convention would be granted permanent residence rather than temporary residence, which was the policy when the reform act was enacted. Those words I have adopted-they were the government's words-belie what has been a major issue of some controversy and one which, I think, has a history that is worthy in this debate of again addressing. This matter reflected on one of the most ignominious periods of immigration administration in this country-a matter that reflected very much upon a former minister's reputation. Normally when people leave this place we do not suggest that they have given service other than of an exemplary and useful kind, but I have to say that I am one those who. believes that the record of the former member for Fremantle, Mr Dawkins, was tainted in his administration of the system of selling Australian education abroad-a program he administered in such a. way as to admit to Australia a host of people who became, even before the Tiananmen Square massacre, illegal entrants to this country. The parliamentary secretary grunts. I am sure whether he is saying that I am wrong, in which case I would challenge it, or. whether he is saying, 'This is tiresome; why is Ruddock raising it again?'. That may be a part of what it is about. But the fact is that there were people here illegally' under the arrangements that the government put in place. It left a heritage, which we are now dealing with, of some· 40,000 Chinese students who, as a result of decisions the ment has made in this parliament, will be permanent settlers in Australia despite being involved in an illegal act-that is, they were illegal entrants at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. If I remember the figures correctly-and i am always happy to be corrected in relation into these matters-about 40 per cent of those present at that time were illegal entrants. The government, because it was not willing to grant permanent residency to these people immediately, embarked upon a series of quite erratic decisions-that would be the most complimentary language one could use about the nature of those decisions-whereby people who made certain promises were given temporary entry permits to remain in Australia until such a time, as it turned out, that the government decided to grant them permanent residency, which it announced in November of last year. When the government made a decision to grant all of those Chinese students four-year temporary entry permits it was faced with a situation that there were a host of other people who came to Australia. as illegal entrants, or sought entry to Australia on other grounds, and who found it useful to apply for refugee status. We saw a blow-out in the numbers of people applying for refugee status. The numbers grew to about 2,300 people in a very short time and the government wanted to deal with that matter. How did it deal with that matter? It said to an of those people who were claiming refugee status: 'If you satisfy nationally accepted definitions and establish that you are entitled to protection in Australia, we will grant you protection but we will not grant you permanent residency'. Asa result of the decision in relation to the not Chinese students, the government then im':' posed upon all of those who were properly entitled to refugee status-and it could have numbered some 400 or so folk; I think that is probably the numbers of people who out of that process to date have been granted refugee status-only a four-year temporary entry permit, or what we called a protection visa. So not only has the government given permanent residency to all the Chinese students who governwere here at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre and accommodated a whole lot of others but obviously it had to make a decision in relation to those' who had the greatest need, the genuine refugees, those' who satisfied the test, that they be granted permanency as well. So this decision, which deals with protection visas-and the entitlement is to bea permanent visa-reflects not the recognition by Australia that as refugees under the refugee convention they should be granted permanent residency; it reflects, in fact, the government's desire in this instance to put in place now a consistent regime, one which was Australia's long standing practice and one which had to be abandoned because of the Chinese student decision.",133
213,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,You agreed with the four-year thing. What are you talking about?,136
214,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,We agreed that in the context of those circumstances which you and your colleagues had allowed to arise it was an appropriate decision to take in that context.,136
215,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,That is not what you said at the time.,136
216,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,That is what you will find I said at the time.,136
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will ignore the interruptions and address his' remarks through the chair.,136
218,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I want to move on in the moments that are left-because I would hate to see this debate not fully utilised, with all of the matters that I want to raise addressedto some of the technical matters that the parliamentary secretary has told us are being addressed, particularly as they relate to Australian citizenship. Again, we are not opposing them. They include amendments to ensure that New Zealand citizens resident in Australia continue to be regarded as permanent residents for the purposes of acquiring citizenship. Let it be understood that there has been an historic relationship between Australia and New Zealand where we have essentially had in place common border arrangements. I am worried that the efficacy of those common border arrangements is being challenged, sometimes by decisions on this side 'of the strait and sometimes by decisions on the other. It is important that the efficacy of these historic arrangements-which are unique and which I think constitute the only reasonable arrangements which discriminate in relation to people's entry. to Australia on the basis of their country of origin, and which are in effect grandfathered-be maintained by the action of both the government on this side of the strait and the government on the other side of the strait. I would not like to think that New Zealanders, in terms of the administration of what is, in fact, the common border, digressed so widely from our own criteria for determining entry that backdo(,r migration to Australia was possible for classes of people who would not access Australia by first going to New Zealand and then seeking to come to Australia. It troubles me from time to time that New Zealand is in the business of structuring its migration program in a way which may put some emphasis and weighting on country of origin or race in determining entry. If that were the case, it would be of concern to me because I do regard non-discriminatory cri. teria as being of the utmost importance. The latter provisions ensure that New Zealand citizens being parents of Australian-born children will be treated as permanent residents for the purpose of the Australian Citizenship Act. Another matter which I regard as important .allows deferral of consideration of citizenship applic-tions for 12 months while a person is under, investigation which may lead to a visa cancellatiop or criminal charge. Of concern to me in recent years have. been situations which have arisen whereby people who might otherwise have had their visas cancelled because they were improperly obtained-and it may have been because they entered into a sham marriage-went out and obtained Australian citizenship as quickly as ,they could after they obtained permanent residency improperly in order to avoid the consequences of the fact that their original entry may have been improper or illegal or improperly obtained. If this enables those matters to be"" addressed, it is a worthy advance. I would certainly appreciate clarification of all of the situations, and I could go through a list Of those that were of concern to me. I hope that the 12-month period will be sufficient. I would have thought it would have been better to be able to cancel citizenship if the original basis upon which permanent residency was obtained was a sham or fraud. I would like to think that citizenship could be cancelled because it was based upon a flawed entry. If 12 months is the only avenue we are going to have, while we will support it, I do not think it goes far enough. I did raise some general comments about the opposition's concern that in relation to the postponement and the drafting of this legislation the government had been particularly inept. I would like to put on the record a large number of quotes as to some of the comments that have been made, but having spent as much time as I have addressing particularly the issue of the Chinese students and the protection visa, I will pass over the opportunity to make some of those comments. In the five minutes that are left I want to pick up several other matters of concern to me. I have indicated that this migration reform bill has the opposition's approval, but the. opposition has beep concerned andremains concerned at the extent to which resort to judicial review is being utilised in numbers of cases for the purpose of delaying inevitable decisions that might require people to be removed from Australia. Where judiCial review becomes an abuse of process-and I think there are cases where that has now become quite evident-one has to look at whether the access to judicial review is appropriate when more than sufficient administrative review processes have already been put in place. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you would know that in relation to refugee determinations and decisions taken under the Migration Act we have two systems of administrative appealone to the Immigration Review Tribunal and another to the independent body, the Refugee Review Tribunal-which are now in place and which ought to provide that protection. In effect, if those bodies were acting unconscionably-heaven forbid that that should happen-nobody could· be denied access under the Australian constitution to· approach the High Court of Australia. But, in my view-I have put this point before, and my colleague in the other place who now acts in this portfolio area, Senator Short, has re-emphasised it-there is a proper concern about the extent to which the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act has been available in relation to migration decisions. The Migration Reform Act repeals that entitlement but substitutes now codified provisions in relation to providing specific access to judicial review on the basis of reasons outlined in the Migration Reform Act. Our view is that there is still the potential for an abuse of process in the large number of grounds that have been provided in the Migration Reform Act. For that reason,. we will continue to monitor that matter most closely. There was another report from the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. The honourable member for Calwell is no longer a member of that committee, but he may be interested to know, if he has not read the report in relation to detention practices, that there was again-with a notable dissent from one of his colleagues in the Senate-a concern expressed about the continued access to judicial review in this area. I ask that the government keep this matter alive in terms of its investigations. I will conclude by talking about one of the most difficult areas that arises in the immigration portfolio. I have highlighted it before. I know that the honourable member for Calwell will perhaps be a bit disappointed in the sense that I raise it because he has seen some Qnique opportunities in this arrangement. It has come to light recently in terms of comments that I have been receiving as I have travelled· abroad that the special assistance category, or SAC, is one that potentially has the ability to distort the migration program quite significantly. It is a fact that our hu-anitarian program-it now comprises 14,000 places and primarily in the past was intended for refugees and those who satisfied special humanitarian criteria but. who were not quite refugees and for technical reasons did not get there-was intended for those classes of people. That total program has now been absorbed to about 50 per cent by this new category. This category comprises people who are not refugees but who are presumably the most needy. It almost includes those who have not quite special humanitarian needs. It also comprises those, who are chosen on the basis of their country of origin. I do not want to get into the business saying that things are not dreadful in Bosnia or bad in the Sudan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia Burma-they obviously are. But are they all the places? Abandoning cases where people are dealt with on the basis of their ability satisfy specific criteria of need rather than country of origin criteria requires us to look at the matter very seriously. Having recently returned from Cambodia, I am very worried that the special assistance category will subsume the entry arrangements that might have normally been made under family reunion or other categories of entry. This category will distort the program. It is building up very high expectations. Essentialperiods ly, in many cases where a family reunion is involved, these people will not have to meet other criteria, such as health criteria; (Time expired)",136
219,Mr FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Reid) (8.54 p.m.)Despite all the claims that there were drafting errors, that matters were overlooked and that there is incompetence by the Department Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) or whomever, the substantive point is that today we are basically following the intent of the 1992 legislation. From my right experience here, which has not been over too many years, few people on either side of the House have the command of the law in this area of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). Howentry ever, I find from appearing on committees with him that even he is sometimes surprised and informed by departmental people as to number of the legal points in this area. sidering the amount of time the honourable member spent dealing with concerns about judicial review and giving us his thoughts on abuses in the, system through the wide repass course to legal appeals, h- should have 'in welcomed the government's decision to. try to get things right in this piece of legislation. Mr Ruddock-We are supporting it. Mr FERGUSON'-The opposition is supporting the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, but in the last half hour we have heard complaints about the fact that it has taken so long, some errors have been found, of some 'things have had to be corrected and measures need to be looked at a second time. or We have basically heard that it is dreadful that this area of the law is lending itself to abuse, iUs horrible that lawyers are exploiting to the system and it is dreadful that people's duration in this country is being lengthened by recourse to the legal system. However, at the same time, we are also hearing that it is horrible that the government has had a second look at this piece of legislation. As I have indicated"" at the end of the day we are substantially reiterating what the 1992 legislation set out to do. We are reducing the possibilities of those very appeals and lengthy of litigation that are so dreadful. As I have indicated, the legislation represents a tidying up of the 1992 legislation. It also encompasses measures to amend a variety of other pieces of legislation, including the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the Immigration (Education) Charge Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. About 10 or 15 pieces of of legislation are affected by the measures the Minister contained in this bilL A variety of visas are established through this piece of legislation. A range of protections are offered to individuals. Their of review and their right to put forward information to the department are also contained in,this legislation. Amongst those visas are the special purpose visas, which apply to those now exempt from the need to have permits. They encompass a diverse range of people, such as ship and air crews, people from Norfolk Island, representatives of !l other countries who come here for diplomatic Conpurposes, and military personnel. Further, these provisions also allow the minister to facilitate the visits of people in very urgent situations, such as funerals. They also encomthe right of the minister, where it is not the public interest' to reveal the individuals, to name those individuals and the purpose of their visit. One of the central points, as raised earlier, is the question of protection visas. From 1 March, domestic protection temporary entry permit holders will be an owed to, apply for permanent residence. ,An applicants seeking domestic protection. temporary. entry permits will be deemed to be seeking permanent residence. Between· 1 March and 1. September, when this legislation operates, they will receive entry permits. All successful new refugees will receive perm'anent residence. As the previous speaker indicated, we are basicany enforcing the decision of the government last year that changed the original intention that refugees were here only on a temporary basis to their being here on a permanent basis. Amongst the other changes is the issue of New Zealanders who were previously covered by special provisions. Under these measures they will continue to have travel facilitation. They will have no requirement of authorisation for travel prior to visits. Whilst there will be exemptions for those with criminal records held and those previously removed, essentially there' will be no practical change .in their situation. The previous speaker also detailed citizenship rights in this country and qualifying periods. The situation is that their residence in this country will be counted towards the period of permanent residence. One of the changes is that people will have to answer claims of incorrect information. They will have to give reasons why they got visas. Evidence of the circumstances will reduce the crime of giving incorrect information. ,Essentially, this legislation. brings into operation 1992 measures. It' does not open up a new area of law. It does not change the original intention of that legislation. We have heard that those opposite are not essentially opposed to the measures. An we have heard is that they believe it is improper and incorrect to have spent this period in re-evaluating a variety of measures. Mr Ruddock-Not improper, just incompetent.",138
220,Mr FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Incompetent. Without delaying the House any further, an honourable member opposite constantly bemoans the fact-l sometimes agree with him-that our system has been bedevilled by attempts by a variety of people to utilise the availability of administrative and judicial review basicany to . stay here for extensive periods. He' is complaining yet again tonight that the government has had the effrontery to look for a second time at what it has been trying to do. It has gone back, questioned some of the Provisions and come up with a degree of measures which he agrees with anyway.. . We have not heard any real objections to these measures. An we have heard is that we have committed a crime by looking at the measures to see whether there are any flaws and whether we can reduce the availability of litigation for these people. That summarises the debate. Those opposite have no major objections. They believe that it was improper to reduce the very problem that they seek to overcome. ' Mr CADMAN (Mitchell) (9.04 p.m.)There is a very basic difference between us and those opposite. In 1989 the Labor Party decided to, codify and legalise the Australian immigration program. The government took a conscious decision that it would have in the courts and before lawyers all of the details",139
221,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,:-You agreed with it.,139
222,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No, we did not. We voted against it and the honourable member knows it. The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) voted against it and so did I. We disagree in principle with the way in which the government has started to apply Australia 's. immigration program. There was no longer the capacity for the Minister, for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bo)kus) to exercise compassion .and judgment; it was all done by computers and the courts. The black and white law that those opposite wrote and forced on the Australian people was just a feeding ground for myriads of lawyersextensive costs that actually created the breeding ground for more law, more contention. If the Parliamentary' Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) doubts the truth of what I am saying, I refer him to one of his notorious reports prepared to review the act. The government reviewed the 1989 act in 1992. The report was called Review of migration decisions-the way forward. The government looked at the messed up judicial system which dealt with people's lives, tried to define compassion and relationships between people in families and people and their potential employers and tried to write it down in law. It did not work too well. In 1992 the government reviewed the whole process. It pre-eminently decided that all of this was a bit too tough. If it was messed up or wrong, it would practically give anybody the right to have it heard over again by one of the review mechanisms that the government put in place. By that very philosophical statement of saying, 'This is all too hard and all a bit messed up so we will let anybody have it checked out again', the government immediately extended exponentially the opportunity for people to stay in Australia while that process went on. Then we come to this delicious thing called absorption. It was predictably said at that time, by both the honourable member and me, that the government would create a situation where it would not be able to cope with the flood of people who are here and want eyerything reviewed. And what have we come up with? I find the parliamentary secretary, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Berowra absorbing, but I do not find any of them absorbed. In my mind that means that they disappear into the surface of the carpet like blot never to be seen again. The government has devised this type of visa which makes people disappear; they are absorbed. It has this queer philosophy that, if people can extend their period in Australia indefinitely by any form and technique-by refugee status, humanitarian purposes, a de facto relationship, perhaps a couple of kids, a good lawyer or two, then maybe the 28-day rule applies or whatever mechanism they want to dream up-eventually they become absorbed into Australia. That is nonsense. It is no wonder that people reject this approach. It has no integriThen ty. They feel that they can manipulate it and change it at whim. When they see the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); who does not appear to understand any of the rules, make an offthe-cuff decision on television before lana Wendt and say, 'Let them stay; the Chinese students can stay', he loses respect right across the world-in Asia, Europe and the United States. I believe that the parliamentary secretary started out With good intentions. I do not deny his good intentions to make this work, but the law became convoluted and difficult. There were more definitions, more categories and more classes to cover more and more gaps. Let us follow what the government has done. Since 1991, there have been 21 amendments to this simple legislation. Has the parliamentary secretary counted up the amendments that had to be made to keep this on the road, to make it understandable, as gap after gap was exposed, flaw after flaw was established in the courts or was brought to his attention? The government made 21 amendments and is trying to convince us tonight that it followed a course of action that is simple. One of the objectives of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1994,which we are dealing with tonight, is to simplify the . immigration documentation of visas and entry permits. You could have fooled me! The government has come forward with three definitions which will give it great difficulty in administration. Let us go back to 1989 when there was the significant difference of approach between the a parties to the way. in which immigration should be tackled. The government chose to go the legalistic way because it thought it was fairer, and· I acknowledge that. But it is not fair; it is harsher, less flexible, and harder for people to understand. The government is realising five years later that what we were saying at that time was right. The migration committee in 1992 had a review and in its recommendations it stated that: The committee welcomes the recent decision of the government ... the range of decisions which are subject to the general system of merit review for immigration decisions should be extended to include: a list of four items was run off, including all classes of visa and entry permits which can be applied for in Australia, discretionary components of decisions relating to those classes of visa entry permits and decisions to cancel· visa entry permits. By that time my colleague the honourable member for Berowra was tearing his hair out because, the government having put the law in place, he was given the job of trying to get a reasonable result out of this constantly shifting target and hearing the stories of the community about the legal processes involved. The honourable member for Berowra is. endeavouring to try to participate in this process and here is the government with its firSt statement-extend the review rights to practically anything that moves. No wonder it has problems. Prior to the government coming along with the Migration Laws Amendment Bill in 1993, and following this report and the legal process, it decided to instigate a bill to amend the Migration Reform Act 1992. But before the jolly thing could come into action on 1 November 1993 the government had to move amendments to it so it was postponed for practically one year until September 1994. We are still picking up the bits and pieces. Tonight we are picking up part of the 21 amendments made to this process since 1991. It is only a three-year period but the government has made 21 amendments to the act and attendant acts. The government has not got it right yet. Let us come to the legislation that is before the House tonight· and look quickly at some of the main purposes. One of the main purposes is to establish different categories of visas but, broadly, the purpose of the legislation this evening is to make changes that provide for three new classes of visas, which cover people legally in Australia who are not eligible for a visa as proposed by the Migration Review Act, and to provide for technical errors and some changes to citizenship law. What are the proposals for the new visas? The special purpose visa is for people who have a prescribed status. That means that the minister or somebody is able to say, 'We want these people to stay in Australia' or 'They ought to have a right to stay here'. The minister may invent on an ad hoc basis an imrriigration program all of his own under this proposal. I do not expect that he will, but the minister may declare that a group of people have a special purpose in being in Australia and should be granted a special purpose visa. Then there is the absorbed persons visa, which I spoke about earlier. These visas are for people who have been in Australia since prior to 2 April 1984 and who have ceased to be immigrants before 2 April 1994. I guess the definition of the act shows what ceasing to be an immigrant means. That is a very interesting point because, as my colleague the honourable member for Berowra has pointed out, that presupposes that at some point in time a person ceases being an immigrant and is absorbed. How do we enforce that rule? Is it a capacity to identify with Australian culture? Is it a capacity to speak English? Is it a length of time? Is it the fact that they have married or are raising children here? What is the criteria the government is going to use to decide whether a person is absorbed or not? This is a ridiculous concept. It cannot be applied with any objectivity whatsoever. The Labor Party certainly claims that it is on about objectivity in the immigration process. But it is not. It is going to grant this absorbed persons visa on some definition of when it considers that a person ceases to be an immigrant.",139
223,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,No.,141
224,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"That is exactly the case. The government should look at it. It is exactly the case when a person has ceased to be a migrant before 2 April 1984. I am right. The parliamentary secretary also needs to understand that if people ceased to be immigrants before 2 April 1984; if, on or after 2 April 1984 and before 1 September 1994 they had not left Australia they are not illegal immigrants. We have a crazy concept of trying to absorb somebody. Absorption was a constitutional doctrine, I .understand, developed by the High Court in the ex parte Walsh and Johnson case. It was a doctrine stated by Mr Justice Starke in that case. He set out the concept of what absorption really meant. We have picked that up and written it into the law. It is not the first time that this parliament has made a decision of that type based on some quite strange notion presented by a judge in the High Court. It should be worked through and really analysed because I do not think it is a real assessment. Then there is the ex-citizen's visa for people who suddenly decide that they .do not handled. want to be Australian citizens anymore but want to retain the right to go on living here. If they give up their citizenship, assessment ought to be made of whether they qualify 'to remain ·as. permanent residents Australia. I cannot see why the government has to raise these complicated concepts. The concept that it is raising here is making definitions, more court cases, more lawyers wealthy, and more people unhappy because the complexity of what it has done. The shocked creation of this new class will avoid the situation where such persons could automatied cally .become unlawful. We want to make them lawful non-citizens rather than unlawful non-citizens; .is that not right?",141
225,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Yes.,142
226,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"This is a confused concreated cept. We cannot have them being unlawful non-citizens. We want them to be lawful noncomplete citizens subject to mandatory detention removal. Nobody has talked about that issue but the government has raised a whole new concept of ex-citizens visas to cover a flaw that it previously created. There is a concept of breaching visas under clause 10, there are various delegations to the Attorney-General and there is the removal of unlawful nonnot. citizens and other matters in the bill. I have despaired over the last four or five years watching what the Australian govern the ment has done to immigration. I do not willy-nilly believe it has integrity because of the comto plexity of the laws it has made. It is possible for the average migrant, or the deserved. average new arrival, to understand the rationale of how the system operates because of processes of the law. The government's delays and the slowness and lack of raticinalehave frustrated people. On top of that; we had to make decisions under the regulations to create special visa classes for PRC and other nationals. That was a shameful thing. Ultimately, the government made that decision because people had stayed here long enough and had been persuasive enough in the election campaign. You had to face an answer or two about the way you had been treated and whether or not the support they gave you. was legitimate and properly",142
227,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will address maybe an his remarks through the chair. Mr CADMAN.....:. Mr Deputy Speaker, I of know that you would be aware of the problems that the parliamentary secretary faced on that occasion and his need to explain himself. more That process was undertaken by a group of people and the response they received from of the Australian government completely all that we stood for in a justifiable immigration program. The government decidit would let the whole thing go at that point. The then Prime· Minister led the way, but nobody stood against him-certainly not publicly. Under the regulations we have recently special visa classes for PRC and other nationals-a' carte blanche decision to allow entry and permanent residency of a and whole class of people based purely on the time that they entered Australia and their nationality. I cannot remember that ever being done before: based purely on the time they entered Australia and their nationality. There are poor old retired Brits around the place that do not know whether they are Australians or The government will not pass anything to help them out of their trouble. I do not believe that we should necessarily do that, but government is prepared to pass regulations based on race and the time of entry Australia to give people permanent residennot cy-something that they had not earned or . I am for case by case decisions. That should the not be moved away from. The government must stick to that if it is to retain integrity and any semblance of a non-discriminatory program-something that the government espouses and· talks about frequently. If the government wants it to be selective but nondiscriminatory, it has to do it case by case and be fair internationally, not just to the electorate or the people supporting the government in the campaign. It has to stand on its . feet internationally. The government should be proud and prepared to do that, but it has not done that: It has wrecked the Australian· immigration program, and I am concerned that decent people who espouse good causes have been sucked into supporting a program that, through indolence, connivance and weakness, corrupted the whole process of immigration to Australia.",142
228,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"CalweII---' Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (9.23 p.m.)-in reply-I thank the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the honourable· member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) for their contributions to the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill. We have had a very wide ranging discussion. Much reference has been made to various matters in the past and selective views of history, especially immigration history, have been put. Members of the opposition forget the fact that I was chairman of the committee dealing with migration regulations for a.record seven years. I know something about the history. It was very interesting· to hear the honourable member for Mitchell suggest that the opposition was entirely. opposed to the regulations process. He failed to mention that that occurred when he was the shadow minister.",143
229,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,You are wrong.,143
230,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The honourable member has had his go and should now listen. When he was replaced as shadow minister by the honourable member for Berowra-the then honourable member for Dundas-the honourable member for Berowra came to an agreement with the government on the regulations approach. The essence of that agreement, if I correctly remember it, was that certain provisions, like sunset provisions, would be added to the regulations and, most importantly, that the then Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations be formed with the task of going through all of the regulations to determine whether significant amendments should be made. The honourable member for Mitchell might recall that there was some urgency in the meetings of that committee. I can remember endless days and evenings of meetings· when that committee-of which the honourable member for Berowra was a member-went through and found a number of problems with the regulations, as a result of which we then put amendments in place. In addition to that, we determined that a number of key issues were encapsulated within the regulations concerning policy determinations. The charter of the committee was draWn up after the election of 1990 in such a way that we could look into policy issues as well as regulation questions. The committee then produced reports in areas of concern to the honourable member for Berowra, including three matters that have been mentioned here today. There was the report on illegal immigration. That was when the issue of absorption was raised. Then there was the report on marriage and de facto relationships-one of the most important reports in international terms to analyse the issues concerned with immigration and marriage. Then there was the report on refugee and humanitarian issues. Following each of these reports, the government adopted a number of recommendations. Sometimes the committee was so concerned about the need for urgent action that the government adopted preliminary committee reports as a matter of policy in order to ensure that the regulations were put in place. In 1992 the government decided to introduce the reform act. After all, the regulations approach had been a new approach in immigration. It was decided that a number of important drafting and conceptual issues had to be resolved· about the application of the regulations and visas. These things have now been resolved in the act. The act ought to be welcomed from the point of view, as the honourable member for Mitchell mentioned, of simplification and clarification and making it easier for people. As a result of this legislation,lawyers will not be able to get as much out of the process as they did before. There will be greater simplification of the situation. Access for ordinary people .will be easier under the immigration law. The whole system has been made much easier· to understand and to put into practice. So, although we have had a learning process in relation to this whole regulations approach-there is no doubt that we have had a lot of angst about it-as a consequence of that learning process, we have been able to put this bill into place which will achieve a very good result in making the law fairer, simpler and better to implement. I tum to some of the specific matters raised by the honourable member for Berowra. He raised the question over and over-it was repeated by the honourable member for Mitchell-about the absorbed person visa. Obviously, he has not read the bill, because clause 26AB(1) makes it clear that persons eligible for these visas are people who arrived in Australia on or before 2 April 1984. Noone who arrived in Australia",143
231,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,So that is the date people cease.to be migrants?,144
232,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Mitchell has had his go. Why does he not just listen? He might learn something from the legislation. The reality is that people Who came before 2 April 1984 were subject to a particular provision. That was the so-called absorption test, which both the honourable member for Berowra· and the honourable member for Mitchell have decried. Irrespective of whether or not they decry it, that test existedMr Ruddock-And the government abandoned it.",144
233,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Yes, our government abandoned it. This test existed for the many years that your party was the government.The absorption test was not introduced by the Labor Party. It was in existence for many years-as I understand it, as far back as the 1920s or something of that sort. On 2 April 1984-that is, shortly after coming into government-we took out the so-called absorption test.·· Mr Ruddock-You want to bring it back.",144
234,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,The honourable member for Berowra keeps interrupting.,144
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Mr Hollis)Order! The honourable member for Berowra will cease interrupting.,144
236,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Those opposite have had a very fair go. They asked a lot of questions. They said, 'We hope the parliamentary secretary will take time to answer our questions'. lam trying to answer their questions. Both of them talked of the absorbed person visa as though it currently applies to people. It applies only to people who came to Australia under special circumstances before 2 April 1984. That is the point. So let us forget about that. The honourable member for Mitchell, in attempting to talk about the absorbed person visa as though it ha.s some application, for example, to the Chinese students or to any other such categories is quite mistaken. Let us now tum to the other two issues. The honourable member for Berowra raised the special assistance category. I am very disappointed in his raising this issue. Mr Ruddock-Be very careful with that program.",144
237,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The special assistance category is a humanitarian category which assists people who are in very dangerous situations in various places around the world, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mr Ruddock interjecting",144
238,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member for Berowra knows that he should not constantly interject!,144
239,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"And other places. For example, I know that Sri Lanka isa concern of yours, Mr Deputy Speaker. These places have been identified. Cambodia is another one. What is the honourable member for Berowra suggesting? Is he suggesting that the introduction of this category will somehow create massive problems in the immigration program. Why? It is simply a humanitarian version of our general refugee conception .. Basically, it is a humanitarian version of our refugee conception. The implication of his comments was that people will be coming into the country willy-nilly. That is not true. In many cases people have to establish some connection with Australia-relatives, sponsors or some other connection that they may have with Australia, as in the case with the Cambodian category. . The special assistance category is one of the most important hwnanitarian measures that we have put in place. I congratulate the ministers not only for putting it in place but also for persisting with it. It enables us to deal, in a quick way, with problems that arise around the world. The minister is able todecIare a particular area of the world as coming under that category and, therefore, can deal quickly with it. . To suggest there is some problem with the special assistance category is quite incorrect. I am surprised at the hopourable member for Berowra. After all, he is a member of Amnesty International. He berates the government from time to time on human rights issues for not doing sufficientfor individuals who may be in difficulties. I am really surprised at him raising this issue. As I have said, this is one of the major humanitarian categories in which we can do something---:and do something concrete and quickly. We do not have to wait around for people who are in totally distressed circumstances and then say to the in, 'You prove to us you've been persecuted by some regime'. What a nonsense. Imagine saying to a refugee from Bosnia-Herzegovina, 'You prove to us that you've been persecuted specifically by this group or that group'. The UNHCR definitions have an important role but, in certain circumstances, ate too narrow. This category takes that into account and gives special consideration to those people. It is a great humanitarian act. It not only is a very important part of our general refugee humanitarian program but also plays a significant role in our foreign policy. Australia's international reputation has gone up as a result of the introduction of this category. This category can be used to· allow people to come from these places and, as I have said, we are able to make decisions quicklyBoth the honourable member for Berowra and the honourable member for Mitchell raised the question of the decision concerning the Chinese students. We know the opposition's position on this matter. We know of the position that the honourable member for Berowra has sustained for a number of years. He put it into the report. Those opposite managed to get a majority on the parliamentary committee because some members of our party decided that they would not go along with the determinations made by the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the Chinese student issue. If anyone wants to traverse all the decisions in relation to that matter, the fundamental point was that a Prime Minister of Australia made a commitment to a particular group of people about their future. The honourable member for Mitchell talked about people's futures. We made a commitment to people on the basis of an assessment that they potentially would be in danger if they returned to their country of origin. Our international reputation as a nation was going to be judged on the basis of that commitment. Irrespective of whether the commitment was right or wrong or should or should not have been made, the fact is that it was made. To suggest, after a Prime Minister had made such a commitment and people were entitled to believe that they would at least be protected for a time, that it was then possible to tum around and go against that commitment is a nonsense. '",144
240,Mr SINCLAIR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,But you turned around immediately afterwards. You couldn't make your mind up. You gave them temporary entry permits.,145
241,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"We have now been joined by the right honourable member for New England, who has suddenly become an expert in the matter. I remember that the right honourable member for New England was on the parliamentary committee. Unlike the honourable member for Berowra, he at least attempted to have some sympathy for these people whereas the honourable member for Berowra apparently had none. Mr Ruddock-I beg your pardon!",145
242,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,The honourable member for Berowra apparently had no sympathy for the plight of these people. Mr Ruddock - I was very concerned to make sure we didn't have a discriminatory system.,145
243,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Order! I am very concerned about the constant interjections by the honourable member for Berowra, which will·cease. Mr Ruddock interjecting",146
244,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Rubbish. The honourable member for Berowra has put his view on many occasions. He has had his go. He thinks he can get up here and try to criticise the government's position onMr Ruddock-What sanctimonious nonsense.,146
245,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Sanctitnonious nonsense?,146
246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Order! Ever since I have been in the chair, I. have constantly asked the honourable member for Berowra not to interject. I would appeal to you at this late hour tonight to please not interject any more. The parliamentary secretary must not respond to these interjections, regardless of how provocative they are. Let us proceed with harmony on all sides tonight, especially while I am in the chair.",146
247,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I did not know that the purpose of parliament was to avoid debate. The honourable member for Berowra made a number of criticisms of the government on this matter. I am trying to reply to him. He seems to think that whenever one replies to his criticisms, one is not entitled to make a valid point. It as though the whole of morality and integrity lies on the view that he has held. If he had persisted with his view, he knows very well it would have meant the expulsion of more than 20,000 people from this country who would not have been eligible for the criteria which he would have put into place. These are people who had been promised by the former Prime Minister that they would never be required to leave against their will. That is the reality. There is no attempt to be sanctimonious. It is a simple fact that the situation which these people found themselves in, not as a consequence of a decision which they made, but of a promise made by a former Prime Minister, and reinforced by the current Prime Minister, does place and did place obligations on us, and we had a very important moral obligation to meet them. The honourable member for Berowra also raised the question of citizenship cancellation. He asked why it is that if we detect that somebody has made a false statement, we do not then cancel their citizenship, even if the 12 months is up. I do not think he quite understands the provisions. I had better go over this situation because it might be important. The situation is that the 12 months applies in the case where the department suspects that there may have been a non-genuine situation, for example, a non-genuine marriage or something of that sort. The department is able, without going to a court, to exercise a power to defer the matter for 12 months. The provision of cancelling citizenship where one goes to a court and establishes that a person has made false declarations applies irrespective of any period of time. So there is clearly a difference here. As far as I understand it, the provisions with respect to citizenship cancellation where one applies to a court and establishes that a person made false declarations will still apply, irrespective of the period of time. With this measure, we have given a 12-month deferral in relation to the matter. I conclude by saying that this legislation clarifies the position. It is intended to simplify the Immigration Act in a very important way, is especially with respect to applications and with respect to people's rights. I commend the department for the way in which it put it together so that it achieves this result. It will overcome the problems mentioned by the honourable member for Mitchell. This clarification of the act will be of great importance in getting our immigration system together, and I welcome it. I ask that the House approve it. Question resolved in the affirmative.

250,Mr KNOTT,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"Since there has been a break in. my speech I will reiterate the points I made previously. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in speaking on the National Agenda for Women 'on 10 February 1993, put forward a program which showed that this government has done extensive work in improving the lot of women in terms of the legal position of women in the community,child-care, attention to violence perpetrated against women and health. This statement prior to the election set out where we had been· and where we were going. I previously pointed out the great contribution that has been made in this House by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) who I am privileged to see is presently in the House and by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). I will reread a quote from the Bulletin of 22 March 1994: They are the caped crusaders o.f law refo.rm, the federal go.vernment'so.wn Batman and Ro.bin co.me to. save the co.untry fro.m marauding lawyers: Attorney-General Michael Lavarch and Justice Minister Duncan Kerr are attempting' to. smash do.wn the walls o.f mo.ney and privilege that have long divided the ordinary folk from the legal profession. The catch cry of these ernest young babyboomers in the Keating ministry is that justice should be fairer, cheaper and more accessible to ordinary Australians-even if it means taking on some powerful interests. This dynamic duo who are taking on the Australian legal system must be commended for their actions. I will now refer to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General was virtually the author of a previous report Half way to equal. It was a landmark report based on a commitment shown by the Attorneyvoluntarily General in his. previous capacity. It was commitment unparalleled in that it has ted in him now being in the elevated position of Attorney-General. As I pointed out earlier, this place and the political spectrum is littered with individuthe as-the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) knows what I am states talking about-who are very heavy on rhetorone ic and very light on action. I am privileged be in the same government, the same and the same party as the Attorney-General, who has taken a new line. He has put the rhetoric out and is acting upon it, and he is bringing a commendable set of changes to the legal processes of this country. The Minister for Justice has also made remarkable contributions. The Attorneyto General and the Minister for Justice, along with our Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who the guiding light-the philosophical leaderview in this regard, have done amazing things in terms of recognising the discrimination nature women have faced within our society. But is they are not just recognising it. As the right honourable member for New Englan,d would know, it is easy to recognise but it is much more difficult to have the intestinal fortitude-I will refrain from using that other more coarse word-to do something about it. The accolade in the Bulletin-which is not necessarily noted as a pro-Labor publicahas tion-pointed out the magnificent and heroic tasks these gentlemen have undertaken. I refer to an address that the Minister for Justice gave to the national Left seminar in Canberra of. on 24 July 1993. He referred to the politics of inclusion. The politics of inclusion is all about allowing people who are discriminated against in society access and a say in the justice system. The Minister for Justice also made another landmark speech, 'Half by the year 2000', in which he put forward his view that more women should be in this place. In regard to the report Equality before the law, one should surely take note of the under-representation of women in this place. I subscribe to the Jim Carlton view that the only way to get equal representation is to legislate; it will not be done by parties. It seems to me a that the most logical way to do that would be resulto have male and female members in each electoral seat, elected by all people within the area. The thing that attracts to me to Jim Carlton's proposition is not the duplication or larger number of politicians that would be around-I personally would like to see the as part of that process-but the fact that day we would not have equal representato tion and the very next day after that election House we would have equal representation. We should remember that this is the centenary of voting for women in South Australia. It has taken 100 years of struggles to get the meagre representation they have today. I do not want to see women, being 50 to 51 per cent of the population, take another 100 years get what they are entitled to. The Minister for Justice has put himself on the line and has is indicated where he stands on this issue. My is that we should take Jim Carlton's position seriously and when we do change the of our political system, which I believe inevitable, use the politics of inclusion and ensure that there is equal representation. Further, the Minister for Justice, in a speech in Rockhampton on 3 September 1993 entitled 'The law and Australian women: towards equality in 2000', .indicated a number of things which should be brought to the attention of this House in terms of what our record been and where we are going. (Extension of time granted) It is the 10th anniversary of the federal Sex Discrimination Act. I think that is an important thing we should take note",147
251,Mr HOWARD,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,Did you vote for it?,148
252,Mr KNOTT,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,Of course I did. I support the Sex Discrimination Act.,149
253,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW REFORM COMMISSION, side The honourable member for Gilmore should know that he should not respond to interjecto tions.,149
254,Mr KNOTT,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will take notice of what you have said. Since the introduction of the Sex Discrimination Act, there have been a number strategic and important amendments to it which have gone further to make sure that women have the right to live their lives free of discrimination and enjoy equality before sition. the law. Amendments were made to the act to insert a definition of 'family responsibilities', to prohibit dismissal of an employee on the ground of his or her family responsibilities an extensionand to prohibit direct and indirect discrimination against workers with family responsibiligive ties. The Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice were very much involved in those amendments coming into place. The federal government's 'Reclaiming justice' speech was another step forward for women. The Prime Minister's speech, 'Reto claim the night', took further action to address the issue of violence against women. That speech stated: Violence against women is intolerable ... Australian women are entitled to be safe, and to feel safe on the streets and in their homes. I know that personal safety is of major concern to Australcountry. Ian women ... It is the responsibility of democratdenied ic governments to fight for freedom from fear the same way that we fight poverty, repression or discrimination of any kind. The Commonwealth has put out a community education program called 'Stopping violence against women'. This program involves things like community grants and gender awareness programs. Considerable resources, and conwould siderable publicity, hav- been put into that program. There are also a number of forthsuggest coming projects. One particular campaign the consent campaign for young people, 'No' means 'No'. Resources will be put in place this year to enable that community message to go out and be sustained. It is a part of three-year program of gender awareness. I now tum to the Family Law Act and the amendments that have been made in that act. Another couple of great contributors from this of the House have been involved in this. I again refer to the Attorney-General and also the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan). The contribution these people have made is commendable. It is something that would never have happened under the coalition because, like osof triches, their heads are in the sand.",149
255,Unknown,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,Honourable members interjecting,149
256,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,Order! There are far too many interjections from the oppo brought about the inquiry. We give this man,149
257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,You did not him an extension; the House granted him an extension. We have had far too many interjections from the opposition side.,149
258,Mr KNOTT,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not know that I necessarily need it from lightweights. I refer the Ronald Sackville inquiry, which was also organised by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice. The Sackville report will also advise on ways to reform the system. All of these actions are attempting to all bring justice and equality to women. I comment on access to legal aid in this One of my constituents was recently legal aid by the opposition's mates in in New South Wales. Her case concerned access to her children. She has already had one child taken away from her and her case concerning two other children is still pending in the court. She asked for legal aid, but she was denied on two counts: firstly, that there· was no benefit for her and, secondly, that she not be subject to severe deprivation if not legally aided. On both of those counts, I to this house that having custody of is one's children is a major issue. The opposition's mates in New South Wales have a lot to answer for, when we consider those people who are trying to keep their families a together and look after their own rights, but have them taken away from them. I turn to the judiciary. A lot has been done in the area of the judiciary, such as awareness programs. The Attorney-General has been at the forefront in this area. The dynamic duo of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice have taken on the legal profession and those who think that they are above the law because they control it-the justices. The Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice said to the justices, 'You must be aware of gender; you must broaden your aspects; you must under!itand that there are people other than white Anglo-Saxon males'. The Attorney-Geileral has taken the courageous action of ensuring that there will be a broadening of the base in the non-judiciary and the judiciary. What that means in a multicultural country in which 51 per cent of the population is female is that we will not only find people in black gowns who are white Anglo-Saxon males. We may even have a mixture of males and females who do not happen to have a Celtic background. We may have. sOIne Asian judges with an Australian background. We· may. even have some black judges with an Australian background These actions portend well for the legal system in this country because we will have a broader base. So when cases which require someone with a broader view of the world are put forward, they will get. some representation. We will have people who have a broader understanding of the world-not this narrow, parochial view of people holding those positions now. I do not claim that all judges are bigoted and narrow-:minded. Many of them are very good people. But we need to understand that some of those people are captives of their generations, as are certain people in this House. They are caught up in that and they cannot escape it. Debate (on motion by Ms De-hm) journed. . NA . BILL (No.4) 1993 Reference to Standing Committee Debate resumed.",149

268,Mr BEAZLEY,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"Would you get Alasdair back again, Maggie?",151
269,Ms DEAHM,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"Alasdair has backed off at last, I am glad to say. I commend the Law Reform Commission for this interim report, which is an extremely important one. As honourable members may remember, the proposal for the report was launched at the National Agenda for Women function at the Bankstown town hall last year in the. lead-up to the 1993 federal election. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the plan to commission this report at that time. It was result of a lot of disquiet expressed by many women in the community across the board about the disadvantages that women suffered at the hands of the law. It was brought to a head at that time by some of the pronouncementsof certain judges in rape and sexual assault cases. I take this opportunity to commend the Prime Minister for commissioning the report. The Prime Minister certainly does respect the role of women in society, politics and every walk of life. I also endorse the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore regarding the report entitled Halfway to equal and those who put that together, because it certainly has launched that process for women. We have come a long way. I made a speech in this place a few weeks ago about the family, at which time. I alluded. to a lot of issues relating to my own family. I was concerned at the time about doing that. So I checked the credibility of that with some of my older colleagues-and I mean older in service, not in years. They said, 'Five years ago you could not have got away with it, but today you can'. I think it is great that women have the opportunity to push the boundaries occasionally. As I have said, I think this is an important report. I am a conscientious representative of an electorate which, as do all electorates, comprises a lot of women. I pulled together a group of women from my electorate and held a consultation about the proposal for report. I was privileged on that occasion to have someone from the Law Reform Commission visit us and sit with us throughout that consultation. It was extremely productive and it formed the basis of the submission that I made to the inquiry. On that occasion I had women from women's health centres; Quota clubs; women's refuges; neighbourhood centres; my local university, the University of Western Sydney; and the Union of Australian Women. I also had women from different legal professions, either in private practice or from community legal centres. I had women from the youth refuges and the older women 's network. As can be seen, a broad cross-section of women attended. Others attended simply in their own right as individuals. A number of issues came out of that consultation. I must say that it was extremely lively. It went on for probably twice the time that I expected it to. At the end, the women were calling for another meeting but, unfortu""""\ nately, we did not have time to do that. I would like to go over some of the issues brought up at that consultative meeting. First and foremost of those concerned Aboriginal women. The Aboriginal woman who brought this issue up in fact worked at the local women's refuge. She pointed out something that the rest of us simpiy did not know at that time; that is, the Aboriginal Legal Service is unable to act for Aboriginal women in cases of domestic violence because it is also obliged to act for the men. So we are faced with something of a dilemma. I think it is appropriate that we have an Aboriginal· Legal Service that works for Aboriginal people who have problems with the law,but, unfortunately, most of the Aboriginal women do have problems with domestic violence and, as the service is obliged to act for the husbands as well, this simply is not possible. Whether we call for a separate service to service those women or whether they have to go to. independent legal advisers is· something that I think we need to resolve. Another issue was social security. It was felt by most of the women at the meeting that there is an assumption of women's dependenthis cy on men in most of the dealings with the social security system. I referred to a matter in this place shortly after my election-I seem to remember that it was the first time. I was heckled by the honourable member for Bennelong. I mentioned several cases where women had been charged with obtaining a benefit illegally from the Department of Social Security when, after obtaining a benefit as a sole parent, they cohabited with a man and did not declare a change in their circumstances. I agreed that the women ought to be brought to account for those misdemeanours, but I was very disturbed at the fact,. as were these women at our consultative meeting, that the men concerned got off scot free. I am glad that since that time the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has rectified that situation. But it does show that the security' legislation is geared towards that dependency of women on men. Most of the women felt that there was a fundamental, systemic bias in the law. They felt that piecemeal reform to selected areas may be inadequate unless the underlying assumptions are questioned and changed. For example, the concept of reasonableness has been applied in ways which do not adequately take into account women's reactions to situations such as domestic violence. Criminal law defences of provocation and self-defence need to. be looked at from a woman's point of view. Similarly, some women in genuine fear of spousal violence have difficulty convincing a magistrate that' their fear is reasonable if their circumstances do not seem frightening from a male outsider's point of view. The possibility of getting 'government funding for an organisation that could run test cases on issues of particular concern to women was also discussed. They also discussed penalties for crimes and the disparities between the penalties received by men and women for similar crimes. Often the violent crime perpetuated by a woman is seen as much more shocking than that of a man. This is reflected in the penalties. Some of our older women raised the issue of wills and estates and the challenges to intestate estates, which seemed to drag on forever and leave widows in great distress while being subjected to vicious personal attacks by other relatives wishing to gain from a share of an estate. They suggested that strict time limits should be set and personal attacks discouraged. Legal aid is one of the issues which is dealt with very strongly in the report. There was general agreement that there was no real equality for women before the law when it came to dispensing legal aid. They felt that legal aid must be made available to women confronting individual men and institutions. Another issue I have already alluded to is that of judicial attitudes. We have had a few shocking examples of that with judges making what seem to women to be quite outrageous social judgments concerning rape and domestic violence. Protection from violence, custody and access, and the Child Support Agency were other issues discussed by these women. Court waiting times was another issue discussed. It was pointed out that this causes great hardship in some situations and often danger to women while they are waiting for their cases to be brought on. It was felt that in administrative structures there was a need for a special women's unit in the Attorney-General's Department to alert the government to gender implications of relevant laws and practices. I do not know whether the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has given some thought to that. Those are the things that were discussed by that consultative meeting. As I have said, it was an extremely livelyone. I think we c.an see that this report, certainly from my own experience, has been based on listening to women. I listened to the women in my electorate and the Law Reform Commission certainly has listened to the women who made submissions to it. There are a number of issues we can raise from that. The importance of the investigation by the Law Reform Commission is that it highlights women's actual, lived experiences of the law. Nobody can point to any actual law which clearly has one rule for men and another rule for women, but the totality of the administration, resourcing and attitudes Of the system of justice in Australia often has failed or disappointed women who have sought protection or rystitution. Not all women's experiences are the same. Some women are worse affected than others. The report notes, for example, that Aboriginal women, as· I have already mentioned, have great difficulty getting protection from police and are wary of seeking police help because of their experiences with police who have shown insensitivity and, at times, prejudice and denigration. The single most significant and recurring theme raised in the submissions to the inquiry is violence against women. I think all previous speakers on this matter have alluded to that particular subject. In fact, 65 per cent of the submissions to the inquiry dealt with issues of violence. I note that Australia is a signatory to the International Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women. It is vital that we address the issue raised in this report at all levels of government. Some of the experiences recounted in submissions to the inquiry tell a chilling tale of indifference, ineffectiveness of formal protection mechanisms and inaccessibility by many women to measures designed for their protection, which all too often result in tragic exposure to violence and abuse. Anyone who has read the report cannot help but be struck by its opening paragraph. How many reports have opened with a paragraph which deals with one woman's experience? Anyone who read the Weekend Australian last week will know about that woman's experience because, after giving evidence to the inquiry, she has now gone public in order to protect other women from similar situations. This particular woman was subjected to violence continually by her husband. When she fled, she left her young son. She was in a state of stress and eventually the husband gained custody of the child. The young child was then shot by the father, who then turned the gun on himself. The father died and the young son is now recovering from his injuries. Her evidence was given to the inquiry before that incident, but the effects of that recorded in the report. I think that is a very shocking incident, which I think needs to be brought home to all of us. The major recommendation of the report is the establishment of a national women's justice program, which would address specific discrimination issues, including access, and correct the imbalance which currently exists in the provision of legal aid, which has tended to disadvantage women. The facts are that men get 63 per cent of legal aid money. Legal aid prioritises providing representation for people charged with crimes, mostly men. Victims of violence, mostly women, get little or no legal aid to assist them to take steps to obtain protection orders or compensation. Lack of legal assistance affects outcomes of court cases and even the decision to take legal action at all. I know a lot of women who say, 'I simply can't afford to take legal action'. Women under-represented or unable to pursue a case through appeal after their funds have been exhausted are less likely to be able to articulate their claims so that they are dealt with fairly against a better resourced, .more publicly experienced, confident and often better legally represented opponent. The proposed national women's justice program recommends that close attention be paid to more equitable resourcing of legal services for women. It is based on the women's health program model, which we all know is working successfully in providing women's health services to women across the community. Legal aid centres in my electorate do much vital work giving advice and assistance to women who would not otherwise qualify for legal aid in family and domestic violence situations. However, the funding levels are clearly inadequate to address all needs of the community. I hope that this strategy will focus attention on priorities within the legal aid budget to provide better resources and access for women to ensure that women get the justice they deserve.",151
270,Mr DODD,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"I am very pleased to take this opportunity to support the motion that the House take note of the Law Reform Commission's interim are report on women's access to the legal system. There have been a great deal of submissions to this report and even in this short time there has been an unprecedented level of public interest in the inquiry. Clearly women have had a lot to say about access to the legal system, particularly the myriad of ways in which the legal system does not, in effect, provide equality of access for women. Women in my electorate in far north Queensland welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the Australian Law Reform Commission's inquiry and lodged a comprehensive submission, which I am pleased to say is liberally quoted in chapter 2 of the interim report. The Australian Law Reform Commission also held public hearings in Cairns in September 1993. It is very important that the voices of women in far north Queensland have the opportunity to be heard in this inquiry because all too often previousAboriginal ly they went unheard because of isolation and remoteness. Women in my electorate face the same obstacles to access to justice identified interim report as women Australia-wide. These are: lack of awareness of their legal rights and of legal services, the fact that key players in the legal system-police, lawyers and the courts-often do not understand or respond appropriately to women's experiences, and the fact that women are often financially less well-off than men and therefore less able to meet legal costs. As well, the report highlights the inaccessibility of the courts to women due to factors such as lack of child-care. Obviously these factors are shared by women in my electorate, but in addition, women in my electorate, women in communities such as Cooktown, Weipa, Coen, Thursday Island and even the more remote communities in the Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait, also have to deal with problems arising from remoteness and isolation. I see that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is here. He has been here for a long time. He represents the National Party of Australia. One of the trends worldwide is that rural women have taken on more and more in the rural crisis that has occurred worldwide as a result of factors such as the decrease in commodity prices. Women have taken on more and more of the farm duties. There is considerable statistical evidence to back this up. This means that women in rural communities face more adversity. They are in remote areas. They are faced with more and more duties in the home, more and more responsibilities on the farm, and yet they suffer from all the problems of remoteness. This report highlights those difficulties in relation to the law. There is another group of people in my electorate who perhaps suffer three times the problems of inequality and .access. They are Aboriginal and Torres Strait island women. Not only do they suffer the inequality that has been highlighted in this report, and not only do they live in remote areas, but also they suffer· all the prejudice that is suffered by and Torres Strait Island people in Australia. The women of far north Queensland speak for themselves in the introduction to their in the submission to the Australian Law Reform inquiry. It is worth reading that introduction. It says: On June 16 1993 a group of about 20 women met in the Cairns Women's Centre for an exchange of ideas about 'women and the law' with a view to presenting a submission to the Australian Law Reform Commission's inquiry into Gender Equity Before the Law. We .spent considerable time sharing our personal experiences of the law as well as those of our friends, relatives and colleagues. We identified 13 areas of the law we felt should have priority and a convenor was appointed for each of those. The submission has since then taken on a form of its own. It is now organised very loosely according to the topics in the commission's Discussion Paper· No. to. Contributors' original submissions are preceded by a brief summary of the issues discussed in each section. Perspectives and styles differ throughout the submission and sometimes our argumentS contradict each other. We are happy to present a document that is ambivalent, a document that reflects the diversity and complexity of our lives. While the submission is a reflection of the diversity of the experiences of women in far north Queensland, it is also about aspects of life which are common to all women in the north. One such factor is isolation. To varying degrees remoteness affects the way in which women are able to access information, legal advice, support services, the legal processes and also to engage in public and political life. For those in the remotest part of fa-,north Qlleen-land, the day-today of women are profoundly affected by isolatipn. The issue of remoteness also affects the women's ability to .contribute to consultation processes, including. that of the Australian Law Reform Commission. We made attempts to include the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in this submission however there is a clear need for the ComITlission to employ a liaison officer to consult with indigenous people in a cultuiallyappropriate way. The submission was prepared by women from' the Cairns community, including women from the AntiDiscrimination Commission, Cairns Campus Student Association, Cairns Community Legal Centre, Cairns Business Women's Association, Cairns Women's Centre, the Domestic Niolence Unit, Family Resource Service, Mookai-Rosie Women's Hostel, Self-health for Workers in the Sex Industry, Ruth's Women's Shelter and the Women's Electoral Lobby. The submission was prepared by a broad cross-section of women in Cairns. I would like to make special mention of the efforts of the Women's Electoral Lobby in Cairns over the years and, in particular, the indomitable spirit of WEL's convenor in Cairns, Ms Joan Trewern, I note that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) acknowledges the work of Joan Trewern. Joan has been prolific in the letters page to the Cairns Post, for years and years putting the same arguments that are highlighted in this report. I would wager there is not a Queensland government minister over the last decade who has not received a letter from Joan. She was an especially vocal opponent of the repressive policies of the National Party government in Queensland. She is also keeping Premier Goss on his toes. Joan has provided submissions to just about every inquiry into issues affecting women in Queensland and the nation and she singlehandedly produc- . es a monthly newsletter that keeps all of the mailingJist up-to-date with issues that concern women in Cairns and around the country. The submission from women from Far North Queensland was·, very much a community based group effort. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all those women who put their valuable time into the submission. The interim report outlines the problems identified in submissions to the Australian Law Reform Commission and recommends a lives national women's justice program as, a,focus for advancing women's access to the legal system. I personally endorse that recommendation and I will be doing my best to ensure its implementation by this government. I am also pleased to see some interim recommendations in relation to the issue of remoteness. In this regard I fully support the com'mission's recommendation that, as part of ii' national women's justice program, a toll-free telephone legal advice and referral service be available to all women in Australia . .This will only be a start to bridging the gap of remoteness that I referred to earlier. ' Similarly, there is an urgent need for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women's legal service around the country to address the particular obstacles barring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women from equality before the law. As the honourable member who preceded me indicated, there is a real problem with Aboriginal legal services representing people in domestic violen-e disputes as well as family law matters. Obviously, a solicitor from the Aboriginal legal service cannot represent both sides in a domestic dispute. So in effect-and I have seen it in' real life as a solicitor---':what happens is that someone, is told to go away: 'You cannot have legal advice if the other party is Aboriginal. We will act for you if the other party is a non-Aboriginal, a European, but we cannot act for you if it is a dispute between Aboriginal people'. There is really only one solution. I say to the Attorney-General (Mf Lavarch): ' we have to provide a separate service so that both sides can get representation. I take particular pleasure in endorsing the commission's recommendations in relation to the need for accredited interpreters. This is a particular bugbear of mine. I am going to push the Attorney-General about the fact that all witnesses, in federal proceedings at least; should have a right to an interpreter while giving evidence. The report says that interpreters must be accredited ,and should be familiar with the legal process. These are important issues. The,sad thingI know this from having been a practitioner in Far North Queensland-is that this matter affects both people who are charged in the criminal courts and victims of crime. Quite often, victims of crime are women. The faCt is that, in courts in Far North Queensland, no real effective interpreter serviee is provided Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. English is basically a second, or perhaps third, language for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the remote regions in my electorate. In the 1990s, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, someone in your electorate of non-English speaking background would never come before a court without an interpreter. I admit that there was a day when that happened, but generally they would never come before the court without an interpreter. However, in my electorate, victims of crime giving evidence, as well as people charged with offences giving evidence, still regularly go before the court without interpreters. I call on the Attorney-General to do something about it. This matter was also raised in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island..;r Affairs report entitled Rhetoric or reality? which, was brought down last year. I am a member of that committee. We again made very strong representations in relation to getting the Commonwealth to provide interpreter services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in courts. Until we do this, we are being tardy in relation to providing access and equity to Aboriginal people in courts and, in particular, Aboriginal women. In conclusion, it gives me great pleasure to see the Attorney-General at the table. He came to Cairns last year. He met and heard first-hand about the obstacles to justice facing women in my electorate in the far north. He made it clear that he was personally committed to addressing women's inequality before the law. This interim report addresses many of the issues that were raised with the Attorney-General at that meeting. That is why I am particularly confident that this report will be accepted by the government. In the short time. I have left, I will mention another matter that particularly concerns me which is raised in the report. There is a problem that comes from remoteness and one submission referred to this problem. Page 36 of the report states that country towns often have only one or two solicitors. Small communities, such as those in my electorate, are lucky to have one solicitor. There is one to solicitor in Cooktown and a legal service in the Torres Strait, and that is about it. It is very difficult in those communities-the solicitors are usually male and they obviously have more social contact with males-for women to get any sort of legal advice .. That problem, which is highlighted in the report, flows from remoteness. I must say that that problem comeS through this report in relation to my electorate. There is the dual problem of all the issues of inequality.that women face plus the issue of remoteness. It is a double whammy that women in my electorate have to endure. I am sure that it will be further developed in the concluding report that the commission will be bringing out in terms of this reference. I urge the Attorney-General to think about it. Unless we address these problems, we are nof serioUs about equality. If we are serious about the equality of women, we have to talk about the equality of women throughout this nation and not just in the populated regions. Again, I commend the report. I commend the Attorney-General and the commission for their work on the report. I look forward to the next report with great relish.",153
271,Ms HENZELL,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,It is remarkable that we have both the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) in the chamber. I am not sure that I can cope withMr Ronaldson-And me.,156

275,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"The honourable member for Moreton, with his aspirations, is being very voluble.",157
276,Ms HENZELL,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"I certainly hope that this is not the contempt in which they hold one of their female colleagues. I am sure that it is speech. not so. In fact, they will probably be listening with bated breath to everything I say, as I am effectively breathing down their necks as I speak. One of the hallmarks of this governaccurate ment as it undertakes serious reform does it with widespread community consultaWomen's tion. This notion forms the body of this report. I am delighted as a woman member of the solicitors, government to see the very serious law reform agenda that our ministers are embarked upon. This goes back to the Half way to equal report; of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs with which the Attorney-General was involved. I will first outline the obstacles that the report highlighted as women seek to have access the law. I will then discuss the issue of violence iii the lives of women importance of dealing with that through more effective access to the law. ObV'iouslythe report highlights a lack awareness of the law and legal services. women are to achieve social justice, they must be able to access justice. It is certainly true that some of my male constituents a firm belief that legal aid services allow women to access the law and not them. But the truth of the matter is that our legal aid attended to. resources are very limited. More importantly, women have great difficulty accessing inforservices. mation and advice as they confront a male dominated hierarchy. The report states: Inadequate information and poor advice leaves women unprotected. They are likely to remain unacceptable situations or to endure violations their rights simply through lack of knowledge of alternatives. That is true of many women whom I have counselled in my professional career. The second obstacle outlined in the report is the lack of awareness by police of needs and experiences. In spite of many of achievements in domestic violence legislation in state jurisdictions, it is true that women suffer secondary victimisation and alienation if they attempt to access protection through the police system. While· there are many exce!lent police officers, it is still true that there IS a culture that is dismissive of women's needs. I will refer to that later in my . The third obstacle outlined in the report is that legal service. providers' fail to provide and appropriate assistance. The is that it report goes on to say: legal services express concern about the large numbers of women who come to their services complaining of legal workers, such as chamber magistrates and local court staff, giving women incorrect information or inappropriate advice, especially about avenues for help in domestic violence and family law matters. The fourth obstacle is not surprising; that is, legal costs. The costs of justice are a recognised problem for most individuals. However, has because women are generally poorer than to men, cost is a greater barrier to them in getting legal help. As I said, legal aid is not and the adequate in this regard. We have to remind ourselves of the importance of legal representation. Given the diffiof culties that women encounter, to then effecIf tively represent themselves in courts will often mean a miscarriage of justice; in fact, most magistrates will adjourn cases and have seriously encourage women to seek legal . representation so that there will not be difficulties as they attempt to get their rights The fifth obstacle is inaccessibility of As the previous speaker, my colleague the honourable member for Lekhhardt (Mr Dodd) mentioned, this is particularly true in remote and regional areas of Australia and in certainly in central Queensland where women of are living in small towns where there is no legal representation available at all, and it is even more difficult. Inaccessibility relates to access of child care and women being able to get to centres for advice. That is a very important issue. The report suggests a national women's women's justice program. It states: Womeri's justice needs are as significant as their health needs. They need legal services that are appropriate; affordable and responsive. They need access to the legal system in every area of law. Submissions to the Commission highlight justice issues of particular concern to Australian women violence again!it women the costs of justice information about rights and remedies, women's credibility in court family law, especially concerning custody of and accesS to children and property division sex discrimination and sexual harassment legal interpreter services which are gender aware and culturally sensitive for women of non-English speaking background legal services that meet the needs of Aborigi,nal and Torres Strait Islander women. This is a very large agenda but it is essential if women are going to have access to social justice in this country.' I want to refer to the issue of violence, which was highlighted in the report. As has been quoted in media references to the report, the report starts with a disastrous experience. It states: One woman's experience demonstrates the importance of this reference. The woman appeared at the Commission's hearings and spoke of her fear of her partner's violence. He had recently been awarded custody of their child. Less than a month later the Commission was told that he had shot the child and killed himself. The child is now recovering. The work on this, reference assumed even more relevance and importance. I think it is fair to say that many of us have been fortunate that our direct life experiences have not included the sort of violence that is the experience of many women. In my counselling, I certainly have had to deal with women wh<;> have lived for years under constant threat, women who have slept on the side of their beds to avoid sexual harassment and rape from their partners. To talk to people about such issues is ultimately humiliating for women. For many years they have kept silent about the sexual abuse they have suffered as children and the sexual molestation and harassment they have suffered from the people who are supposed to love and care for them. Mr Ronaldson-And emotional abuse too.",157
277,Ms HENZELL,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"And emotional' abusethe fact that they have not been allowed to have any money to spend. These all impact seriously on the self-esteem and confidence' of these women. They niusthave access to services. I would suggest a family centre where they can have' acce-s to legal advice, counselling and financial management services. Above all, it should be user-friendly. Women should feel that it is okay to be able to talk about experiences' that are ultimately painful and humiliating. and kn()w that they will be accepted. Unfortunately, their first port of callis often to a local police station where, because of historical reasons,' they are met very often by a male law enforcement officer who is very dismissive. We can understand that this is a very difficult area of policing. Very often hard working and hard-pressed police officers go out of their way to help women in situations of domestic violence only to find those women return to the situation of violence and intimidation. This can lead police officers to say, 'Well, you cannot help these people. They must enjoy it'. Mr Acting Speaker, I can tell you that women donotenjoy violence. I must make reference to the fact that I am wearing black. It is Thursday, and I am wearing my 'Thursdays in black' badge. Every Thursday when I wear it my colleagues-male and female-ask, 'What is this badge, Marjorie?'. It is to draw attention to the continuing issues of violence against women and children. It is very gratifying to find that all my male colleagues are very supportive and sensitive, but support and sensitivity are not enough. On International Women's Day I. was attending' a function in my electorate when a very nice woman said, 'It is no use talking to the politicians or the law because they won't help us. You have to go out and do your own thing'. I found this a most distressing resolution of the problem because,the reality is that, unless the law and the political system address issues of violence against women, violence in families and violence and harassment in the workplace and in the schools, we will continue to perpetuate a situation of inequality. It is. certainly true that in any year nine or 10 classroom-in fact, any year two, three or four classroom-peer group relationOne ships are already being established based inequality, a lack of respect and valuing women. For example, very often in two, three and four classes children get into groups. They might be called. 'koalas'. Sometimes they are called by the favourite toys that are around.,-Barbie dolls or whatever the latest space age or television toy is, Boys do not get into Barbie doll groups very often. So girls have to accept male dominated hierarchy without any comsional plaint. We have to be aware that the causes social inequality are very deep. They right into family life, into parenting. I again from the interim report: The Commission knew that violence was a serious problem for women but the intensity uniformity of the women's submissions brought cades. home to the Commission that the link between wome-.:s inequality and violence was fundamental. The legal system's tolerance of violence against women underwrites women's inequality before law. Women cannot be equal until the legal system responds effectively to violence and until women are treated as equals, violence against them be reduced. The experience of violence is in disempowering.. for women and impedes their to legal services. . So what we have here is one aspect of tempting to deal with the experience of inequality and discrimination that women each day. Our government is committed to real reform in the legal system, to real sibility for women in the workplace without harassment and discrimination, to child care and to the needs of women in part-time work. We have a huge agenda to reform those issues for women. It is very important that we go out and explain our very effective policies for women. One of the ways we will do this is by encourtypists. aging more women into the political cess-more women members in the parliawomen ment on both sides of the House, more . women into the ministry and more women tnto the cabi.net. We .cannot afford any longer to forget about over 50 per cent of the munity. (Time expired)",158
278,Mr HAVILAND,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"I have great pleasure in joining in eight, discussion on the Law Reform Commission's report on women 'saccess to the legal system. of the reasons that I joined the Australian on Labor Party in the 1970s was that I, like all of people on this side of the House, have a year one, commitment to social justice. Mr Ronaldson-There's no-one on that 'wombats' or side of the House.",159
279,Mr HAVILAND,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"No, I was talking about this side of the House. There is no greater social justice issue than the equality of men the and women. I have had a fair bit of profesexperience in this area. In a former life of I was fortunate enough to be responsible for reach the implementation of equal opportunity quote programs in the Australian Public Service. This experience was very valuable and gave me great insight into some of the history of and women in employment in the last few deI will use the Australian public sector as an example, because it is the area I know best. the It is unbelievable when we look back into the first half of this century and realise that in the Australian public sector, and indeed probably will not in most parts of the work force, women were itself excluded from most areas of work other than access the lowest paid areas, like typing pools and other low-paid clerical assistant-type jobs. I atam talking about office work mainly. There are a lot of other traditional areas of female face employment, like nursing et cetera, but we will find that most of the areas of traditional accesfemale employment are the lowest paid. It was not until 1949 that women were able to work in areas other than the very lowest level in the Australian Public Service. In those days, the Australian Public Service was broken up into four divisions and women were barred from all areas except the fourth division, which was clerical assistants and It was not until 1949 that that was prochanged by the Chif1ey government and had access to all areas of employment in the Australian Public Service-but only if they were single. It was not until 1966. that the marriage bar was lifted. Before 1966, if a comfemale was employed in the Australian Public Service-and probably in most state public for that matter-and she got married, this she had two choices: either she became a temporary employee or she resigned. That was a pretty blatant example of the discrimination that existed in our· work force fairly recently-less than 40 years ago. It was not until the early 1970s that the fairly celebrated equal pay cases were fought and won, and women finally started getting equal pay for equal work. That is gradually permeating its way through. We still have women earning on average less than men because they still tend to occupy lower paid jobs. At least in situations where they are doing equal work of equal classification they do get equal pay. It is worth reflecting once again on the opposition's obsession with the trade union movement, which was exemplified during this week with it criticising and attacking trade unions all the time. It was the trade union movement that won for women the right of equal pay for work of equal value. In most states of Australia, and in the Commonwealth, we had equal employment opportunity legislation passed iIi the 1980s. It is worth noting that without exception all the legislation relating to equal opportunity, whether in the Commonwealth area or in the states or territories, was passed by Labor governments. The New South Wales Wran government was the first state to pass equal opportunity legislation, in 1981. The Commonwealth, I think, was the next.",159
280,Mr KERR,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,A good government; a Labor government.,160
281,Mr HAVILAND,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"The Wran Labor government, that is right. The Hawke government followed in 1984 with the first of a number of pieces of legislation on equal opportunity when it amended the Public Service Act to provide for equal employment opportunity in the Australian Public Service. There were further pieces of legislation carried down through the 1980s which affected statutory authorities and the private sector. But, like most social change and most social justice initiatives, it was the Labor Party that effected these changes. It is just as well that we do have Labor governments in this country otherwise we would still be living in the dark ages with massive discrimination against women and other sections of society as well. Another area that has drawn a lot of discussion recently about equality and equal access for women in terms of careers is the number of women in parliament. We heard an outrageous speech yesterday, an unbelievably hypocritical speech, by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who came into this chamber and lectured the government about i- position on women in parliament. She quoted figures and percentages. She did say that we have at least 10 female members on this side of the House·-and she criticised the Labor Party for having only 10. Mr Ronaldson-You give credit where credit is due. She's been a very strong advocate for a very long time.",160
282,Mr HAVILAND,LAW REFORM COMMISSION,"The one thing she did not mention was that the opposition has only four on its side. When I went to school 10 beat four any day. It is pretty rich for someone to come in here and lecture the Labor Party in a patronising way, like the honourable member did yesterday in the grievance debate, about not promoting women in parliament when we have 10 on our side and the opposition has four. Just for the record, 10 out of 80 is 121/2 per cent-that is not flash; I agree that we should have more. But the opposition side has four out of 65, which comes to about six per cent-less than half the percentage for this side of the House. How dare the honourable member for Moncrieff come into this chamber lecturing . and criticising the Labor Party's record on allowing women into parliament. At least the Labor Party is having a debate within its own party forums about the need for more women in parliament. I have not heard much from the other side about women in parliament. The only time we ever hear anything from the other side about women is when it is promoting one particular womanthe candidate for Mackellar, who is apparently going to come back into this parliament next week. That will increase the opposition's numbers to five. That is a bit of a step forward, I suppose, depending on which way we look at it. The only time we ever hear anything from the Liberal Party about promoting women is when one particular woman promotes herself and her own leadership ambitions-the person who has modelled herself on Margaret Thatcher, who is hardly, I would have thought, a great advocate for the pronise gression of w9men's rights. Nevertheless, what an outrageous and hypocritical tirade had yesterday from the honourable for Moncrieff when she came in here and spent 10 minutes attacking the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), attacking the Labor Party, and lecturing us of all people about the need to promote more women in parliament. I found it absolutely outrageous. It is the Labor Party that leads tht: way this country 'on social change and on social justice. I also congratulate the Attorneysomething General (Mr Lavarch), the minister at table-the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr)and everyone else involved with that report. It is a Labor government that is producing these works and these .reports. It is also showing that in an important area such as the legal system we do need to address issues access, equity, equal rights for women, equal rights for people with non-English speaking backgrounds, Aboriginal people, people with disabilities, and a whole range of other minority groups who have been historically journed. disadvantaged in this country-particularly because of the long periods that coalition governments have served in this country. Let us face it: when Menzies was here women had to resign from the Australian Public Service if they married. That was absolutely outrageous situation. There were not too many women in parliamept then. The Liberal Party has never been at the forefront. We never hear it promoting women. At the Labor Party is debating the need for more women in parliament, which is more can say for people on the other side. Another great area of social change and social reform is child care. Child care is not only a women's issue. Nevertheless, the huge increase in federal funding for child care and the implementation of child-care programs since 1983 has provided greater access for women to go into the labour market. The increase in labour market .participation by women has been immense since 198""3 when this government was first elected. One of the reasons that women are better able to access employment and go into the labour market is that they now have a better chance-I recogthat we still have a long way to go-of finding child care. The provision of child care we is essential for men or women to be able to member access the work force. These issues are very important. The opposition, as usual, trivialises and downplays these issues because it has no agenda of its own. It has no policies, it stands for nothing; yet it lectures the Labor Party about some of . our policies and our record on ,social justice. in At least we believe in social justice, access and equity in the work force. We will do about it and have done'a lot about the it. We will continue to push ahead with reforms that provide better access and better government programs which will enhance the opportunities for women to have equal access to all areas-whether it be employment, the legal system or elected office. So I welcome of the opportunity to speak on this particular debate. I am proud to be a member of the Labor Party-a party which believes in social justice. I commend the report to the House.

SOCIAL SECURITY (HOME CHILD NA ALLOWANCES) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration of Senate Message Message received from the Senate returning the bitl and acquainting the House that the Senate does not insist on its requests for amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives but has agreed to the following resolution: The Senate: 1. notes that without amendments the bill will exclude from eligibility from the Home Child Care Allowance:, (3) families in which the child or (otherwise eligible) parent is overseas for longer than thirteen weeks; and (b) families .with children who are dependent full-time students aged 18 to 25 when the child's income is under $1,785 a year; and (c) families with children who are receiving prescribed student payments; and (d) families who are ineligible for the HCCA 'as a result of the more onerous income definitions under the Social Security Act 1991; and 2. also notes that the combined complexities of the Social Security Act' I 99 I and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936""made it extremely difficult for requests for amendments to be prepared that ensure that the bill would not unfairly exclude these families from access to Home Child Care Allowance without having any unforeseen consequences; and 3: ""'recalls that duriJ'!g the debate on the second reading of the bill the Senate considered the legal complexity of the issues involved in amending the bilI, but did not, at that time, choose to urge the Government to prepare requests for amendments and instead agreed to requests for amendments moved by Senator Hartadine; and 4. notes that on 2 March 1994 these requests .fOl: amendments were the subject of a letter from the Minister for Social Security, Mr  MP, highlighting a range of alleged unforeseen consequences; and 5. notes that in Iighf of this correspondence Senator Patterson arranged for the preparation of a revised amendment in the. following form: ""Clause 3, page 13, after proposed Division 5, insert the following Division: "" 'Division SA-Preservation of home child care allowance ' Preservation of home child care allowance where rebates would be available '929A.{l) If: (a) under subsection 159J(1B) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as in force on 1 January 1994, a person or a person's spouse would be entitled to a rebate in respect of a dependent child in respect of a year of income; and (b) a home child care allowance would not be payable to the person during a period during the year of income, or would be payable but at a lower rate than the amount of the rebate in respect of that period; a home child care allowance is payable to .the person for the child during that period at the rate equal to the amount of the rebate in ' respect of that period. '(2) For the purpose of working out the amount of the rebate in respect of that period, the maximum rate of the rebate,is taken to be the amount per annum for the time being applicable under section 928. '(3) This section only applies to a person who lodges a claim in writing, in accordance with a form approved by the Secretary and with section 917, for this section to apply to the person.'.""; and 6. notes that this revised amendment would go some way to addressing the concerns and unintended consequences identUled by the Minister; and 7. notes that any remaining concerns or unintended consequences could have been readily overcome if the Government had ensured that the necessary e-pertise was made available for the drafting' of amendments in such a way as to guarantee the elimination of such concerns and unintended c?nsequences; and  Ruddock MP, and frotTi Senator Patterson, dated 3 March 1994 and 9 March 1994 respectively, the Minister had been asked to redraft the amendments, in order to eliminate the alleged unforseen consequences while, ensuring that the proposed Home Child Care Allowance benefits were not , denied to those families who would other, wise have, been unfairly excluded from , them; and 9. expresses its conce- that on i 0 March 1994 the Minister again' refused to have the requests for amendments redrafted by the Government or to make available to the Senate's drafter, departmental officerS expert in the intricacies of the relevant social security and income 'ta- law; and ·1 O- reminds the Government that, in virtually identical circumstiulces, on 2 March 1994, while the Senate was considering proposed amendments to the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1993, Senator MCMullan, the ,Minister for Trade and Administrative Services undertook ''to give ' effect in the House'of Representatives to the Senate's intention by redrafting the amendments, sending them back to the Senate, and having the same purpose with better drafti-g"", an undertaking given because of the complexity of the issues involved; and 11. expresses its disappointment that the Government, through the Minister, Senator Crowley, has made it known that the Government will not redraft the Senate's amendments or make experts available who could assist the Senate to redraft the amendments, to ensure that the bill delivered its benefits to the families currently intended to receive them and also to those families, referred to in paragraph 1. above, to whom the Government would otherwise deny them; and 12. condemns the Government for its failure to treat all those families who should be entitled to the Home Child Care Allowance, equally.

301,Mr BRERETON,COASTWATCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 23 February 1994, Commonwealth and State Departments of Labour officials met in room, Canberra to discuss ILO matters, including ILO Convention No 151, .Labour Relations (Public 1978. The position until that time was that who all jurisdictions apart from New South Wales had selected formally agreed to ratification. (2) At the 23 February 1994 meeting, QueensVictoria, Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory indicated that their positions would be reviewed in relation to the Convention, given the introduction or the proposed introduction of new industrial relations legislation in each jurisdiction. Once the new legislation had been compared with the provisions of the Convention, these jurisdictions would advise the Commonwealth whether they were able to confirm their agreements to ratification. Western Australia advised that it was likely that the new legislation strengthened its compliance with the Convention, and Queensland did not envisage any problems. New South Wales and Tasmania had concerns about compliance with some of the provisions of the Convention. New South .Wales would be seeking legal advice to clarify the position. Rights of the Child: Committee Report (Question No. 752) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 15 December 1993: Further to answer to question No. 340 (Hansard, 21 October 1993, page 2469) concerning Australia's draft report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child which was sent for comment to all States and Territories on 26 May 1993, in what form and to what effect did each State and Territory respond.",178
302,Mr LAVARCH,COASTWATCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A questionnaire in the form of the guidelines set down by the Committee on the Rights of Child was sent to State and Territory Governments, and to all relevant Commonwealth Government Departments. Most responded in this form although some responded on an Article by Article basis. I am advised that the responses received from States varied. Responses from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory were generally more informative than those from South Australia and Tasmania. The Northern Territory did not submit its response until the end of June 1993, after the draft report had been circulated. The States were also asked to comment on the draft report. I am advised that comments were varied and generally late. South Australia's comments were not received until late October 1993. I ani advised that the drafting of the Report on the Rights of the Child is now finalised and that it will be submitted to the, Committee on the Rights of the Child after approval by the relevant Ministers. The Report will be tabled in the House, once submitted. Australian Securities Commission (Question No. 768) Mr Mack asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 16 December 1993: (1) Is he responsible for the operations and activities of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC).

(17) Does (a) he, (b) his Department or (c) the ASC propose changes to the legislation affecting company regulation in the manner referred to in the preceding parts of this question; if so, what are the details.",179
303,Mr LAVARCH,COASTWATCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The ASC is an independent statutory authority established under'the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 to regulate companies and the securities industry. The ASC is accountable to the Commonwealth Parliament through the Attorney-General. In the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers, the ASC is not subject to any directions other than those given under sections 12 and 14 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. Under section 12 the Attorney-General may give a written direction to the ASC about the policies it should pursue or the priorities it should follow. In the public interest Attorney-General is empowered under section 14 to direct the ASC to investigate a particular matter. However once an investigation is commenced by the ASC, the Attorney-General has no power to direct the conduct of that investigation. (2) Yes. The ASC's functions are set out in subsection 11(1) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. (3) Prospectuses are required to be lodged and in most instances registered with the ASC. The ASC is required to register prospectuses as soon as is practicable after they are lodged, and in any event, within 14 days. The registration process involves a preliminary check by the ASC that formal requirements in relation to prospectuses have been met and to identify any potential areas of concern with the prospectus. The ASC conducts a program of post-vetting of prospectuses to ensure that prospectuses are in compliance with the Corporations Law and to protect investors in the event that a prospectus is found to be materially defective. If the ASC finds that a prospectus is materially defective it may, after holding a hearing, issue a stop order preventing any further securities being issued on the basis of the prospectus. (4) The disclosure requirements for prospectuses are set out in the Corporations Law. They are not prescribed by the ASC. The policy of the Corporations Law is to place the initial onus on securities iSsuers, rather than the regulator, .to determine the information that is required by investors and their advisers in order to make an informed investment decision. Section 1022 of the Corporations Law does this by creating a general disclosure requirement that prospectuses contain all such information as investors and their professional advisers would reasonably require and reasonably expect to find in the prospectus for the purposes of assessing the financial position and prospects of the corporation, and the rights attaching to the securities being offered. As noted in the answer to question (3) above, the ASC conducts surveillance of prospectuses and exercises its powers to ensure that prospectuses comply with the Corporations Law, particularly section 1022 of that Law. (5) The ASC is not empowered to prescribe that certain matters must be included in all prospectuses. Whether a company is required to disclose litigation in which it is involved will depend on whether section 1022 of the Corporations Law-as applied to the particular fact situation-requires the such disclosure. This will in tum depend on a range of factors, including the materiality of the particular litigation in question to the company's financial prospects. If the ASC forms the view that section 1022 requires details of particular litigation to be disclosed in a particular case, it will take appropriate action to ensure that such disclosure is made. (6) I am advised that the ASC has. I am also advised that: (a) The ASC has conducted a post-vetting require surveillance upon a prospectus 1993 which was lodged by Scitec with the ASC on 12 November 1993. I am also advised that 'in response to a number of complaints in relation to Scitec received by the ASC, inquiries have been made by the ASC into those allegations. (b) The post-vetting surveillance was conducted between23 Novemberand 2 December 1993. (7) I am advised that the answer is yes. I am advised as follows: (a) The post-vetting surveillance discussed in answer to question (6) was commenced by giving there a notice to Scitec requiring production of books. (b) The notice was given to Scitec on 23 Novemprospectus. ber 1993 requiring production of the books on 25 November 1993. (c) The notice was given pursuant to section 30 of the ASC Law. (d) The notice to produce books was issued for ure in this prospectus"".. the purposes of investigating compliance with Parts 7.11 and 7.12 of the Corporations Law. (8) I am advised that the answer is yes. I am advised as follows: (a) The ASC requested that following statement on page 11 of the prospectus lodged on 12 November 1993: "".. based on an independent valuer's report, it (the intellectual property) was valued at $4.1 million with $15 million written off as an abnormal item .. "". clarified this statement by lodging a supplementary prospectus with the ASC on 29 November 1993. (b) The request was made in relation to the prospectus of Scitec lodged with November 1993 for a renounceable rights issue of new shares and primary options. (c) The request was made pursuant to a letter written by an officer of the ASC dated 26 November 1993. (d) The request was made to ensure with sections 1022 and 1032 of the, Corporations Law. (9) I am advised that the answer is yes. I am also advised as follows: (a) The ASC is not aware of the extent of the potential liability. (b) The ASC has not sought to have Scitec disclose the existence, nature and potential liability of the litigation. Scitec determined that the potential liability to other parties (if any) at the date of the issue of the prospectus was not sufficiently material to be disclosed in the prospectus pursuant to section 1022 of the Corporations Law. The ASC, through its post-vetting of the prospectus, did not find that there was a basis for exercising its powers pursuant to subsection 1033(2) of the Corporations Law to the disclosure of the potential liability in dated 11 November the prospectus. (10) I am advised that Scitec has not disclosed the existence, nature, or potential liability of litigation in which it is involved in the one prospectus which has been lodged by Scitec with the ASC since it commenced on I January 1991. This prospectus is the one referred to in the answer to question (6) which is,dated 11 November 1993 and also was lodged with the ASC on 12 November 1993. (11) I am advised that the ASC has received the the explanation from Scitec that it is their view that is no current litigation or other matter likely to give rise to any litigation which is considered material for disclosure in the aforementioned This explanation is set out on page 26 of the prospectus under the heading of ""I·itigation"" in the following words: ""There is no current litigation or other matter likely to give rise to any litigation which is considered material for disclos' I am advised that the ASC through its postvetting of the prospectus did not find that there was also a basis for exercising its powers pursuant to subsection 1033(2) of the Corporations Law to require the disclosure of any potential liability in Scitec clarify the the prospectus. (12) I am advised that the answer to this question ·is the same as the answer to question (8). The supplementary prospectus lodged by Scitec on 29 Scitec November 1993, which addresses the concerns raised by the ASC as a result of the post-vetting exercise on the Scitec prospectus, was lodged pursuant to section 1024 of the Corporations Law and is a document available to the public through the ASC on 12 the ASC data base. (13) I am advised that the answer is yes. I am also advised as follows: (a) The ASC approved Guidelines on Official Conduct of Staff of the Australian Securities compliance Commission on 29 April 1991. These guidelines and the policy contained therein are applicable to all ASC officers and employees. In particular, the guidelines address the following: confidentiality and restrictions on use of information in the possession of the ASC under sections 127 and 128 of the ASC Law; Public Service Regulation 8B, which requires that, in respect of financial and other private interests, each individual is obliged to be alert to any actual or potential conflict of interest, pecuniary or otherwise, and take steps to avoid any conflict; and section 125 of the ASC Law, which requires that certain persons engaged in work of or assistance to the ASC, other than under the Public Service Act 1922, give the ASC written notice of their interest that could involve a conflict. (b) While the ASC believes that no procedures can offer total certainty in such cases, ASC management is not aware of any failure of the type referred to. (14) I am advised that the answer is no. The ASC has advised that Mr Cameron's business and professional relationship with Blake Dawson Waldron, a law firm representing Scitec in litigation, ceased on 31 March 1991, welI prior to his joining the ASC on I January 1993. He is no longer a partner of Blake Dawson Waldron and he has further indicated to me that he has no commitment or understanding of any kind with that or any other law firm in relation to any present or future relationship. However, due to his former relationship with Blake Dawson Waldron he is nominalIy a codefendant in two actions brought by Mr Rajski. (15) No. Mr Cameron has assured me that he has no interest, pecuniary or btherwise, that would conflict with his official duties in relation to this matter. Further, had there been a potential conflict of interest on this occasion, the ASC has advised that no actual conflict could have occurred as Mr Cameron had no role in, and was not aware of, decisio'ls concerning the Scitec prospectus at the time they were made. Those decisions were made by regional office staff at a less senior operational· level. (16) I will not be taking any steps as appropriate legislative provisions, namely Division 1 of Part 7 of the ASC Law, already exist for the prevention cf conflicts of interest in the ASC's exercise of its functions. (17) The only changes to legislation relating to prospectuses are set out in Schedules 1 and 2 of the Corporate Law Reform Act 1993 (""the Act""), which recently received Royal 'Assent. The Schedules will come into operation on a day or days to be fixed by Proclamation, which must be within 6 months of Royal Assent. Continuous disclosure-New continuous disclosure requirements ar- also included in Schedule 1 of the Act. Disclosing entities (whose securities are of interest to investors) will be required to disclose material information concerning their position on a continuing basis. Entities listed on the Australian Stock Exchange will be required to inform the Exchange about any matter necessary to prevent investors being misled or deceived in a material manner. Most unlisted disclosing entities whose securities are traded or offered for sale are already required to disclose material information in supplementary prospectuses. For those not subject to these requirements, the new provisions will require them to lodge with the ASC, as soon as practicable, information likely to have a material effect on the price or value of the entities' securities. 'Intentional, reckless and negligent failures to disclose material information will result in civil liability to investors who thereby suffer loss. New criminal sanctions will apply to intentional or reckless failures to disclose material information to the Exchange or the ASC as required. Prospectuses-Item 94 of Schedule 1 of the Act is intended to have the effect of limiting the content requirement for prospectuses relating to primary offers of quoted securities of certain listed disclosing entities to transaction specific information. Information about the entity itself should already be known to the market through the enhanced disclosure requirements for those entities. In particular, the new civil and criminal liability will assist in providing incentives for full disclosure and will provide remedies in the event of material breaches. Schedule 2 of the Act includes a range of amendments to the fundraising provisions of the Law, many of which concern prospectuses. The changes most closely linked with the legislation referred to above are set out below. Under current subsection 1024(4) of the Corporations Law, a director, expert or a person who authorised or caused the issue of a prospectus must notify the issuer of the prospectus of any significant change or new matter which would require the lodgement of a supplementary prospectus. Once Schedule 2 of the Act commences, section 1024 will be replaced by a number of new sections as folIows: Under new section 1023A, persons such as directors and experts will be required to give a written notice to the issuer of a prospectus if, during the application period of the prospectus, they become aware that: there is a material statement in the prospectus that is false or misleading; there is a material omission from the prospectus; there has been a significant change affecting a matter included in the prospectus; or a significant new matter has arisen which would have been required to have been included in the prospectus if it had arisen when the prospectus was prepared. Failure to comply will be an off(!nce. Under new section 1023B, wI1e;e an issuer of a prospectus becomes aware during the application period of the prospectus that it contains a material misstatement or material omission, the issuer will be required, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware, to lodge a supplementary prospectus or a replacement prospectus consolidating earlier prospectuses. Failure to comply will be an offence. Under new section 1024, where the issuer of a prospectus becomes aware during the application period under a prospectus that: there has been a significant change affecting any matter that was included in the prospectus; or a significant new matter has arisen which would have been required to have been disclosed in a prospectus had it arisen when the prospectus was prepared; the issuer will be required, as soon as practithese cable after becoming so aware, to lodge a supplementary prospectus or a replacement prospectus containing particulars of the change or new matter. Failure to comply will be an offence. Other amendments concerning prospectuses set out in Schedule 2 of the Act include new disclosure requirements for secondary trading, disclosure requirements for information of historical interest only, general matters regarding supplementary and replacement prospectuses, inclusion of documents in prospectuses by reference and the ability to obtain a refund where an application for securities is made on the basis of an out of date application form. (Question No. 794) Mr Hawker asked the Prime Minister, upon noti-e, on 17 December 1993: (1) How many cases of fraud did the Government uncover in the Department or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility in (a) 1991, (b) 1992 and (c) 1993. (2) How many cases were successfully prosecuted. (3) What sums were recovered in (a) 1991, (b) 1992 and (c) 1993 from fraud cases. (4) What percentage of the total loss from fraud does the recovered sum comprise. (5) How many persons in the Minister's Department or in agencies for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility have been removed from employment for involvement in fraud. (6) Is the Minister able. to say whether any person referred to in part (5) is still employed in the Australian Public Service.",180
304,Mr KEATING,COASTWATCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) established its Fraud Awareness Unit in March 1993. From this point in time, all matters relating to fraud have been consolidated. Prior to this, the information was held in a variety of locations in the states and regions. To collect and assemble the information in respect of the matters referred to in the honourable member's question would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of money and effort involved in assembling such information. However, ATSIC provided the following informa.lion based on records currently available. (1) (a) 11. In the 1991/92 financial year 11 matters involving fraud were forwarded to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Details relating to matters, and the timing and nature of the allegations, are not readily accessible. (b) nine (six organisations and three internal). (c) 14 (nine organisations and five internal). Of the nine matters involving funded organisations, five have been referred to State Police for investigation, with the AFP handling the remaining matters. (2) The figures for successful prosecution for the years 1991 and 1992 are not available. In 1993, to date, there have been two successful prosecutions. (3) (a) Not available; (b) Nil; (c) $11,782. (4) It is not possible to provide a. percentage figure for funds recovered compared to the total value of loss from fraud identified. It is often impossible to determine an exact figure for a Fraud particular case until it is completed. Many of the cases currently being investigated by ATSIC are in this category. Of those that are not in this category the amounts of suspected fraud involved totalled $334,500 in 1992 and $221,782 in 1993. The $11,782 recovered in 1993 represents 5.3% of the amount identified. (5) One. (6) ATSIC is unaware of the person concerned being re-employed by the Commonwealth Government. For the rest of my portfolio the answer to the honourable members' question is as follows: (1) (a) One; (b) Nil; (c) Nil; (2) One. (3) (a) $1,080.08; (b) Not applicable; (c) Not applicable. .

Meat Inspection Service (Question No. 870) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 2 February 1994: (1) Does a single meat inspection service remain an intention of the Government. (2) Since the answer to question No. 2061 (Hansard, 16 December 1992, page 3981), has the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service consulted with the Queensland and Western Australian Governments on the provision of meat inspection services at domestic establishments in those States; if so, with what outcome. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Since the Royal Commission into the Meat Industry in 1982 the Commonwealth government has supported the Commission's recommendation of a single national meat inspection service. However Queensland and Western Australia chose ta not transfer domestic meat inspection responsibilities to the Commonwealth and Tasmania resumed responsibility for domestic meat inspection in that State in 1991. The Victorian government has indicated that the arrangement under which the Australian Quarantine and Inspection service (AQIS) provides domestic meat inspection in Victoria will terminate on 30 June 1994. The South Australian government is known to be considering similar action. AQIS will continue to ensure that adequate controls are in place to protect the integrity of export meat production. The Government will encourage States and Territories to use the Australian Code of Meat Hygiene as the uniform standard for domestic meat inspection. (2) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has had no formal consultations with the Western Australian or Queensland Governments on the provision of domestic meat inspection services in those States since the answer was given to question No. 2061. There have been informal discussions with Queensland authorities but Queensland has chosen to continue on the existing basis. Protocol for the Protection of Cultural (Question No. 916) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 21 February 1994: (I) Which (a) permanent members of the UN Security Council and (b) members of NATO,have not yet ratified the (i) Convention and (ii). Protocol for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed ConfliCt (The Hague, 14 May 1954). (2) Whieh departments have considered ratificationof the Protocol since the answer to question No. 1738 (Hansard, 3 November 1992, page 2503) and with what outcome. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) (a) (i) ,and (ii) China,' United Kingdom, United States of America .. (I) (b) (i) and (ii) Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Portugal, United Kingdom, United States of America. (2) The question whether departments have considered ratification of the 1954 Protocol since the answer to question No. 1738 depends on policy developments in other portfolios. I understand that the former Department of the Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories and the fomier Department of Administrative Services and the Arts have considered ratification of the Protoc col. The Department of Communications and the Arts has advised that no action has been taken to pursue ratification of the Protocol as the required resources have been committed to other priorities. Defence Force: Firefighting Role (Question No. 932) Mr Bradford asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 24 February 1994: (I) What is the role of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) in fighting fires outside Department of Defence property. (2) Does the ADF have an ongoing role in fighting fires outside Department of Defence property. (3) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the (a) potential of amphibious aircraft such as the Canadair CL 125 and 415 to scoop and quickly . deliver substantial quantities of water to remote areas, (b) use in North America of such aircraft to stop small fires becoming large and uncontrollable Property and (c) fact that the aircraft are multipurpose and can be used to carry freight and passengers as well as large volumes of water. (4) Will the Minister investigate the acquisition by the ADF of a fleet of multipurpose aircraft such as the CL215. Mr BeazJey-'-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Under the Australian constitution, prime responsibility for the safety of life and property is vested in the various state and territory governments. However, the Australian Defence Force (ADF), as part of the Commonwealth response, is able to assist in such emergencies when the relevant state or territory does not have the resources or has exceeded its capability and requests assistance from the Commonwealth. In the case of firefighting, the role of Defence is limited to providing support for specialist and trained volunteer firefighters following a request for ADF assistance by the state or territory. (2) No. Defence assistance is only provided if the state or territory is not capable of controlling the emergency and requests assistance. through Emergency Management Australia, which is the agency responsible for coordinating Commonwealth Government emergency response activities. (3) Yes. (4) I am aware of the debate relating to the use of large fixed-wing aircraft on Australian bushfires. While these bushfire fighting systems have. been proven overseas they have not, to date, been shown to be appropriate under Australian conditions. Research was undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation into aerial firefighting capability in December 1985. The results of the study indicated that the use of large fixed-wing aircraft for fire suppression was neither cost-effective nor suitable for Australian conditions, due largely to the greater intensity of eucalypt hardwood fires when compared with softwood fires of America. The report also noted that availability of suitable water supplies in the bushfire season is also a limiting factor whereas in countries such as Canada there are large bodies of suitable water for this purpose. In addition, the research indicated that all aircraft would have failed on the major fires of Ash Wednesday. Notwithstanding these points, I am arranging to be briefed on the use of Canadair aircraft through the offices of the Canadian High Commission.

311,Mr COSTELLO,COASTWATCH,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: (1) Did the Committee on Employment Opportunities in its discussion paper entitled Restoring full employment estimate that 45 000 new jobs would be created by Commonwealth Government labour market programs during 1992-93; if so, (a) how did it arrive at the estimate, (b) what underlying assumptions were made and (c) what methodology was employed. (2) What are the committee's estimates of displacement.",187
312,Mr KEATING,COASTWATCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In its discussion paper Restoring full ment the Committee on Employment Opportunities stated: /I A fairly crude estimate is that some 45,000 new jobs were directly created by labour market programs of the Commonwealth Government during 1992-93.-The indicative estimate was arrived at as follows: 10bstart is a private sector wage subsidy. program. A 1990 evaluation by DEET found that some 15% of jobs in this program were additional. Taking 15% of the 1992-93 Jobstart commencements of 150,600 gives some 22,600 jobs created under 10bstart. . The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme isa selfemployment assistance program. An evaluation described in the Report found that of the 2,750 who were assisted in this program in 1991-92 some 1,760 were still self-employed after assistance ceased and that they were employing 880 others. When applied to the 3,350 commencements in 1992-93 this implies some 3,000 jobs. While all NElS jobs are required to be additional, it was assumed that only 85% of these jobs were additional in order to produce a more conservative estimate. This results in an estimate of 2,550 for 1992-93. Employment 10bskills and LEAP are community and environment work experience programs which assisted some 22,920 jobseekers in 1992-93. Although these are required to be additional jobs it was assumed that some 85 % were additional in order to produce a more conservative estimate. This gives an estimate of some 19,480 jobs in 1992-93. The sum of these estimates is 44,630 or some 45,000 in round numbers. (2) The estimates of displacement used by the Committee were 85% for 10bstart, 15% for the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme and 15% for both LEAP and 10bskills. These figures 'are the obverse of the estimates of additionality quoted above. Coal Industry (Question No. 994) Mr Cadman asked the Minister for Reemploysources, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: Will the Government convene a national inquiry into the coal industry. . Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A special meeting of the Australian Coal Industry Council (ACIC) was convened on 14 March 1994. Membership of ACIC comprises the responsible Federal, New South Wales and Queensland Ministers and company and union representatives, with the Federal Minister as chair. The meeting agreed that an independent study of the Australian export coal industry will be conducted. The study will identify what are the main opportunities and impediments for achieving a strong, growing, competitive export industry and what needs to be done about them for the industry to realise its full potential. This will include consideration of how to: achieve world's best practice in the coal production and export chain, and expand Australia's coal trade and capture new markets. The study will be submitted to ACIC .for its consideration.",187
