1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I let the Prime Minister know last night that I should today ask him a question with regard to the purchase by the Government of an article peared in the first issue of the Lone Hand magazine. I ask now what was the price paid for that article, what steps the Government took to insure the purchase of the natives? best article obtainable from the press of Australia, and when the arrangements for its purchase were made? - Mr DEAKIN - It slipped my memory until a few minutes ago, that the honourable member intended to ask the question. I have had to obtain the information by phone. Speaking from memory, the purchase was made about the beginning of been 1907, the conditions being that we were to the natives, be supplied with copies of the article beKaipani 'River.. fore it was published, and to pay ,£120 for 10,000 copies and all the plates'. These 'copies were circulated throughout . the Mother Country, and, as press cuttings ministrator show, gained a great deal of notice. The figures, diagrams, and pictures which were given, illustrated the great resources of the Commonwealth more vividly than any other publication with which I am acquainted.",14

4,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Negotiation s must have proceeded between the Government and the proprietors of the Lone Hand or Bulletin before the publication of the article, and therefore, .1 would ask the Prime Minister to lay the papers on the table, as the best way to give honourable members information on the subject ",14

Upon which Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN had' That the .requested amendments be not made. were Mr COON (Batman) [2.39] -""Variou s under speakers, last evening stated that cotton goods are not, and cannot, be made herej but I - am now in a position to say that they can be, and - are, made here. When'the""Tariff was first introduced some sixteen machines were imported for the purpose of making cotton stockings. Several hundreds of pairs were made, and,- at .present, one. firm ""has 2,000 lbs. of cotton yarn waiting to make up into these goods - Last year we imported ^156,000 worth of them. They are made today in Victoria under conditions which are not to be' excelled in any part-of the world. - Mr 'MALONEY --Can they be dyed here equal to those dyed in Germany ?",15
15,Mr COON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Yes . - Mr JOHNSON - Then the evidence of the manufacturers before the - Tariff Commission 'is all wrong ?,16
16,Mr COON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable member, as a* rule, does not follow the Tariff Commission's reports unless it suits him to do so. Since the Tariff Commission sat, the industry has been started. I am surprised at the honourable member for Melbourne saying that we cannot make goods as well as the Germans can. I am prepared to produce 'three samples this afternoon, and I will - undertake that the honourable member for Melbourne cannot distinguish the Australian-made from' the German article. Mr LIDDELL.'-The test is in .the wearing, not in' the appearance. .' Mr COON - The honourable member is very, much concerned about their wearing qualities. So am I , and I am .also concerned about the people getting employment.",16
17,Mr LIDDELL,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The honourable member would prefer shoddy.,16
18,Mr COON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am against the imported shoddy, and in favour of the local article, which will give better satisfaction, and also give employment. I am surprised at honourable members who represent the cause of protection, stating that we cannot make tories. cotton, stockings here. It is absurd to say that the. most progressive people in the world are not. equal to such as the making of their own stockings. I . hold in my hand an Australian stocking, made under conditions insured by Victorian factory legislation, - under which a girl seventeen years of age can earn 24s. week at the work. This other stocking was made under conditions where there is no striction of the hours of labour, a'nd wherenumber,, for Melbourne, and the honourable a girl gets only 7s. a week. Is that the kind of stocking that members of the position want us to import into Australia ? ' stockings are made here. '",16
19,Mr KELLY,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,What is.the source of the honourable member's information?,16
20,Mr COON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable member would'not go to the source to which I went tb get the information. . He stands aside and says, "" I shall not be convinced unless I see it for myself."" The honourable member can see for himself tp-morrow morning what the source of my information is. He can see the girls working the machines; and. the conditions of their employment. If we can produce the article here at the same price for the poor people of this country, we should do so. One honourable member opposite claimed that he. was standing up as the representative of the masses of the people, but does he represent the masses, when he is prepared to allow the sweated goods of other countries to come here to' enter into competition with the products of ourown labour? If these stockings can be made here' under fair conditions, and be retailed at the same price as the imported-6d . per pair-wh y should not the local manufacturers have the protection proposed ? Why should we not give em- ployment to hundreds of people in this industry ? I appeal to all protectionists, and particularly to the honourable member, for .Melbourne Ports, to vote for the duty. That honourable member was under a misapprehension yesterday. Like several others, he was not aware that these stockings were being- - made, here, and that the' work will give employment to thousands of. people. The paper which I hold in my hind is a part of the industry. Two tons of it are ordered at a ""time, to wrap the stockings in.

Such a construction cannot be placed upon the proposition before us. I confess that I should like to see guns which are not properly marked absolutely prohibited.

I was referring to the notorious Abrahams case which cost those concerned an enormous amount of money, from which I am* afraid they got very little satisfaction. We should have here a means of testing, unstamped guns now on the water, so that if they can pass an approved test they will be admitted at the ordinary rate. We can, of course, save a lot of. money by accepting what is a well-known, and recognised test mark in other parts of the world, but I think that my suggestion would meet with ' the approval of the honourable member for North Sydney, and that such tests would be a. guarantee, to the public that inferior guns could not be sold under the conditions I described a few moments ago.",20

77,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,That would do away with the duty of £ 5 per. gun.,20
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,We do not want to collect such a duty in respect of guns bearing an approved mark.,20
79,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Quite so, but my endeavour has been to suggest a compromise between prohibiting the introduction of unstamped guns now on the water, and the distribution of guns that are unsafe. . Mr BATCHELOR (Boothby) [3.23] It is all very well that honourable members should be anxious to protect the. public in this matter, but I am inclined to think we are asked to go to an unnecessary extreme. This proposal means a prohibition against the introduction of the' cheaper class of guns, such as are used by orehardists for. discharging blank cartridges with the object of ridding their gardens of sparrows and other bird pests. There is a good deal of fad.dism indulged in with respect-to this approved test mark question. Many gun accidents have certainly occurred, butmost of them, I am inclined to think, have been due more to the inexperienceor carelessness of the man behind the gun than to faulty barrels. We ought not to overlook the fact that many people are obtaining a living by fruit-growing, and that they are' being constantly retarded in. their operationsby the . adoption qf all sorts of fads. A cheap gun is, quite' as good as - a gun costing £ 5 or J£J for the discharge of blank! cartridges, and many orehardists buy a cheap one solely - for thatpurpose. ' Why should the}' be compelled to use expensive guns? The adoption of this proposal will mean that .orehardists must either allow their f r u it to be destroyed by birds chase an expensive gun. worthy of"" consideration is that we are asked to rely upon tests over which we have no control. ""The British test may constantly used in the interests of special gunmakers in the Old Country. are to have a test, by all means let it made under our own supervision, so that the prohibition of - inferior guns will be absolutely within our own control.

If the Minister were prepared to provide that guns not bearing an proved test mark should be tested i tralia; he .would meet the wish mittee and gain the approval of the public. The honourable member for North Sydney, has suggested that guns now water-should be excluded from this provi-.. sion, but as its object is to protecf life and have them tested before exportation. limb, I do not think that we ought adopt that proposition. secure the importation of barrels that are up to October next. not likely to burst.

Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [3.35]-Are we to understand that, after deliberation, the Government are prepared to permit the alteration of their Tariff to the extent proposed by the Senate's request? This matter was fully considered in this House when the Tariff was first before us, and various rates of 5s. 6d., 5s. pd., and - 2s. 6d. were agreed to. Are we now to be taught our business by the Senate? It is ridiculous to suggest that we should impose a duty of £ 5 each on these articles. Surely members of the public can be trusted in purchasing a gun to ask for some reference as to the quality of the article they propose to buy ? In my opinion, the way in which time has been wasted in this national Parliament in dealing with the Tariff is something disgraceful.

96,Mr REID,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"If the Treasurer holds a very strong 'opinion in regard to road-making ploughs, I do not wish to take up time in discussing the matter.",23
97,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Kalgoorlie) [3.50] The proposal of the Minister to make the amendment requested by the Senate again draws attention to the differentiation made in the Tariff between various industries for the carrying on of which machinery .is essential. Ministers seem to have made up their minds that agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery should not bear duties higher than 20 and 15 per cent. ; but they have imposed duties pf 30 and 25 per cent, on mining machinery, although for the successful conduct of mining it is necessary to buy some machinery in a wider market than that of the Commonwealth. In my judgment, either the duties on mining machinery should be reduced, or those on other machinery should be increased. It is now proposed to reduce the duty on cane unloaders and cane harvesters, machines used in the sugar industry, to the maintenance of which the people of Australia already contribute largely. I do not say that there is no justification for assisting the sugar industry; . I merely point out that, whileother industries are assisted by bonuses, and by a low duty on necessities, the mining industry is heavily taxed - The Ministry ought to show some strong justification for this proposal.",23
98,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Dalley) [3.53] - As a matter of fact, the highest machinery duties are 25 and 20 per cent., but those rates are imposed only in two instances, most of the machinery coming under the - Tariff being dutiable at 15 and 10 per cent., though there is also a 1 2 per cent, rate and, in connection with electrical - appliances, a 5 per cent. rate. No duty at all is being charged in some cases. .",23
99,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,What about the duties on mining machinery?,23
100,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The highest duties posed on any machinery are 25 and 20 per> cent. It is a remarkable thing that the duties on hats and caps,' and apparel and attire, range from 40 to 120 per cent., and yet the local makers of machinery have to be content with duties of 1.5, 12J, and 10 per cent. The object of the Minister is to make road-making ploughs dutiable at 20 per cent. As there is a scramble to secure piotection for industries, I do not see why I should not get what I can for the engineering industry. Of all manufacturers, those connected with engineering have most to grumble at in connection with the Tariff. Even rigid free-tradersmust admit that they have not been too well treated. In regard to many items, duties of 15 and 10 per cent, are spoken of as revenue duties. The leader, of the Opposition referred to road-making ploughs as tools used by - municipal bodies. As these machines are used, not by private individuals who are dependent on them for their livelihood, but by municipal bodies, large contracting firms, and the Governments, of the States, the importers can afford to pay duty on them. If I were a protectionist, I should begin by protecting the iron industry and subsidiary 1 industries, and I am sorry that the Senate ha* not shown an inclination to increase duties for that purpose. I cannot now move for higher rates, and, therefore, shall support the motion.",23
101,Mr LIDDELL,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Hunter) [3.57] - I do not know why the duty on such useful machines as road-making' ploughs should be increased. Th.ey are practically horse road machines, since they are used on the roads, and drawn by horses. I do not appreciate the argument that, because they are used chiefly by municipal bodies, they should be heavily taxed. Mr WiLKS - Is the fact a reason for reducing the taxation ?",23
102,Mr LIDDELL,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Yes ; because whatever duties are imposed wil l have to be paid by the unfortunate men on the land. These ploughs are used chiefly by shire councils,' to make roads for the carrying on of traffic from farm to farm, or from farm to station, and to tax them is to tax the primary producers. Another, evidence of the loose manner in which the Tariff has been framed 1 is to be found in the fact that road-making ploughs are classed as agricultural implements, whereas, of course, they are not used for agricultural purposes.

107,Mr SPENCE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Darling) [4.10] - It would be more convenient to deal with the requested amendments separately. I havesomething t.o say with regard to new paragraph B. I desire the Committee to accept the Senate's request to make the handpieces of sheep-shearing machines free, whatever may be done with regard to paragraph A. I am authorized to say that this amendment meets the views of all the parties interested. There is a firm in Australia making the flexible shafting, and some of the other parts. . Those will come . under the head of machinery, and be subject to duty, but the Senate's request is to put the hf.nd pieces on the free list. The hand pieces are very important to - the'' largest industry in Australia. A shearer's earning capacity depends entirely on the quality of the machine he handles. men cannot and will not use an inferior machine. If any machine made.in Australia is not a good one for doing the work, the men cannot use it. This"" part of the machine is not being made in Australia yet. One particular class of machine which is now being used somewhat is made in America ; but the favourite machine,' the Woi- seley, is made in England. That is the one that the men generally ask for. This matter is of the greatest importance-to the pastoral industry. There is no reason why the employers should be taxed; but I am not putting the case from their stand-point. A duty on the hand pieces is purely a revenue duty, and increases'.the cost of the article. The machine turned out by one maker has been installed somewhat largely, but even this year the men practically went on strike, and absolutely refused to use it. The quality of the machines is one of the big troubles in the shearing industry. ' The contractor who had the shearing of that station in Queensland had to send, out a box of the Wolseley machine hand pieces before the men would start work. So far there has not been ""made in Australia' a machine that meets the requirements. Until it is made here, it is useless to impose a duty. There are a great number of articles affecting the farming industry in paragraph A, which the Senate desires us to place upon the free list, and which I think might very well be made free. There may be some difference of opinion about those. Some honourable members may desire them to bear a duty., and still favour putting cream separators and the hand pieces of shearing .machines on the free, list, and therefore it would be well to divide the question. The combs and cutters are not involved in this proposal.. They are already.' on the'free list elsewhere,- while the other portions"" of the' machine now made in Australia come under the heading of machinery and have a measure of protection. I . hope the Government will .accept the requested amendment in paragraph B. I was very anxious previously to have hand pieces exempted, and I think they were made dutiable by mistake.",24
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,There was no mistake; we had a great debate on the question.,25
109,Mr SPENCE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"A machine was shown in this building; it was at first thought that it had been manufactured by a Sydney firm, but we discovered afterwards that it was imported from America. Some hand The pieces are made in America', and other' portions of the machinery are being made in Sydney.",25
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"There , was no discovery about it. It was stated distinctly on the machine where it - was made.",25
111,Mr SPENCE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"But there was first of all an impression that the Sydney firm were making the - complete machine. I have heard .that they propose to do so, but the fact remains that they have not done so. If the machine is made here, it' must be one that can do the work or the men will not use it, because they must have a good quality of machine to enable them to earn their money. They'will have the imported article in this case, even though' it costs more. Under present circumstances the imposition of a duty of 10 per cent, on the hand pieces is simply a tax on the industry.",25
112,The CHAIRMAN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"As there appears to be a desire that the requests should be put separately, I will divide the question. The question is "" that the requested amendment to insert the letter ' A ' before the word ' Testers ' be not made."" .",25

(Angas) [4.16] - I desire to support the. honourable member for Darling with regard to new paragraph B. It has been pointed out to me that these hand pieces cannot be made here, and that the statement . of facts put forward' by the honourable member for.Darling on the last occasion was amply borne' put by the CXT perienqe of .'the Pastoralists' -'Association! I have' a - letter - from'' the- ''South Australian Pastoralists' Association, in which stateThe handpieces of shearing machines 'being of such delicate mechanism, the quality of the material and of the workmanship must be of the very highest standard to insure practical efficiency. The present condition of efficiency has only been reached by the experience of manufacturers and workmen over a period of many years, and it would require a similarly lengthy experience and painstaking for locallymade machines to be of practical value, and to command the confidence of the workers. latter is a most important point, for inferior machines mean harder and slower work for the shearer, who gets .paid according to the number of sheep he shears. From that point of view the Senate's remade in Canada. quest ought to be accepted.",25

With regard to the preference, think, that practically all these articles are here. made in Canada and the United States. Most of them are patented, and require rakes, special machinery for their production. England'makes very few of them, and for that reason a.preference of 10 per cent, would be of no use.

144,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I shall not do no matter how long the discussion upon it may continue. We have a few nice protectionists in this House.,29

147,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"My suggestion was prompted by a desire to assist the Government. We all know that the use 01 cream separators and sheep-shearing machines is confined' to two - very important industries. In the dairying industry cream separators play such an important part that the dairyman who is satisfied to adopt old methods cannot hope to successfully compete with the individual who is using up-to-date implements. These implements come largely from the Continent. There are patent rights connected with them which frequently preclude their manufacture in Australia for a. number of years. It is essential that those engaged in the industry should have the advantage of the very latest improvements in machinery. In the matter of sheep-shearing machines, I recollect that the original .proposal of the Government was that they should be placed on the free list. At the last moment, however, the Treasurer proposed that a duty should be levied upon them. In one of the rooms attached to this building a sheep-shearing machine was exhibited and a hand piece shown around the chamber which we were' led to understand had been manufactured in Sydney, and that' was regarded as a sufficient reason why it should - be protected. PAIRS. That was theargument that' was then"" sopotent in inducing the Committee to come to the vote then given. The Senate has had the advantage of considering the mat- . ter with more detail than honourable, members of this. House had. We were taken at a disadvantage, because until the Minister rose the assumption was that the proposal in the schedule would stand, namely, that these lines should be upon.the free. list. Honourable members had not time to get information bearing upon the ' production of these machines. The Senate did not labour under that disadvantage; and while it is a Chamber in which protectionist principles predominate, yet the members, after looking carefully into the question, came to the decision that these machines could not. be reasonably pro- . duced in Australia, and therefore decided so to place them upon the free list. That is the request which we now have to consider.' I have received a communication from the Pastoralists' Union of New South Wales, signed by the secretary, Mr John Mair. The letter sets out the position from the pastoralists' stand-point mainly, but incidentally also from the stand-point of the shearers who use the machines. Mr Mair says- As the House of Representatives will , in its consideration of the Tariff, be dealing at an early date with the item Sheep Shearing Machinery, the executive of this union desire to bring under your notice the following reasons why, in their opinion, Shearing Machines (Hand Pieces) which are the tools of trade of shearers, should be admitted free of duty. These hand pieces have not been commercially produced in Australia, though several unsuccessf u l attempts to manufacture them have been made. If , as there is every reason to believe, they cannot be successfully made here at present, a duty will impose a tax on the primary producer and worker without conferring any benefit on the - manufacturing interests. In any case, seeing thati the great majority of the shearingsheds have already been fitted with imported machines, duplicate parts thereof for replacement purposes will necessarily have to be of - imported make, and their cost'will be increasedby the duty. If it should be found that shearing machines can be made here, fhey would necessarily cost' much more than the imported article, seeing that the raw material is not producible here, and the increased expense would, of course, have to be borne by the consumer, while, as'the number of hands engaged in the manufacture would be comparatively small, there would be very little compensating advantage in the way of extra employment. The hand piece? of shearing machines beingof most delicate mechanism, the qualityof thematerial and of - the workmanship must be of the very higheststandardto ensure practical efficiency. The present condition of efficiency has only been reached by - the experience of manufacturers' and workmen over a periodo f many years, and it would require a similar lengthy experience and painstaking for .locallymade machines to be of practical value and to command the confidence of the workers. The latter is a most important point, as inferior machines mean harder and slower work for the shearer,' and, consequently, lower earnings, seeing that he is paid according to the number of sheep he shears. As regards this aspect of the case, I would refer you to the remarks by Mr W. G. Spence (President of the Shearers organization, the Australian Workers' Union) when the item was previously before your House, on which occasion' he opposed a duty on the ground that it would militate against the interests of the shearers. (See Hansard, 6576, et. seq.) In submitting the above facts for your consideration, I am directed lo express the hope that you will favour the placing of shearing machine hand pieces on the free list. Here we have the Pastoralists' Union of New South Wales, through its secretary, making the statements which I have just read; and the honourable member Darling, the president of the Workers' Union, representing body of employee's interested in the use of these machines, has also placed before the Committee their position. The only request which the Government sidered comes from the one firm of MoffatVirtue. The firm have placed' the market an implement - in ' connection with (which they hold patents. Part of their mechanism manufactured for them in America. the great pastoral industry machines also. The Wolesley machine is used largely in New'South Wales; another machine which is used to a great extent is the one placed upon the market by the firm of Burgon and Ball. firms will be greatly disadvantaged if the Senate's request is not accepted, because the parts of their machines are not readily interchangeable with those of Yirtue. I have received a communication from the firm of Wolesley and Company on this very matter. They point out that they endeavoured to start manufacturing in the Commonwealth, but found that their raw material and other requirements necessitated the establishment of a factory in England, and they have continued manufacture there for that reason. these large firms will be penalized if they have to pay this high duty,' inasmuch as they could not use parts. , Many sheds are already fitted up with the machines manufactured Wolesley Company and by Burgon and Ball, - and they have to keep on hand a supply of duplicate parts to replace broken Mr Thomas Brown. or worn-out parts of this complicated mechanism. The duty would thus be a heavy penalty, whilst not conferring any considerable advantage upon any large number of working people within - the Commonwealth ; because the number engaged in the manufacture of these machines is very small comparedwith the thousands who are using them. I therefore hope that the Committee in its wisdom will see the advantage of not penalizing this industry, and will accept the suggestion of the Senate by placing sheep-shearing machines upon the free list, and thus enable this primary industry to hold its own in competition with the wholeworld.",29
148,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Robertson) [ 5 . 0 ] - I trust that the Committee will decide to place shearing machines upon the free list, and that cream separators will for be similarly treated.

All The CHAIRMAN - They are included only as a matter of convenience. We are dealing merely with a part of the item Moffat-Virtue concerning which a request has been adopted by the Senate. It is not competent for an by the honourable member to discuss the whole item.",30
152,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I quite understand the ruling; but one might easily suppose, as the honourable member for Maranoa and I did, that cream separators were also affected. What I have said with regard to those implements will, ' however, apply equally to machinery used in shearing, because the cheaper selectors are able to'buy their shearing machinery, the more land will be put under cultivation for mixed farming. Take the case of a farmer who keeps - a small flock of sheep. He requires to have his sheep-shearing machinery cheap. Smallsheep farmers find great difficulty in getting shearers at the proper time of the year, unless there happens to be a fair number of holdings in the district. Shearers will not gowhere there is only a very small amount of work for them to do; or, if they go, the owners have to pay higher prices than - are paid on large stations, where the work is more considerable, and Extends over a longer period. So that, by enabling' the farmer to get his machinery cheap, we shall facilitate settlement in the back country. We should, therefore, f o l low the advice of the honourable member for 'Calare, and adopt the Senate's request. The small settlers in Australia are innumer-' able. Every year additional areas are being taken up by small men, and by cheapening the machinery which they must use, - we. shall increase the wealth produced by thera, and thus benefit the community.  petent for the Gommittee to make an amendment removing a duty from parts. I was not permitted to move a similar amendment ",30
153,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Perhaps the honourable member is right. It is often by failing that we get to understand our powers. I agree with the Senate that sheep-' shearing machines should be free, and I hope that the Committee will agree to its request.",31
154,Mr FOSTER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"New England) [5.7] I hope that the Committee will make the requested amendment. It is only the imported hand parts of sheep-shearing machines which have been found to be quick, and efficient, and in the shearing of sheep expedition is of the utmost value, not merely to sheep owners, but alsoto the shearers. I have known it to be necessary, because of the weather, to delay sheep-shearing for weeks, and once this operation is begun, it.is important that it should be finished as soon as possible ",31

157,Mr LIDDELL,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Hunter) [5.10] - This is a fitting opportunity to draw attention to the surly manner of the Treasurer. When the request was called on, he blurted out that "" he did not care how long we stayed here, the amendment would not be made.','  to decide.",31
158,Mr LIDDELL,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"My point is that the Treasurer is not treating us properly. Neither he nor the Minister of Trade and Customs is now present, and the substitute whom they have provided does not know what is in their minds, so that it is almost useless to make representations to him. The bearing of the Minister of Trade and Customs yesterday compares very favourably with that of the Treasurer today, being all that could be desired. As a consequence, business was expedited.' But no sooner does the Treasurer return than trouble begins. ",31
159,Mr LIDDELL,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Some of us .cannot strike a bellicose manner. I hope that the Commi'tteewill make shearing machines free. The honourable member for New England' pointed out how necessary it is that shearing should be done quickly. Many shearers, I believe, carry their own cutters.  settled that.",31
160,Mr LIDDELL,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"At any rate, a great deal of shearing is-done by farmers themselves, and farmers' sons, in slack times, add tp their earnings by shearing for others. The proposed duty would be a tax on one of-the primary industries of the country. Of course, it is in keeping with the policy of the Government to do all it can to'strangle the primary industries. I hope that the Treasurer will try to atone for his surly conduct by not forcing his motion to a division.  that the Minister will make the amendment requested by the Serrate. As I represent a purely pastoral district, I know what into would be the effect of the duty. Sheepshearing machines are not made even in Collingwood, and, therefore, I appeal to ; the honourable member for Batman to sup- port the Senate's reouest. The proposed duty will be purely revenue-producing, and I . have heard protectionists say that they will not vote for such' duties.",31
161,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Shearin g machines are on the same footing as cream separators.  what cream separators are to the dairyman. No one knows better than you do, Mr. Chairman, what rapid strides have been made with machine shearing in western Queensland. There are few sheds now-adays in which the shearing is done by hand. Yet the Treasurer wishes to impose a duty of io per cent, on machinery necessary for the carrying on of our chief primary industry. As a pastoralist, he must know the effectof the duty. If the honorary Minister now in charge of Government business were to agree, in the absence of the Treasurer, to make the amendment requested by the Senate, he would .obtain a name for himself which' he will not have another chance to gain.",32
162,Mr HUME COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"What would Treasurer say?  would the country say ? All connected with the pastoral industry would - pronounce the - honourable gentleman to be the only sensible man in the Ministry I feel sure that the Committee will make the amendment requested by the Senate. Our wool has to be sold in the markets of the world against the keenest competition of producers elsewhere, and protectionists, who, no doubt, sympathize with us,, will not be sacrificing any principle if they go further and vote for the Senate's proposal.",32
163,Mr SPENCE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Darling) [5.20] - Under the previous Tariff, the definition of shearing machines adopted by the Customs Department, included the flexible tubing and bevelled friction-gearing, leaving the shafting to be .included as general machinery. A change in the definition was made, but subsequently the original definition was reverted to. When the Sydney firm referred to started the manufacture of the flexible - tubing and overhead gearing referred to in - the Senate's requested amendment, with the object of carrying out the Government policy, I used' my influenceto have the - matter dealt with in the way proposed by the Senate, in order that the duties might be imposed on the flexible tubings' and overhead .gearing, leaving the hand-pieces to be admitted .duty. free. .These parts of the shearing machine have really been successfully manufactured only by the Wolseley Company. They have developed .their machine after long years of experience of its working. They have acted upon reports of shearers and pastoralists; they use only the very best steel, and have succeeded better than other manufacturers of shearing machines in avoiding the great heat which arises from the rapid movement of the parts. The shearing machines turned out by other manufacturers do the cutting all right, but the hand-pieces become so hot as to' blister the workmen's hands. As the result of a recent award in the Federal Arbitration Court, the employers are now required to provide 'their shearers with efficient machinery. In some cases recently stated, men complained.that they could not work with the machines with which they wfcre supplied. As a consequence, a number of shearers provided their own machines ; but as they cost ^ 3 , it is unreasonable that workmen should be asked, to supply such a tool of trade. The decision of the Court, requiring the employer the to-provide efficient machinery, has had the effect of throwing out of use machines of inferior' make. The makers of shearing machines otfcjer than the Wolseley Company, have tried for years to develop and improvetheir machines, but they have found that it is not so easy to make any material improvement. It is clear that protectionists are unable to contend that this is an article which can be made satisfactorily in Australia. We know that one firm in .Sheffield has practically a monopoly of the manufacture of hand shears. They arp made by men who, in succeeding generations, have been specially trained in their manufacture, and understand exactly the tempering of the steelrequired. Even in the United States, manufacturers have not succeeded in making hand shears that can compete with the Sheffield shears. Shearing machines are now displacing hand - shears to a very great extent, and even settlers engaged in the pastoral industry on a small scale are getting their shearing done by machine shears. All these considerations make this a very important matter - for the pastoral industry. , I have been surprised at the opposition of the Government/ because I am in a position to say that all parties interested in the matter are satisfied with the amendment requested by the Senate. Under it, the firm that is. - manufacturing ths parts of the machine proposed to .be made dutiable, will receive sufficient protection, and at the same time, those engaged in the pastoral industry will be able to obtain more cheaply than they otherwise would, the: shearing machines which they must buy. Whether we impose a duty on the hand-pieces of shearing machines or not, the Wolseley machines will be imported and purchased, as so far no other machine has been - invented that is a satisfactory substitute for it. .It should not be forgotten that the Wolseley Company have protected their manufacture by patents. Moffat-Virtue, and the representatives of Wolseley Company, are satisfied with the requested amendment, and the Government would do well to accept it.",32
164,Mr LIVINGSTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Barker) [5.25] I am very pleased that the Senate has submitted this request. I was glad to hear, the explanation of the matter given by the honourable member for Darling. No one in Australia is more competent to speak on this subject. As the honourable member has pointed out, it is of the very greatest importance to pastoralists to be able to. obtain the best possible shearing machinery. If any of the machinery used.in a shearing shed breaks down, it must be sent, a long distance to be repaired, and this leads to very inconvenient delay. Shearing, unlike other work, cannot possibly be delayed. It must be done in fine weather. If it is delayed beyond a certain time, as one honourable member pointed out, grass seeds are apt to get into the wool. Shearers look for employment in anumber of sheds ih succession, and if , by a break in the weather, they are delayed in one district, they may be too late to secure employment in another. Many small farmers are now cb-operating in this matter. They bringall thieir sheep to one shed and have th!em shorn by machinery. They are deeply interested in consequence, in avoiding any delay in the work of shearing. The' honourable member for Angas pointed out that the Pastoralists' Association of South Australia is in favour of the amendment requested by the Senate. It will not be denied that the members of that association take a keen interest in the business, and we may assume that they are prepared in .this matter to recommend what is right, and what would be in the interests of pastoralists and shearers alike.",33
165,Mr REID,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"East Sydney) [5.27] - I appeal to Ministers not to continue this ""stonerwalling"" of the Tariff. We are all anxious to finish its consideration; but there is a persistent "" stonewall "" - set up by Ministers in refusing to accept an amendment the fate of which is perfectly ob^ vious. The amendment requested by the Senate on this item is absolutely in line with the principles of the Tariff as sub-, mitted by Ministers themselves. I refer honourable members to item 167, under which machine tools, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, are admitted free. Under item 169, tools of - trade used by artisans and mechanics, and tools in general use, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, arealso admitted free. Under these two items thousands of tools of trade used in town industries are admitted free of duty. Why should - the shearers of Australia be singled out for specifically unfavorable treatment in this way ? The shearing machine is a tool of their trade, and it should not be forgotten that they are able to use it only for a limited period in each year, whilst the artisan engaged in a town industry is able to use his tools of trade all the year' round. As the honourable member for Barker has said, if the state of the weather interferes with the work of shearing at aman's first shed, it is very likely that he will find himself thrown out of his second shed, and he may have only four or live weeks' work at shearing in the year. It came under my notice in the cases I have referred to that frequently a jshearer may have to travel over 100 miles to his first: shed and then should rain set in find himself thrown out, of a chance of employment ata second shed - That is an acknowledged risk in the shearing . industry. I admit that in Queensland the shearing season extends over a longer. period than in New. South Wales.  refers to is happenm? at the present, time in Queensland.",33
166,Mr REID,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"When we have agreed Uo admit artisans' tools of trade free by the thousand, on what principle can we' justify the imposition of taxation on a tool of' trade used by shearers?",33
167,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The honourable gentleman' must admit that these machines are not provided by the shearers.,33
168,Mr REID,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The shearers' earnings de-. pend on the use of these machines, although they have to be provided by the employer. I remind the honourable member also that in many of the big factories in Melbourne the artisans employed do not find their own tools. They are. provided by the factoryowners. - Mr SALMON - I thought that the honourable gentleman was speaking-on behalf of the shearer personally.",33
169,Mr REID,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The interests of the industry are of vital importance to the shearer,, and there are thousands of men who follow the industry of shearing in Australia. Although, as the result of isome recent arrangement, the employer may be required to provide shearing machines, I know that shearers used at one time provide their own shears. On principle, I do not see why a manufacturer should be able to obtain the tools of trade required by his workmen free of duty, though they can carry on their work all the year round, whilst a pastoralist who is required to provide tools of trade that are used only a few weeks in each year should be singled out for special taxation. In my opinion that is against the principles of the Tariff. I am sure that no man has a greater sympathy with the country industries than has the Minister of Trade and Customs, and I appeal to him now to accept the requested amendment and do a good action - at the same time.  item affects an industry which I venture to say employs something like 40,000 hands.",34

In regard to this particular item, I said, according to the Hansard report, that this was a case in which there might be some variation; but that duties of 15 and 10 per cent, were suggested by the Senate. duties are 20 per cent, and 15 per cent, and those duties the Government desire should be continued. Under the Tariff of 1902, cutlery, if plated, was 20 per cent., and, otherwise, 1.5 per cent -; so that if the Senate's request be granted, the Tariff will be considerably lower than the first Tariff.",35
185,Mr TILLEY BROWN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Has experience not shown that it ought to be lowered?,35
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"No ; experience has shown the reverse. I cannot see that the Government would be justified, under any circumstances, in reducing the duty 5 per cent, below that of 1902.' When I first addressed the Committee in reference to the requests, I felt that it would be unwise and unfair to have such a reduction and, therefore, I made the reservation to which I have already alluded. to stand by the item as it left the House of Representatives.",35

198,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I should like to obtain your ruling, Mr Chairman, as to the power of the Senate to request additions to items. In this case we find that the Senate has requested the insertion of words bringing within the item certain machinery and engines which were not included in it as the Bill left this Tellers : House. T say niothing on the question whether the requested amendment would be ' advantageous or not; my point is that the Senate has no power to. request an addition - to an item bringing under it lines which were not included in it as passed by this House.

As the Tariff left this Chamber, we in cluded "" Generators for direct coupling to steam turbines "" . in item 177. - ' Mr HUME COOK - The Senate have not put these machines in a better situation, because they have included them with .machinery.",37

I hope that the Minister will accept the Senate's request in the interests of the mining industry of Australia, because, while some mines pay large dividends, the great bulk of them are struggling between shutting.up or going on. There are thousands of men employed in mining, and a very arduous, dangerous, and uncertain occupation it is. Machinery of this kind is very similar in the case of mining to the tools of trade that artisans in the town get free. amendment cannot involve a large amount of revenue.",38
213,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Kalgoorlie) [6.15] - I admit that it was my misfortune not to hear the Minister advance weighty arguments why the Senate's request should not be acceded to, but the matter is of sufficient importance for him to endeavour' to convince some of us who had not the pleasure of listening to'him previously that he is adopting the right course. ' If the Minister is in possession of all-convincing information, he might reasonably occupy a few minutes in imparting it to the Committee in a question of this importance. The Senate's proposal is very clear.",38
214,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,It was a Western Australian proposal.,38
215,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In regard to this Tariff the Minister has adopted towards the mining ventures of Western Australia an attitude not altogether in keeping with his usual custom of considering industries. It does not matter to me where the proposal came from. This Committee has already deliberately included in this item flueheated economizers, mechanical stokers, steam traps, and steam turbines, because it was demonstrated beyond doubt that they were not being made in the Commonwealth, and that there was no reasonable prospect of them being made here for a considerable time. The Senate, acting on additional information, have added to this list "" high-speed reciprocating engines coupled with generators or dynamo electric machines to be used in mines."" I have no objection to the removal of the words "" to be used in mines."" According to the information I have obtained, .the high-speed engines which are coupled with electric machines and at present in use .throughout Australia, are not made within the Commonwealth.. That view must have influenced the Senate in making this request. In the case of this highly-technical machinery, which is on a par with the machines already included in the paragraph, the Minister might .well agree to the request, in view of the big duty which has already been agreed to upon mining machinery generally. If machines of this description had been removed from the general machinery items and placed on the free list in the first place, I believe that the Treasurer could have secured a higher rate of duty on general machinery when the schedule was before us previously.",38
216,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"If I had given conThe sideration only to mining machinery, perhaps I could have, but I did not think it was right to do so.",38
217,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"How can the Minister make that statement in view of the fact that he himself accepted duties of 15 and 12J per cent, on agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery, but insisted on duties of 25 and 20 per cent, on mining machinery ?",38
218,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I was compelled to accept the lower duty in the other case.,38
219,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"This is highly technical machinery used principally in connection with the treatment of the most refractory ores in the most difficult mining propositions in Australia, but it is used in other projects as well.. The Minister, on account of his exceptional antagonism towards any proposal that may assist the mining industry-and I believe that that attitude of his applies principally to Western Australian mining-refuse s to grant .the concession asked for by the Senate.",38

Surely any prejudice which may have'been engendered by the composition of individual mining companies should not bias or influence honourable members in deciding a question of this k in d !

228,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Yes , very often. The expenditure which is required in obtaining information in order to keep pace with the times, particularly in regard to electrical development, is so great that none but the most powerful companies could possibly engage in the industry. Here is a proposal which I think should commend itself to any reasonable man. Some honourable members say that they cannot vote against it, because that would seem like giving a vote against protection, and an industry which might be. built up hereafter. likely the industry will be established in time to come.

260,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Flinders) [8.4] I am rather surprised to find myself in agreement with .the Treasurer in this matter. If honourable members look at item 177A, and item 177B, in the Tariff, they will find that generators and dynamo electric machines were originally charged duty^ at 30 per cent, and 17J per cent., according "" high- to their capacity. If the language of the Tariff were, left in the form in which it is in the Senate's, suggestion,' the benefit of this particular exemption would only apply to this particular class of reciprocating engines, provided they were-actually coupled with generators on importation. I think the object of the Committee is to give the benefit of the exemption to this particular class of motive .power, whether, coupled with generators or separate from them; and I am inclined to 'think that the wording of the modification moved' by the Treasurer is more effective for that purpose . Mr SALMON - What kind of motive power does the honourable member mean?-'",41
261,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"We are only dealing with motive power in this item. A generator is not motive power, though its name implies that it generates force. It . merely turns the power generated by a steam engine into another form of energy. That is dealt with under a separate item. We are dealing in this case only with steam engines.  machines? Mr WH IRVINE,-They are: dealt with under a different item-No . 177 - Sup 1 posethat the item under discussion were left as the Senate proposes toleave it; This peculiar result would be brought about j that if an importer brought in an engine of this class unattached to a dynamo electric machine it would not get the benefit of the exemption, but would come under the general heading, and pay the higher percentage.  the use of a shaft.",41
262,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The shaft is the connection, but the honourable member will see that the general duty-on steam-engines under item 160 LS 20 per cent. the general duty on all motive power machinery. The object of this particular request is to exempt one particular class of motive power machinery, taking it out of the 20 per cent, list, and making it dutiable at! 5 per cent. But that thing to do with generators and electrical appliances. It merely means that if you have a rapid reciprocating engine the duty is reduced from 20 to 5 per cent.,, but that that great advantage, will only be given under the Senate's saggestion as it stands to those engines which are attached to or connected with electrical machines. Now, we wan|t to make the item wider than that.

The first part of the item under consideration uses the words "" except. electric ""-namely , except electric machinery and appliances. As - we have accepted the words of the item up to a certain point, we have also accepted the ""fact that the item exempts electric machinery. . So.that it could not include a dynamo or an electric machine. It seems to me, therefore, that unless we accept the Minister's proposal, we cannot agree to what the Senate proposes.",42
273,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Oh , yes, we can. - I think not, because the first part of the item excepts electric machinery and ""appliances. It seems to me, consequently, that we could not include electric machinery and appliances, even if wished to accept the Senate's suggestion it stands. Would it not be better, then, to accept what the Minister suggests, especially as he agrees to leave out the words "" to be used in mines "" ? It has to be remembered that these engines are used in many other places which are just as important as mines, and in connection with which it is just as essential that they should be Mr HUMECOOK : - In electric-lighting engines manustations, for instance.",42

275,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"[8.14] - The request of the Senate is evidently intended as a concession to the mine-owners. The Senate intends both high-speed engines and electric machines .to come in free when imported from the United Kingdom; because, if both did not come in free the dynamo would pay either 20 or 12J per cent., according to its size. So that the Minister very shrewdly says, in the modification which he has moved, that these engines may come.in on the easier terms for a certain purpose-no t that the electrical machinery shall come in on those terms, but that the engines shall come in at 5 per cent, and free when coupled with electrical machinery. These generators and dynamos are dutiable under another item at 20 per cent, and 1 2 per cent., and the Treasurer is actually opposing the request made by the Senate that that class of electrical machinery when used for mining purposes shall come under this item. I hope that the Minister will agree to the request made by the Senate since it will undoubtedly be a concession to the mining industry.",43
276,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In view of the fact that we have passed the first part of item 160, which reads, "" Motive power machinery and appliances (except electric),"" is it competent for us, Mr Chairman, to agree to a request to insert in the body of the item words which would be opposed to the expression in the opening paragraph "" except electric ' ' ? There seems to be some doubt as to whether reciprocating engines, when coupled with generates or dynamo electric machines, will be subject to one general duty.",43
277,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I think that is what the Senate intended.,43

I have asked the Chairman whether, seeing that we have agreed to a paragraph providing that electric machines and appliances are excepted 1 from this item, it would be in order for us to agree to a requested amendment which would have the effect of bringing electric machinery under it.

The interpretation placed upon these words by the honourable member for Laanecoorie would be right if we were dealing with a Bill ' which had not yet been sent to another place; but we are dealing with requests made by another authority. That authority has a right to make these requests, for there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent it making any request that its pleases. A requested amendment may be thoroughly inconsistent with the context; but the Constitution does not provide that in such circumstances it shall not be taken into consideration.

For the Treasurer to go back upon compromises made in this Chamber when the Tariff was formerly undei consideration here is not creditable to him.

419,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"X can assure the leader of the Opposition, with regard to this item, which is one of the most important in the whole Tariff, that there are strong complaints from a number of industries which have' not received the assistance to which they are entitled. "" Manufactures of Metals "" is an item which affects a large number of industries. In other cases we have been dealing with one industry at a time. Under this heading, we are compelled to deal with a large and important group of industries. There is first the bedstead manufacturing industry. It is not a Victorian industry only. In the mother State of New South Wales it is assuming very large proportions, and is gradually capturing the trade of the continent. Then there is the - fireproof safemaking industry, and the sheet metal industry, which employs an enormous number of men in its various branches. The tinware trade also employs a largenumber. I point out that in Victoria, under our Wages Board system, for certain classes of tinware, the employees are actually receiving more in wages than the imported article costs. I would specially appeal to honourable members in the Opposition corner to remember that under the Wages Board system in operation in Victoria men are paid more for making tinware, and a number of other manufactures of metal, extending over a very wide range,, than is actually charged for such articles when imported.",54
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,And does the consumer obtain the locally-made articles at a lower price than is charged for those which are imported?,54
421,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Not those particular articles, but other goods manufactured in the same works are being sold here at very much lower rates than would prevail if the importer had a monopoly. This item covers also malleable iron castings, acetylene gas generators, oven ranges and stoves, bath heaters, and zinc and metal ceilings. The zinc and metal-ceiling industry is doing, remarkably wen. i h New South Wales.",54
422,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,And in Victoria.,54
423,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,That is so. Wunderlich's have a branch in Victoria - - Mr SALMON,54
424,Mr BOWDEN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Wunderlich' s are doing very well under the Tariff as it stands.,54
425,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,But has the honourable member any idea of - the competition to which they are at present being subjected ?,54
426,Mr BOWDEN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,They are making all their own ceilings in Australia under the present Tariff.,54
427,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,But they are subjected to competition from abroad.,54
428,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"-Does the honourable member wish to abolish all competi.tion ? Mr . SALMON - No ; but I am assured that the additional duty of 5 per cent, requested by the Senate would just give the metal-ceiling trade in Australia the advantage which it should have overits competitors from abroad. - Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Wunderlich' s under lower duties' have been making zinc and metal ceilings for years.",54
429,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,But the honourable member will admit that the competition which the industry in Australia has to face just now is stronger than it has ever been.,54
430,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"If .the zinc and metal-ceiling makers here' could carry on under l o w duties, when the industry was only a small one, surely now that its operations have been extended, and theold duties have been increased, it should be able to do very well under the Tariff as it stands.",54
431,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"So long as the importer keeps up prices, the local ' manufacturer working on a small scale is able to make a living, but as soon as he is squeezed by the importer resorting to dumping, the posi- . tion is different. The japanning and galvanizing trade, and many others, are also covered by trie item relating to manu-"" factures of metal. All these industries are worth cultivating. We desire to have our own iron and steel .industries, and surely we ought to be prepared to assist those who invest their capital in enterprises with the object of supplying Australia with all that she requires in respect of these manufactures ?",54
432,Mr BOWDEN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,T.h e honourable member referred just now to the manufacture of bath heaters. Is he aware that the manufacturer in New South Wales is content with the present duty?,54
433,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I am glad to hear it .,54
434,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The manufacturers there are not content with the present duty.,54
435,Mr BOWDEN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am speaking of Hannam. - I did not desire the honourable member to mention the name of any manufacturer - I - do not know 'that any manufacturer would care to have his name - canvassed in this way, but I should* be glad, if it were constitutional to apply the present, duties to those who are satisfied with them, and to give the rest of those engaged in the trade the benefit of increased duties.",54
436,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The manufac-o turer named was for years making bath heaters without the assistance of a duty.,55
437,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"My desire is to consider not what any uidividual is doing, but whether the industry generally is extending and how the people are being served.",55
438,Mr CARR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,And employed . 1,55
439,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"And especially to consider how those engaged in the industry are being treated by their employers. I urge honourable members to be guided by our experience and to agree to the request made by the Senate. ' Mr Wilks (Dalley) [9.56] - The Treasurer has been subjected to a fairly severe roasting, and it is not my duty .to apply any glycerine. Honourable members of the Opposition appear to be troubled because some compromise made when this item was originally under consideration in 'this House has been disregarded. robust fight had been made against the attempt of the Senate to increase taxation I should have been glad to take part in it, and to have assisted in roasting not only the Treasurer but the Ministry for permitting the Senate to usurp powers - of taxation. I should like to see the 'leaders of the different parties in this House put up a strong fight on that question. On less important matters an appeal has been made to the country by States Governments.",55
440,Mr REID,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,But under the Commonwealth Constitution the Senate has an undoubted right to make any requesti that it pleases. It does .not make an amendment; it simply requests us to make it.,55
441,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"It was only as the result of a. compromise that the Convention agreed to the insertion in the Constitution of the provision that the Senate should have the power to make requests. We ought to be careful to reserve to this House the power to impose taxation, and the time will come when the Government of the day. will have to take up a strong stand on that question. Coming to the requested amendment I do not hesitate to say that if other industries had been refused similar increases I should probably have been found voting against this request. Requested increases of duties relating to ""the manufacture of blankets, hats, caps and other branches of .the textile industry have been agreed to, but a request that a duty relating to what I have described as the black trades-the engineering and iron foundry trades-is singled out for different treatment - There' are thousands of persons engaged in industries to which this item relates, as against dozens employed in industries which at the suggestion of the Senate were granted special treatment yesterday. Industries which have received this special treatment have been for the most part peculiar to the southern States. This item, however, relates to an industry in which New South Wales is interested. I recognise that it is not statesmanlike to deal with questions of this kind from a provincial stand-point; but I have seen honourable members over and over again supporting a proposal because it was advantageous to an industry in their own electorate or State, and I have come to the conclusion that in the circumstances I ought to do the same. This item has an important bearing on men engaged in various manufacturing industries in the State of which I am a representative, who certainly ought to be granted the assistance of the additional 5 per cent, duty proposed. If a Manufactures of metal include stoves, safes, grates, and other articles which are 1 essentially the work of the moulder, for whom no one has yet had a word to say.' I should expect protectionists to be prepared - to extend the most favourable treatment to the moulding industry.",55
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Twenty-fiv e per cent, is a substantial duty.",55
443,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I was'satisfied with the proposed duties of 25 and 20 per cent., as ithe Tariff left this Chamber.,' but since that time a good deal of water has passed, under the bridge,' and when, at the request of the Senate, .the Committee has agreed to increase the duties prooosed for the protection of those engaged inother industries, I am not prepared to sit here like an innocent Willy, and refuse to do anything to assist the foundry industry. When I find honourable members prepared to vote for ad valorem duties as high as 120' per cent, for the protection of hat and cap manufacturers, I am not going to baulk at such a hurdle' as an increase of 5 per. cent, for the protection of an industry in which manv of my constituents are employed. With the Treasurer's observance of a compact in the matter, I am not concerned. The honourable gentleman's sins in that respect - must be on his own head. The proposal now made is one which affects people employed in industries carried .on in my electorate, - and I am prepared to take advantage of it. I admit that two years ago on the election platform I made use of anugly sion, and said that if there were any loot to be had I would see that my constituents got their share of it, and I asked them give me a free hand in these matters view of my past experience of the way' were treated. I have less objection creased duties today thanI had three four years ago - in view of the introduction of the policy of the new protection. This is a new star which has arisen in the Combut, monwealth firmament. M i. JOSEPH COOK - It is many millions of miles away yet.",55
444,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I hope it will be tralian star of the first magnitude.' I is effective, it will certainly overcome many of the objections that I , in common withwe others, have to a protectionist. policy. aiways looked upon protection as intended *D tax the many for the benefit of the few. If I thought that by supporting the posal to increase these duties by 5 per cent. thedens I should be assisting to take money from the monstrous pockets of people who require to purchase tives of South stoves, grates, fire heaters, and such articles i-i order to put it into the pockets of the owners, of factories, I should not support it: . But if , under the policy of new tection, the workers in the factories are benefit by the increased duties in the ment of - higher wages, and the improvement of the conditions under which asked to work, a.. very great deal of my objection to the imposition of a protective duty will have been met.",56
445,Mr MATHEWS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The honourable member time should come over to this side.,56

448,Mr REID,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Not at all. I do not what the honourable member says; he is .real good man.,56
449,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I return the honourable gentleman's compliments by saying that am glad that he is supporting the principle of new protection. M.r. REID - I was one of the first champion it. It is one of the best ideas evermentioned.,56
450,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable gentleman's attitude towards that policy only shows that my leader for so many years the same ""Progressive George!' that he - was many years ago ",56
451,Mr REID,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I w.ould prefer to see the workers"", rather than the . manufacturers expresbenefited by a protective duty.",56
452,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I mean no disrespect to - the right honourable gentleman in speaking to of him in the way I have done, because, in in my opinion, it is a compliment to a public they i man to be known as I say the honourable to ingentleman has been known. Throughout or the consideration of the Tariff I have 1 fought to secure the imposition of the lowest possible .duties on the necessaries of life, finding that increased duties have been proposed time after time for the assistance of other industries, I am. prepared to avail myself of this opportunity to .afford the an Ausfoundry workers some increased asf it sistance.. I should like, at the same time, to say that if in connection with this, request were asked to decide whether this House . 1 or the Senate should rule in such matters, I should consider an additional 5 per cent, for the benefit even of foundry workers to probe too great a price to pay for admitting right of the Senate to increase the burof taxation. In my opinion, it is to contend that the representaAustralia, Western Australia, ' and Tasmania should have the same power in regard to taxation as the representatives of Victoria and New South Wales. proAs we have already accepted amendments to involving - increases of duty at the request payof the Senate, I intend to support the Minister in accepting the.

We have heard of nothing but compromise from the shriek of the honourable member for Parramatta to the dulcet Oxford accents of the honourable member for Wentworth. ""Compromise"" I is nothing but 'the sacrifice of principle, and I am> sick of hearing the word. The corrected him friends of honourable members opposite, in the Senate, did all they could to duties. Where they were successful, in carrying. requests for reductions of duties, we heard no howling of the word "" comhis promise,"" and no shrieking .of. the word by the honourable member for Parramatta tones"" so bitter that one might think the honourable member had been . sucking Seville orange. This conduct on the . part of the acting leader of the Opposition is. getting very sickening; and it would be well if he followed the splendid example of his leader in the way of genial courtesy.

456,The CHAIRMAN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I must ask the worker, honourable member not to. discuss what was done in the Senate.",57
457,Mr MALONEY,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"At any rate, it was there moved that the duty should be made still lower; and had the free-trade senators, who voted to a man, been able to carry the motion, the request would, have been for lower duties. ' The Government cannot ways get what they desire; and if, in reachincreased ing for the stars, they grasp the moon, are not to be blamed. I take it that the Minister representing the Government in Senate accepted what he was able to get.

Then there are protectionists, towards whom I have some leaning, who also have no desire to collect revenue at Customs; and I contend that where manubroken a pledge. : facturers are .not able to produce goods without a heavy duty, and the manufacture of those goods could be carried on by the State, there should be absolute prohibition. The question then arises how we - are obtain revenue; and there is no way except by direct taxation - Does the honourable member for Lang agree in that view.? The Senate has the right, under the Constitution, to-make any suggestions it.likes; and am sure the honourable member for Dalley will agree with his leader, who so pleasantly",57
460,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,My - leader admitted that reduce this was only a compromise.,57
461,Mr MALONEY,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"But the leader of the Opposition may make a mistake; and in experience of legal and political life, he must have regarded some compromises in with contempt. The question is really one of the interests of the workers; and the a honourable member for Dalley alluded to moulders and iron workers generally,, who, in my opinion, have hardly been dealt with fairly in the matter of factory legislation. We all know that when Solomon was going to give a prize to the calling which had that done most good, and, when he drew aside rethe curtain of his throne, he found there an iron worker. When he asked the iron why he had taken that place, the .latter replied, "" Do I not make tools for the worker to reap the . harvest and build houses and temples? "" Then Solomon, in his wisdom, gave the iron worker the pride of place; and certainly those connected with the iron industry follow the hardest, and, perhaps, one of the most unhealthy of alcallings. I am sorry that the Senate has these duties by 5 per cent, inthey stead of by. 20 per cent. Compromise is merely sacrifice of principle, and.if there the is one party which has tried to avoid compromises it is that to which I belong. Mr JOHNSON.;-This is .merely a matter is the of keeping one's agreement. ' Mr MALONEY - The volubility of the honourable member is known. His speeches fill many columns of Hansard; to but he cannot convince me that these duties should not be increased. - Mr CARR (Macquarie) - [10.21] - The argument of the leader of the Opposition seemed to me sophistical. It was that of colthe professional pleader.. He seemed to ' seek to take advantage of the situation. But no matter how syren-like his speeches may be, the Gommittee is not to be. dethe ceived into believing that the Minister.has I do not share the antipathy of the honourable member for Melbourne to 'Compromises; but they should be resorted to only when neither of two contending parties cani get what it to wants. That was the position in regard to this item. The Minister did not renounce the intention to get the duties' increased later on, if that should be possible. He had to compromise at the time, for fear of getting still lower duties. But in making such a compromise, a man cannot be justly accused of abandoning his principles, nor is it right to say that he must forego all future opportunities to gain his ends. The charge made by the leader of the Opposition against the Treasurer was not just. In any case, what was done by the Minister does not bind the Committee. The Committee would not be bound even had the Minister promised the leader of the Opposition to make no future attempt to increase the duties.",57

465,Mr CARR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"It is immaterial who moved for it ; what we are concerned with is that the request was agreed to by a majority of senators, and that it is for us to say whether the requested amendments shall or shall not be made. In my opinion, the duties should be raised. I have all along opposed duties which were ostensibly' only revenue producing.",58

Any duty is likely at first to produce some revenue, but when a duty is protective, that result is only ' porary. Seeing that Australia offers such a large field for the manufacture of metals, there is every justification increasing these duties. Owing to the better market provided, local competition has already become keener, and this_has regulated prices. I have sufficient belief democracy to think that the people will always see that they are not unjustly charged, and the - Legislature can better prevent impositions on the part of local manufacturers than it can control the operafuture. tions of manufacturers abroad. I am we prepared to give every encouragement to industries which - have a fair prosper pect of thriving here, more especially, as the Minister is pledged to give for voting for such duties. the Parliament the right to' control conasked ditions for manufacture, even if it should. be necessary to seek an - amendment of the Constitution to secure that right.

If he and his supporters accept so many requests without question, it is only fair that another place should give way to us. on some other items. I want as high a duty on these manufactures of metal as I can get, and I agree with the honourable member for Batman that even this duty suggested by the Senate will not give all the protection that the industry warrants. It has a great many ramifications and will afford employment in a thousand directions to all classes of tradesmen.",59

I desire to see encouragement given ""to our manufacturers from the production of the iron to the manufactured article. If it is a good thing, as the honourable member asserts, to give a bounty to the producer of .the iron, then, as we are not willing to give a bounty on the manufactured article, it is-a good thing to grant a duty on it. I am sorry to say that in two or three instances T have almost been forced into voting.for a duty of io .per cent. I have voted against most of .such duties because they were .proposed merely for revenue purposes. .The compromise which the' Minister is stated to have come t c here on this item was one with which I had no sympathy, nor do I think that any protectionist belonging to the Labour Party sympathized with it. I am delighted to think that the Senate considers that a great deal more ought to be done for certain industries than thisCommittee did. For that reason I appeal, to honourable members to support this request. There were two - or three items on which I felt very strongly, but I allowed them to go because I knew that if I were to make a fight, the numbers would be against me. I hope that when the time comes we shall be able to say to the Senate': "" We are showing the same spirit towards you - as has 'been shown in this House by both sides."" I believe that some compromises have been very satisfactory to all parties here. . But, of course, this particular comipromise. is not going to end here. A good many honourable members have riot heard what has been said by honourable members on the Opposition side, and by the Minister, and I think that they ought to have a chance to say something' on this important question. I suggest that, at this late hour, it would only be fair if the Minister' would consent to report progress.

508,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I must accept the evidence of my own eyes. I believe that honourable members on the other side spoke in ignorance of the facts. I do not think that the""y attempted to wilfully mislead the Committee.",60
509,Mr REID,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"If the leader of the Opposition did that, he cquld not have known of the arrangement which - was .made. .I am sure.that he would not do .it deliberately. - Mr SALMON - Her e is my authority for correcting the statements of honourable members opposite, and if they can show me that it is wrong, I shall be very glad to accept their disproof.",60
510,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Parramatta) [10.44] - The honourable member for Laanecoorie has, I regret to say, stated a fact in such a. way as to mislead the Committee.

516,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Then it ' is all right.,61
517,Mr SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I only said that he voted for it. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Of course, he voted for the proposal after he had been put in such a position that he was compelled to vote for it by the Government",61
