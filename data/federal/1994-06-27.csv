1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Bon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 12.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA",11
2,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I wish to refer toa matter of privilege. You are aware, Mr Speaker, that the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues is currently considering an inquiry into the operation of the Child Support Agency. The committee has not yet reported. In the Melbourne Herald-Sun of 11 June there was published under the by-line of Cheryl Critchley an article referring to the inquiry. The report referred to members of the committee being given a 600-page draft report containing 150 recommendations to reform the Child Support Agency. It went on to outline what were said to be recommendations in the report. In the Sydney Daily Telegraph Mirror of 22 June there was published under the by-line of Sue Dunlevy details of what was said to be an exclusive interview with the chairman of the committee. The article predicted what the committee might recoinmend and referred to what was said to be the changes that the chairman wants to see. The joint select committee has not authorised publication of any draft report. Mr Speaker, there appears to be a prima facie case of contempt in respect of both disclosure and publication. I present copies of the articles.",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"It is normal practice, I think, that has been adopted on recent occasions, for the committee to endeavour to ascertain in its own deliberations whether or not such a case might be sustained and who the source of any potential provision of information to other sources may have been. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) has not indicated whether that procedure has been followed in this case. If it has not, it may suit the member for Tangney and other members of that committee to, firstly, endeavour to establish that particular matter through that process, and then to raise it again in the House. If that procedure has already happened and the honourable member for Tangney would like me to look into the substance of the matter, I would be pleased to do so.  Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues and the person to whom the alleged breach of privilege is directed, I wish to inform you, Mr Speaker, and honourable members, that at the request of the deputy chairman of the committee that matter is listed as an item for discussion at tomorrow's meeting.",11
4,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"That being the case, I would suggest that the honourable member for Tangney may again raise the matter following that discussion, which is in line with. past practice on this matter. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the routine of business for this sitting being as follows, unless otherwise ordered: 1. Questions without notice. 2. Presentation of, and statements on, reports . from parliamentary committees and delegations (for a period not exceeding 45 minutes). 3. Private Members' business (for a period not exceeding 90 minutes): Provided that any division called for in the House during the consideration of private Members' business on a question, other than a motion moved by a Minister, shall stand deferred until after the conclusion of the Grievance debate. 4. Members' statements (for a period not exceeding 15 minutes). 5. Presentation of petitions. 6. Grievance debate (debate concluding no later than 5.15 p.m.). 7. Notices and orders of the day, government business. NA",11
5,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Brian Howe, is absent from question time today as he is travelling on government business. The Minister for  answer questions in Mr Howe'sabsence. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Gary Punch, is absent from question time this week. He is travelling on government business. The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, Mr Gordon Bilney, will answer questions in Mr Punch's absence. NA Indonesia: Press Freedom",11
6,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Prime Minister to statements by his own spokesman reported in the media last week that the recent banning of three Indonesian news magazines is 'an internal matter and we have no right to raise it'. Does that remain the Prime Minister's view? Can the Prime Minister confirm that he will not be raising the issue of press freedom in Indonesia when he meets with President Suharto this week? Mr KEATINGThe government's view on this matter has already been stated clearly by the foreign minister in the Senate last week. It is no doubt inevitable that issues tween the two countries such as the recent issue of press closures are issues on which we will disagree. But I think the broader issue the nature of the relationship and how difficult issues within it are managed; I said on radio-let me repeat it-that Australia has been forthright in putting its views about liberty, freedoms and human rights in Indonesia and in other parts of the world. But we still maintain broad relationships with countries like China which have state control of media, and with countries like Malaysia which have a very substantial degree of discipline over the media. Because of the breadth of those relationships, that is as it should be. In respect of Indonesia, the government has said it was disappointed by these closures. As Indonesia changes, as it continues to grow, as incomes continue to rise, as wealth continues to be distributed, as the nature of its economy continues to be outward going, there will be changes in the way in .which Indonesia is managed. Some of those stresses and strains will show up in matters such as these. The point is that I will be seeing President Suharto tomorrow. Again, I am not in the business of saying to the Leader of the Opposition or to the media in Australia what I will say to President Suharto before I see him. Employment: Training Wage",12
7,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, refers to one of the most significant initiatives in the government's white paper on employment. Can the minister inform the House of progress of negotiations with employers on the training wage? When is it intended that the training wage be introduced?",12
8,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question. Of course, the training wage is a very significant development and part of the armoury of this government in fighting unemployment. I am pleased to report to the honourable memberÂ· that significant progress has been made on agreement to, and, therefore, speedy implementation of, the training wage. Last Tuesday beI met with employers. At that meeting we ironed out most of the wrinkles as they perceived them so far as the training wage is was concerned. I had a further meeting on Friday where all the wrinkles were ironed out, today I am pleased to say. Employers have now unanimously agreed to the rates as previously negotiated between the ACTU and the Metal Trades Industry Association-and, of course, involving the government-but, importantly, they have. also agreed to the detail of the the award. This has to be contrasted with the.inprinciple agreement that employers gave to the training wage soon after the government's white paper was announced. The meetings last week were attended by a significant group representing the peak bodies of employers in this country. Not only was the Metal Trades Industry Association present; so were the Australian Confederation of Commerce and Industry, the Business Council of Australia, the Victorian Employers Confederation of Commerce and Industry, the National Farmers Federation and the Retail Traders Association. All have now agreed unanimously with the government's position. The significance of the training wage is fourfold. Firstly, for the first time it will introduce an adult training wage. Secondly, it will simplify the complexity of rates now applying to youth in this country. Importantly, it will base the rates on competencies and qualifications achieved; they will not be based on age. The third important area is that the training which qualifies for this wage can be training done on the job. Therefore,it will enhance the thrust to enterprise bargaining and the significance and relevance of an enterprise's training needs. Fourthly, we have streamlined the process, through the establishment of the body called Nettforce, whereby the red tape has been cut. So the meetings that I have held with employers have been numerous and they have been constructive, although you would be forgiven for believing that the whole training wage was about to collapse, from the newspaper reports of a little over a week ago. The shadow minister seemed to be relishing the thought that it would collapse-paying lipservice to the concept of a training wage but doing absolutely nothing constructive to achieve it. This is a government not just about developing good policy but prepared to get involved in the nitty-gritty of implementing it. The training wage is a milestone achievement for this government. It will help propel the skill formation agenda of this country, which is essential to avoid skill blockages. It will certainly help the long-term unemployed get back into work. It will significantly and far more effectively match employer requirements for skill formation with the available skills of the work force or, if those skills are not there, with the mechanisms in place to ensure that they are brought up to speed. I commend this initiative to those on the other side of the House. I hope they get behind supporting at least one dimension of the government's policies. NA",12
9,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from Canada. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Indonesia Visit: Australian Flag",13
10,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. On your previous visit to Indonesia in April 1992 you criticised Australia's national flag and promised Indonesians that you would change it. Prime Minister, will you give the Australian people an assurance that while you are in Indonesia this week you will not again demean Australia's flag or our national institutions and that you will stand up for Australians rather than apologise for them?",13

12,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory!,13
13,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Remember, I sang Advance Australia Fair first-before God save the Queen.",13
14,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, did you hear the little rider to that question and the embarrassment of the Leader of the National Party? And well may he be embarrassed, up there .singing the national anthem of another country:-up there singing God save the Queen at the monarchist dinner. And he has the temerity to get up and ask me questions about what I might say abroad! I will tell you what I will not say abroad. I will not be arguing that a foreigner should be Australia's head of state, as the Leader of the Opposition is arguing and as you are arguing-with you compounding it by singing the national anthem of Great Britain while you are at it. Mr Speaker, that is what I will not be doing. I marvel at the nature of the question from the Leader of the National Party. One of the things which I think is very important in the region nearby Australia is the notion in those countries that Australia is going its own way; that it now has an open, competitive trading economy; that it is integrating with the. region, in terms of investment and trade; and, in doing that, that Australia feels its independence is such that in this country there is a debate about the question, which warrants consideration, of the Australian head of state. I said this on the last occasion there I get asked about it again, I will say what the government's policy is. The notion is, 'You can mention the government's policy at home but don't mention it abroad.' That is, 'Don't go and say that the aim of the government's policy is that by the year 2001 Australia will become a republic with an Australian person as our head of state.' That is the government's policy and I will say it wherever I think it advances Australia's interests. Sole Parents",13
15,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Has the Minister for Social Security seen reports of a package of reforms for sole parents being introduced by the Clinton administration in the United States of America? Will Australia be adopting any of these measures?,14
16,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: one wonders what President Clinton's antlouncements have to do with this parliament but that was a direct request for the government to announce policy and, as such, is wasting our time. Mr Speaker-No, it was not; it was seeking information. The minister knows the standing order with regard to announCing government policy.",14
17,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I am sure many honourable members would be aware of the changes that President Clinton has announced in the United States. From our point of view, the announcements that he has made serve to highlight just how much headway we have made in this whole area over the last few years. There is a range of proposals, the most controversial of which is a time limitation on the availability of so-called welfare support. A range of other proposals is bound up with President Clinton's proposals. These include trying to achieve .a national system of child support, which in some ways would be analogous to the one we have already achieved here, and focusing additional amounts of assistance in the form of labour market program assistance to help sole parents get back into work. Again, in both those areas there have been some very significant and if achievements in this country. It is worth making the point that there are important demographic and social differences between our circumstances and those of the United States. When thinking about whether it is appropriate or justified to have a time limit on income support for sole parents, it is worth bearing in mind that the poliCies we have put in place-designed to increase the self-sufficiency of sole parents-have been very successful. The jobs education and training program is a very well-structured and effective program to help sole parents. As a consequence of this and the child support; scheme, we have actually been able to reduce very significantly the proportion of sole parents on the maximum rate of sole pension. It has gone down from around 84 per cent in 1983 to around 50 per cent now. That reflects the combined impact of our labour market interventions and our child support scheme. As honourable members would be aware, the child support scheme has been operating over the past six years and, since 1988, very significant achievements have been made. Around $450 million has now been directed through that scheme; around 70 per cent of that goes to the benefit of sole custodial parents and their children, and a significant part of the remainder goes back to the taxpayers in the form of reduced soCial security outlays. The proportion of sole parents receiving child support has gone from around 26 per cent at the beginning of the scheme to. around 40 per cent now. There has been virtually a doubling in the number of sole parent pensioners declaring maintenance. All in all, very considerable results have been achieved, given that we do not think it is appropriate to contemplate some sort of time limitation on access to these payments. We consider that would be highly inhumane. Also, in the light of the results that have been achieved, which have resulted in bringing down the average duration on the sole pension to around three years in this country in any case, it would be particularly inappropriate to contemplate the sorts of proposals that are being considered in the United States by way of a time limitation. As to the other measures in the Clinton package, as I said, we have already made very substantial headway in those broad directions. The net effect of that is to achieve a very significant improvement in the living standards of sole parents caring for children. This is an area of major achievement for this government in which I think we can justly take pride. Interest Rates",14
18,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given the fact that bond yields have steadily risen since your appearance on the Lateline program last Wednesday and that interest rates on fixed rate mortgages have already risen, do you now concede, as the Treasurer does, that official interest rates will be moving upward? Or do you continue to maintain that there is no pressure on official interest rates in Australia?",15
19,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It seems to me that bond yields have moved up all over the world, so the shadow Treasurer credits me with great influence, I must say. My Lateline interview must have travelled far and wide to have this devastating impact on bond yields. Thank you for the compliment. There is no doubt that skittishness in international markets has impacted and does impact into the Australian bond markets. There has been a view abroad about the prospects of inflation as recovery and strength of economic growth comes through the western economies. There has been a view, particularly in the face of very low nominal and real interest rates in the United States, that monetary policy needed to be shifted. But I made the point the other day-I think it is worth making again-that, at their lowest point, interest rates in the United States fell to three per cent. That is the federal funds rate, the official rate. The official rate in Australia, the cash rate, fell to 43/4 per cent. That is 13/4 percentage points above where the United States' rates were. They are bumping up now against capacity constraints in the US in the labour market, certainly in the trained labour market, in the product markets and with plant and equipment. There has been a view in US markets that this will reflect in higher rates of inflation. This has permeated world markets and has had an impact here. As I said the other evening, interest rates here for business lending are somewhere between 6 1/2 and nine per cent, with a real rate of something like 41/2 to seven per cent. Even if one were to take the gloomy view and say that inflation will be higher than two per cent in an underlying sense and, say, three per cent, a real rate of 3 1/2 or six per cent is not easy money. That is the point the Treasurer has made and the point I have made continually and consistently. What the Treasurer said is that as the recovery picks up and there is a call on savings by the private sector for plant and equipment and other forms of investment, in every other recovery the price of funds has risen. He is talking about them rising in this context not because of inflation getting out of control, but simply because of pressure on funds for resources. That is why I have made these points. I do not think the shadow Treasurer should try to paraphrase the Treasurer's remarks as indicating that some sort of interest rate rise is imminent. Basically, inflation has been decelerating",15
20,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It has happened.,15
21,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Bennelong says, 'It has happened; making reference to the two banks that have shifted their rates. There is a iot of competition in the retail banking sector these days and, as a . consequence, some rates are decidedly lower than others. If, in the funding of those loans, a bank decides that its fixed lending rate should rise from 6.9 per cent to 7.4 per cent, I think, in the case of one, I do not think the opposition is entitled to say, 'Shock, horror! The end of the world is coming.' Some books will be cast differently and, as a consequence, the lending policies of some banks will be different. Therefore they will lift their rates, but official rates have not risen. The key point is that official rates have not risen. They have not risen because the government believes that inflation has been . checked and that, from the official statistics, it has actually been decelerating. In that context, falling in with some sort of market sentiment from the northern hemisphere which says that inflation is going to be out of control, when we have just agreed to another two years under the accord of $8 to hold inflation in check means that the government will not be responding to pressures in the bond markets which are induced from other markets.",15
22,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Ministe-,for Human Services and Health. Can' the minister advise the House on the level of public support for Medicare and where the government stands in relation to recent community debate on the program?",16
23,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for the question because it gives me an opportunity to advise the parliament that 85 per cent of Australians surveyed fully support Medicare. This is a great success story of the government and one that I am pleased to say is apparently now enjoying the belated recognition of the opposition.Welcome to the rest of the country! I noticed over the weekend that the Leader of the Opposition got together with several of his frontbenchers on this question and they decided that it was time the opposition started to get behind Medicare. They recognise what most other people have known for a long time, and that is that it. is a very popular program: The reasons that people give for supporting Medicare are the ones that we have always endorsed-that is, that it helps low income earners, covers everybody regardless of means and location, and provides value for money. The Leader of the Opposition tells us that the Downer team is now going to support Medicare. The headline in the Canberra TImes read 'Downer to team: we like Medicare.' This is wonderful news. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition wants his backbenchers and his frontbenchers to convey the following message to the community: They believe that if they can convince a voting public enamoured with Medicare that they will get that ... they will win votes. In other words, as the Prime Minister is suggesting to me, it is an entirely cynicalexercise-not talking about how it will be delivered, but, at the same time, talking about gap insurance.",16
24,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,16
25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,16
26,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is most interesting Medicare that whenever these issues are raised with the opposition its response is simply to try to shout out the argument The opposition is supporting Medicare now but $1.6 billion is going to be ripped out of the public health system at the same time. That is why I call it cynical. The $1.6 billion is the tax credits that have been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition spokeswoman on health. That has been reinforced by the Leader of the Opposition in recent days. That is what it would cost to give tax credits at the level proposed by those opposite-$1.6 billion. The Leader of the Opposition and honourable members opposite say that they are not going to increase taxes; and they are going to cut that out of the system-$1.6 billion out of Medicare! In other words, the Leader of the Opposition is proposing what his old leader did. He is proposing to go to the electorate and say, 'We support Medicare'-Fraser said 'We support Medibank' - and then rip all the funds out of the system which make it work. That is clearly what has happened in this case. When asked about how they are going to fund these tax credits, those opposite talk about reducing fraud in the system. The specific indication that was given by the Leader of the Opposition is that they would stop $1.6 billion worth of fraud in the system. I find that highly unlikely, and it is particularly dishonest",16
27,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,16
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!. Will the minister resume her seat for a moment. Those on my left will restrain themselves. The minister is entitled to be heard in silence and she will be.,16
29,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition has the level just right: he is inclined in this House to make interjections an interesting kindMr Filing interjecting,17
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Moore.,17
31,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"but not quite loud enough for others to hear and certainly not loud enough for Hansard. The question in this case is the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition. We are talking about your loving Medicare, taking $1.6 billion out of the system and insisting that it will be done by checking on fraud, when just a month ago your members in the Senate watered do-n a proposition which would have seen us m a better position to prevent fraud. We have the same group of members putting forward to the people of this country a proposal that they know people want to .hear: 'support Medicare'; then, if ever they were to get into office, they would do the Fraser trick of dismantling it; ripping $1.6 billion out from the system; creating a twotiered system with gap insurance, which would be out of control; and heading in the direction of the United States, which now has 12 per cent of its gross national product in form of health care costs. The people of Australia ate awake up to the Leader of the Opposition and they know that he speaks with a forked tongue on Medicare. Interest Rates",17
32,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given that the Treasurif er conceded on SundayMr Snowdon-Woof! Mr Tim Fischer- Mr SPEAKER ,17
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy inflation Leader of the Opposition might resume his seat for a minute. The honourable member the Northern Territory will stop interjecting. Mr Downer-There is an irony in the factoring interjection.,17
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the call. He is not being helped by those on his own side.,17
35,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Given that the Treasurer conceded on Sunday that interest rates will of rise, do you stand by your statement that interest rate increases will trigger a wages push? What effect would a simultaneous surge in interest rates and wages have on employment and the economy generally?",17
36,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first observation I make is simply this: it is only this side of the House that has the policy to keep wages in check. That is point one. We have done so for the eleven years of the accord. In most years we have had the wages outcome-that is, the national accounts average weekly earningsat below the budget forecast, so the accord and its management have outperformed the official forecast for the. year. We recently concluded a further arrangement under accord mark 7 to adjust the bottom 20 to 25 per cent of the work force by two $8 per week increases. The rest of the work force will be adjusted by enterprise bargaining, giving Australia the kind of wage flexibility that, as with everything else, only a Labor government would have done. Whether it is deregulating the financial markets, or opening up the exchange mark-ts or the product markets, or knocking the tanff wall over, or opening up telecommunications, the or fixing the ports and wharves, in the labour market, as always, all the hard jobs get left at our door. Again we are seeing that sort of flexibility now running through the lab?ur market. As a consequence, we are seemg wages maintaining low inflation. The point I made the other night was this: you say to the work force, 'Look, let's be in a national objective of restraining inflation', which the business community accepts and the work force accepts, and in a sense there is a compact on this, and we have down, but then one of the markets that boast concern about the inflation ratefor the bond market-says, 'We don't believe . that inflation has been defeated in Australia; we don't believe the national resolve; we are in higher inflation,' and that ends up, as some of them would like it.. re-ecting in nominal interest rates and housmg mterest rates, why would any person in the work force say, 'I've made my contribution'? Interest rates are now rising. One of the principal points of low inflation is low interest rates. If the work force contributes to low inflation but does not get the low interest rates, what is it left with, if interest rates to rise inexorably, other than to say, 'This is the cost of living and we'll recover it in the marketplace'? Apparently the shadow Treasurer cavils at that notion. He thinks there is something fanciful about it. - at is because he does not understand how the labour market and the economy work. If he had had a decade of wrestling with the double digit inflation bequeathed to us by our predecessors and getting it down in the context of wage tax trade-offs and productivity related wage bargaining, he would have some sort of deeper and incisive understanding about the relationship between wages, inflation and interest rates, and the role of interest rates in the economy and society, particularly in terms of wage costs. The government now has a productivity based wages system in place. On the Lateline program last week, I said that the government will always have a weather eye on inflation. In any recovery, one would be recreant of one's duty not to keep a weather eye on wages-and we will-to see that, where wages are accompanied by productivity, we can be confident that the inflation rate is going to stay where it is. But where there are wage increases which are paid without a connection to productivity, the government will keep an eye on that. It is the government which has brought inflation in Australia back to and below the world average of our trading partners. It was never the coalition, which found itself unable to deal with inflation from the mid-1970s onwards.",17

46,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The relationship should always have been productive for Australia and Indonesia but getting it to the point where it is productive for Australia and Indonesia should be a high objective of Australian foreign policy. It certainly remains so with this government. I will be going to Indonesia this afternoon, principally to open the trade forum, which is part of the Australia Today Indonesia 1994 promotion now under way. I remind the House that this is the largest trade delegation ever to leave Australia. More than 200 business people will participate in the forum. Many of them are also taking part in associated trade exhibitions, which I think is an outstanding result, and shows just how far the relationship has travelled in the last few years to be able to mount such an exhibition. It is worth reminding the House that twoway trade with Indonesia is now worth $3 billion, and Australian exports have tripled in the past six years. Nearly a quarter of our exports are elaborately transformed manufactures and just on 200 companies are now represented on the ground in Indonesia. The Australia Today promotion, which is the most extensive we have ever undertaken, will help focus the attention of Australian and Indonesian business on new areas of cooperation. I remind the House that, on average, the Indonesian economy grows at six per cent a year. So this is a vast powerhouse of growth, wealth and demand. The services sector is one such area where real gains can be made. For example, the number of visitors to Australia from Indonesia rose by 40 per cent in 1993.

The other thing I am going to mention while I am there is the proposal to consider the future of AFTA, its objective of reducing protectionism in the ASEAN areaÂ· and the possibility of a more formal set of linkages with Australia and New Zealand. As the talk to House may know, the combined GDP of ASEAN is roughly the GDP of Australia and New Zealand.

As a consequence, it would make a trading market of about $1,000 billion, which is a third the size of Japan's market; with about 300 million people. This proposal has been discussed by the government with the government of Thailand and with other countries in ASEAN. I will range over this issue with the Indonesian President and ministers. No relationship is more important to Australia than the one we have with Indonesia. Our economic, political, security and regional interests are all heavily engaged there. As the Australia Today promotion shows, the relationship is now broadening to a wide range of issues. It is a short visit-two days-but I hope to renew the contact with the President and the government and to range over these issues, which are important to both our countries, including the forthcoming APEC leaders meeting in November, which offers great prospects for change in the Asia-Pacific area, given the nature of its attendees, and the future of the trading relationship between Indonesia, ASEAN and Australia. Tax Increases  the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Treasurer said, 'We'll have a look at both our monetary .and fiscal policy and if necessary then we'll tighten them.' Given the Prime Minister's statement in this place last year that there would be no further spending cuts, because anyone who proposed further spending cuts was-to use your words-either 'an extremist or a foo]', can we now assume that further tightening of fiscal policy will involve tax increases?",19

62,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I III ways say to those opposite, you are very easily amused and happy in your circumstances over there-and well may it continue! I have said in the past that any notion of a change in public policy resting on a $10,000 million cut to public expenditure is fanciful and extreme. That was the policy-and as far as I know it remains the policy-of the federal opposition. Over and over again, after years of cutting public sector outlays in this country to where they now lie, I have said that people who believe that they can cut just on two per of GOP from outlays are deluding themselves. It would mean the absolute destruction of the socia] security system, the social welfare system, the transfer system and the education system as a consequence. It would be impossible and unthinkable. I have also said on a number of occasions, as has the Treasurer-and he made it clear again yesterday-when asked pap questions by journalists such as 'Will you give a guarantee about this and about that?' particular]y as we have seen enormous changes in economic cycles, that no government sensibly is going to say, 'We are going to close off this option and that option.' Of course not! The government took remedial action on the receipt side of the budget last year. Let me remind honourable members opposite that, in a totally unprincipled way, they opposed every such change in the Senate and attempted to defeat them. As a consequence, receipts to GOP-and their equation with outlayswill lead to an outcome which the government forecasts will be better now than the deficit of one per cent of GOP by 1996-97.  promised to balance it.",20
63,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member has asked his question. He has had his litt]e go from last week. He can wait a moment. The government, as a consequence, put those receipt side measures into place. The budget trajectory is travelling down to below one per cent of GOP by 1996-97. All the Treasurer said is that even if, for instance, the recovery gets to the point in a couple of years from now where it is putting real pressure on resources, we will always keep fiscal policy under notice. I should have thought that to be a pretty unexceptional statement, a thing that any rational government would do. But having already put those receipt side measures into place, particularly with fisca]. policy travelling down the way we expect, there is a nice balance between monetary and fiscal policy. That is the point I thought he wanted to make and, I thought, he made it well. Industrial Relations",20

At a meeting in Washington last week with the House Majority Leader, Congressman Richard Gephardt, some very positive things indeed were said about Australian industrial relations, in particular about the Australian best practice demonstration program. That meeting coincided with the introduction by Congressman Gephardt of legislation into the US Congress which is based upon the Australian program.

69,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Congressman Gephardt took the opportunity last week to acknowledge that Australia was the source of the proposed US program. He said: We are thrilled and happy to be able to follow Australia's lead. We are certainly ready, willing and able to copy anybody's ideas that are good we commend Australia for its farsightedness. This is not the first occasion on which key US figures have praised the tripartite nature of Australia's industrial relations system. It was earlier this year that Dr Ray Marshall, a senior member of the Dunlop commissionwhich happens to be the commission set up by President Clinton in the States to study labour market reform-said after studying our system that the US could learn particularly from Australia how to make it very difficult to pursue low wage policies. That is what he had to say. He said it was a great lesson for him and he proposed that it was a lesson that could well be learned by all of the United States. He went on to say that the Dunlop commission 'is not going to any country we don't think we can learn anything from. We are not going to the United Kingdom for instance'. Those people came here to Australia to study our industrial relations system. How ironic it is, against this background, with prominent US statesman after statesman commendingOpposition members-na, hal",21
70,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do I hear mirth about the Congress majority leader, Congressman Gephardt? Do you argue with that? I would sincerely hope not. It is against this background that the federal coalition continues to advocate its Jobsback policy, the policy that gives all of the worse aspects of the old system in the United Kingdom and the old existing system in the United States, a system that provides no safety net at all, that provides a policy vacuum and a recipe for wage slashing and industrial conflict. The opposition's domestic role model is the Victorian IR system, the system that has now seen almost 400,000 workers resign from state award coverage and come across to the federal system. Only last week the Victorian Employee Relations Commission, that is the commission set up by the Kennett government, itself went to the extent of disowning the system. The architect of Jobsback, the honourable member for Bennelong, missed his annual hypocritical sojourn to Geneva this year. He should perhaps think about a visit to the US Congress. If he went there and spoke to the and congressmen I spoke to last week he would realise that it is not just the Australian people who are rejecting his policies for low wages for Australian workers.

She has kept a perpetual interest in education and training as issues. The government has appointed Mr Bannon, a former premier, to the board of the ABC. As a consequence, I am sure that the ABC board will be the better for it. Also during government's current period of office, Mr Warwick Smith, a former opposition member, has been appointed as the Ombudsman of Telecom and a former Liberal Party lord mayor of Brisbane, Sallyanne Atkinson, has been made a trade commissioner in Paris. In the light of that, I would not have thought that the opposition would have asked such a question. As far as Bob Hawke is concerned, recently he and Malcolm Fraser, at my behest, represented Australia at the constitutional arrangement, the election of Nelson Mandela in the South African election. So I do not think there is any basis for the question, other than to display the juvenile qualities that the Leader of the Opposition now seems intent upon presenting with great gusto at each question period. Maybe, if the coalition were in office, there would not be a whole bevy of former leaders, and deputy leaders, on its front bench. There they sitalone and palely loitering. South Pacific",22
86,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Can the minister inform the House about the regional reaction to his recent speech on Australia 'srelations with the South Pacific? Mr BILNEYIt is interesting indeed that the only interest in that speech in the parliament came from our side of the House. That speech, which was given on 15 June, was the first major review of Australia's relations with that very important area, the South Pacific, since Senator Gareth Evans gave his constructive commitment speech in 1988. In my speech I reaffirmed the principle of constructive commitment as the ongoing. basis of Australia'S relationship with the South Pacific region. I aisorestated Australia's enduring commitment to working with Pacific Island countries to help secure the future of the region. At the same time, I suggested that the end of the Cold War and the rise of APEC presented the region with very changed international circumstances and new challenges and that we were facing increasing social and economic problems which needed to be urgently recogthe nised and addressed by the countries themselves in partnership with Australia. I said that Australia did not seek to impose its own solutions to regional problems, or that those problems were easily identified or not different between the separate countries, but that the Pacific Island countries themselves should accept greater responsibility for putting in place the kinds of policies and programs which were needed to achieve sustainable economic growth. That is important to maintain the support of donors and, equally, to attract quality foreign investment over the long term. As a key part of that, I highlighted the importance of the sustainable management of island countries' natural resources, particularly in the fisheries and the forestry sectors, and the ways in which closer regional cooperation between the Pacific Island countries could give them more equitable returns from the harvesting of their resources. I noticed just today that the Papua New Guinea Minister for Forests was reported to have said that his country is losing more than $1 112 million from illegal logging exports. I also noted that there was great potential for ecotourism as a longer term economic alternative for the region, provided that the fragile environments of the Pacific Island countries could be protected from further economic degradation. I said, importantly, that this presaged the discussion which will occur at the South Pacific Forum to take place in Brisbane early in August. At that meeting regional leaders will discuss in a more focused way the opportunities for sustainable development in those countries. The speech was telecast live in the South Pacific region and was very well received by Pacific Island countries as a confirmation of our serious and informed interest in the South Pacific region and of our continuing constructive approach to regional issues. In fact, I inform the honourable member that a number of island country leaders have indicated publicly or to me personally that we have a common understanding of the urgent problems which face the region, and they, like us, want to address them with equal urgency. We do not believe that we can solve the region's problems, but we can assist. We do not think that region-wide solutions will necessarily work, but we do believe that the problems facing the region are very serious. They need the urgent attention of Pacific Island couritries in partnership with their friends, of which Australia will always remain one. Prime Minister: Piggery",22
87,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It relates to answers given to questions to him earlier this year. Inquiries to the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority confirm that the company, Brown and Hatton, will be prosecuted under the Clean Waters Act for two separate acts of pollution at Parkville between August and October last year. You were the half owner of the company at the time. You must know that the excess effluent from those piggeries at Parkville runs into Kingdon Ponds, which supplies the city of Scone with one-third of its water supplies, and eventually a day runs into the Hunter River system. Why, in answer to questions from me on 9 and 21 February, did you mislead the parliament saying that the Parkville piggeries had not contributed to any pollution when you, a half owner, were aware at the time of the instances to which I am referring? Do you still claim that what you said in the House was true when the EPA is now saying that you were aware of the investigation at the time?",23

92,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, as far as I understand, at Parkville. I am informed that last week the Environment Protection Authority announced that it intends to take an action against the company. It announced that before having any communication with the company at all. At this stage, the Environment Protection Authority has not served any process on the company whatsoever. If the member for Barker wants to go off on this, he should first ask the Environment Protection Authority in New South Wales, in its indecent haste to announce this, why it announced it without first advising the company or issuing any process. I am also informed that it has contravened a number of important regulations in the process that it has undertaken, and the company tells me that it will quite happily engage the Environment Protection Authority in litigation with the expectation of defeating it again. I saw this report and I made sure that I asked about it. As a consequence, the company said, 'We'l1 see them in court again.' .

101,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I present the committee's report entitled The proposal for pay parking in the parliamentary zone, together with evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",24
102,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,"I have great pleasure in presenting to the House a report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories on the proposal for pay parking in the parliamentary zone. The parliamentary zone represents the heart of the national capital and belongs to all Australians. The parliamentary zone is a major focus for tourists in the national capital. Visitors come to see their Parliament House and those other institutions and monuments that have been largely established and supported by government revenue. This was the first public inquiry the committee has undertaken in relation to the parliamentary zone. On 21 December 1993 the then Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), wrote I to the committee referring to it a proposal by the National Capital Planning Authority, the NCPA, to install new parking signs and voucher machines within the parliamentary that zone. The work was required for the implementation of pay parking within the zone. Pay parking was the method proposed to raise some $4.3 million of a total program of $19.3 way. million for the restoration and replacement program of national capital assets. . The committee supports the need for a coordinated maintenance program to ensure that the parliamentary zone is preserved and improved. Regrettably, the works proposal examined in the inquiry was not one that the committee felt would result in the improvement and enhancement of the parliamentary zone. The committee was concerned that the installation of voucher machines and associated signs would have a detrimental effect on the appearance of the parliamentary zone and would be contrary to the high design standReport ards enforced by the NCPA for other works in the area. The majority of the committee interpreted the scope of the terms of reference broadly to include the examination of the works proposal in its entirety. Without exception, all people and organisations who made submissions to the inquiry addressed the broader range of issues raised in the NCPA's proposal. This meant that the impact of the installation of signs and equipment was considered as well as the wider issues raised in the works proposal. All of the institutions in the parliamentary zone were concerned about the impact of the proposal on tourist numbers and the detrimental effect on visitor enjoyment of national institutions. If the meter is running they would have to rush to avoid being fined and therefore the enjoyment of visiting would be diminished. Some important Australian institutions could be financially disadvantaged by the proposal. The committee felt that insufficient attention had been paid to allaying the concerns of the major institutions in the parliamentary zone. The committee was also concerned about the possible impact of the proposal on the many volunteers who willingly give up their time to assist in the operations of some of Australia's most important institutions. In examining the details of the works proposal, the committee believed that insufficient attention has been given to the nature the parliamentary zone, which is an area of substantial employment but lacks the normal commercial and community services found at other centres. The committee received submissions from many people who work in the area. It was noted that no guarantee by the NCPA had been given that improved public transport links would be created to ensure an adequate service into the zone at peak periods. Also, in examining the works proposal, the committee was concerned that the revenue targets were unlikely to be achieved without a significant increase in the rpte of charges for pay parking, which would be disproportionate to the commercial value of the parking sites. In addition, there is no guarantee that at the of the restoration program the funds raised from the parking charges in the parliamentary zone would continue to be spent on national capital assets. Consequently, the committee has recommended that parliamentary approval, as required under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, not be granted for the proposal to install voucher parking machines and associated signs in the parliamentary zone; and that the National Capital Planning Authority, in consultation with other relevant departments, investigate alternative means by which additional funds could be raised to offset the cost of the restoration and replacement program of national capital assets. (TIme expired)",24
103,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,"I would just reinforce the comments made by the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). This was a relatively trivial inquiry, but many honourable members will be familiar with the fact that issues of this kind generate a lot of attention even though they are not of central importance, and we received a surprising number of submissions. I would begin by thanking the committee staff for their work, as I am sure the chairman would have done if he had been given the time to do so. The work on this inquiry was very professional and thorough, and the of drafting is an excellent summary of the issues. The chairman has summarised those points very well and I would also thank him. But let me just reiterate a couple of the very important ones. As the chairman said today in preface to his remarks and as the report states at the beginning of the summary of conclusions and recommendations: The Parliamentary Zone represents the heart of the National Capital, and belongs to all Australians. It was in that context we were looking at this inquiry. It is important that all the institutions within the parliamentary zone-the parliament, of course, but also the other institutions: the National Library, the National Art end Gallery, the High Court, and so on-be freely available to people. To introduce pay parking seemed to us inconsistent with that goal. As well, the chairman has mentioned other issues that concerned the committee. We were not at all impressed with the idea of the introduction of voucher machines. We thought that they would not in. any way enhance the aesthetic value of the area; in fact, we thought they would detract from it. We were concerned about the issue of who should pay for improvements. Of course, there needs to be improvements and maintenance in the area, and it is entirely appropriate that funding for those tasks come out of general revenue. It seems inappropriate that shnply those who work in the area or those who volunteer to help at those cultural institutions, such as the gallery and the library, should be expected to pay for what is really a national asset. As the chairman has already said, we were not convinced with the revenue estimates and were quite deeply concerned that a modest level of parking fee, the introduction of which was proposed, would very rapidly become a larger one. We thought that there had not been adequate thought to alternative modes of transport through the area, and we believe that also needs attention. It is very important to t:lote that there are alternative methods of funding improvements, other than just general revenue, if that is what the government really wants. A very obvious way of doing that would be through charging some kind of fee directly to the institutions which are located in the area. For example, charging rental for land in the parliamentary zone would be a very logical way of funding improvements and maintenance of infrastructure in the area. In conclusion, I think the committee has made a very sensible recommendation. I fully expect that the government will accept it and take seriously the need to maintain well the beauty of the central area of the national capital, an area of which all Australians can be proud and, I think, most are. We should look for ways of {nhancing that improvement rather than detracting from it.",25

108,Mr GORMAN,COMMITTEES,"Greenway) (1.45 p.m.)On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, I present the committee's report entitled ASIO and security assessment: a review of security assessment procedures, together with evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",26
109,Mr GORMAN,COMMITTEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the report I have just presented-ASIO and security assessment: a review of security assessment procedures-is the result of a reference to the committee from the previous Attorney-General in the last parliament which was referred again by the present Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) in May 1993. In total, five public hearings were held, two in 1992 and three in 1993. Submissions were received from 29 organisations and individuals, and evidence was taken at both public and in camera hearings from agencies such as ASIO itself, the Attorney-General's Department, the Inspector-General of Intelligence"" and Security, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Security Appeals Tribunal, the Administrative Review Council, the Privacy Commissioner and the Merit Protection and Review Agency. The report traces briefly the historical background to ASIO's present role in security assessment; from its establishment in 1949, through the royal commissions headed by Mr Justice Hope in the 1970s and the 1980s, to the present. In its examination of the issues, the committee came to several early and fundamental conclusions: firstly, that it remains in the national interest to restrict access to certain places and information; and, secondly, that the appropriate balance has been achieved between the security assessment role of ASIO and the access suitability decision making role of agencies. In reaching these conclusions, however, the committee identified a number of areas of concern, namely: the intrusive nature of security checking, and the extent to which this process itself may deter suitable applicants for positions; the extent of security checking, resulting from the number of government positions requiring the occupants to have a national security clearance; the qualifications from a training and experience of agency officers involved in security clearance decisions; aspects of the procedures adopted by the Security Appeals Tribunal; and the lack of a right of review of agency decisions in relation to access. Th- committee makes nine recommendations in relation to these concerns. Among these are recommendations designed to: allow for greater public accountability by agency heads for decisions related to security access; review the privacy-intrusive nature of the present process; and establish a new security division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and permit appeals to the tribunal in relation to access decisions by agency heads. The report makes an important contribution to what should be a continuing examination and discussion of the sensitive issues involved in personnel security. This continuing examination must always seek to balance individual human rights with the needs of national security. i thank committee members for their contributions. I also thank the staff, particularcontains ly Donald Nairn, Pat Sherman and Miss Gillies; the secretary during the later stages of  Catherine Cornish, Margaret Gibson and Sophia Konti. I commend the report to the House.",26
110,Mr DODD,COMMITTEES,"As a member of the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, I support the committee's report. Today I wish to speak about chapter 3 of the report which deals with the role of the agencies. The agencies have the final responsibility on security clearances. The committee raised some matters in this regard which were certainly of concern. The committee was particularly concerned about the role of the agencies and the extent of the somewhat intrusive questioning of security clearances. Obviously, ASIO has a role, and I certainly support the report's recommendations on ASIO. Over-classification was one of the matters dealt with by the committee. Too many positions are classified as security positions, and that sheets back to the agencies. The recommendations go further than that. On a matter of great concern to the committee, it is worth quoting from Mr Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, who states: Individuals must provide detailed personal information in a questionnaire and/or interview. These details are then checked against information held by other agencies-including the police and in some cases, ASIO, to confirm the details provided and/or ascertain if there is other relevant information. In some cases, personal information about third persons, such as spouses or other relatives, is collected and checked: this often occurs without the knowledge or involvement of these third parties. In such cases, the issue arises as to whether these third persons should be made aware that information about them is being recorded and given the opportunity to comment; and whether their consent is sought before checks are carried out. The committee was impressed by the strength of the arguments of the Privacy Commissioner. The committee stated in the report: The involvement of third parties on issues unrelated to work performance is an unwarranted and unnecessary intrusion on personal privacy. To illustrate this, appendix C of the report personal particulars forms. Question 13 in the personal particulars form No. 1 is: Do you have a Spouse/De Facto/Fiance(e)? Question 14 is: Has this person visited or resided overseas? That question is very broad, and it is questionable as to whether it is relevant to a security report. These forms are certainly intrusive to third parties. The committee has made recommendations-not definite recommendations---on this matter in its report. I think the chairman of the. committee would agree with me in saying that this matter is obviously. something which the committee would want to monitor in the future. The Privacy Commissioner told the committee that he was concerned that very junior officers sometimes carried out questioning using the personal particulars questionnaire. I guess it adds insult to injury when senior officers of the Public Service are questioned by junior officers on quite personal matters, such as whether they have a fiance or whether their fiance has relatives overseas. The committee recommended that all security interviews within agencies be conducted by appropriately qualified, trained and experienced officers. I think that is very important. I commend the committee's report to the House. It is a good report which deals with a very difficult issue. The committee has been dealing with this issue for some time. Our deliberations have been long, but they have been thorough and very worthwhile. (Time expired) Motion (by Mr Gorman) proposed: That the House take note of the report.",27

112,Mr ELLIOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian Parliamensomewhat tary Delegation to the 39th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference, held in Cyprus, and to Malta and Germany from 3 to 23 September 1993. The delegation to the 39th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Cyprus, and to Malta and Germany in September last year, was significant in a number of ways. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference was attended by 247 delegates from 97 Commonwealth jurisdictions. Its theme was the role of the Commonwealth in world economic development and its impact on the environment; the strengthening of parliamentary democracy; world security; and the safeguarding of human rights. Commonwealth of Australia branch delegates contributed to all plenary and panel sessions. A highlight of the conference was the addressÂ· by His Excellency Chief Emeka Anyaoku, on the theme 'The Commonwealth and inalienable rights'. The full text of his address is an appendix to the report I have just presented. It was a memorable speech, particularly on African issues. The CPA's formal decision making body, the general assembly, was especially significant in that it adopted a new constitution. The former constitution had been in effect since 1977 and had been much amended, leading to problems of interpretation and questions as to its consistency. The Commonwealth of Australia branch, and particularly former President Kerry Sibraa, had put considerable effort into the development of the draft. Our delegation was successful in persuading the general assembly to agree to certain amendments to the proposed constitution. The adoption of the constitution, as amended, was received with utmost satisfaction by all concerned. The assembly also elected the next chairman of the CPA executive committee. Mr Colin Shepherd, a member of the UK House of Commons, was successful and congratulations are extended to him. The delegation's visit to Malta was the first official visit by a delegation from the Australian parliament. Australia's relations with Malta at the parliamentary, governmental and citizen levels remain excellent, enhanced by the large numbers in Australia of Maltese-born citizens and those claiming Maltese ancestry. Discussions were held with the Maltese President, the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the Leader of the Opposition, central political party representatives and leading figures in industry and commerce. The end result from the delegation's view was a most successful renewal of ties with the Maltese House of Representatives and review of our bilateral relationship, and an exchange of views on a wide range of political, economic and social issues, both domestic and international. The visit to Germany was the first by a parliamentary delegation since the 1989 unification. The timing was interesting in that the commencement of the visit coincided with the Hamburg state elections in what was described by one participant in the delegation's program as a marathon period of elections. In Hamburg the Social Democratic Party lost its absolute majority but retained power with the support of the Greens. The Christian Democratic Union vote fell to 25 per cent and a right wing extremist candidate failed to be elected by only 0.2 per cent. Some observers saw the result as a protest vote against the major parties and a major shift in politics resulting from changes in eastern Europe, and as an indication of Germany in microcosm. The contact the delegation enjoyed with a wide cross-section of political, legislative, and executive leaders, with leading industry and commerce figures, and in legislator to legislator discussions, gave the delegation a sound awareness of the challenges and practical considerations flowing from the 1989 unification, particularly the enormous resources required to bring the former GDR states to parity. The visit provided members of the delegvisit ation with the opportunity to advance Australia's position on the need for a speedy conclusion to the Uruguay Round and to assert our support for the Blair House agreeCommonwealth ment as a minimum position. The opportunity was also taken to urge greater access to Australian exports, particularly coal and agricultural products. The delegation had the opportunity to' sample some of Germany's cultural delights, including a German performance of The Phantom of the Opera in Hamburg, a modernistic performance in the Semper Opera House, Dresden, entitled Hommage to Rachmaninoff, and a tour of the 'Old Masters Gallery' in Dresden, encompassing works by Rembrandt, Rubens, van Dyck and others-a very memotypes rable experience. Thanks are extended to our hosts and to the Australian representatives in Cyprus, Malta and Germany. The hard working staff of the parliamentary relations office as ever did everything within their power to ensure the visit's success. Thanks are also extended to the delegation members. I also extend the delegation's thanks to the Deputy Clerk of the House, Mr Ian Harris, and Mr Fred Peppinck, Senior Adviser to the then President of the Senate, for their invaluable assistance to the delegation. It was an extremely hard working delegation, punctual a and ever committed to presenting unified representation of Australia's position on specific issues. Particular thanks are due to Kerry Sibraa and Brian Archer, who have since left the Senate, for their leadership and individual contributions. I commend the report to the House.",28
113,Mr TRUSS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"It was a real privilege to be a part of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 39th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. It was my first experience in representing the Australian parliament overseas and I certainly found the visit informative, interesting and enjoyable. The hospitality extended to us was always generous and we were made to feel very welcome wherever we went. As the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) mentioned, the central cause of the was to attend the Commonwealth Parliastrongly mentary Conference in Cyprus. Yet again that conference demonstrated what a diverse group of nations the British of Nations has become. It is no longer, if it ever was, just a group of traditional English-speaking, prosperous, white democracies. The majority of delegates these days come from countries that are black, Indian, Third World or African. Surprisingly, a number of French speaking parliaments are also represented at the conference. It was an excellent meeting which certainly did a great deal to further extend the bonds of goodwill that exist between Commonwealth countries. I suppose not. many world shattering resolutions are ever carried or dealt with at these of gatherings but I thought the final communique was a bit of a disappointment. I think it showed very little reflection of what actually happened at the conference. It was full of politically correct language, but I could not help get the feeling thatÂ· it was written before the conference started and that what actually occurred was not allowed to influence the final comrriunique too much. We had the opportunity to see something of Cyprus but, even without our own visual observations, the so-called Cyprus problem, as it is euphemistically described, was ever present in the debates. The division of Cyprus into Greek and Turkish sectors is a tragedy which falls very heavily' on the lives of the local people. The Australian police force that is currently fulfilling a role there is very highly thought of. From time to time there have been suggestions that Australia should withdraw that group of men and women. I can assure the parliament that such an action would not be well received by the people of Cyprus. Their role is appreciated and there is a desire to maintain that United Nations presence to ensure peace and security between the Greek and Turkish sectors. The visit to MaltaÂ· was also a wonderful experience. As was previously mentioned, it is perhaps surprising that this was the first visit ever by an Australian parliamentary delegation to Malta. There are lots of ties between our two countries. Virtually every Maltese family can tell stories of their relatives in Australia. We were told on more than one occasion that there were more Maltese in Australia than in Malta. Some of those people who came here years ago are now returning to their home country as the Maltese economy improves and it is now a little more difficult to obtain work in Australia. There are close ties between Australia and Malta. We were warmly welcomed in Malta and had the opportunity to meet all of the leading political and business figures of that country. There is a strong desire in Malta to strengthen links with Australia. In particular, the Maltese regularly raise their desire to have air links between Malta and Australia to facilitate a more appropriate method of travel. The country has a magnificent history. It has been a fortress for something like 2,000 years, strategically located no matter what conflict there seems to have been in the world, and its heroic people have certainly filled a very prominent role in the history of the world. The journey to Germany enabled us to learn something about the enormous impact of reuniting East and West Germany. The East Germans, who have lived in a sheltered economy for a long time, are now exposed to the rigours of international competition. It is not just ordinary international competition, because it is now in direct association with West Germany, one of the most vigorous economies in the world. The East Germans are not finding that experience to be all plain sailing. There are many difficulties, but they are adjusting and there is a great deal of confidence that the new Germany will be stronger as a result. I think it was a very useful exchange. I would join my colleagues in thanking the leader of the delegation, Senator Kerry Sibraa, as well as Ian Harris, Fred Peppinck and others associated with assisting the delegation. We learnt a great deal and I am sure that our understanding of the issues of the world has been greatly strengthened as a result of the delegation.",29
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Mr Rocher)Order! The discussion has concluded. NA Environment, Recreation and the Arts Committee Report",30
115,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I present the committee's report entitled Commonwealth environmental impact assessment process: review of audit report .No. 10 of 1992-93: living with our decisions, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",30
116,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report that I have just presented is the third review of an audit report that I have tabled this year. On a previous occasion I emphasised how important it was for the parliament to take careful note of audit reports and for it to call on government departments to explain how they are going to overcome any deficiencies identified by the auditors. In this case I very pleased to report that the agency cerned, the Commonwealth Environment assistance Protection Agency, CEPA, has taken a posiown tive, indeed pro-active, approach to the audit report. Undertaken during 1992 by the Australian National Audit Office, the efficiency audit was intended to determine how the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commonwealth's firmly environmental impact assessment processes could be improved. CEPA is to be comwithin mended for its initiative in developing detailed strategic approach to implement auditors' recommendations. However, the committee is concerned that CEPA's effort has not been matched by other departments and agencies with responsibilities under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. In the 20 years since the act was introindustry duced, Australia has undergone some dramatic changes. The emphasis on conservation, preservation and protection of the environevaluation ment has taken on new dimensions. Environand mental impact assessment has become a routine part of decision making but, as the audit revealed and as CEPA's subsequent actions confirmed, there is considerable for reform of the administration of the enviallocating ronmental impact assessment process. One of the features of the act-and it can be argued that it is a deficiency-is that departments and agencies other than CEPA have to make the initial assessment about whether a proposed action is likely to rise to significant environmental impact. main environmental impact assessment provireport sions of the act are triggered only if this initial assessment identifies potential impacts. This procedure means that the so-called action ant. agencies that make this initial assessment need staff who are knowledgeable in the EIA process. One of the most important findings emerging from the committee's review of the audit is the pressing need for information and training in the EIA process. At present there is a notable lack of expertise among officers in other agencies which are involved in environmental impact assessment. CEPA has am developed a comprehensive draft operational conmanual which should be of considerable to other agencies in writing their in-house manuals and organising their own staff development programs. CEPA will take a Jeadership role in developing appropriate education strategies to increase the level of expertise of all environmental impact assessment practitioners, but the committee believes that this task must be a shared one. The development of greater expertise action agencies is likely to encourage a the integration of environmental decisions the with general administrative processes. To assist further in the education process, CEPA is proposing to set up an environmental impact assessment practitioners' network that is designed to bring together a cross-section of people who are participants in the EIA process and other interested parties, such as representatives, academics and conservation organisations. The purpose of the network will be to facilitate the sharing, and dissemination of information to promote stronger relations between all parties. The committee has recommended that all departments and agencies with responsibilities under the act support the proposed scope network and demonstrate their support by adequate resources to ensure its success. Another deficiency in the act is the lack of provision for the monitoring of compliance with conditions imposed on developments and for assessing the actual impacts of projects give once they become operational. CEPA comThe missioned a consultancy to evaluate and on the best options for monitoring approved projects. This is another area where the response of other agencies will be importThe committee believes that memoranda of understanding between the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and all . government agencies that make environmentally significant decisions haveÂ· been much underrated and underutilised. They serve a valuable purpose in assisting agencies in the important task of evaluating the environmental significance of proposals. They do this by establishing appropriate procedures for determining environmental significance, by providing guidance as to which proposals should be referred for consideration and by ensuring that other agencies are aware of proposals. The committee believes that it is important for parliament to be aware of progress in the negotiation of memoranda of understanding. (Extension of time granted) It has recommended that DEST provide details of all proposed memoranda, complete or not, in its annual report. The audit report recommended the introduction of a consulting fee as a means to force action agencies to improve their capacity to make decisions about the environmental significance of proposals. However, the committee believes it is important that open communication channels exist and advice and support be freely available throughout the process as decisions made by other agencies may have significant environmental implications. The committee proposes to continue to consult with CEPA and to monitor the performance of the agencies that need to participate in the implementation of the audit findings to ensure that the opportunities for reform created by the audit are not wasted. Whilst the EIA process has some shortcomings and unnecessary complexities and loopholes, it is a valuable tool in the tion of the environment. The recent mushroom growth of mobile phone towers is a cause of dismay to many not only because of the visual ugJiness and inappropriateness of many of the locations but also principally because of the lack of consultation or forewarning. The builders of these eyesores, which are the three carriers-Optus, Telecom and Vodaphone-are all but exempt from environmental impact considerations and can continue to build towers anywhere they like. The normal application of environmental impact assessment procedures would have forced these operators to consider alternatives such as the co-location of facilities and would have required public consultation. I thank members of the committee secretariat for their work on this report, particularly Gabrielle Jess, who did much of the initial research, and Ian Dundas, the committee secretary, who oversaw the preparation; I commend the report to the House.",30
117,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This is the third in a recent series of reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee the on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts into audit reports on a number of Commonwealth programs. This report is the least controversial of them all. While there is some criticism of the way in which some programs have been operated, generally there is agreement that the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is trying hard andÂ· is serious about implementing its responsibilities. However, there is some question about whether other departments and sectors of government adequately recognise their obligations in this area and have responded appropriately to the legislation. I join the chairman of the committee in thanking the committee staff for the assistance which they have provided in preparing this report and in the other work of the committee. I also compliment the chairman on the very effective way in which he chairs the committee's deliberations and generally brings us to a unanimous finding in our reports. That has certainly been the case in this instance. The Environment Protection (Impact Of Proposals) Act was passed by the parliament protecin 1974. Under this act, Commonwealth projects likely to affect the environment are subject to examination on their potential environmental impact. The review is not merely to be associated with proposed capital works or projects of that nature; it can also deal with proposals, negotiations and agreements, including agreements with the various states and territories, decisions and recommendations that are made by various government agencies or other proposals involving the incurring of expenditure. Clearly, the act is intended to be very broad based. Ministers actioning proposals are required to initiate the processes of the act. That has clearly not always occurred in the past. The Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is responsible for administering the various aspects of this act. It has sought to guarantee these processes through the establishment of a number of formal memoranda of understanding. There have been negotiations with various agencies as to the way in which environmental impact assessments will occur whenever proposals are initiated. Even at this stage-20 years after the implementation of the act-only 22 of these memoranda are in existence. Some of them are with agencies that have subsequently ceased to exist. I refer briefly to page 10 of the report. It states: The Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation commented on the delays in negotiating MOUs in 1979 and 1985. On the secpnd occasion, . the committee reported that it was 'appalled' that only two MOUs had been agreed in the six years since the 1979 report, bringing the total to eight. Some progress has been made in negotiating MOUs since 1985, but it appears that departments and agencies are still reluctant to finalise negotiations, despite the potential to clarify administrative complexities and streamline the EIA processes. The progress in this area has, to say the least, certainly been slow. Questions need to be asked as to what level of commitment there is in many government departments and agencies towards the environmental impact assessment process. It has to be regarded as a pretty half-hearted response that in 20 years so few agencies seem to have put in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure that their proposals and projects do not have adverse environmental impacts. CEPA is clearly taking its responsibilities seriously. It is to be commended for the initiatives that it is taking to seek to strengthen the procedures and to ensure that they cover a wider range of activities. The audit report makes 19 recommendations, 17 of which have been agreed to by CEPA and one with qualified agreement. The qualified agreement is in a matter dealing with fees. In this area, ironically the committee came to the conclusion that it disagreed with the Auditor-General's recommendation. It suggested that fees should not be charged by CEPA. Clearly, if there is some reluctance for agencies to be involved in .this process, they will be more reluctant if theyÂ· have to pay fees for the process. (Extension of time granted) I conclude by saying that, if there is to be a fee schedule, government agencies and departments will clearly be less likely to seek the advice and assistance of CEPA than if the advice is handed out freely and on request. There needs to be a general encouragement of government agencies and departments to ensure that they fulfil their responsibilities under this process. CEPA needs to be given support in its endeavours to ensure that its responsibilities under the act are fulfilled. Motion (by Mr Langmore) proposed: That the House take note of the report.",32
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Rocher)In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. SHIPPING: SINGLE VOYAGE NA",33
119,Mr HOLLIS,PERMITS,I move: That this House expresses its concern at the increased number of single voyage permits being issued to foreign vessels on the Australian coast run.,33
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERMITS,Mr Rocher)Is the motion seconded? Ms Henzell-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,33
121,Mr HOLLIS,PERMITS,"In an address to the committee in Melbourne on 10 April 1994, my friend and colleague the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) said: The increasing use of single voyage permits has provided flexibility and new opportunities for shippers-opportunities that will see more than 400 cargo permits issued this financial year. This represents a lO-fold increase since 1989. I rest my case. My colleague the minister seems to think somehow that this increase in issue of single voyage permits is good news. It might be good news for thoseÂ· who are in the quick quid market, but it is not good news for Australian shipping, for Australians in general or indeed for Australia. Single voyage permits are supposed to be issued when there is no Australian ship able to do the work; that is, no Australian ship standing by waiting to do the work. It is in that case that a single voyage permit is issued. Before the department issues the permit, it is supposed to contact the unions and satisfy itself that those ships meet all Australian standards. The issue of single voyage permits is now nothing more than a farce. The department has been lax and has not ensured that those vessels meet even the minimum Australian standards. For the clever country we are unbelievably slow learners. It is only good luck, not good management, that one of those ageing rust buckets trundling its way through the Great Barrier Reef has not gone down. When it does, as inevitably it will, when our premier tourist attraction is awash with sticky oil or the sea is polluted with one of the cocktails of chemicals that ships are increasingly carrying, it will be too late to then say that these ships should never have been permitted to ply their wares along the coast of Australia. What is happening off Cape Town in South Africa as I now speak could be repeated off the Great Barrier Reef any day. Mr Langmore-That's right.",33
122,Mr HOLLIS,PERMITS,"That is indeed right. I have told honourable members before in this chamber about my inspection of the APJ Anand. Last year this ship was issued with a single voyage permit to carry barley from Albany in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland. On arrival in Gladstone it was found to have 148 major defects. I happened to be in Brisbane at that time and I was contacted by the unions to go and inspect that ship. I went to Gladstone to inspect it and although I was not permitted to board the ship I had discussions there with some of the crew and others about it. If this ship had met all the requirements for Australian coastal shipping, if it had even been inspected, if those the department had got off their butts for once in their life and inspected this ship as they were supposed to have done, how come it had 148 major defects? This ship was to go from Gladstone to Mackay to pick up a cargo of sugar for some Asian port. There is no doubt that these ships being issued with single voyage permits in the main do not comply with Australian standards. Despite the Australian Maritime Safety Authority'S extra vigilance since the Ships of shame report, too many of these ships are not being inspected and are not meeting minimum Australian standards. The maritime unions are supposed to be contacted before these single voyage permits are issued, but they have not been contacted. As late as this morning when I contacted the Maritime Union, there had been absolutely no attempt to contact it before any single voyage permit had been issued. I would like to know why this Commonwealth department is not carrying out its requirements under legislation. Single voyage permits are nothing more than an attempt to weaken cabotage in this country. In most of the world cabotage is closely protected, but the issue of single voyage permits is a way around this. It is the way those opposite would go as they would open our coast to the dangerous rust buckets of the world. It is because of the threat of cabotage and the dangers to our marine environment that I strongly oppose the issue of single voyage permits. The issue of single voyage permits should only be sanctioned in extreme cases, not as now, by the minister's own admission, where the issue is a mere formality. Continuing with the issuing of single voyage permits and allowing the foreign rust buckets to carry our cargo around the ports of Australia will make it even more easy to sell off the Australian National Line, which is something some, even on my side of politics unfortunately, would condone. To sell ANL would be extreme economic folly. The world's shipping fleet is ageing. Even if we commence replacement building today, within 10 years there will be a shortage of ships and, perhaps even more serious, there in will be a shortage of trained personnel to crew these ships. But what is a clever country's response to this challenge? By issuing single voyage permits we are increasingly allowing foreign flag vessels to carry cargo around Australia, thus denying those opportunities and revenue to our own line. In an undignified scramble we are touting what should be the pride of every Australian, ANL, to bidders both locally and internationally. Instead of selling off our heritage and our asset, we should be looking at the injection of funds to ANL and be looking to building our own ships. If Denmark, with a wage structure higher than that of Australia, can build ships for the world, why can we not with the'use of modern technology buil- our own replacement ships? Of course, we could do that. The only thing lacking is the will. As an island continent, few nations are as dependent on shipping as Australia, yet to our shame we carry less than five per cent of our cargo in Australhim Ian flagged and crewed ships. Once we sell off ANL, other shippers such as BHP would flag out. We could see the situation of a BHP ship registered in Malta, officered by Filipinos and with ratings from Burma. For us to retain credibility in the international forums dealing with shipping, such as IMO, it is essential that we maintain our own flagged and crewed ships. The opposition in this place makes a lot of the Australian flag. We come in here today and find that members of the opposition have gone back to the childish prank of having the Australian flag on their desks. If they are so keen to have Australian flags on their desks, why are they so ashamed to see Australian flags on Australian ships? Why do we not hear them then? They come in here and put these flags, perhaps made in Taiwan, on their desks, but when people like me and the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) stand up here and argue for Australian flagged shipping, what do we hear? Why do those opposite not want to see the Australian flag on Australian ships? They talk about national pride. How could we have more pride than to have our own flag on our own ships? So get your flags off your desks, you fools, and support the idea of having the Australian flag on Australian ships. The dramatic increase in the numbers of single voyage permits issued over the last few years is, I would suggest, no cause for celebration. The rules in existence concerning the issue of these permits must be enforced. Let us hope that in a few years there is a decline in the numbers of single voyage permits issued and that this cargo is being carried where it rightly belongs: in Australian flagged and crewed ships. Then the minister, I hope, will be as gleeful as he was at that meeting in Melbourne in April of this year.",34
123,Mr HAWKER,PERMITS,"Wannon) (2.29 p.m.)That was quite a performance. I am utterly confused as to what the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) was really trying to tell us. I agree with him when he said that single voyage permits are available only when there is no Australian ship to do the job. I agree with him on that. But then we heard attacking the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Is this the sign of a major split in the government? Are we finally seeing the Left and the Right about to come to blows over the single voyage permit policy? The honourable member was not happy with just attacking his minister. He then went on to attack the government departinent. He said that it was not administering the policy that the minister has announced and has been supported by the government for some years now. So he found that the administration is no good. Maybe he ought to go into the caucus room when ministers meet tomorrow and give them a good lecture. Some of them might be quite interested in what he has to say. Then we had highly emotional talk about what might happen to the Great Barrier Reef. Like all honourable members, I would do anything reasonable and possible to stop pollution on the Great Barrier Reef. It has not happened. The honourable member then cited the example of a grain ship having major defects as though this is proof that an oil tanker is suddenly going to go around to the Great Barrier Reef and do the unthinkable. We then heard some highly emotional and quite fantastic examples of what mayor may not happen if a rust bucket were to go down. But, as the honourable member knows only too well, Australia is well noted in world shipping circles for enforcing considerably higher standards than some other countries do. When he makes comments such as 'No doubt, the majority of ships do not comply with Australian standards', we have to question what he is saying about most ships that come into Australian ports. He knows only too weB that not only are they well run; they are also well maintained and well serviced. He can always provide some exceptions, but he knows full well that Australia does insist on much higher standards. To suggestÂ· that the removal of cabotage creates an 'open run for rust buckets', as he puts it, is just utter rubbish. If he wants to make a decent case, he ought to have much sounder facts to back up his argument. I was even more confused when he started talking about the Australian National Line. He attacked the government because it was supposedly going to sell the ANL and then he said that it should not be sold. I ask the honourable member: what is going on? Is he not a member of the government? He has attacked it on the single voyage permits; he has accused it of not enforcing the law as it has been passed through this parliament; he attacked his minister; and then he attacked the Australian Labor Party on its proposal to sell the Australian National Line.Â· I wonder why he remains a member of the party. Has he ever thought of exercising his rights and showing people that he is fair dinkum about it and resigning from the Labor Party? He gave an extraordinary performance. He attacked the government and then he did the usual thing that is done in the Labor Party: he turned around and blamed the opposition for it all. It is just marvellous. How long has the Labor Party been in government? The honourable member said that it is the opposition's fault. Then, just to make sure that we did not get diverted too much, he started to talk about the Australian flags on the desks of opposition members. He ought to be very proud of the Australian flag, as are most Australians. If he were to look at the polls, he would see that the majority of Australians happen to be rather proud of the Australian flag. So, if I were him, I would not spendÂ· too much time attacking the flag. I want to refer to the main point raised by the honourable member: single voyage permits. I said at the beginning of my speech that single voyage permits are available only if an Australian ship is not there to do the or if an Australian ship is not adequate to meet the needs of the port or ports that would be used. One other occasion when single voyage permits would be available is if the minister is satisfied that it is desirable and in the public interest that unlicensed ships be allowed to engage in that trade. Obviously, the minister is unlikely to do that, but there are occasions when he might, for example, if the owner or the agent of a ship were to offer to carry cargo freight free on behalf of a recognised amateur sporting group or a charity. The minister would then obviously have to be satisfied that it met this criterion. Another example is if some cargo handling equipment were being relocated from one stevedoring facility to another. It is true, as the honourable member has pointed out, that the number of single voyage permits has increased. In fact, it has risen from 72 in 1982-83 to 307 in 1992-93. That increase over that lO-year period has been under a Labor administration. There is clearly an indicated need, otherwise this would not have been occurring. In the few minutes available to me, I would like to turn to an area in which I think the honourable member ought to be directing some of his attention: the comparative costs of shipping in Australia. I would like to start with comparisons of some of the port charges. I have an index of comparative port costs, which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard.",35

130,Mr HAWKER,INDEX OF COMPARATIVE PORT COSTS,"I thank the House. We ought to be looking at some of the costs involved in shipping in Australia to see where Australia is lagging behind. If we look at this survey, if we take as a base rate the port of Melbourne as 100 per cent, we find that Sydney's costs are 79 per cent; Fremantle, 76 per cent; Adelaide, 56 per cent; and Brisbane, 50 per cent. But, if we compare the costs with those of a couple of ports in New Zealand, we find that Auckland's costs are only 35 per cent-about one-third of the cost of the port of Melbourne-and that Wellington's costs are 25 per cent. I suggest to the honourable member that he ought to be attacking his government and his minister about tackling some of these. We do not have to just look across the Tasman; we could also look at the costs in Europe. Hamburg is more expensive but Rotterdam is considerably cheaper than Melbourne, and Tilbury is cheaper than that. If we go to other ports in Europe, we find that Fos-Sur-Mer's port costs are 54 per cent of those of Melbourne; Zeebrugge, 44 per cent; Barcelona, 31 per cent; and Lisbon, 26 per cent. The honourable member ought to take this pretty seriously if he is concerned about making Australia more competitive when it comes to shipping. I also refer the honourable member to a report published by the Business Council of Australia just over a month ago, which makes some comparisons of other costs. It found that, for example, the manning costs for Australian dry bulk vessels were over 40 per cent greater than those of the lowest comparable country using a national crew, whichbefore the honourable member jumps inhappened to be a UK crew. As pointed out in this report, Australian crews incurred higher indirect manning costs-that includes leave provisions and on-costs, such as training and recru.iting-than coastal crews from any of the other selected overseas countries. It also pointed out another matter which the honourable member ought to be taking very seriously: the costs of fuel for Australia were the highest of the selected countries. Why? It is mainly because the high excise tax significantly inflates the purchase price of fuel. The honourable member ought to be looking at all those costs very seriously before he comes in with his emotional case about single voyage permits. If he is serious about trying to make the Australian National Line and other Australian shipping companies competitive with the rest of the world, then he ought to look at some of these costs, many of which are under the control of this government. I think that, far from being concerned about single voyage permits, he should direct himself to these other issues, which are considerably more significant in terms of making the cost of exporting out of this country more expensive than it need otherwise be and, hence, not only increasing the cost of our exports, but also getting a decent figure for our balance of payments just that much harder.",38
131,Ms HENZELL,INDEX OF COMPARATIVE PORT COSTS,"Capricornia) (2.39 p.m.)The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) tried hard, but he had not put a lot of effort into his speech. He might be aware that we have just reduced excise costs on fuel. However, port charges are a state responsibility, so he - i11 need to speak to some of his state colleagues about them. The other point that needs attention drawn to it is the good level of shipping safety that he was talking about. I refer him to the Ships of shame report, which states: The international economic climate in combination with an excess of tonnage has created a situation where current freight rates are placing considerable pressure on ship operating costs and are insufficient to justify the maintenance of existing ships let alone the building of new ones. It later states: The Committee has received evidence that the IMO convention standards are sufficient, the problem is non compliance with those standards. The failure of some nag states to comply with international conventions is the major impediment to improving ship safety. The report also states something that is very relevant to single voyage permits: It became apparent that the crews of many bulk carriers are inexperienced and lack any formal training. The increasing use of crew members from non traditional maritime nations on very low wages was put forward as a major reason for the decline in crewing standards ... The Committee received evidence that on many occasions crews were underpaid and underfed with working and living conditions not meeting the minimums set down in ILO Convention 147. The report further states: The Committee has received evidence that sizes approved by some flag states may have reduced to the level where the crew would not able to adequately cope with a disaster situation. This reduction in the size of crews in combination with the lack of experience and training of crews poses a most serious threat to ship safety. This isa very important issue. I notice that the honourable member for Wannon has left because of his rather under-resourced speech. The honourable member is quite correct terms of the massive increase in single voyage permits. Whilst we are being constructively critical-I thought he was being an apologist for government policy; a most interesting tum-up of events-the important issue if we allow a massive increase in single voyage permits without effective monitoring, we indeed will have a situation of disaster, outlined by the honourable member for flag, Throsby (Mr Hollis). It will be too late when the Barrier Reef, which is right off the coast of my electorate, is awash with oil. Unfortuand nately, we need to be pro-active rather than reactive in these matters. The other issue that the honourable member for Wannon raised was manning costs. It true that on some comparative statistics we have higher levels, but we also have one of the best trained and skilled maritime industrial personnel groups. That has been a tribute this government's reform of the shipping industry. I acknowledge the role of the honabolished. ourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), a former minister for transport. The report of the Bureau of Industry ECQnomies on coastal shipping, International performance indicators, states that the average crew level of the Australian fleet was reduced from 28 to less than 21 and is now below the average of DECO vessels visiting Australia. So, with the commitment of the maritime unions, we have made a major restructuring and, at the same time, an increase in training. I believe that it is most important, given this improved record over the ll-year life of this government, that we now consolidate our position and not sell off ANL. It is absolutely vital that we maintain our own shipping industry, jobs and commitment, and not cede sovereignty to other nations. This is a crucial crew industry for this country. It provides $7 been billion worth of shipping in imports and be exports. We need to maintain the value of this industry in the country. Any minor savings that may be made would be fully offset by many our balance of trade in terms of shipping costs. It is vital for the standard of crewing that we maintain an Australian presence in this industry. That is absolutely vital for the in protection of Australia 'scoastline, from an environmental point of view and also in terms of our own national sovereignty. So I pay tribute to the Maritime Union of Australia, which has taken this issue to the people of is that, this country. (Time expired)",38

135,Mr WAKELIN,INDEX OF COMPARATIVE PORT COSTS,"I always appreciate any assistance that is available, Mr Deputy Speaker. I tum to the matter of ships and permits. Let us see what is said in the legislation from this government, which has been in power for almost 11 years. I refer to a speech on waterfront reform that the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), gave to the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers at Clyde Cameron College, Wodonga, on 26 November 1992. I thank the shadow minister for his help in this matter. He makes these comments: Australia has a responsibility, not only to Australia and our own coast, but to play its part in keeping the world's seas safe. The needless loss of the lives of seafarers is truly deplorable, regardless of their nafionality. The unfortunate thing from Australia's point of view is that the unseaworthiness of many vessels is an international disgrace. We do not wear it. We are not in favour of it. We want to do something about it. He continues: They do not select the coastlines they sink alongside - and they are just as dangerous one kilometre out of Australia's waters as they were one kilometre inside The Navigation Actthis is where we come to the law of the land, which this government is supposed to administergives wide powers to Federal Government over all ships entering Australian waters and ports - the same powers that it exercises over Australian vessels. Section 189 of the Act states that ""All ships shall be liable to inspection and survey"" Note that this applies to all ships, not just Australian ships. The power of the Australian Authority under the Act is comprehensive: Section 190AA.(I) provides that ""A surveyor may at any reasonable time go on board a ship and inspect the ship and any part of the ship, including the hull, boilers, machinery and equipment of the ship, and may require the certificate of competency of the master or of any . officer of the ship, or any certificate or other document relating to the ship, to be produced to him."" The Navigation Act also defines what is unseaworthy and substandard in Sections 207 and 207 A. This is already in the act. The government could be administering it, if it chose to. What is the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) doing about it? The shadow minister further states: A vessel is only seaworthy if ""it is in a fit state as to condition of hull and equipment, boilers and machinery, stowage of ballast or cargo, number and qualifications of crew including officers, and in every other respect, to encounter the ordinary perils of the voyage then entered upon."" If the ship is under foreign certification, then it is unseaworthy if ""the condition of the ship or of its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of that certificate or any of those certificates."" It is substandard if it is, for the purposes of the Act, ""seaworthy, but conditions on board are clearly hazardous to safety or health."" The Act provides for the provisional detention, and then the detention (which can be indefinite, unless the faults are remedied) of a ship that is unseaworthy or substandard. The Act applies to vessels of all flags, not only to Australian vessels. The Authority under the Act is now the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. So there we have it. If this government wants to do something about it, it should get off its backside and administer the act that it has in front of it.",39
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDEX OF COMPARATIVE PORT COSTS,Mr Nehl)Order! The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. COMMONWEALTH-STATE REVENUE NA,40
137,Mr FILING,SHARING,"I move: That this House: - 1) notes that: (a) the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have argued that much of the micro-economic reform is the responsibility of the States; (b) in order for the States to carry out that reform they must get a far greater share of revenue from the economic recovery; (c) the 1994-95 Commonwealth Budget fails to deliver a fair share of revenue to the States in that the forward estimate of the Budget indicates that the Commonwealth revenue is expected to grow by 34.4 per cent in the period 1993-94 to 1997-98 however the total grant to the States is expected to grow by only 8.4 per cent over the same period; (d) Table 2.4 of Budget Paper No. I indicates that the States and the local sector are producing the goods in terms of fiscal reform in that their net public sector bor- ing. rowing requirements (PSBR) are expected to be in surplus in 1994-95 while the Commonwealth is expected to achieve a large and unsustainable net PSBR of 3.6 cent of ODP; and (2) in view of this situation, supports the call by the Western Australian Premier, Mr Richard Court, for a fair share of revenue and for Commonwealth to bear its share in the necessary process of fiscal consolidation. It is interesting to come in here this afternoon and have a foretaste of the punch cUp that is going to occur later this year at the federal conference of the Australian Labor Party over policy and, in particular, the government's lack of real commitment to micro-economic reform. It will probably be a tame affair compared to the punch-up currently going on between the Bankstown Bonaparte and his working class mate, Bob Hawke. Mr Chynoweth-What has that got to do with it?",40
138,Mr FILING,SHARING,"It has plenty to do with it. It indicates clearly why the government is moribund. It cannot develop policy that accommodates all the squabbling factions within its party. In proposing this motion, I ask a simple question of the government: who is more fiscally responsible and better able to spend the hard earned money of Australian taxpayers and manage government services-the states or Canberra? I have always been of the view that the trend to the centralisation of power in Canberra is anathema to the ideal of giving Australians better and more efficient government services. If we look closely at the government's 1994-95 budget papers, the Working Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and historic trends, we immediately see a worrying trend emerging in this country. It is a trend that sees the Commonwealth government hell-bent on strangling the states' ability to fund services at the grassroots level and thereby vesting more control over expenditure in Canberra. It is obvious that the government and is determined to hitch a piggyback ride on the long suffering states with regard to fiscal responsibility while becoming ever more burdensome itself through its orgy of spendThe Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr per Willis), as well as their predecessors, have often stated that micro-economic reform is primarily the responsibility of the states. Why will the Prime Minister not let the states get the on with it? The problem with micro-economic reform for the Labor Party is that it is sandbagged by an ideology which inevitably ends up in increased spending when factional infighting causes the government to attempt to placate as many minorities and factional subgroupings as possible. I had to smile a little when I read the comments of the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns). He talked about the way minority groups have been accommodated by the federal government in recent years. We need to consider how easily the government backs down to minority groups when it is put under pressure. When we look at the budget forward estimates, two things become clear. The Keating government has committed itself to a huge spending increase which will result in an effective deficit of $17 billion in 1994-95 after allowance is made for major asset sales and provision for GBE superannuation. The second aspect that comes to light is that the government is substantially using the improving fiscal performance of the states to fund this spending spree. What message is the government sending to the people of this country? It appears to be quite clear.",41
139,Mr GEAR,SHARING,Richard Court wrote this.,41
140,Mr FILING,SHARING,"The Assistant Treasurer is at the table and is making absurd comments as usual. The government is saying that more spending is needed and we need not worry about the low level of domestic savings-the level of household savings is predicted to fall even further during 1994-95-or the rapidly rising level and cost of public debt. As we all know, it is a national scandal that the Commonwealth debt is forecast to rise by 15 per cent to $95 billion during the next finan. cial year. Interest payments on this debt alone will increase by 29 per cent. This message of big spending at any cost runs counter to the message that the states are rightly trying to give to their constituents. On the one hand, we have states pushing the doctrine of careful and responsible financial management; on the other we have a federal government throwing money around like confetti. What are the people of Australia to make out of this? The federal government should be leading the way in fiscal reform. Instead this government is abrogating any responsibility it has for fiscal leadership. To rub salt into the wounds, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are relying on states' revenue to fund the massively increasing levels of expenditure to which I have just referred. The states have largely done their part in turning Australia around economically. The budget papers forward estimates minus asset sales show likely surpluses in Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria. This is due mainly to the effects of increasing stamp duty and other fixed charges rising on the back of improving economies in these states. Not content to sponge off the added revenue generated by the states, the federal government has employed even more sinister ways of bringing the states to heel regarding fiscal policy. I refer to the government's continued campaign to force state governments to spend existing Commonwealth grants in areas targeted by the federal government. It has resulted in the level of untied grants to the states from Canberra decreasing and the level of tied or specific purpose grants increasing as a percentage of all grants. This is further evidence of the trend by Labor to neuter the states and vest further control in Canberra. For example, historically, in the decade before Labor came to government, tied grants made up just over 32 per cent of all grants. A decade after Labor was elected, tied grants now form 43 per cent of all grants. This quite clearly hits at the very centre of the relationship between the states and the federal government. This trend must be reversed through the sensible allocation of more control to the states where the funds are administered more closely to the community which they affect. I remind those opposite with short memories that the 1990 Special Premiers Conference stated its objective to return levels of tied grants to 1980s levels. The' Prime Minister has not only ignored this, but also embarked on a further course of emasculating the states. The average Australian may well have difficulty in distinguishing between tied and untied grants, but the fact remains that the federal government is increasingly using the twin levers of tied grants and reduced funding to squeeze those states that it sees as the enemy. By this, I mean the Liberal state governments that have taken on the task of righting the dreadful financial mess-ups of their predecessor Labor administrations, and they are succeeding spectacularly. It is interesting to note that in question time today the opposition raised the issue of the number of former failed premiers of Labor governments who have been given taxpayer funded jobs by the federal government. We even have a failed Labor premier from Western Australia now holding a very senior portfolio in the federal government. I must say that if the history of her government is any guide, then we are in for a woeful time in relation to health policy. As if the government is not satisfied with ripping control off the states and entrenching centralism in Canberra, it has embarked on a concerted campaign in recent years to hand over control to committees of the United Nations and to Geneva through the ILO. Mr Chynoweth-What rubbish!",41
141,Mr FILING,SHARING,"The honourable member might well scoff. He does not mind that the Prime Minister has handed over more power to foreign bodies than has ever occurred before in the history of this Commonwealth. The Prime Minister pretends to be a nationalist and patriot but he has been steadily handing over power to institutions such as the UN Human Rights Committee. What an absolute joke, what a parody it is that there are representatives on the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations whose human rights records in their own countries are absolutely abysmal, yet we have to kowtow to those people through the external treaty provisions of the constitution. This federal government has signed away so much of our sovereignty to overseas bodies. This country needs governments to get closer to the people, not further away; not in Geneva, not overseas, but here. It needs to get closer to the people that governments are supposed to serve. The states that have led the way in micro-economic reform in this country, states like the one I represent, Western Australia, have adopted a tight fiscal policy which will see them post a significant surplus for the year 1994-95 according to the forward estimates in Budget Paper No. 1. The situation now is that the people who actually generate the money through the states do not get to use it in anywhere near the proportion which would be considered as fair and likely to contribute to an efficient or effective economic recovery. This is all the more worrying when one considers that the states' funds are targeted at real community services such as health, education and law and order. The moneys generated by the states and leached off by the federal government are in many respects expended on intangibles with dubious and often straight out non-existent benefits for the taxpayers who provided the funds in the first place. This motion does not necessarily call for a bigger handout to the states from Canberra. It requires that the federal government allow the states greater control over the increasing that they generate. The big spending nature of the budget and the relative reduction in grants to the states, as outlined in the budget papers, show that the federal government is using the states' improving performances as a pool of capital to fund its own uncontrolled expenditure. During 1994-95, the Commonwealth's own purpose spending will reach 19.4 per cent of GDP-a record high. At the same time, grants to the states will crash to 5.3 per cent of GDP-a record low. What does this tell the people of Australia about the government's commitment to providing services and fiscal leadership? Not a jot.",42
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHARING,Is the motion seconded? Mrs Moylan-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,43
143,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,SHARING,"I rise to oppose the motion moved by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). The motion itself and his contribution are essentially based on faulty facts, faulty analysis and faulty logic. The first paragraph of the honourable member's formal motion refers to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) having argued that much of micro-economic reform is the responsibility of the states. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and this government, say that micro-economic reform is a responsibility of all governments in Australia-local, state and federal. The Commonwealth has been the leader in micro-economic reform in this country over the last 10 years. A good example of thatone the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, is closely aware of and invo\ved in-is the recent decision of the meeting of Commonwealth and state heads of government in respect of competition policy and the Hilmer report. Once again, with this micro-economic reform, the states were dragged to the table by the Commonwealth. We say there is a responsibility at all levels of government but we also say that the federal government has been the key mover of microeconomic reform in this country over the last funds decade. Paragraph (b) of the motion of the honourable member for Moore states: in order for the states to carry out that reform they must get a far greater share of revenue from the economic recovery; This assumes that micro-economic reform is linked to more revenue. That is not necessarily the case. For example, one of the key micro-economic reforms that the government is supporting under its access to justice plan is reform of the legal profession. We do not need a greater handout to any of the states to ensure that we have competition in and reform of the legal profession in the states. This notion that the states must somehow get a greater share of revenue to effect microeconomic reform is based on faulty logic and faulty analysis. In paragraph (d) of the motion, the honour The able member for Moore refers to Commonments wealth revenue. Let us look at some of the facts and analysis. In the 1994-95 Budget national Paper No. I, table No. 1 at page 1.8 refers Commonwealth budget outlays and revenue revenue as a percentage of GOP. Let us find out who the big spenders and the big taxers are. In the last periodÂ· of coalition government, outlays by the Commonwealth totalled 27.6 per cent of GOP in 1976-77 and, in the coalition's last provide year, 1982-83, they totalled 28.8 per cent. Commonwealth outlays totalled 25.2 per cent of GOP in 1990-91 and the projection for 1997-98 is 24.2 per cent. In terms of outlays, those opposite are the big spenders. Again the last years of coalition government, in 1981-82 Commonwealth revenues totalled 25.9 per cent of GOP and, in 1982-83, 26.1 per cent. In 1990-91 revenue was 25.7 per cent of GOP, projected to fall in 1997-98 to for Perth. 23.8 per cent. So we know who the big taxers and the big spenders are. It is the coalition. When we look at Commonwealth-state This financial arrangements it is always very helpful to look at Budget Paper No.3, period Commonwealth financial relations with other terms. levels of government, which details the precise nature of Commonwealth-state relations and finances. The 1993-94 Budget Paper No.3, at pages 20 and 21, gives a very good summary 1993-94. of the precise state of Commonwealth-state financial relations. At page 21 it says: The Commonwealth's macroeconomic responsibiliim-rove ties necessarily require a focus on the overall financial position of the total public sector. Changes in the level of Commonwealth payments to State/local sector are an important means by the Commo-wealth can seek to influence the stance of fiscal polIcy. The States' response to Commonwealth policies also very important in determining the overall economic impact of public sector activity. Hence, the stance of Commonwealth fiscal policy and, particular, the level of payments to other tiers government must reflect judgments as to the relevant capacity of each level of government accommodate the policy adjustments that may considered necessary. Charts 9 and 10 help illustrate this by comparing real annual growth Commonwealth and State total revenue with annual growth in State own-source revenue Commonwealth payments to the States. It goes on to say: significant restraint in Commonwealth payto the States exercised through the latter half of the 19808 . . . was aimed at ensuring that the burden of fiscal adjustment required. to bolster . savings was borne equitably by all tiers of to government, at a time when State own-source was growing strongly. Chart 10 shows that the 19808 strong real growth in State. own-source revenue. was an important offset to real reductions in Commonwealth payments to the States . . . the Commonwealth recognising the need to the States with greater stability in terms of the level of financial assistance in budgetary planning.",43
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHARING,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will resume in his seat. The chair would be obliged if the parliamentary secretary would observe standing order 57 and give the speaker with the call the courtesy of not standing between him and the chair. I call the honourable member,44
145,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,SHARING,"The Budget Paper continues: was reflected in the 1990 Premiers' Conferenceoutcome, where FAGS for the three-year 1991-92 to 1993-94 were guaranteed in real In addition to the base level of FAGS, the Commonwealth provided a one-off increase of $168.7m in 1992-93. The 1993 Premiers' Conference confirmed this 'real terms' guarantee for The 1994 Premiers Conference decided to t?at position a-d place i- - n .a per capIta baSIS. The key po tnt he-e-It IS tn the ""- charts that I have referred to-IS that all state the and local sector sources of funding over the which period 1961-62 to 1991-92 show a consistent trend line. State-own source revenue shows a consistent trend upwards. The mix is that is when we find an increase in state-own source revenue we find a comparable reduction in net in Commonwealth payments. But the key point of is that there is a consistent trend line over a 30-year period for all governments, with state to sources of funding on that consistent trend be line. The argument that is put about the to reduction of Commonwealth funds to the in states is precisely balanced by the increase in and net the states' own revenue sources. The 1994-95 Budget Paper No.3, at page 4, contains a very good summary of the decision made at the Premiers Conference in March 1994. The centrepiece of the agreement is the decision that financial assistance grants to the states be maintained in real per capita terms over the next three years-that is FAGS will be adjusted each year not only fdr inflation,as has been recent practice, but also for total population growth. The level of general purpose payments to the states will be significantly higher than they would have received over the three years to 1996-97 if real terms guarantee that applied from 199192 to 1993-94 had been extended. By 1996-97, on that formula, there is effectively a $450 million increase to the states. Some.of the states, including Western Australia, have argued that the mix of Commonwealth-state finances ought to be calculated on the basis of a guaranteed share of revenue. If that had been 1980s the states would have received about $2.3 billion less than they actually received under the previous and the current arrangements. That is because Commonwealth tax revenues are more volatile than state revemies. Had there been revenue sharing based on the 1990-91 proportions, the states would have received $2.3 billion less in financial assistance grantsÂ· from the Commonwealth over the 1991-92 to 1993-94 period than they actually received under the real terms guarantee that was in place. On that analysis, the proposition put forward by the honourable member for Moore is not reflected by the budget papers and is not reflected by the facts. But what is the honourforward able member for Moore trying to do here? He is trying to give political succour to the Premier of Western Australia. Often I hear the Premier of Western Australia saying that Western Australia is a great exporting state and that therefore it is entitled to a greater share of Commonwealth revenue. Who is responsible for the massive increase in exports coming from Western Australia? That point is made very succinctly by Peter Roberts in the Financial Review, in an article which appeared on Wednesday 22 June 1994 under the title 'WA gets the export smarts'. He says: When I lived in Perth more than 15 years ago, the idea that Western Australia could be anything more than an export of raw materials was laughable. ButÂ· since then the state has broadened its export base at the same time as boosting its international market share in core resources markets. One can see the trend line in the graph depicted .for elaborately transformed manufactures and manufactured exports in Western Australthe is over the 10or ll-year period 1983-84 to 1993-94. That increase is a direct result of the policies of this government, making Australia more internationally competitive and, as part of that, ensuring that as a matter of national fiscal policy we have a clear and close mix of Commonwealth and state outlays. The propositions put forward by the honourable member for Moore do not bear up to rigorous analysis and simply reflect his efforts to give political succour to the Premier of Western Australia. the case, over the (Time expired)",44
146,Mrs MOYLAN,SHARING,"If the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) were to go back and take a look at the early history of his state and compare the revenue and expenditure of the states and the Commonwealth over that period, I think he would seeÂ· a quite significant and alarming difference. This motion arose from the sheer hypocrisy of the federal government, which sees fit to preach the need for fiscal reform to state governments while clearly failing to reflect that advice in its own economic policy making. The fact is that the 1994-95 Commonwealth budget fails to deliver a fair share of revenue to the states, in that the estimate of the budget indicates that the Commonwealth revenue is expected to grow by 34.4 per cent in the period 1993-94 to 1997-98. However, the total grant to the states is expected to grow by only 8.4 per cent over the same period. In 1901 the colonies of Australia joined a federation. Our founding fathers wisely recognised the need for a national government to determine national. priorities, and none of us argue with that. At the same time, though, it was accepted that state governments were clearly better left to decide and manage the local issues and priorities of their people. The federal system was set up to serve in an efficient manner the interests of Australian citizens-and not for cheap political gain. The government hypocrisy has its genesis. in its clandestine plan to truly paint itself as big brother and to disperse its ever-increasing revenue base at the expense of the states. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), who was a government backbencher at the time, said: We have devoted the last 20 yearsand he was talking about his own governmentto a debate about individual and group rights and perhaps insufficient debate and intellectual effort has been devoted to some other primary objectives, that is securing our economic future. The power vested in the federal government by our founding fathers is being abused to the detriment of all Australians, and never more so than over the past 11 years. To illustrate the trend towards centralisation, particularly of financial power, the following figures are graphic. In 1901-02, when the federation first began, the share of revenue to the Commonwealth amounted to 58 per cent. In the corresponding period, the share to the states was 42 per cent. By contrast, the 1993-94 share of revenue to the Commonwealth was 75 per cent and the share to the states was 25 per cent. What is more relevant and alarming is the share of expenditure figures, with the Commonwealth collecting revenue far in excess of its expenditure needs. Only a part of the surplus is returned to the states. When the state expenditure exceeds its revenue, the problem of vertical fiscal imbalance arises. This was recognised as a significant problem by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the state premiers in 1990 when they called a special conference to discuss these problems. This move to redress the problem was scrapped by the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is a problem also recognised as significant by an eminent Australian economist, Emeritus Professor Russell Mathews. In May he lectured on federal financial relations at the Australian National University and called for an end to the Commonwealth's virtual tax monopoly. Some 40 per cent of Australians live more than 1,000 kilometres from Canberra; 20 per cent live more than 2,000 kilometres from Canberra; and 10 per cent live more than 3,000 kilometres from Canberra. That decision making should be kept close to the people is well illustrated by the frustrationsÂ· of people in our territories. To realise that total government from Canberra is a complete failure, one has only to go to a place like Christmas Island and look at the living standards that both the residents and the tourists have to put up with. There are disgraceful, unsealed, potholed roads and there is inattention to ... environmental management and funding that would never be tolerated on the mainland, including raw sewage being pumped into the harbour, phosphate dust being pumped unchecked from chimney stacks, old decrepit asbestos roof tiles and, even worse, a hurdygurdy response to the concerns of those citizens with the government rarely addressing the local issues. The federal government should be called to task by the Australian people for playing P9litics with the management of our economy and for the steady and wilful destruction of a very successful system of federation. The people of Australia should demand a return to a system which delivers decision making by their own state representatives instead of Canberra based politicians. (TIme expired)",45
147,Mr CHYNOWETH,SHARING,"How serious is the opposition? The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) does not even stay in the House to hear the arguments put forward by members debating his motion. Those opposite are obviously very serious about this! This motion is simply just more bleating from the Tory states which want more handouts all the time. This motion refers to growth in Commonwealth revenue of 34.4 per cent and growth in grants to the states of 8.4 per cent. However, revenueÂ· and grants are not the same thing. All states, including Western Australia, have their own taxation revenue. One has only to look at Victoria. Kennett has increased the annual taxation revenue by over $952 million since coming to office less than two years ago. ",46
148,Mr CHYNOWETH,SHARING,"Over $952 million. There have been 4,345 individual increases in taxes in Victoria. Western Australia has its own growth taxes, such as payroll tax and stamp duty. Page 13 of Commonwealth Budget Paper No.3 reads: The Western Australian economy has grown by more than the national average throughout the recovery period and this growth is expected to provide a cyclical improvement to Western Australia's revenue and budgetary position. Page 55 of the Bureau of Industry Economics Occasional Paper No. 19 reads: Western Australia was the fastest growing state between 1981-82 to 1991-92. Real GDP growth in Western Australia was 53 per cent and in Australia it was 26 per cent. GDP-capita growth was 23 per cent in Western Australia and 10 per cent in Australia. The honourable member for Moore has the gall to get behind Western Australia's Premier Court asking for more handouts. What a disgrace! The real reason for this motion is that the Tory states know themselves that they cannot manage their own financial affairs. Page 62 of the Bureau of Industry Economics Occasional Paper No. 19 reads: Western Australia led Queensland in the race growth but does not appear to have performed so well in financial management. It is trying to say in a nice way that Western Australia just cannot manage its own financial affairs. Another Tory state that is not being properly managed is Victoria. Jeffrey Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, is shifting the costs of state obligations for Workcover to the Commonwealth government. He is putting Medicare funding in Victoria at risk by allowing queue jumping in public hospitals. He is also misusing using taxpayers' money for party political purposes. Mr Kennett has political advertising in Victoria. He even has full-page as in our local papers, such as the Frankston Standard, which is a good paper. They are upside down, which is the sort of thing he would do. It is costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to put in his as which are attacking the Commonwealth's industrial relations legislation. This is not Victorian government advertising; it is party political advertising. The Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters deemed the advertisements as political advertising under the Broadcasting Services Act. The Kennett government, despite its public postulating, accepts the advertisements as being political because they put the additional political tag on the advertisement. The advertisements do not say that they are authorised by the Liberal Party; they say the Victorian Parliament House. They do not give any state government offices either. So it is definitely a political ad that is going on the air and is being put in our papers. Jeffrey Kennett, in his usual bullyboy manner, has ignored the independent umpire's ruling that it is a political ad. I was sufficiently angered and concerned by this disgrace to write to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) seeking his opinion on whether using taxpayers' money for the political advertising of the Kennett government breaches legislation. I believe that it does. It is my money, the money of those opposite and the money of all the people in the gallery which is being used. We are all paying our taxes. Jeffrey Kennett is getting grants from the federal government and then spending that for money on paid political advertisements. For whom? For himself, and no-one else. I am expecting a reply from the Attorney-General soon. I trust that we will take the Kennett government to court and, for the taxpayers of Australia, get that money back.",47

150,Mr MARTYN EVANS,COMPETITION POLICY,"On behalf of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), I move: That this House: (1) endorses the communique of the Council of Australian Governments. (COAG) on 25 February 1994 for a national agenda for microetonomic reform and competition policy; (2) confirms its support for the principles of national competition policy set out in the Hilmer Report dated August 1993 and specifically its recommendations for: (a) strengthening the provisions of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act as they apply to , both the public and private sectors; (b) closing exemptions from the general conduct rules of the TradeÂ· Practices Act for federal and State government business enterprises and primary commodity marketing bodies; (c) structural reform of public monopolies and the principle of competitive neutrality between government and private businesses; and (d) the extension of competition through the professions, especially doctors and lawyers; and (3) urges that the implementation of the COAG communique gives attention to rationalising: (a) federal/State financial relations given the proposed changes to pricing regimes for State government business enterprises; and (b) the large hidden subsidies available to high income earners from State pricing policies for public utilities and the impact of this reform on the national welfare system. Since coming to office in the early 1980s, this government has made considerable advances in transforming a protected and unresponsive economy into one that is now competitive, flexible and outward looking. Macroeconomic policies have given us an economy that is very much a part of the Asian region. We have a GNP about the same as that of the six ASEAN nations combined, and we are one of the few industrialised economies to have a trade surplus with not just Japan but the whole of Asia. This is not due solely, as one might expect it to be, to our traditional exports of agricultural and mining products. In fact, we are now the 10th largest supplier of manufactured goods to Japan-ahead of Canada, Hong Kong and each of the ASEAN countries. Australia is able to compete on an inh-rnaÂ­ tional basis in the manufacturing sector. Exports as a proportion of GDP have grown by about 50 per cent in the past 10 years and stood at 20 per cent of GDP in 1992-93. Australia has also seen exciting growth in the area of elaborately transformed manufactures, with exports in this category almost trebling over the last seven years. Australia has been able to achieve this rapid growth in ETMs by specialising in not only expanding industries, such as pharmaceuticals, medical and scientific equipment and computer hardware, but also certain industries previously thought to be in decline, such as shipbuilding and motor vehicles. We also have an excellent industrial relations environment - nd the lowest total tax collections as a percentage of GDP of any OECD nation. Given this enviable macro-economic record, where are we to tum our attention to next? Clearly, the answer to that question has to be the area of micro-economic reform and competition policy. Competition policy is an essential element of our future national economic development. We cannot ignore the international nature of our economy, given the GATT round and the increasing international demands for fair and open competition and the removal of hidden subsidies and other barriers to trade. Future benefits in this area will rely on cooperative arrangements between the states and the Commonwealth. That has to be true, given our constitutional framework. The Council of Australian Governments agreed in 1992 to the establishment of an inquiry to lay the groundwork for a national competition strategy. In October of that year the Prime Minister established the Hilmer review, based on criteria agreed by the heads of government. The report of the review to COAG in August 1993 represents one of the most significant developments in this field since the enactment of the trade practices legislation in the 1970s. The trade practices area has come out well from that review and, indeed, the review has identified the benefits which have flowed from trade practices reform in the general business community. However, a lot of work now needs to be done in the area of government business enterprises. Commonwealth government business enterprises have been subject to Trade Practices Act review since 1977, but that is not the case with respect to state government instrumentalities and state government business enterprises. Indeed, one of the prominent ways in which enterprises can avoid the rigorous impact of trade protection policy and the implementation of free and open competition policy is through the exemptions provided by the state governments and the shield of the Crown which the state governments enjoy. A truly effective and national competition policy requires that all service providers in both public and private ownership compete on the same terms. Competition and the distribution of infrastructure in the form of electricity, water, railways; aviation and increasingly telecommunications and other high technology services are vital if we are to reduce costs and improve service in the longer term. Already in the last few years we have seen benefits flow from deregulation of domestic aviation in 1990. This has resulted in declining air fares on nearly all routes, saving approximately $100 million a year for consumers of those services. We have also seen the introduction of competition into the telecommunications area, with STD peak rates on the Melbourne-Sydney route falling by 21 per cent between June 1992, when Optus first entered the market, and May 1993. While the Commonwealth and states have agreed in principle to the Hilmer reforms, the hard part of that process is yet to begin. The states will find themselves with an internal conflict of interest in that their immediate financial incentive will be to sell some of their business units for as high a price as they can get when Hilmer will reduce the effective value of some of these assets by exposing them to competition. It is essential that we overcome this internal reticence on the part of the states and ensure that those enterprises, where possible, be exposed to the full effects and benefits of competitive processes. It does not necessarily follow from those Hilmer processes, though, that those enterprises need necessarily reduce in value. Some of the examples we have seen in the area of electricity are very instructive in this case. It is quite possible that, through reductions in cost structures and improvements in productivity which will flow from the benefits of that competitive policy, we will see the value of those enterprises enhanced and increasing revenue flowing to the states from them. Therefore, it should not be immediately supposed that an open competition regime, which Hilmer proposes, wi\l necessarily adversely impact on state budgets. It is very much a question of how this is approached and how the states go about unbundling some of those enterprises to ensure that, where necessary, the network and generating facilities are retained in the hands of the state business enterprise while perhaps enabling some of the distribution mechanisms to be open to franchise agreements and further competition. In the telecommunications industry, which is very much a growing and evolving industry, I think we have already seen some of the ways in which this process can occur. Austel, for example, has been established to separate regulation from the delivery of service by Telecom. Telecom, of course, has previously had an important regulatory role which has now been overtaken by an independent regulator, Austel, and of course Telecom has now been left to deliver the service rather than regulate its provision. As Telecom is the provider of the national telecommunications infrastructure, it is essential that that infrastructure be made available to any other operator. Currently it is restricted to Optus but eventually, of course, it will be open on a much wider basis. We have already seen substantial benefits flow from allowing other parties to access the nationally owned infrastructure but on terms which are regulated by the independent regulatory authority-Austel in this case. Other people are able to gain access to Telecom's networks at what amount to wholesale rates and then compete in the delivery of those services in a very effective manner. We certainly should not permit the duplication of very expensive infrastructure, such as the telecommunications network, when in fact we can gain the benefits of competition by simply determining access policies to those broader networks at reasonable prices and then ensuring appropriate franchise agreements to provide for the community service obligations which those existing government enterprises provide. Indeed, in the telecommunications industry we have seen the way in which Optus has been required to provide a levy to ensure that the community service obligations of Telecom are fairly funded across the board by all those who are part of the process. The importance of the social justice criteria which for many decades in this country have been underlying government enterprise in this area cannot be neglected in any element of competition policy. It is also quite critical that we turn our attention to other areas of competition and, indeed, to some classic cases of market failure. In that regard I would look no further than the health industry and the legal industry. We have seen doctors ana lawyers enjoy some very restrictive practices which have not been exposed to the benefits of competition and have resulted in what amounts to a classic failure of marketplace economics. Where anticompetitive arrangements exist within a profession and are not authorised in the public interest-which should be the sole criterion in this context-it is essential that that profession be required to be exposed to competition. It is very easy to suspect that, because certain professions are operating in the private sector, they are automatically competing on an open and fair basis, but that is not necessarily the case, as we have already seen with the legal profession and the restrictions which are imposed on that. The Hilmer report is about a set of proposals for reforming and expanding competition policy in Australia. The next step in that process is very much a cooperative federalist one. It will be a great test of those relationships but one which I am sure, if Australian Commonwealth and state governments are able to meet the challenge, will ultimately benefit all Australians.  my right to speak.",48
151,Mr FORREST,COMPETITION POLICY,"I welcome the motion moved by the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans). The opposition endorses the need for a coordinated national agenda on micro-economic reform, for which this motion seeks support. The coalition has welcomed Hilmer's report, although it has expressed some strong reservations. The general benefits of Hilmer's suggested refonns can be significant, especially when coupled with those recommendations to refonn'the professions in the private sector, as the member's motion highlights. However, I would like to express a number of major reservations. If there is a major push on regulatory refonn and full-scale nationwide competition, it must not come at the expense of the delivery of vital services and facilities, particularly to rural areas, such as the one which I represent. The Hilmer recommendations have not been embraced by rural areas as enthusiastically as they have today by the honourable member for Bonython. The general reaction to Hilmer in rural regions is the recognition that something has to be shut or closed-be it a post office, a bank or the abolition of a statutory marketing authority. Over the last decade rural areas have been asked to bear the brunt of considerable refonn. Trade barriers have been lowered - nd almost abolished in some areas, exposing fragile industries to the international market. The user-pays ideology dominates. Whilst the many government refonns in air and transport-which the honourable member brought to our attention-and in telecommunications have had immediate advantages for predominantly urban dwellers, rural people are still waiting for the benefits. They have suffered a substantial erosion of services, particularly in the areas of post, telecommunications and banking. There have been wide scale social implications with enforced economic rationalisation in government service providers. The Hilmer review can be criticised on the ground that it fails to take these social implications fully into account. This worries me. Leaving the market as the mechanism to resolve community .concerns will place my rural constituents further out on a limb in the absence of critical population mass. Reliance on outcome certainties in rural areas would be better than market-driven approaches. The honourable member mentioned the community service obligations of government business enterprises. Under Hilmer, there is no doubt that these will be exposed to diminution. Unless the community service obligations of government sta-utory utiliti-s are rei-force.d prior to any ImplementatIOn of Hilmer s recommendations, rural people will suffer. Government needs to decide whether it wants people to live in rural Australia or whether it is intent on making it too expensive. Australians living and working in rural and isolated areas are entitled to be provided with telephone and postal services of the same quality and standard, embracing new technological advances, as those available to people living in urban areas. Were telephone services to be deregulated as envisaged by Hilmer, no single carrier could be identified as responsible for universal service obligations. An example of what can happen is what is already happening in the delivery of mobile telephone services, particularly in my electorate. The Mallee electorate covers roughly a quarter of the state of Victoria, yet only 15 per cent of that area is currently serviced by mobile telephones. If we are going to encourage new enterprises to go out there, we need to provide them with the technological advances which will allow them to compete in an international environment. When I complain about this situation, a typical response contained in one of the many letters I receive from Telecom is: We currently offt<r coverage to 84% of the population of Australia, but with an area coverage of 4.5% of the land area. To cover the balance of the population with a terrestrial1y-based radio network is quite impractical. That is a classic example of what can happen in the case of a completely deregulated, market-driven approach. I have similar concerns about Australia Post. Erosion of delivery is already occurring. There are locations in my electorate where delivery of mail has been reduced from three days per week to one day per week. It might interest you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to note that the entire municipality of the shire of Wimmera-a significant shire in my electorate-now no longer has a single post office as a result of the rationalisation that has occurred to Australia Post. This is despite recent assurances by the minister in this House that post offices would not be closed, and despite assurances that there would be no adverse impacts as a result of the government's decision to lower the competitive price threshold from $4.50 to $1.80. Again I would say that the government needs to decide whether it wants people to live in rural areas and whether it wants to provide those areas with modem services. The minister should give consideration to advancing the rural m-il services review which is due to .report 10 1996: I would like to see the results of that review at least a year earlier so that the real impacts on rural areas can be realised. I also have major concerns in relation to what Professor Hilmer says about statutory marketing authorities. Professor Hilmer states quite categorically that statutory marketing arrangements are grossly inefficient an-, effectively, tax users and consumers. ThiS statement. I would wholeheartedly contest because it fails to recognise that the major marketing authorities operating in extremely aggressive international export markets do so at great benefit to all Australians by enhancing export income. They are not price fixing mechanisms, they are price negotiating mechanisms, which is responsible, orderly marketing. If what Professor Hilmer says is fully implemented, Australians generally stand to be substantially disadvantaged. One of the major criticisms of Hilmer's report is that it has a very strong domestic focus; it fails to only recognise the international focus of many of our commodities as they are delivered. I would hope that the opportunity to provide an emphasis to request other people to lift their game does not cause the government to take attention off its own need to reform its micro-economic responsibilities. Focusing on the professions and on the activities of efficient marketing authorities is not the real issue that needs to be looked at in a total micro-economic reform agenda. Our rural export industries hold the key to restoring our international competitiveness, restoring our international creditworthiness, reversing our debt problems and restoring living standards. Rural export industries need policy which will maintain a competitive exchange rate and reduce interest rates. What we are seeing currently is frightening business right across the nation. These indusprices tries need policy which reduces the burden taxation. All of these things add costs charges to business and industry and reduce their ability to compete, particularly in international environment. As well as that, cuts in undue government spending to fund the huge bureaucracies of government need to be given serious attenians tion. In addition to Hilmer's recommendaians, tions, there must be maximum flexibility in industrial relations, responsible wage tions and cuts in the costs of government. If all these can be included in a national agenda then we truly will have genuine macrogest economic reform.  pleased to join with the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and the state honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) in making a contribution to this debate about micro-economic reform and competition policy. All too often when we talk about competition policy and micro-economic reform both sides of the House try to outdo the other as to who is the most virtuous or who is the most advanced. I want to pick up a few of the contributions that have already been made. It is true to say that we have benefited the areas where we have deregulated monopopayer lies and provided competition. The greater area of concern is whether or not we have given sufficient recognition to the fact that consumers may not have equal access or equal power. As the member for Mallee pointed out, some consumers do not have choice about products at all. I would like to advance the proposition that in pushing very hard for competition policy we need to or strengthen consumers' rights. It is very difficult to ask farmers or small bush enterprises to be competitive with their sister organisations in regional cities or capital cities if they do not have the same access to infrastructure. I think that is the point the honourable member for Mallee is concerned about, and I badly strongly support that view. Even in my own electorate, when it comes to communication, whilst there has been so small much development of communication and and charges have generally lowered, it of still remains the case that the poor do not and have access to communications. Given that the communications media are going to be the an vehicles by which in the future we will deliver the benefits of the super highway by saying to whole sections of Australians, whether they be rural and provincial Australor whether they be urban, poor Austral'You're going to miss out,' that will in fact double, treble or whatever the disadvannegotiatages that they may currently suffer. Together with competition policy, its espousal and its implementation, I also sugthat we should focus on the needs of consumers and consumer rights. For example, we are very keen to see the distribution of electricity and its retail system throughout the governments, as well as that of the water boards, subject to further competition, and I support that idea. But I would like to remind the House that most of the money provided for emergency funding by the federal government to the states goes to people who have had their electricity or water cut off. That does not mean that competition is bad; that is far from the point that I want to make. But I do think that instrumentalities need to be far more innovative in dealing with the so-called in battling consumer. All too readily a slow is labelled the same as a defaulting payer, and there is a world of difference. As yet we do not encourage monthly billing. I all would like to see it encouraged. There is no doubt in my mind that more frequent, smaller bills would make budgeting for poorer, a battling customers so much easier. I want to talk about doctors because so much has been said about health, the success otherwise of Medicare and the changes that need to be made. I am very concerned that we do not seem to be picking up one group in the community that is suffering grievously because of the health charges of some specialists. Firstly, the specialists regulate their numbers by limiting the supply of specialists coming on every year. Secondly, they ask people like pensioners, who are covered by Medicare, to fork out sums of money of the order of $6,000 to undergo operations. Perhaps this reflects a weakness in the current system that needs to be addressed. It is really outrageous that those in the community least able to afford it are being asked to pay massive amounts of money to go private. No member on either side of the House, I believe,. can be satisfied with this arrangement. Perhaps competition is something that may have an impact as far as specialist fees on the poor are concerned. (Time expired)",50
152,Mr ABBOTT,COMPETITION POLICY,"Warringah) (3.45 p.m.)May I begin by saying that as much as I enjoyed the speech of the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), I am disappointed that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was not here to move the motion standing in his name. As the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) has said, the opposition supports the thrust of the Hilmer report. We believe that competition is a good thing. We believe in eliminating the rorts, the rackets and the rip-offs from our economy and not necessarily by throwing a textbook at every problem. There are certain occasions when it is possible to be too respectful of economists living in their ivory towers and not being up to the tricks that governments play. It is quite interesting that the member for Werriwa had published in the Australian last week an article which demonstrates that the government's approach to Hilmer could very well produce more government rather than more competition. In particular, in talking about our health system he said: Most importantly, the income of an service ers would consist of payments by regional authorifinancial ties. In other words, what the member for Werriwa wants and what he believes the Hilmer report should lead to is not more competition between health providers but the effective employment of all health providers not by their clients but by some huge bureaucracies. own This is not a recipe for more competition, lower prices and more efficiency in our health system but a recipe for the nationalisation of our health system. The member for Werriwa is not talking about more competition; he is talking, in effect, about moving towards the British system of health care. That mayor may not have some virtues but it is certainly not a system which is characterised by competition. The member for Werriwa endorses the idea that the federal government should: ... pay public hospitals directly using the Casemix funding system thereby cutting out the complication of grants to the states. Do we not have it in a nutshell? For this federal government, reform means eliminating the states, and cooperation with the states means effectively bypassing them. This is not a recipe for a more efficient system in this country; this is a recipe for concentration of power in the hands of the federal government. Not everyone in the federal government is so foolish as to believe that putting everything in the hands of government is the answer to all our problems. Indeed, no less a person than the former minister for health, ex-Senator Graham Richardson, understood that one of the important reforms we need is to get more people back into private health insurance. He even said that he believed the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself, as a very high income earner, should go back into private health insurance. It is greatly to the Prime Minister's discredit that on his sort of income he could not see his way clear to be in private health insurance. One of the problems with the government's approach is that it has tended to make reform in this country a dirty word. Under this government, tariff reform has meant the providdevastation of so many of our industries, markets reform has meant that we have gone onto an interest rate roller coaster, and the whole package of reforms has given us one million unemployed. Under this government, reform has not meant .the better use of the resources of society; reform has meant that so many Australians have been thrown onto the scrap heap. Reform has become a dirty word in our society because, as soon as the government talks about reform,Â·the people understand that this means paying one person a lot more money so that 10 or 20 or 100 people can be thrown onto the scrap heap of unemployment. This is what reform has meant under this government. This is the problem that this government has to live with. The CSIRO is typical of.reform under this government. The CSIRO has sacked hundreds of scientists who are crucial for the welfare this country, yet it still keeps two corporate headquarters. What sort of reform is that? It is reform for the workers and not for the bosses. Surely it is time that this government stopped attacking lawyers and doctors and got on with the job of real reform.",53
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMPETITION POLICY,Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. NA Female Genital Mutilation,54
154,Ms WORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On 21 February this year I moved a private members motion calling on the federal government to introduce legislation to outlaw female genital mutilation in Australia. There was bipartisan support for the motion and since then the New South Wales government has introduced legislation to amend the Crimes Act 1900 to make it an offence to mutilate external female genitalia or to aid, abet, counselor procure such mutilation. Having written to all state Attorneys General, I was pleased to find this subject listed for discussion at the next meeting of Attorneys-General. Today I place on the record my appreciation of the report to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) prepared by the Family Law Council. The conclusions and recommendations are sensible and sensitive, acknowledging the need for both education and uniform legislation and the need for counselling, including for those who reject the practice of female genital mutilation. Prime Minister: Comments about Australia Hawke, Hon. R.J.L.: Comments about Leader of the Opposition",54
155,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to make a complaint. It is that todayI will be represented in Indonesia-he is on his way-by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who thinks this country is the 'arse end of the world'. I am absolutely outraged that the Prime Minister of of this country believes that about his own country an- then goes off to represent our country overseas. More importantly, I want to comment on the statement made recently by former Prime Minister Hawke that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) will be the next Prime Minister. Of all the things that Mr Hawke has said in his political career, that would have to be the one that has the most truth to it. He is a most astute political observer if he believes, as do many people in the community, that the Leader of the Opposition will become the next Prime Minister of Australia. When they consider the gutter language used by the Prime Minister, the Bankstown Bonaparte, about his own country, they will recognise that the Leader of the Opposition will make a far more distinguished, patriotic and believable Prime Minister than the one we have at the moment. RAAF Nomad Aircraft: Crash",54
156,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In March 1990, as a result of the crash of an RAAF Nomad aircraft near Adelaide, the husband of one of my constituents was unfortunately killed. That event was followed by an exchange with ministers as to the reasons for the crash and the reasons why those aircraft were constrained in their operations. I am informed that later this week a very major report will be released by the Ombudsman which will validate some of the complaints thatÂ· were being made at that time. I hope, for the sake of those people who are flying the aircraft in both the air force and the army, that that report will get to the bottom of the crash, as well as giving the widow of that unfortunate officer the real reasons why that aircraft crashed. EConomy",54
157,Mr HAWKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to point out some of the practical impacts that the government's mismanagement of the economy will have. We are hearing all about the increase in interest rates and what is going to. happen because the government could not run its budget properly, but let us look at what the government's mismanagement is really going to do. I draw members' attention to an address by the new President of the NFF, Mr Don MCGauchie., in which he popular pointed out that a one per cent increase in interest rates will cost the farm sector $170 million. He also went on to say that a one per cent rise in the exchange rate will similarly cost farmers around $160 million. Because of the government's mismanagement, financial institutions are being pressured into putting up interest rates, which in itself will have a very big cost factor for farmers. There is also likely to be a double whammy effect because interest rates will increase value of the Australian dollar against our major trading partners, in particular. United States dollar, which many agricultural deals are written in. The farming communimade ty-one of our major export industries-will be hit twice by this government's misbelieve management. It will have a very severe Australia impact. Doohan, Mr M.",55
158,Mr SLIPPER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Australian motor cycle grand prix legend Michael Doohan deserves congratulations today on two to counts-for his Dutch Grand Prix victory respect yesterday and for his show of patriotism. Doohan won the 21-lap race in just over 41 minutes, 35 seconds ahead of the 1993 world champion, American Kevin Schwantz, who Australia. finished in fifth place. The 29-year-old Queenslander now faces the challenge of becoming the first Australian to win five successive races in the 500cc motorcycle world championships when the series concaucus, tinues in Italy next Sunday. There are still seven races to go in the series. If Doohan's success continues, 1994 might produce an Australian world champion. Let us hope so. Australians should be proud of their sporting heroes, particularly those who have pride in their nation and its symbols. . Not only did Doohan take the chequered flag at yesterday'S Dutch Grand Prix; he also proudly flew the Australian flag over his shoulder during his victory lap. His achievements and actions yesterday gained him the admiration of all Australians. The claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that our flag does not represent its nation or its people is totally wrong. When one of Australia's most young sporting heroes performs this act of patriotism for the entire world to see, about it confirms how out of step the Prime Minister is, not only with Bob Hawke but also with the other people in this great nation. Prime Minister: Comments about Australia Fuel Costs",55
159,Mr LIEBERMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Indi}-In the last few days we have had some fairly heady reports the of claims and counterclaims by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the current the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We all know the disgraceful reference to this great country by the Prime Minister. We disagree entirely with his description of this nation. I that he is treating country people in in the same way that he refers to his nation. I am not going to use the word; honourable members know what I mean. I will give a vivid illustration of this. For many years this government has refused act to help country people get justice with to the cost of fuel and LPG. In northeast Victoria, for example, people regularly have to pay lOc to 15c per litre more for their fuel than people in the metropolitan areas of There is a disparity due to freight, but that cannot be any more than lc to 2c per litre. The government has had hundreds of representations, not only from people on this side of politics, but by members of the Labor and has not acted. In some cases the price of LPG in country areas of Victoria is almost double the price. of LPG in metropolitan Melbourne. (Time expired) ALP: Leadership",55
160,Mr BRADFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,I was wondering where the government is this afternoon. Mr Lieberman-They are at a crisis meeting.,56
161,Mr BRADFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was going to say that those opposite are having a crisis meeting. One can imagine that a caucus meeting might be going on in a back room somewhere in Parliament House. There is one forlorn, downcast looking minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free). Well he might look downcast as he contemplates the future of the Australian Labor Party under the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). One can only imagine that there must now be serious consideration being given by the Labor Party to a change of leadership. The speculation on our side of the House today is whether the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) or the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) or perhaps a dark horse like the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) or maybe even the minister at the table, who might be somewhere in the running, might be the next leader. There is no doubt that Australia is bereft leadership. The government is not here. We heard at question time that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) is away on business and that the Prime Minister is on his way to Indonesia. It is a pity that the people of Australia, other than those people in the gallery, cannot hear or see this debate to wonder where the government of the country actually is and what it is coming to. I wanted to pick up on a couple of points that had already been made about the current debate between Mr Hawke and the Prime Minister, but earlier today somebody warned me that it was very dangerous to get into a fight between two dogs because 'you're likely to get bitten yourself'. To some extent I believe that is true. I am reluctant to get the debate. IÂ· was also told that neither of them was terribly careful with the truth but, on balance, Mr Hawke might be slightly more careful with the truth than the Prime Minister. (Time expired) Interest Rates",56
162,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Thank you for the opportunity of speaking again, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to continue the point about interest rates. I come from a constituency that has a large number of young families raising children who in many cases have quite substantial mortgages to pay off. In many cases they have mortgages of $90,000 to $100,000. If, as predicted by the Labor government, there are going to be interest rate rises in the near future-as is quite clear from what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today, prior to going off for his jet set tour of Indonesia to kowtow to the Indonesian leader, when he gave the clearest indication for a long time that interest rate rises are imminent-a one per cent rise will mean that some people in my electorate will be faced with an extra $60 a month. If we have the rise predicted by experts such as the Westpac analysts or BIS Shrapnel of up to three per cent by the end of next year, I have constituents who will be paying up to $160 or more extra on their mortgage repayments to service their home loans. How can families that have already been hard hit by the recession, who are strapped by an of income tax system that is totally biased against families raising children, possibly cope with the effects of interest rate rises of this enormity? If any of those members opposite who are not here today but who normally are here think that in the outer mortgage belt areas they are going to win seats, they are sadly mistaken. (Time expired) Kennett Government",56
163,Mr CHYNOWETH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like. to speak about the Kennett tax slug. Jeffrey Kennett has increased 4,345 taxes in Victoria while he has been in government, which has cost the ordinary Victorian family $1,600 more in taxes and charges. He has brought in the $100 poll tax on every home, into which means that millionaires pay $100 and pensioners pay $100. He has doubled the electricity supply charge. He has increased gas charges. He has increased water charges. He has upped the petrol levy. He has increased stamp duty on car and house insurance. He has doubled the bank debit tax. He has increased TAPE fees. The increases go on and on. The people of Victoria were paying $9.9 million in bank debit tax. Since Jeffrey has been in power, they have been paying $118 million. He has increased the cost of little things like plumbing and draining installation to $65. Families with disabled children that needÂ· respite care primarily provided by government agencies have a new fee structure, with increases of up to-wait for it1,310 per cent. That is how much he has increased the fees for people looking for respite care. (Time expired)",56
164,Mr LIEBERMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Indi}-People who live in Victoria, as I do, have had to put up with a recovery-after 10 or 11 years of Labor state government-costing billions of dollars of assets. Any increases in charges in Victoria are directly attributable to the maladministration and incompetence of the previous Labor government. This government has failed to come forward with assistance for the people of Benalla, who suffered a severe and major disaster and flood last year. There are elderly people in Benalla with no covering on their floors. Winter is now upon us and they are unable to afford to repair damage to their homes caused by the floods. We have asked this government to make available some small measures of assistance. The government said it was considering it. So far it has failed to respond. are now almost at 30 June, when new arrangements for financing between Commonwealth and states must come into effect. I wonder whether the government is deliberately running this to 30 June so it can get off the hook. East Timor",57
165,Mr BRADFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"One of the most politically incorrect subjects to raise in this place is East Timor. If I had been able to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a question today then it would have been whether he would be prepared to raise the question of East Timor with the President of Indonesia while he was there. I am sure he will not. It is a matter for great shame, in my view, that the world, and Australia in particular, has stood by and watched the genocide that has occurred in that small country-or what was a country and now apparently is part of Indonesia. It is a documented fact that over 200,000 East Timorise have been killed since the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia in 1975. When we look at those people arid realise how close they were as friends of ours, particularly during the Second World War, we ought to be ashamed. I am not naive enough not to understand that to us Indonesia is an important ally, an important trading partner and an important friend. In no way do I downgrade that. But I Victoria will not be prevented from expressing the concern of many Australians who wonder why both sides of this place, government and opposition, have stood by and acquiesced to the invasion by Indonesia. We might also stand up on behalf of those Australian journalists who were murdered in East Timor in 1975. (Time expired)",57

167,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: ANZAC Day We To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: The ANZACs at the Gallipoli landing on 25 April 1915 were instrumental in forging a new identity for Australia. That landing was a lifetime ago but the deeds of those ANZACs of 1915-18 still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever. ANZAC Day is a day to remember those who left their homes with a strong desire to return but did not, as well as those who did return,. but in so doing carried for the remainder of their lives the scars of these experiences. It is a day to contemplate the spirit that moves men and women to serve, to suffer discomforts, dangers and fears and to risk their lives in defence of their country and in the pursuit peace, justice and freedom. On ANZAC Day, we salute not only the spirit of the ANZACs but, in paying tribute to them, take the opportunity to dedicate ourselves striving for our country as they did and upholding their finest qualities of courage, commitment, endurance and mateship. . Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge the Government to .declare ANZAC day as Australia's National Day of Commemoration and that it be held on 25 April in each year, and on no other day. by Mr Forrest (from 40 citizens), Mr Holding (from 113 citizens), Mr Howe (from 42 citizens), Mr Keating (from lO citizens), Dr Kemp (from 33 citizens), Mr Lieberman (from 219 citizens), Mr Lloyd (from 710 citizens), Mr Reid (from 23 citizens and Mr Ruddock (from lO citizens). Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in 12 for Australian women; (b) recognises the fact that breast cancer has potential to affect every Australian family; (c) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer. Your Petitioners aSk that the House of Representatives call on the Government to: (a) increase funding for breast cancer research ten-fold (a minimum of $14 million) in the 1994/95 Budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations for breast cancer research. by Mr Cameron (from 358 citizens), Dr Hewson (from 291 citizens), Mr Nehl (from 1,399 citizens) and Mr Wakelin (from 80 citizens). Pensions: Age for Women . To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. The petition of citizens and/or residents of the we Commonwealth of Australia respectfully show to concern at the Commonwealth Government's to intention to amend the Department of Social Security legislation to raise the age of women for pension eligibility from 60 to 65 because: The propo-al is active economic discrimination against women Women have a shorter paid working life than men Women receive less than equal pay Women have less access to superannuation The proposal does not recognise the value of women's unpaid labour Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House intercede on behalf of the Petitioners to: Ensure that women remain eligible for age pension at the age of 60. . And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Baldwin (from 25 citizens), Mr Lavarch (from lO9 citizens) and Mr Melham (from 190 citizens). CSIRO: Agricultural Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the state of Victoria, being members of staff at CSIRO's Division of Animal Health, the draws to the attention of the House the serious consequences of the significant reduction in Australian research and development on agriculture, particularly within CSIRO. Unless this decline is reversed or arrested, Australia stands to lose much of its unique expertise in agricultural research. The value of this market is currently estimated at around $20 billion per annum and is guaranteed to increase with the growth of South-East Asian economies. The Agricultural Industry cannot continue to be a significant export earner for Australia without significant R&D to underpin its status as clean and efficient. Your petitioners therefore request the House to act to assign a higher priority and greater funding for agricultural research in CSIRO. by Mr Baldwin (from 37 citizens) and Mr Tanner (from 95 citizens). CSIRO: Primary Industry Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents South Wales, being members of staff at CSIRO's Division of Wool Technology, draws to the attention of the House the serious consequences of the significant reduction in Australian research and development on primary industry, particularly within CSIRO. Unless this decline is reversed, Australia stands to lose much of its unique expertise in agricultural and pastoral research. The value of this market is currently estimated at around $20 billion per annum and Primary Industry cannot continue to be a significant export earner for Australia without significant Research & Development. The present proposals for restructuring within the Institute of Animal Production and Processing of CSIRO will result in the loss of the irreplaceable skills of over 300 staff and the loss to Australian primary industry of the benefits from the research they have in progress. Your petitioners therefore request the House to act to assign a higher priority and greater funding for agricultural research in CSIRO. by Mr Howard (from 96 citizens). Family Law Act To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes: 1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and deter. mined by a panel, the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. 3. That legal professionals be barred from appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast savings to the disputing parties. 4. That a modified fault clause be re-introduced to Family Law primarily designed to discourage adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the expense of deserted and innocent parties. 5. That the Child Support Agency be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate administrative procedure within the Tribunal. 6. That apart from cases of exceptional circumstances parental-child access become the inalienable of the state of New right of all parents. 7. That alternative counselling, (Government funded) be made available through the churches and that much more emphasis be placed on mediation in resolving disputes prior to the commencement of legal proceedings. by Mr Beale (from 80 citizens). Overseas Aid To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House that: (a) The signatories express deep concern that the Australian overseas aid budget of 0.36% of GNP could be cut in the next Federal Budget. (b) This decision would lessen the quality of the Government's aid program at a time when community support of Non-Government Organizations' aid programs is increasing. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House caIl upon the Government to honour its pre-election promise to increase the overseas aid aIlocation to 0.38% of GNP in the 1993/94 Budget in order to achieve a target of 0.4% of GNP by 1995 and to steadily increase the aid budget each year in order to achieve the UN recommended level of 0.7% of GNP by the year 2000. by Mr Cadman (from 452 citizens). Asian Dog Exports To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the state of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that over 7,000 puppies were exported from Australia to Hong Kong last year. It is further brought to the attention of the House that these Australian-bred dogs are being condemned to lives of misery in cramped apartment buildings. It is finaIly brought to the attention of the House that the dogs are treated crueIly, are not cared for and that the dogs should not be brought up in such an environment. Your petitioners therefore respectfuIly ask the House of Representatives to introduce greater restrictions on the export of dogs to Asia, and ensure that if any dogs are exported, proof is provided that they are satisfactorily looked after, and that if there is a breach of such restrictions, severe fines be introduced. by Mr Cameron (from 190 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so small the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears, for these purpOses, to 40,000. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to object most strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Cameron (from 86 Citizens). Fees: Cairns Campus To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain students of the Cairns Campus Student Association draws to the attention of the House that we oppose the introduction of full fees for domestic tertiary students. Your petitioners therefore request the House to vote against any proposed legislation which would introduce full fees. by Mr Dodd (from 108 citizens). Defence: Shoal water Bay To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth THAT it is our belief that the Australian Defence Force must have unfettered access to a suitably located area of our country in which to develop and maintain the high standard of tactical and technical efficiency necessary to fulfil its mission in assuring 7. and promoting the future security of our country SO THEREFORE do we call upon the House of Representatives to ensure that the Shoal water Bay Training Area in Central Queensland is not in any manner whatsoever taken out of the present system of control and management of our Australian Defence Force.

Christian Commonwealth To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: Bears The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we, the undersigned, call for the full and total recognition, by Federal Parliament and the High Court and all government agencies. that Australia is a Christian Commonwealth according to law and its heritage, traditions and customs. That as Australia prepares for the Centenary of Federation on 1st January, 2001 AD we celebrate our Centenary as a Christian Commonwealth as described by the Founders of Federation such as Sir John Downer, who said ""The Commonwealth will be from its first stage a Christian Commonwealth and as stated in our Federal Constitution-""Relying of the Blessings of Almighty God ... "" That our Federal Parliament therefore implement the following policies before 1st January 2001 AD, ""In the Year of our Lord"":1. The Adoption of a Christian National Anthem such as ""God Bless Australia"" to the tune of ""Waltzing Matilda"". 2. The Adoption of a Christian National Motto such as ""One Nation Under God"", for use on our coins, banknotes, etc. 3. The appointment of practising Christians as Vice Regal representatives of our Christian Queen, Elizabeth II. 4. The retention of our Christian Prayers including the Lord's Prayer at the daily opening of Parliament in the standing respectful present of all Members of Parliament. S.

The retention of Christian Christmas Carols in our Schools and other civic functions during the Christmas Season. Officially inform the United Nations and all the other nations of the world that Australia is a ""Christian Commonwealth"". Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will reaffirm our Christian Heritage as a Christian Commonwealth. And your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Howard (from 38 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: (1) They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag. (2) They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack. itself the creation of three Christian crosses, represents the nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 190 I. (3) They know the flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. (4) They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism. (5) They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will: Propose and pass a motion that 'the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a Referendum' . And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Howard (from 15 citizens). Rights of the Child: United Nations To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. THAT ratification of UN. Conventions, such as the. above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles; 2. THAT the Convention's philosophy of parent/child relationships is based on a false National Flag promise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children; 3. THAT the Christian - principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation. 4. THAT Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think. say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent; 5. THAT some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection. of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers; 6. THAT some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection ofchildren from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws. Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislation or provide for; (a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles; (b) a referendum to follow the Moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Howard (from 12 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Convention 1. The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national flag. 2. We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon and approved by the people of Australia in a national poll. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Jull (from 10 citizens). Postage Charges To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the adverse effects on all Australians and residents of country Australia in particular, of the outrageous increases in by Australia Post for postage of magazines and newspapers and requests the House to take action to prevent the proposed rises taking place. by Mr Neh) (from 11 citizens). Medicare Office: Katherine To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of certain residents of Katherine and citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that a Medicare office in Katherine is urgently .needed to eliminate financial hardship and personal inconvenience to residents of and visitors to the Katherine region of the Northern Territory requiring Medicare services. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a Medicare office be established in Katherine and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Snowdon (from 1,858 citizens). Petitions received. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted.",57
168,Mr BRADFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Today I grieve for the legacy this government has left to my children and to other children in this country: the legacy of . debt. Australia's gross foreign debt is now in the order of $201 billion. Mr Hollis-Mostly private.,62
169,Mr BRADFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is not mostly private. It is both public and private debt. That represents a $171.9 billion net debt. The situation is actually worse than that. We also need to look at foreign ownership of Australian equity; that is, stocks and shares in Australian corporations. That amounts to a further $145.4 billion. Australian investment abroad is $73.2 billion, so net foreign equity in Australian companies and businesses amounts to $72.1 billion. What a pity it is in many respects that Australian companies and individuals have to look elsewhere to invest. The Australian Labor Party and the policies it has brought in have clearly failed to' encourage Australians to invest in their own country. The answer by charges the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to a question in question time a couple of weeks ago was very hollow. He suggested that there was something wrong with those foreign investors who chose to invest in Australia. The fact is that much of Australia is being sold cheaply. Many people from overseas are seeing the bargains that are here, but that does not alter the fact that many Australians are clearly choosing to invest outside Australia. Whilst we on this side of the House do not want to necessarily discourage that, I make the observation that that is costing hundreds of thousands of Australians jobs. If the economic settings were right in this country, Australians would be choosing to invest in Australia. They would be encouraged to invest in Australia and by doing so they would be creating jobs for Australians. Although the latest current account figures showed a fall of $1.84 billion in net debt, the latest figures also show a huge $5.04 billion inflow of foreign equity investment. Those figures are the second highest on record. Foreign interests owned 21.2 per cent of Foreign Debt total Australian business capital as at 30 June 1992. Many people regard that as being a very conservative estimate. I have seen others estimat- the figure to be in excess of 30 per cent. That figure of 21.2 per cent as at 30 June 1992 is an increase from 16.6 per cent as at 30 June 1980. So there is clear evidence there-there was particular evidence in the last set of figures-that there is an increasing interest in overseas investors buying shares and taking up equity in Australian corporations. It may be possible to argue-I think the Treasurer attempted to do this in his answer to the question-the relative merits of debt versus equity. It may be possible to make a case that the movement from debt into equity is in some way beneficial. However, the bottom line when we add these two together-in an accounting sense that is the correct thing to do because what I am pointing to is Australia's total foreign indebtedness-is that Australia's total foreign liabilities now stand at $244 billion net. That is up from only $38 billion just under 10 years ago, at the end of the financial year 1981-82. The gross figure-if we talk in gross terms the figures are even more horrific-is $346.5 billion. That compares with a gross total foreign indebtedness of $55.1 billion at the end of 1981-82. I will make that point again. That is an increase from $55 billion just over 10 years ago to almost $350 billion today. If we break that amount down to an amount per capita, the debt is $20,000 for every person in Australia. It ought to concern every Australian that this government is continuing to sell off the farm at an alarming rate. We sometimes hear hollow and simple defences for that action, but when we look at the balance sheet of Australia in accounting terms, we see that it is crook. It is not a healthy balance sheet at all. Of course, balance sheets do not measure the potential that this country has to be great-I have no doubt that it does have the potential to be great-but in simple accounting terms the debt this country now has to others is enormous. It ought to concern every Australian and I believe that in the lead-up to the next election it will become a major issue as people finally realise the extent to which this country has been sold out by the government in the last 10 years. The government has consistently produced a current account deficit. Each month we drop further and further behind. If it is only a billion dollars or a billion and a half dollars it is considered to be a good result. Each month we have that result we must rely further on foreign savings to keep us afloat. The other part of this equation is Australians' savings. Our savings rates are deplorpressure ably low. If we look at a table of national savings over a period, we see consistent falls since the mid-1970s peak of 26.8 per cent of GDP to only 15.8 per cent of GDP in 199293. By world standards this is an extremely low figure and it adds up to the fact that people in this country have been highly taxed and they have had their investment income taxed so they have been reluctant to invest, and they have been given expectations about having a funded retirement, which has been counterproductive in terms of savings. I am not arguing here-certainly the opposition would not be arguing for this-for financial regulation, although we must observe that in many respects deregulation has not worked effectively. Clearly, though, financial deregulation has allowed significant supplementation of domestic capital from overseas. Given the continuing fall in the domestic savings rate, either use of foreign capital had to expand or the Australian investment rate had to fall. Quite clearly we cannot have high consumption and high investment. Foreign equity investment may be qualitatively better than debt, but it will still ultimately lead to the repatriation of profits overseas. I have seen arguments lately that suggest that the cost to Australia in economic terms will be greater in the long term from the repatriation of profits than it would be from having to meet a commitment as a result of debt. The government has not set a very good example for the private sector. To take up the point of my good friend over here, we do have a significant public debt in this country so it is not correct to take the simplistic copout and say that it is all private debt. Even if it were all private debt it would still be a problem for this country, but the fact is that we now have a very significant public debt. Public debt is a collective liability of all present and, of more concern to me in a lot of respects, all future taxpayers as well. Net government demand for capital exceeding net private sector supply of capital has led to the importing of foreign capital by both the public and private sectors. That brings us back to the situation today, where so much is being put on interest rates. When the government has to' go out and finance a deficit of $11 billion-or perhaps closer to $18 billion, which it effectively is-then of course there is going to be pressure on interest rates. We are seeing plenty of evidence of that at the moment. The fact is that Australia is actually hooked on debt. There is little light at the end of the tunnel. The gap that has been made up by the steady rise in foreign ownership shares and other productive assets is not in Australia's best long-term interests. The government's failure to address the underlying causes of our alliance on foreign funds which, however it is rationalised, threaten our economic sovereignty is deplorable. (TIme expired) Macedonians: Throsby Electorate",62
170,Mr HOLLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Given the multicultural nature of Australia, it is perhaps not surprising that all political parties welcome members from diverse ethnic backgrounds to their ranks, and the ALP is no exception to this. It is also true to say that, given the ethnic composition of Australia, their numbers are not fully reflected in the parliament of Australia. However, over recent months in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland there has emerged the disturbing tendency of people to work for their own political agendas in an attempt to manipulate some sections of the ethnic community. I believe this is called branch stacking. I speak with a degree of personal experience in this matter. The Macedonian community in the Illawarra is, in my view, being manipulated by some individuals-not all from within the Macedonian communitywho are running a political agenda which, to their mind, would reach its climax with the replacement of me as the member for Throsby. Honourable members would be aware that, over recent years, three members of this chamber have consistently espoused the Macedonian cause, be it on the question of recognition, the term 'former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia', the highly offensive term Slav Macedonia, the access of Australian Macedonians to consular facilities, the question of human rights, the way Macedonian minorities are reported to have been treated in other countries, or the amount of broadcast time on SBS for Macedonian programs in the Macedonian language. The three members have been the former member for Stirling, Mr Ron Edwards, my colleague the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) and me. Each of us over many years has espoused the Macedonian cause, at some cost to ourselves. It is not always a popular cause to espouse, as the telephone cans I get in the middle of the night remind me. I make the point that I embraced the Macedonian cause not for political expediency but because I did believe and still believe in the justice of that cause. This has been especially true on the recognition issue. I believe that Macedonia met an the requirements for recognition. I also believe-as I have said in this chamber many times-that, given the large Macedonian population in Australia, Australia should have been among the first to recognise this country instead of being among the last. It is also fair to say that I have until recently enjoyed a close working relationship with the Macedonian community, not only in the Illawarra but Australia wide. Indeed, even today I received a letter from a group in Melbourne asking me to take up a particular issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). In an attempt to ease the channels of communication to ministers and the federal parliament, I was instrumental in establishing the Australian parliamentarians Macedonian support group. Following a visit by Senator Bolkus to fulfil a long standing invitation from the Cringila co-op in the electorate of Throsby, the Macedonian community has been manipulated into what is commonly known as branch stacking, or an anti-Hollis push. My colleague Senator Stephen Loosley wrote an interesting piece in yesterday'S Sunday Telegraph. In that article he made very telling points about the disruption and divisiveness of branch stacking. Most ALP branches in New South Wales have between 25 and 50 members. This is certainly the case with most of the ALP branches in my electorate, but I believe that even Senator Loosley would be somewhat amazed to see what has happened in the Warrawong branch in my electorate. The Warrawong branch of the ALP has enjoyed quite a chequered history. Membership has widely fluctuated. During the past 12 months there have been great difficulties with gaining quorums for meetings, and monthly meetings of the branch have been abandoned for this very reason. In the past, there was talk of branch closure. We even changed the night the branch met to a Friday night, and we changed the venue. There were 11 stalwarts in that branchtwo of them with a Maltese background, one was Macedonian, and the rest were Lebanese five from one family. It is true to say that thWarrawong branch was the smallest and poorest ALP branch in my electorate. It was the one ALP branch which contributed nothing to the last federal election campaign. In fact, the president of the Warrawong. branch approached me earlier this year to pay a levy charged by head office because the branch could not afford it. In two months this financially embarrassed, struggling multi-ethnic branch has gone from having a membership of 11 to having a membership in excess of 500. In one night, 318 people-all of Macedonian backgroundfelt the urge to join the Australian Labor Party and did so at the Warrawong branch. The next month, over 150 joined. One suspects that the Warrawong branch has also gone from being one of the poorest branches to one of the richest, because the head office of the New South Wales ALP gave to the Warrawong branch a receipt for in excess of $4,000 for membership fees paid in cash. The local petrol station, which is Macedonian owned, was the recruitment centre. People collected their forms there, filled them in and deposited them at the kebab shop next door-also Macedonian owned. Some of them di- n-t quite understand what they were filhng 10. They were told to fill in the forms and, as they cost no money, they took them down to the community centre. In fact, some of them often rang my office and asked me about the form. The queue for the meetingthe attendance went from 11 to in excess of 318, complete with television cameras et alstretched from the first floor right out into street. People would progress up the stairs, and they were directed by two young spivs from Sydney who instructed them where to sign in the book. They then turned around and left the meeting. In the meantime, the other meeting was proceeding with the 11 loyal and devoted members. When Senator Bolkus visited the area to fulfil a long standing appointment, he and I were met with a barrage of bottles and eggs. When we finally reached the building where the meeting was tq take place, the front door was kicked in and, for good measure, the back door was smashed in. It appears that my sin is that, when I went out to see what was happening-it was fairly obvious-and was interviewed by the television stations, l said that it was a disgraceful exhibition that did the Macedonian people, their cause or the Illawarra no credit. I retract not one iota from that statement. It was not I who put the news bulletin of the disruption out that night; it was the local television statiQns. After that the Macedonians, with the help of a couple of spivs from the New South Wales Labor centre unity faction-and I believe, with the support of the New So-th Wales ALP head office-decided to stack against me. In this, they were ably assisted by the secretary of the South Coast Labour Council and the president of the Throsby FEC who, the day after the 318 people went in, had a meeting in Wollongong with the Macedonians. It is somewhat ironic that the two local Macedonians most involved in the stacking are both funded by federal government grants. lice Musarevski, who is employed by FIMEE as a migrant liaison officer, is responsible for dealing with all migrants in the area n?t just the Macedonian people, but has set himself up as a Macedonian recruitment officer to such an extent that he has actually produced a pamphlet which has been sent out-hopefully not with FIMEE postage. It says: This is the one way for us Macedonians to have control in the Branches of the Australian Labor Party. On Tuesday 154 members were accepted by the the NSW Administrative Committee and now we have total control of the ALP for Throsby, which means ex-ct1y we have sang Colin Hollis' song, and the entire number of members has to go for the seat of Throsby. - rom Macedonian background 542, which is 2 times more than the total (others) and that is why we have total control. . A letter was sent around by these spivs, Signed on ALP paper, telling people what to do. One of them, David Tanevski, signed himself 'regional organiser'. That is a criminal offence because there is no such position in the Illawarra ALP. I was recently invited to speak at a rally down here, but the same people from Wollongong prevented me doing that. I welcome new members of all ethnic backgrounds, as I believe all political parties do, but I do not believe that such blatant stacking does anyone anyone any cr-it at all. The issue of Macedonia is complex. It will not be sorted out in Australia; it will be out but by Greece and Macedonia. (TIme expired) Children With Disabilities Exotic Birds",64
171,Mrs GALLUS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am sorry that we cannot extend the time of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), as it was such an interesting speech on branch stacking in the ALP. I am sure that we could all learn from it. Today I would like, firstly-and solely, if I use up all my time - to address a problem that has arisen in my electorate in relation to the children's services program. This is a program of the Department of Human Services and Health, administered by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). I will refer to the aims and objectives children's services program, as listed in a handout by the minister. The first priority is children whose parents are in the work force. The second priority-the second of four-is children or parents with a continuing disability or incapacity. It is against the law of this country for children with disabilities to be excluded from the child-care program. The out of school hours care program is a combination of the after school program and the vocation program. The laws of the Commonwealth of Australia state that discrimination is against the law. The second priority of the children's services program is that children with disabilities be included in this program. In the instructions relating to the program, at paragraph 6.4 'Enrolment of children', there are priority of access guidelines; that firstly, work force participation or training and, secondly, children with disabilities. The handbook for these organisations further mentions that the priorities to be considered within these groups are parents or children with disabilities. Taking this into consideration, I think we would all assume that a child with disabilities would have access to the out of school care or vocation care in South Australia. But that is not the case. We can go even further because we realise that children with disabilities may require extra care. There has been a lot of rhetoric sorted from the department on supplementary services grants. These grants are to assist with out of school child care. The department provides examples where extra moneysupplementary service grants-can be given. It states: . A broad range of services may be suitable for SUPS funding. The following examples give an indication of the types of services which may be funded under SUPS. Example No. 11 is children with disabilities. Grants will be provided for workers to assist children with disabilities; the training of staff and caregivers in the special requirements of certain disabilities; provision of specialised toys for use of children with disabilities; and minor capital grants for modifications to premises. Three elements would make us believe that children with disabilities would of the have access to these programs. South Australian children with disabilities do not have access to this program at all. The Ascot Park Primary School, a local school which runs an after school care program for children with disabilities, raised the problem of an autistic child whose mother works and who requires assistance to stay in the program. A staff of only two have to care for the nonnal range of children plus the autistic child, as he has special needs. They simply cannot do this without extra funding. No special funding has been available, despite every possible avenue that this school has gone through. In following up this matter, I thought there must be some mistake. It is written in black and white in these different fonns, including is, the supplementary service grants, that this is a particular area of need to which money should be given. So I rang the office of the Minister for Family Services and asked whether supplementary service grants could be used on this occasion. The minister's office knew nothing about the supplementary service grants. I was given the phone number of the South Australian Department of Health and Community Services. When I rang the number, it turned out that the number had been disengaged several months ago and was no longer the department's phone number. This did not make things any easier. I went back to the minister's office and asked whether there were any other numbers I could ring. I was given another number of a person in the department. I rang the person concerned and asked about the grants. That person had not heard about the grants, but referred me to somebody else who had. I was assured that those grants would definitely be available for somebody with disabilities in after school child care. I rang the next person, who put me on to Kay Filmore, from the special needs office. When I rang her she said that she had been trying for well over a year to get assistance under this program and that basically no assistance was forthcoming whatsoever. It seems that the department does not know what is happening; nobody seems to know what is happening. This seems to be another example of this government's rhetoric. It says that services are available to the community when they are not. The government stresses how much it looks after people with disadvantages and how it is targeting the disadvantaged in the community. When we look, we find that there is no action on the ground. The department does not even seem to know about it. The department would have received information from Kay Filmore because, as I said, she has been trying for a considerable time to get this service for the people she works for. She states: Without funding for supplementary services for out of school hours care families with children with disabilities are effectively denied access to programs. I wonder how seriously the government takes its own programs when there are 10,000 places for out of school care in South Australia and not one of those places is for children with disabilities. I ask the minister to address this as a matter of urgency. Another matter that is of concern to me arose out of my previous position as shadow minister for the environment. I have mentioned this issue to the present shadow minister, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). I hope that he will take it up. The issue of considerable concern to me is the importation of exotic birds into Australia. I can see no good reason to import exotic birds into Australia when the importation of those birds puts our own bird population at risk. Recently, two macaws were imported into Australia. They were in quarantine in England, where one of the birds died. The other bird continued on its way into Australia, where it was diagnosed in quarantine in Australia as being ill. After being examined, no cause of illness could be found. It was then given injections of hormones and antibiotics and released into Australia. Subsequently, it died of a disease known as macaws wasting disease. Macaws are parrots. Parrots have a general genetic composition in common in the Southern Hemisphere and can pass diseases from one parrot species to another. So had that parrot had some contact with our native parrot population, it could have passed on this macaws wasting disease. This matter is not only of concern to me but also to vets of considerable standing in the community. I mention in passing Dr Patricia Macwhirter and Ross Alan Perry, who is a veterinarian who deals with budgeri shipment 19 budgerigars were examined and found to have megabacteria. He asks: if these budgerigars are released from quarantine into Australia with megabacteria, what are the guarantees that no other diseases are being released into Australia from imported birds? While my specific interest is in the environment, I followed this matter up. I found that these the reason for the importation of these birds was simply so that those people who already had exotic birds in Australia could increase their genetic pools. As laudable an aim as this may be, I do not think in any circumstances it justifies Australians bringing parrots or other birds into Australia with a quarantine period which is obviously not long enough to look at this disease. The quarantine stations focus on diseases in poultry and not diseases in Australia's wildlife, specifically Australia's parrots. 1 grieve today that such a thing should be allowed to occur. I ask the minister to look at this matter in the interests of the future of Australia's wild bird population. Member for Gilmore: Media Coverage . Mr KNOTT (Gilmore) (4.40 'p.m.)-My grievance today relates to the way in which parliament and parliamentarians are viewed in the media. I refer particularly to the work that is done by members of parliament in their electorates and the way that members get the news of the work they are engaged in across to the general public. I rise to speak about this matter because I have received some media coverage in recent times. I find it somewhat disturbing that, whilst 1 constantly mention the good work that is being done in my electorate, it is very difficult to get the media and those who gaze upon my work to look at the positive things I have actually done. I will give a run down of what I did last week. ' Mr Bilney-You won't have time.",66
172,Mr KNOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I do so much work. There is one particular event that I draw to the attention of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, who is at the table. The RTA Big New South Wales Bike Ride is coming to my electorate of Gilmore. It will be the first time it has come to a federal electorate. It is the first time a federal member has sought it and, with the local councils, put together and won a bid. That may seem well and good and not very newsworthy, but I contend that an event which costs between $600,000 and $700,000 to stage will result in a significant economic influx to my electorate of Gilmore. My region will receive an immediate economic stimulus because of the money that will be spent there. There is more. The electorate will receive exposure in a tourism sense. People who live quite close to us are going to see some of the treasures of my electorate that they did not know about. Leonie Watman, the events organiser for Bicycle New South Wales, and Simon Roundtree, the events coordinator for the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Australia,toured the route with me and spoke to the mayors, councils, chambers of commerce, leading citizens and various groups such as the police, firemen and other emergency service groups. We did this so that we could start the planning and highlight the economic benefits that will flow from the event which will come through my area in the first week of March next year. This is the first stage in a long process. I will have my electorate wound up and looking forward to benefits that can be obtained from the Olympic Games in the year 2000. It is our estimate that the first travellers will come to our shores in 1996. There will be a trailing off in travellers after the year 2000 and we will probably still see the effect of the Olympic Games to the year 2001 or 2002. I sincerely hope that the tourist operators and those involved in business within my electorate will be finely tuned by that stage. I hope we will have gone through the RTA Big New South Wales Bike Ride with such a degree of cooperation and enthusiasm that we. will be able to package and market our area for the bigger prize-the dollars that will come to Australia as a result of the Olympic Games. None of this was ever mentioned in the recent publicity. The media did not want to know about this. When I first started to put the idea forward, there was some degree of ridicule. Some in the media were saying, 'What is this federal member doing pushing for something like this for his area?' I will continue to push for this event. I will continue to push for things like the aero modelling world championships to come to my electorate. That is a $3 112 million event. These events may not be the Olympic Games or at the cutting edge of huge international events, but they are very significant for electorates like mine. Secondly, 1 refer to the work I have done in changing the opinion of the council on where sewage should go. When I became the member for Gilmore on 13 March 1993, the Shoalhaven City Council had a policy that it was going to put all its sewage effluent out to sea. It had a bogus community discussion program which basically said, 'We'd like to put it somewhere else but we're going to have, to put it out to sea because it is much cheaper than any of the other options.' It has taken over 12 months, some very hard ball and some very hard discussions to come to the point where the Shoalhaven City Council has abandoned its plans to put effluent into the ocean. I know what the minister at the table, who is a keen fisherman and who has congratulated me on the two four-kilogram snappers and the two 2 1h-kilogram snappers that I have managed to catch in the last four weeks, thinks about the prospect of people eating fish that were caught in areas polluted by sewage. Mr Bilney-Small fish, but at least they'll be clean in your electorate.",68
173,Mr KNOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The fish in my electorate are large and clean. The bottom line is that, through a novel and lateral thinking approach, we have managed to look at employment potential that effluent management can achieve for my people. That means the re-use of effluent on farm properties and farm forests. These are not innovations that I have made. They are not new in the Australian context, but they are new to some people within my electorate. The attitude that anything which is not the way it has been done for the last 50 years in Sydney is not on is finally dying. We actually have people within my electorate who can see the use in protecting new industries, such as the mariculture, which I am sure the minister is deeply concerned about. Mariculture is a growing industry which involves the farming of fish in the oceans. It is very dependent on the cleanliness of the water. What would the Shoal haven City Council have achieved had I not stepped in? Firstly, it would have destroyed the tourism industry. Secondly, it would have destroyed the residential amenity, the main reason most people come to the south coast and continue to come to the south coast. Mr Bilney-Or come there for holidays, for that matter. .",69
174,Mr KNOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Or come there for holidays. Thirdly, the blossoming industry of mariculture, particularly the bi-valve scallops which are now being farmed effectively on string arrangements, for my constituents and for their grandchildren would be gone if this environmental vandalism had taken place. The council is stiII not convinced. It still thinks it has to have an ocean outfall for sewage. That is not the case. The studies which have been conducted and which the federal government has funded are going to prove that there is another industry in my electorate. Let me show honourable members the stupidity that goes on in some of the media. I note in particular the Kiama Independent. It is one of my more vocal critics. It has criticised me and my family for something like 27 years. It is getting a bit thick. I sent a letter to it referring to the fact that women have had the vote for 100 years. It told me that it was not important and that it was a local issue. The fact that this term of council has had the first woman mayor and the second woman mayor, ever, in 127 years of local government, I would suggest is relevant to women getting the vote. The fact that Kiama now has a woman mayor, I would have thought, would have made it even more relevant. Does the editor of the Kiama Independent not realise that 51 per cent of my constituents are women? If he thinks that they are not important and that they are not a local issue, his head is in the wrong place. Postal Services: Country Areas Telecom Services: Double Standards  wish to bring two matters to the attention of the House. The first concerns the decline in the standards of Australia Post's mail delivery service from capital cities to country areas and the second the practice of operating double standards in the delivery of Telecom Australia services. Is this House aware that Australia Post's nationally agreed and accepted standard for letter deliveries from city to country areas is now three days? The service to country areas was considerably faster than that 34 years ago, as one of my constituents in Donnybrook, a town in the south west of Western Australia, will confinn. He infonns me that the mail was delivered from Perth steam train and arrived promptly at his office each morning at 8.30 a.m. His office was in . up. the habit of opening the mail, dealing immediately with the urgent matters by the time of the next postal collection at 1.00 p.m. could confidently expect the mail to be delivered in Perth promptly the next morning. With all the modem technology available this day and age, Australia Post now accepts that a satisfactory service between Perth and Donnybrook is a three-day delivery time. fact, there are a number of instances where has taken longer.. On one occasion a letter posted on Tuesday did not reach South Perth post office until the following Monday mornadvances ing. Mail sent from Bunbury to Albany in south of my electorate has to first travel. 200 them. kilometres north to Perth before being sent southward again past Bunbury to Albany. Constituents in the south coast town Denmark, in my electorate, tell me that it is not unheard of for mail clearly addressed 'Denmark, WA' to be delivered weeks later, having been sent first to Denmark in Europe. One has to wonder, with clearly addressed envelopes and properly used post codes, just why this sort of mistake and this poor stantreated dard of service should be tolerated from modem mail delivery service. The second matter I wish to raise concerns the standards of service available to country Telecom users. Last year, Telecom Australia announced in a blaze of publicity that it spending $3.3 billion on new telecommunicaexchanges. tions infrastructure. A program of network modernisation and expansion would 'springTelecom board Australia into the 21st century', accordpoor. ing to a senior Telecom officer. Western Australia was promised a $313 million boost as a result of the new future mode of operbeen ations, FMO, program, which was hailed a revolution in our telecommunications local system. The new high-tech system would give users of services: itemised call records; call which notifies a user that a second caller is the line; call divert facilities; call control, which allows a personal identification number to be used; and a delayed hotline, a facility frequently used by the frail and the aged in an by emergency, which automatically dials up a program number when .the receiver is picked This major cash injection also promised to provide malice call tracing facilities, abbreviand ated dialling, third party conferencing and various other facilities that have become commonplace in Australia's capital cities. in But while Telecom may appear to have its sights finnly set on the future, a large constituent of its rural customers are finnly of the In opinion that Telecom's headlong plunge into it high technology has left them completely out in the cold. For thousands of rural customers in my electorate, Telecom's technological are not contributing in any way at the all to an improved standard of service for There is still a very large number of customers in the south west and the great southof ern regions of Western Australia who are denied access to the sorts of Telecom services to that metropolitan subscribers have taken for granted for many years. They are denied access to itemised billing, to Easycall and to other network based facilities. Quite simply, the perception in country areas is that they are by Telecom as minority, second-class a customers who have to accept a second-rate service. What is even worse, many of those country customers face a further delay of four or five years before they can enjoy the benefit- of the was changeover from analog to digital telephone To the north of my electorate is the rural town of Brunswick Junction. services to Brunswick Junction are Subscribers are forced to tolerate frequent faults, do not have access to itemised billing and, to make matters worse, they have disappointed on a number of occasions as when Telecom has made assurances that the exchange would be updated only to later abandon those assurances. I understand from Telecom that the upgrade wait, of Brunswick Junction telephone exchange on from analog to digital is now not scheduled to take place until the 1998-99 financial year, with the possibility of call charge information by June 1996. They may just scrape in on the tail end of Telecom's five-year future mode of operations program. With the rapid advances being made in telecommunications technology, it is incomprehensible that Telecom can operate a twoclass system, one high cost and high-tech for city customers, with the other barely an advance on the clumsy, makeshift system our grandparents used. Coun-ry people have had to tolerate a declining service coupled with increasing costs. Country public telephone boxes have been removed, public phone box call charges have been increased, and on 1 June I understand that Telecom also wants to slap a four per cent increase on local call charges. As if this is not enough, country users now have to pay for out-of-area telephone directories to be delivered. Previously they were provided free by Telecom. When I raised this matter with Telecom I was told: The number of outlets for out-of-area directories under the previous system made it extremely difficult to estimate customer demand with any degree of accuracy. With over 1,300 post offices and some 2,600 postal agencies nationally, the opportunity for waste in both transport and raw materials is greatly increased if demand is overestiFor mated. Surely Telecom can estimate waste just as easily by developing a more accurate estimating process. I am quite sure, for example, country users would not object to placing their orders on a toll-free number if could continue to receive free directories. The other point raised' by country constituents is Telecom's assumption that a Perth telephone directory is an out-of-area directory for country users. Many agricultural machiTelecom nery manufacturers are based in Perth. If parts or supplies cannot be sourced locally, a Perth office can be found in the Perth telephone directory and goods freighted down overnight with a minimum of delay to the farm ness. To many people in the rural community, access to the Perth market is an essential of their business and is not an out-of-area service extra, as Telecom attempts to make it. Similarly, the rapidly expanding tourism market in the south west and great southern regions has to have access to the state's capital city, not just for its visitors-the bulk of whom come from Perth-but for a great deal of its essential supplies. Telecom has consistently failed to understand that country people rely on an efficient, reliable telephone service far more than people in capital cities. To the rural community the telephone is a vital link, to the agricultural and tourism industries especially. It is the single most important piece of business equipment. It makes business possible, and country customers have every right to expect the same standard of service enjoyed by their city counterparts. In the south west of my electorate, in Albany-which students of Australian history such as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will know, was the first part of Western Australia to be settled-Telecom has still not provided a fully itemised billing facility for all the town's telephone customers. Changeover to a fully digital exchange, with alI the services and facilities that will provide, is not scheduled until the 1998-99 financial year. At this point it might be useful to quote Telecom's group general manager of networking technology, Mr Doug Campbell, who said: Australian business in particular, FMO will be the springboard into the 21 st century. The world is knocking at our doorstep and FMO is our welcome mat. that What he did not say is that the world will have to wait up to five years to get a welthey come mat from the south west and great southern regions. Speaking from a business background, I can assure Mr Campbell that business opportunities do not hang around for five years for people to act on them. Neither nor Australia Post has any right to expect country users to tolerate these double standards. For all the so-called advances being made, services are simply not being improved and the cost of those services is certainly not busicoming down for country users. If, by highlighting these severe communicapart tion problems, I have given the impression that they have not taken place in one of Australia's remote areas, let me correct that impression. The south west and great southern regions of Western Australia are amongst the fastest growing areas in the state. The south west attracts more than one million tourists a year, who contribute $219 million to the region's economy. (Time expired) Green and Fitzroy .Islands: Currency",69
175,Mr DODD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Leichhardt) (5.00 p.m.)Today I want to draw the attention of this House to the problem of so-called funny money on Green and Fitzroy Islands which continues to cause offence to many of my constituents in Far North Queensland. For generations, residents have made daytrips out to Green Island. Glass-bottom boats have been used to view the beauty of the reef from Green Island as far back as the 1930s. Green Island is a coral cay and it is the oldest nature reserve in the Great Barrier Reef region, having been declared a national park in 1937 and a marine park in 1974 under Queensland legislation. It has also been used a boat building yard and a fishing retreat from the earliest days of settlement in the Cairns area. Fitzroy Island is a continental island off Yarrabah. It is a beautiful rainforest clad island that has also been a long-time popular destination for Cairns residents and tourists alike. Both islands have resort and visitor facilities that are leased to a foreign owned company, Daikyo, which operates the very successful Great Adventures tourism packages. Since I have been the member for Leichhardt, I have heard rumblings in the community about the so-called funny money being obligatory on Green and Fitzroy Islands. The point at issue is aptly put in a letter from a constituent who wrote to me earlier this month. It reads: I am in possession of Australian currency, the of which all bear the phrase, 'Legal out Australia and its Territories.' Why, then am I not permitted to use this currency on Green and Fitzroy Islands in exchange for goods? Why must I exchange my currency for another before I can purchase any goods? Have Green and Fitzroy Islands become separated from Australia? My constituent goes on to ask why Australian currency is not valid on these islands. That is a very good question indeed. The questions put to me in this letter by my constituent are typical of questions asked by the thousands of Cairns residents who visit Green Island and find to their surprise that the Australian currency in their wallets will not buy them a seat on a glass-bottom boat. It will not even buy. them a beer or a hamburger. I have been to Green Island and I have seen the currency exchange booths located right throughout the resort area. If people want to buy anything on the island, from a diving trip to a packet of chips, they have to use Daikyo's so-calledÂ· adventure vouchers. The vouchers are not Japanese yen, although rumours to that effect have whipped around Cairns at various times. According to Daikyo's publicity blurb, the adventure vouchers: ... will be for exclusive use on all Great Adventures cruises and on Green and Fitzroy Island. You'll be able to buy anything you need from drinks and food to souvenirs to dive courseS with the vouchers. So you won't need cash. Adventure vouchers are equal in value to the Australian dollar. You'll be able to buy individual vouchers or books of vouchers. People can get a refund on any vouchers they have not spent at the end of their tropical sojourn. Cairns residents are asking why Great Adventures has introduced this money exchange system. I am not into conspiracy theories. There is no question of Daikyo taking over Australia or subverting our sovereignty. In my opinion, the only logical reason for Daikyo introducing the voucher system is that it makes money for the company. Successful corporations are dollar driven, and Daikyo is a very successful corporation. So one can only assume that the voucher system works to improve the corporation's profit notes margins, and this can only be at the expense tender throughof the consumer. Obviously, Daikyo hopes that its customers will leave with adventure vouchers still in their pockets or take the funny money home as a souvenir. One of the selling points of the voucher system is that the holders of the vouchers get a five per cent discount on all purchases. This strikes me as quite bizarre. If Daikyo has a monopoly control over pricing on the islands and people can buy goods or services only with adventure vouchers, the benefit of a five per cent discount seems rather illusory. Nevertheless, I have heard Cairns locals argue for the right to use Australian currency at the bar on Green Island, encouraged by other more gullible patrons to change their money so that they can get the fantastic five per cent discount. The locals in question decided to leave their drinks untouched on the bar rather than change their money. Such is the depth of local discontent with the voucher system that I will write to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) seeking advice on whether the adventure voucher system infringes any consumer protection laws. This brings me to the next big question constantly asked by Cairns residents: is the money exchange system legal? I. have received a copy of a standard response to this question from the Reserve Bank. The re- . sponse, which is truly worthy of Sir HUnlphrey, reads: The Governor has asked me to reply to your letter of 26 July concerning the use of purchase vouchers on a cruise to Green Island. Legal tender law relates only to the settlement of existing debts. Trades may specify the form in which they will accept settlement for their services or products before the 'contract' is entered into. For example, here in Sydney there are signs on the approaches to the Harbour Bridge saying that Ic, 2c and 5c coins will not be accepted in payment of the toll. We do not know the background to why the operators of some island resorts do not wish to handle Australian currency notes. They are, however, entitled to use their own voucher system if they wish, provided, of course, that they do not contravene the Reserve Bank Act, the Crimes (Currency) Act or any other legislation. The analogy with the Sydney Harbour Bridge toll misses the point completely. The toll is demanded in Australian currency. If Sydney drivers had to hand over bottle tops, monopoly money or adventure vouchers to a foreign owned corporation, the analogy would be meaningful. I am sure that regular bridge users in Sydney would be just as outraged as Cairns locals are about the Great Adventures voucher system. The last pl,lragraph of the letter from the Reserve Bank raises tJ:te question: just what contravenes the Reserve Bank Act, the Crimes (Currency) Act or any other legislation? Section 44(1) of the Reserve Bank Act under the heading, 'Other persons not to issue notes', states that 'a person shall not issue a bill or a note for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation'. The Crimes (Currency) Act is concerned mainly with making counterfeit money and counterfeit securities. I might also add that section 23 of the Currency Act 1965 is relevant here, but I do not think that I have time to quote that. I have written to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to get the definitive word on the legality of adventure vouchers, in view of the above acts and any other relevant acts. The people of Cairns are entitled to be fully. informed of the legal basis for such a locally contentious matter as the money exchange operated by Great Adventures-if the exchange is legal. I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that the money exchange system is illegal and I am not raising this matter in any way to discredit Daikyo. As I said earlier, Daikyo has been a huge contributor to the Cairns economy and is a big employer in the city. I have raised these matters because they understandably concern many of my constituents. I can assure members of this House that the subject has raged long and furious on Cairns talkback radio and in pubs and workplaces in the city. Cairns tour operators-I think the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) will back me up here-assured me that it is also a constant topic of conversation with visitors to the Great Barrier Reef. It is not stretching the point too much to say that, if not resolved, it has the potential to affect the image of Far North Queensland amongst potential domestic tourists. For these reasons, I believe that the matter should be clarified in the near future. Even if the practice of issuing these funny money notes is not illegal, I take the opportunity in this grievance debate to call on Daikyo to abandon its practice of using funny money consistent with its other actions as a good corporate citizen of Cairns and Far North Queensland. Question resolved in the affirmative. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS",72

April alluding to a defamation case. I informed the House that, while there was no issue of privilege involved in the complaint, I would take the opportunity to consider the application of the sub judice convention to the proceedings of the House. I said I would make a more detailed statement in due course. I wanted to review this matter because the sub jud'Ice convention is a very important one affecting, as it does, the rights of members of the House as well as the rights and interests of other citizens. I was concerned to ensure that, in times of considerable change in social and legal matters, members of the House did not find that the application of the sub judice convention in the House left them in any inferior position compared to ordinary citizens or media personnel. reviewed - he pra-tice of the House and that of the Untted Ktngdom House of Commons and having consid-red the attitude taken to contempt of court tn the form of comments on proceedings, I wish to spell out the key features of the convention as I believe it should be applied in the House in the present times. The application of the sub judice convention is subject to the discretion of the chair at Assemall times. The chair should always have regard to the basic rights and interests of members in being able to raise and discuss matters of concern in the House. Regard of needs to be had to the interests of persons and who may be involved in court proceedings and to the separation of responsibilities between the parliament and the judiciary. As a general rule, matters before the criminal courts should not be referred to from the time a person is charged until a sentence, if any, has been announced; and the restrictions should again apply if an appeal is lodged and to be of remain until the appeal is decided. As a general rule, matters before civil courts should not be referred to from the time are set down for trial or otherwise brought before the court and, similarly, the restriction should again be applied from the time an appeal is lodged until the appeal is In making decisions as to whether the convention should be invoked in particular cases, the chair should have regard to the likelihood of prejudice to proceedings being caused as a result of references in the House. Matters before royal commissions or other similar bodies which are concerned with the conduct of particular persons should not be referred to in proceedings if, in the opinion of the chair, there is a likelihood of prejudice being caused as a result of the references in the House. Matters before royal commissions or similar bodies dealing with broader issues of national importance should be able to be referred to in proceedings unless, in the opinion of the chair, there are circumstances which would justify the convention being invoked to restrict reference in the House. I will draw the attention of the Deputy Speaker, the Second Deputy Speaker and members of the Speakers Panel to this statement. The approach will, of course, apply in respect of the Main Committee as well as the House. NA Public Accounts Committee Membership",74

Privileges Committee Report",75
182,Mr SAWFORD,COMMITTEES,"I present , the report from the Committee of Privileges in connection with the matter referred to the committee by the House on 15 December 1993, Disruption o/mail services to members' electorate offices, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",76
183,Mr SAWFORD,COMMITTEES,"by leave- Mr Deputy Speaker, the report I have just presented concerns a reference given to the committee by the House following bans placed by members of the Communication Workers Union on the delivery of mail to the electorate offices of members. This matter was first raised by the honourable member for . Bennelong (Mr Howard). In addition, the Leader of the National Party (MrFischer) and the honourable members for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and Braddon (Mr Miles) made representations to the Speaker concerning the bans. In the course of its inquiry on this matter my committee received submissions from the national secretary of the Communication Workers Union, from the Leader .ofÂ· the National Party, and from the honourable member for Adelaide. In addition, oral evidence was received from the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). We were grateful to those members who made submissions. The key facts in this matter were not in dispute: commencing on 8 December 1993 the delivery of mail to the electorate offices of a number of members ceased. Further, it is not disputed that this arose as a result of decisions taken by members of the Communication Workers Union. Each of the members who put views to the committee outlined the effect of the industrial action on the work of their electorate offices. An important point was made by the honourable member for Indi, who made it clear that his concerns were riot so much about any effects of the bans on him in a. personal sense but rather that ordinary citizens were deprived of the ability to communicate with their elected representatives.  Communication Workers Union, advised the committee that the action taken by his uriion was not intended as, or taken in the knowledge of it being considered as, a breach of privilege. He said that the union 'had expressfact ed dismay' at the cabinet decision in relation to an Industry Commission inquiry into mail services. He said that the union initially contemplated widespread industrial action which would have caused great public disruption during the pre-Christmas period. The union had subsequently decided on a more limited form of action which would have an impact and demonstrate the level of concern amongst its membership. The union stated that it was believed that members were not fully aware of the consequences of the government decision, and it was felt that the union action would bring the concerns home in a meaningful way. The committee has been satisfied that the ability of a number of members to perform what they accepted as their duties to constituents was impeded as a result of the actions complained of. As it happens, the committee is not aware of any particular case of what may be regarded as a substantial harm or damage was caused to a member of to any constituent, but it is clear that the bans had the potential to cause a serious problem. The committee recognises, as a predecessor committee did several years ago, that: The realities of political and public life are such that members from time to time are subjected to various forms of inconvenience or irritation as a consequence of being members of parliament. The difficulty is to distinguish between what may be regarded as reasonable or acceptable forms of expression and protest and those which go beyond this and constitute harassment or obstruction of members in the discharge of their duties. In our view, actions such as the bans in question go beyond what the House should be prepared to tolerate. These particular actions have caused inconvenience to members and to ordinary citizens and do not represent an acceptable means of expression of concern. In the present case the committee has found that although it would be open to it to makeadverse findings in respect of those responsible, it has not done so, having regard to the apparent ignorance of the relevant law on the part of those responsible, to the apparent absence of any intention to offend, and to the that the disruption caused was of a limited duration. I commend the report to the House. It deals with a difficult but important issue.",76
184,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As a member of the Privileges Committee, I endorse the report which the chairman of the committee has just tabled. There are some elements of the question of parliamentary privilege and its particular application in the case covered by the report to which I would like to refer. The principle contained within the institution of parliamentary privilege is an extremely important one. Contrary to those who believe it has reached its use-by date, it continues to fulfil an essential role within our system of parliamentary democracy and a fundamentally important role to make it possible for people iri this chamber and in the other chamber to take up those issues which they, in conscience, believe it is their responsibility to take up and to be beholden to no-one, except perhaps to the parliament itself. However, the principle of parliamentary privilege will survive only while it is respected by parliamentarians and the parliament. It can survive only if it is not abused and if it is not used as a vehicle to provide protections for parliament and parliamentarians which are outside the narrow focus of its purposes and which are not available to other members of the community. The circumstances addressed by this report of the Privileges Committee concembans which were imposed by the Communication Workers Union on the delivery of mail to and dispatch of mail from the offices of members of parliament in December 1993. The issues involved in this matter go to the heart of parliamentary privilege and the question of how it should be interpreted and applied. The casual interpretation of 'privilege' by the House of Representatives, by successive officers of the House and in House of Representatives Practice has allowed it to assume a wider meaning than it has within either the House of Commons or within our own legislation-the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. House of Representatives Practice on page 685 states: Parliamentary privilege relates to the special rights and immunities which belong to the Parliament, its Members and others, which are considered essential for the operation of the Parliament. These rights and immunities allow the Parliament to meet and carry out its proper constitutional role, for Members to discharge their responsibilities to their constituents and for others properly involved in the Parliamentary process to carry out their duties and responsibilities without obstruction or fear of prosecution. Privileges are not the prerogative of Members in their personal capacities. . There are three important points to note about that statement. Firstly, for 'members', the reference is to their 'responsibilities'; Secondly, for 'others', the reference is to their 'duties and responsibilities'. Thirdly, privileges are not the prerogative of members in their personal capacities. Another very significant element ofÂ· the statement is that while the legislators in the Parliamentary Privileges Act use the term 'members' duties' the authors of House of Representatives Practice have chosen to use the less rigid and more embracing term 'members' responsibil itiesÂ·. The House of Commons has always adopted a more restricted interpretation of privilege and contempt than that which the House of Representatives has chosen to adopt. In the House of Commons, care has always been taken to ensure that there is a connection between any action complained of and-I underline the next word-proceedings in the House or a committee. If there is no such connection, the matter is taken no further. Thus, in a case like the postal ban issue, it would never have been referred to the House of Commons committee of privileges. The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, which is quite explicit in its reference to privilege, states: Conduct (including the use ofÂ· words) does not constitute an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the full exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the full performance by a Member of the Member's duties as a Member. Thus, we have enshrined in legislation a wider interpretation of privilege than that ever adopted in practice by the House of Commons. That is perfectly legitimate except that the interpretation of privilege now hangs on the meaning of 'member's duties'. In this context it is important to note, firstly, that the legislation refers to the full performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. Thus, it does not have to be generalised conduct affecting all members; it can and does include conduct which affects the full performance of any single member's duties. Secondly, it also includes the reference to the 'member's duties as a member'. Thirdly, it does not use the expression 'responsibilities' but the much more restrictive expression 'duties'. How then can we interpret 'member's duties'? 'Duties' may be either moral duties or legal duties. I believe that we must dispense with moral duties from inclusion in the protection of privilege, because all members would see their moral duties as members differently. The Parliamentary Privileges Act states that for conduct against a member to constitute an offence it must interfere with the full performance of a member's duties. I underline and emphasise the phrase 'a member's duties'. May states that the 'House will proceed against those who obstruct members in the discharge of their responsibilities to the House'. I underline and emphasise the word 'will'. Taking those two references together, the inclusion of 'moral duties' in the interpretation of 'duties' would mean that the House would be required to act whenever the moral duties of any single member were obstructed. Some actions which some members may see as their 'moral duties' as a member of parliament have included, or could include, illegally trespassing on Commonwealth property to protest against nuclear arms issues; illegally committing acts to prevent damage to the environment or to prevent certain developments; and attending religious services, political meetings and social activities of various kinds. Would or should we consider any 'conduct' which is 'likely to amount' to an improper interference with the 'full performance by a member' of his or her moral duties as a breach of privilege in connection with which the 'House will proceed against those who obstruct members'? Clearly not; the proposition is absurd. Thus, the interpretation of 'member's duties' is clearly intended to relate, and can only be interpreted as relating, to a member's legal duties. There are at least two legal duties of a member which immediately come to mind: to attend sittings of the House; and to provide a statement of registrable interests to the registrar. There are probably others. In connection with the postal ban imposed on members of parliament by the Communications Workers Union, it must be realised that it is not a legal duty for members to receive mail; it is not a legal duty for members to read or otherwise process mail; and it is not a legal duty for members to reply to correspondence. Clearly, all sensible and conscientious members will do these things and many others in fulfilling their responsibilities or functions, but they are not legal duties of members. Successive Speakers of the House of Representatives have placed their own interpretations on what constitutes or contributes towards a breach of privilege. In 1978, the Speaker concluded that a strike which affected the whole of Canberra and was not directed solely at the parliament did not constitute a primaÂ· facie case of breach of privilege. In 1985, the Acting Speaker concluded that union bans affecting all mail and which did not subject members to particular action in their capacity asÂ· members did not constitute a prima facie case of breach of privilege. On 15 December 1993, the present Speaker said that, on information available to him, the postal ban was directed specifically at members and would have been affecting their capacity to perform their duties as members. The Speaker concluded that a prima facie case did exist. As I have said, the fact that the bans were directed specifically at members should have been, on the basis of both practice and law, of no consequence. I have disputed whether interference with members' mail would affect their capaCity to perform their legal duties. Members of the House of Representatives have sought to widen the protection available to them under 'privilege'. They can only do this by expanding the interpretation of 'duties' or extending it in less subtle ways. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) raised the issue of the postal ban in the House of Representatives on 13 December 1993. He suggested that it seemed to him to Â·be a clear breach of privilege, presumably supported by the fact that the ban was directed specifically against members of parliament. However, action under neither the provisions of privilege nor contempt requires or is assisted by any singling out of members. The letter of the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) dated 25 January 1994 to the chairman of the Committee of Privileges gave reasons why the postal ban may have involved breaches of the Australian Postal Corporation Act and the Commonwealth Crimes Act. However, apart from quite legitimate concerns about 'democratic process', 'improper' action, 'inappropriate' industrial action, unanswered mail and Christmas deadlines, there. is not substantial for the claim that her legal duties as a member of parliament were improperly interfered with. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) wrote to the Committee of Privileges and detailed the actions of his office in relation to the ban. He said that a large amount of mail was delayed in the critical pre-Christmas period. He said that the ban was a 'restriction on electors' access to members of parliament and, as such, restricted members of parliament from carrying out their duties on behalf of electors'. Although the honourable member used the word 'duties', he also gave it a wide meaning. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) gave oral evidence to the committee. He indicated that he was more concerned about the effect of the ban on his constituents than any inconvenience it may have caused him. He said that it involved 'grossly improper pressure' on MPs to influence policy. He said that. he thought 'a parliament should, through the process of its privileges committee, stand up for people'. He expressed concerns about the rights of private citizens, especially in the context of communicating with their elected representatives. He said he considered it his duty 'as an elected member of parliament to respond to mail'. While the concerns of the honourable member would probably be shared by all MPs, it is doubtful whether they are best addressed via the principle of parliamentary privilege. There appears little doubt that a more conscious effort needs to be taken to ensure that the protection afforded members of parliament by parliamentary privilege is not expanded consciously, unconsciously or by default to the point where it is considered to be breached simply because a member's capacity to fulfil an accepted function is deliberately interfered with. It is quite clear that the term 'a member's duties as a member' needs to be clarified and defined .. We should not allow its meaning to be progressively extended in an ad hoc and piecemeal. way simply to satisfy the wishes of members to expand the shield of parliamentary privilege for their own comfort, security support and protection.

186,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"-On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fifth report of the committee for 1994 relating to the construction of an Australian Embassy complex in Hanoi, Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Ordered that the report be printed.",80
187,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report which I have just tabled refers to the proposed construction of an Australian Embassy complex in Hanoi, Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The proposal includes a new chancery, a head of mission residence, staff apartments and recreational facilities. The estimated cost of that the project is $23.605 million at March 1994 prices. The current Australian Embassy in Hanoi consists of a two-storey French style villa used as a chancery, adjoining villas on either side and a purpose built block of staff apartments. There is also a swimming pool and a recreation area. One of the two adjoining villas is the ambassador's residence and the other contains staff apartments. The chancery was first occupied in 1978 and the two adjoining buildings were occupied in 1991 after extensive renovations. Although the chancery building has been extensively renovated by Australian tradespeople and completely rewired, maintenance of the building remains a constant problem. The chancery is unfortunately already too small for current requirements and will be converted into a senior staff apartment as part of this proposal. The Overseas Property Group has accorded the Hanoi project a high priority among proposed capital works projects because of the inadequacy of both the office and residential accommodation. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .endorses the of the new custom built chancery and the official residence as it believes it will make an invaluable contribution to promote Ausdiplomatic tralia's identity in Vietnam and will demona strate Australia's firm commitment to develassociated oping a substantial long-term relationship Vietnam. The lifting of the United States economic and trade embargos against Vietnam has developed opened the way for resumption of lending to that country by the international financial institutions and major bilateral donors Japan. These developments will stimulate economic growth in Vietnam, and this will bring increasing commercial opportunities Australian companies. This will place increasclaimed ing demands on the Australian Embassy Hanoi which is already operating at what can only be described as beyond full stretch servicing the current level of relations. In addition to a new chancery and official residence, it is proposed to construct storey apartment block. The existing staff accommodation is below standard and there is a lack of appropriate alternative accommoexpected. dation available on the open market. Where residential accommodation is obtainable, extensive refurbishment is required. However, refurbishment costs are high and even the accommodation may still be substandard after refurbishment has been completed. The construction struction of well-built accommodation within the chancery compound will enhance the physical security of staff while also providing for emergency power and filtered water supthat, plies. There will also be significant savings in the long term to the Commonwealth resulting from rental savings and lower maintenance costs. Hanoi has few recreational facilities available for staff. There are no clubs and there are very few sporting facilities of a suitable standard for casual hire. The present chancery compound has a small recreational area with a swimming pool. The recreational facilities in the new complex will include a tennis court, swimming pool and squash court. The committee is satisfied that these facilities are fully justified in Hanoi which the committee was advised is an extremely difficult living construction and working environment. The site for the complex is located in an area of Hanoi which is being developed as a enclave and aiready accommodates number of diplomatic missions and their residential apartments. The comwith mittee was initially somewhat surprised to discover that the site is currently part of a small freshwater lake as indeed are all nonsites in this area. The site, which will be reclaimed, has an area of 1.17 hectares and will be leased from the Vietnamese such as government for a period of 60 years. The committee sought an assurance from the Overseas Property Group that the confor struction of the embassy complex on reland would not present difficulties. in The Overseas Property Group advised the committee that it believed that the site would in be suitable although further geotechnical advice will be sought and there could be a cost loading for the extensive piling system a fourrequired. The Overseas Property Group advised the committee that the presence of unexploded ordnance on the site was not However, the committee has recommended that a metal detector survey of the site should be undertaken before construction commences as a precaution against the posbest sible presence of unexploded ordnance. While the committee welcomes the conof this project, it is fair to say that the committee is somewhat disappointed with the design of t-e complex. The committee was advised by the Overseas Property Group in large measure, the design was influ.enced by the characteristics of the local building industry in Hanoi which has a combination of comparatively cheap and unskilled labour with a high work ethic-it sounds like my own area! The industry is labour intensive, with minimal mechanical equipment being .available. Therefore, all proposed embassy buildings will be simple in form and structure to make allowances for the local building industry both in relation to short-term construction requirements and longer term maintenance factors. One difficulty that we as a committee face when we come to pontificate on such buildings is that it is almost a fait accompli before we receive the plan. We receive the proposed building plan and we do not have a chance, at this stage, to have an input into the design of the building. To achieve the necessary building quality it will be essential that expatriate trade and specialist services supervision form part of the construction program. All imported materials will come through the port of Haiphong which could become an area of delay to the project as trade activity increases. While the committee understands and accepts the practical constraints which led to the design solution for the Hanoi complex, it does not believe that the design reflects the positive and dynamic image which Australia should be projecting in Asia. The committee is of the view that the Overseas Property Group should hold a design competition when a project of this nature is being developed in future. The committee believes that the Overseas Property Group does not have an underlying design philosophy which would enable its architectural consultants to express a sense of an Australian identity in building projects. The committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group should develop such an underlying design philosophy. There must be many architects who would be only too willing to submit a design for a proposed Australian Embassy with the prestige associated with such a work in many parts of the world. I personally wonder what the architect is trying to achieve with this fairly pedestrian complex. I know that design is often an individual issue. Our embassies around the world and our chanceries are a mishmash of designs. Few reflect an Australian image. I think a couple of the better ones are the Beijing complex and the building under construction in Suva. These buildings are fine but many of the others leave a lot to be desired. This building that we are now recommending to this parliament is like something out of the 1950s. We were told by the architect and by the Overseas Property Group that we were not to be too ostentatious, overelaborate or overprestigious. We most certainly have achieved that. It is a breezeblock building like something out of the 1950s. It is a very plain building but, I guess, it is a functional building. It will add absolutely nothing to the architectural merit of Hanoi and Australia's image. This is very important for us, especially in countries like Vietnam where more and more Australian companies are going and tendering for buildings. We were told that the friendship bridge was an example of what Australian concrete companies could achieve. I dread to think what image we will present to people who see the new embassy complex in Hanoi. We are not asking for an overelaborate building, but we are asking for something a little more updated than the 1950s and something that would portray the sort of image of Australia that I thought we as a parliament were trying to project in Asia. Following recent construction experience in Beijing, Jakarta and Phnom Penh, and in order to achieve the desired project quality, it is envisaged that a considerable number of Australian trade and specialist supervisory personnel will be employed during the construction phase. The successful contractor will be required to specify and use Australian products wherever possible. Australian manufactured furniture will be used throughout all bUildings. Overseas Property Group expects that the material components will be 80 per cent Australian content. As I indicated earlier, the total cost of the project is $23.605 million. However, it is interesting to note that there will be no impact on the budget as funds will be made available from the sale of properties in Singapore. Overseas Property Group advised the committee that the sale of the properties in Singapore will also finance the construction of a chancery in Islamabad, the refurbishment of Australia House in London, the purchase of land for housing in Shanghai and also the construction of a modem residence for the Australian High Commissioner in Singapore. I am only hopeful that Overseas Property Group gets as much money for the sale as it thinks it is going to get. In view of the difficulties likely to be experienced in the construction of the project, the committee sought an assurance from Overseas Property Group that the cost of the project would not rise significantly, as was the case in Beijing. Overseas Property Group stated that, unlike the BeijingÂ· project, an Australian project manager would be appointed with Overseas Property Group taking control of the project from the initial stages. In Beijing, Overseas Property Group was tied to a Chinese construction company and also did not have direct control of the project. I commend the report to the House. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration of Senate Message Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate insists upon the requested amendments disagreed to by the House, as indicated in schedule A; and has made the amendments as indicated in schedule B.",80
188,Mr SPEAKER,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,"It is my duty as Speaker to draw the attention of the House to the constitutional question this message involves. When similar circumstances have arisen in the past, Speakers of all persuasions have advised the House of the constitutional principles involved, and the House has invariably endorsed their statements. The message purports to repeat the requests for amendments contained in message No. 266 which the House rejected at its sitting on 30 May 1994. The House of Representatives has never accepted that the Senate has a right to repeat and thereby press or insist on a request for an amendment in a bill which the Senate may not amend .. The question as to the justiciability of the Senate purportedly pressing a request by repetition is uncertain. It is, however, a matter of constitutional propriety as between the houses, based on the provisions of sections 53 to 57 of the constitution. Legal opinions supporting the argument that the constitution does not empower the Senate to press a request have been advanced by Quick and GaITan, who were intimately involved in the development of the constitution, and by eminent constitutional lawyers, past and present. Respectfully, I agree with the opinions but do not propose to repeat the arguments which are summarised in House of Representatives Practice at pages 447-51. Copies of the relevant extracts from House of Representatives Practice have been circulated to members in the chamber. It rests with the House as to whether it will consider message No. 289 in so far as it purports to press the requests that were contained in message No. 266. Motion (by Mr Free) agreed to: That(I) the House endorses the statement of the Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by message No. 289 transmitted by the Senate in relation to the Student Assistance Amendment 8iI1 1994; (2) the House refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights in respect of Senate message No. 289; and (3) the message be considered forthwith. Senate s requested amendments No. 1Clause 2, page 2, after subclause (4), insert the following subclause: ""(4A) Item 12A of the Schedule is taken to have commenced on I January 1994."". No. 2Schedule, page 5, after item 12, insert the following item: ""12A. After section 7 in Part 2: Insert: Concession to parental assets test '8. In determining what benefit is payable under this Part, a parental assets test is not to be applied in the calculation of a student's living allowance if the parent is entitled to a Health Care Card issued by the Department of Social Security for the purposes of the National Health Act 1953.'."".",83
189,Mr FREE,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (5.55 p.m.)-I move: That the requested amendments be not made. It is not my intention to further canvass the issues raised in opposition to the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994. Let me make it quite clear that the government insists on disagreeing with the requested amendments presented to this House for the second time by a message from the Senate. If agreed to, these requests for amendments would have the effect of virtually removing the assets test from Austudy, cause a financial burden upon the people of the nation and enshrine in legislation inequities which the government will not accept. I ask the House to again reject the requested amendments.",84
190,Mr ANDREWS,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,"In relation to the requests for amendments from the Senate to the Student Assistance Amendment Bill, the coalition is opposed to the course which has been elaborated by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) briefly this afternoon because we believe they, in effect, will seek to hold the government to a commitment it made to the Australian people, and to students across this country, in the budget of last year and in documentation which arose from that budget. In a sense, when one looks at this matter one can quite clearly see that there was a commitment made by the government at that time. I will briefly touch on the background to this matter. This matter arose from last year's budget and from statements which were made in a series of documents pursuant to that budget that, in effect, if a person held a health care card then, so far as the assets test under Austudy was concerned, that assets test would be waived. This statement, or this commitment, on behalf of the government was made on at least four occasions. The first occasion was in a departmental budget kit for student assistance after last year's budget. This kit clearly set it out in these terms: From 1994, special assessment will be extended students whose parents hold a current health card. Such students will qualify for Austudy without parental income and assets test. In other words, if you are the holder of a health care card which does not carry with it an assets test you would be able to obtain Austudy without that assets test as well. That statement in the kit was followed by a media release from the Department of Employment, Education and Training on 13 September last year, which stated: Effective January 1, t 994 students from families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for maximum AUSTUDY entitlements, with means and assets tests waived. This measure is especially beneficial to low income families which are not on Department of Social Security or Veterans' Affairs benefits. Clearly, a statement from the Department of Employment, Education and Training has set out the same information-namely, that the holder of a health care card will qualify for Austudy and that the assets test would otherwise be waived. So on two occasions, in two documents officially from the department, this commitment has been made. Following those documents there was the release of the 1994 Austudy guide. The 1994 Austudy guide is a glossy publication which is published jointly by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the National Union of Students. In numerous places in this glossy publication, this official guide to students-and their parents around Australia-seeking to apply for Austudy, information is set out to the effect that, once again, holders of health care cards will have the assets test waived. One of the paragraphs in the Austudy guide states: From t 994 the assets of both you and your spouse generally will not be counted if your spouse holds a Health Care Card. So on the third piece of documentation from the department we have a clear indication of the government's commitment. Finally, if when going through the Austudy application form people tick 'yes' when it comes to indicating whether they hold a health care card, they miss having to provide any information required in relation to assets. On the face of the application form for Austudy, to holders of health. care cards do not have to care provide information relating to their assets. That supports the documentation previously released by the department. This was the situation up until early February of this year. On 7 February some of the student assistant offices around the country, and parents and students who had applied to Austudy pursuant to this provision, found out that, where the assets test had not previously been complied with, that would no longer be the case. The first public indication of this was a report in the Australian of 15 February of this year. I mention it because it quite clearly shows the minister making a response to this matter that differs from his response this afternoon and on previous occasions. The report, headed 'Austudy rethink may hit farmers', states: A spokesman for Mr Free said yesterday an ""administrative contradiction"" between the Department of Social Security and DEET had occurred and that some people applying for Austudy benefits might have been affected. That indicates that there is some administrative contradiction between the Department of Social Security and DEET. The report goes on to quote the spokesman for the minister. It says: ""The Government intends to honour its policy but at this stage it is not clear whether it can-this will takeÂ· a few days to sort out,"" the spokesman said. In the first public response to this matter we have a spokesman for the minister saying that 'the government intends to honour its policy'. What is the policy or the commitment that has been set out in no less than four documents emanating from the Department of Employment, Education and Training? On the face of those documents, it is that, for the Â·purposes of Austudy applications,the assets test is waived for holders of a health care card. As the minister indicated this afternoon, that situation has now been reversed. We have had indications on various occasions that the cost of this would be something from $25 miIlion down to $10 million. We are not sure what the cost is. We have had indications from Senator Schacht in the Senate that only 100 students might be affected yet, as the National Farmers Federation pointed out in September of last year, the statistics do not give an accurate indication of the numbers of rural people who would like to undertake further education but who are unable to because of the government's policy on asset testing. We do not actually know how many are concerned, yet the minister said again today that this is somehow going to blow a hole in the budget so far as DEET is concerned. If $10 million were involved, one could probably find considerable savings from within DEET itself that would cover that amount of money. If we look at the DEET budget for this year and in previous years we see that this is a department which continues to expand. This is the department of government which, when questioned in Senate estimates earlier this year, could not actually indicate where one of its divisions had gone-it had been lost. We have continual expansion in the numbers of public servants employed by that department each year. In the midst of the rural crises that we have around this country-floods, fires and droughts over much of the country over the past few years-this measure, which was seen by farmers and others in rural areas as beneficial, is being ripped away from them by the government. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was recently off on his latest tango in Paris, yet here is the minister saying, 'There is about $10 miIlion here which we cannot make up in some way in the department.' I suggest to the minister that $10 million worth of waste in the Department of Employment, Education and Training would not be too difficult to find. The history of this is that,first of alI, the matter was treated secretly. It was almost a month before the minister came into this chamber and made some statement about the matter, even though the student assistant offices around the country had been indicating to students that they would no longer be able to qualify for Austudy without the assets test, even if they held the health care card. It was a month before we had any clear indication that this was what had happened. Then we had the excuse from the government that it was some 'administrative contradiction', to quote the spokesperson for the minister at that particular time, and that therefore it was something that should simply be overlooked, even though it was quite clear that at least some families around Australia would be adversely affected. The department will admit to a minimum of 100 families being affected, although there are quite clear indications that many more families are affected by this measure. Therefore, it is something that is of real concern to many farming families. My office has had reports and telephone calls from families in various parts of Australabout is saying that this has made a clear difference to their ability to provide education for sons and daughters, particularly those wanting to obtain higher education at both higher seconpolicy dary and tertiary levels. The effect of this measure is that those students who have are obtained Austudy with the health care cardhow that is, without qualifying under the assets test-will lose that qualification after their health care card runs out. Normally, health care cards run out after a period of six months unless they are renewed. There is a situation of real injustice for those families. We have hundreds of other families across Australia who relied upon what they saw ment from the government to recognise their particular difficulties being ripped away from them. Therefore, as I indicated to the minister the outset of my contribution to this debate, we on this side of the House will not accede to his motion. We believe that this is a microcosm of Labor's approach to public policy generally because it illustrates one two things. It demonstrates either inept ministration, if we believe what the minister says about this-even though what he says seems quite contrary to the first response from the department-or, more likely, a reversal of a commitment that was clearly given to the Australian people. When one looks beyond the rhetoric to the government's lack of commitment to rural and regional Australia, one can see that this has been illustrated once again in this particular motion before the House. We had the situation last year where the same goveplment was moving to take 16and 17-year-olds off Austudy and put them onto family payments. The effect of that would have been a saving to Treasury overall, a reduction in the amount of Austudy that many of those kids would have received, a reduction in the weekly amounts, a reduction in the income test and a reduction in the assets test as well. I think this is just another example of the way in which rural and regional students are being treated by this particular government. It does not matter what the government says its policy; it does not matter what platitudes are spouted around the country: what one has to look at is the a-tual policy and the actual practice to determine what its is. Here are two illustrations of what its actual policy is. No matter what platitudes spouted in this place or in the bush about it cares and is concerned for students in rural Australia, the sad fact is that for those who come from a rural part of Australia, their educational opportunities are much less than they would be in metropolitan urban areas. That is a fact documented by a series of . studies, not least of which was the 1991 report of the National Board of Employment, as a commitEducation and Training. If we are looking at policy, not the policy that is spoken about in platitudes in this place but the policy which is actually practised by at the Labor Party in relation to rural students around this country, we see in these two illustrations and in this motion before the House tonight an attitude towards rural and regional students that says that in some ways of they are not to be treated equally with stuaddents from other parts of the country. This is a government which has in other areas implemented affirmative action programs in order to raise some people and some sectors of the community so they can be treated as equal, yet here we have clearly documented evidence about the inequality in terms of educational opportunities and educational outcomes for students in the bush in Australia. The bush people regarded this measure to be to their benefit, particularly in times as harsh as at present, yet the government after six months ripped away what was regarded as a commitment to theseÂ· people. The message to people in the bush from this government in relation to this particular motion is, 'Forget educational opportunity. We simply are not interested in it.' If the government offers platitudes in the future and says, 'We are interested and we are out to give you a fair go,' people in the bush should look back on the record, look back on this motion tonight, look back on the passage of this legislation and look back on what the government tried to do in relation to 16and 17-year olds with Austudy. That record speaks loudly.",84
191,Mr FREE,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (6.10 p.m.)-In response to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), this issue has been discussed a number of times in this chamber. I simply reiterate that the policy was quite clear in terms of the cabinet decision on this matter. The cabinet decision embraced the income test but not the assets test for health care cardholders. The honourable member for Menzies is wrong and he knows he is wrong when he perpetuates that fiction. Secondly, this is far from a matter of discriminating against families or young people living in regional or rural Australia. In MCLeay, L. B. fact, to do what the opposition is, asking would be to make a special case of that group by making the assets test inapplicable for that group only in Austudy applications. Finally, if this is such a good idea, as opposition members are now saying, I wonder why it was not included in their policy last year. If one reads Fightback, one will find no mention at all of the removal of the assets test for Austudy purposes for farming families. Indeed, if one reads Fightback one will find Abbott, A. J. only a proposal to remove some 30,000 . Anderson, J. D. students from Austudy to save an estimated Andrews, K. J. $30 million. I find it interesting that these Bishop, B. K. matters are still being attended to by the Cadman, A. G. former shadow minister. Apparently his Cobb, M. R. successor, who certainly has had time to get Evans, R. D. C. across this issue, does not approach it with Fischer, T. A. the same enthusiasm as the honourable memGallus, C. A. ber for Menzies.

Second Reading",87
192,Mr TICKNER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (6.21 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will recall that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 was substantially amended during 1993 to give effect to the recommendations arising from the review of the act by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC. One of the more significant changes was the - tablishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority-the TSRA-which is to exercise ATSIC powers and functions with respect to Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal persons in the Torres Strait area. The TSRA will commence operation on 1 July this year. This bill will extend the powers of the TSRA to: enable the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function on the TSRA; to enable the minister to confer commission functions on the TSRA; NOES to give the TSRA the power to negotiate, cooperate and enter into agreements with other Commonwealth bodies and with state, territory and local government bodies and to make grants and loans to the state of Queensland and its authorities, including local government authorities; and to allow the TSRA to use moneys in the TSRA land and resources fund for the development and implementation of the marine strategy referred to in the Torres Strait PAIRS development plan, or in developing or maintaining real estate, or in acquiring an interest in land. The bill will allow the minister, by notice in the Gazette, to increase the number of members on the TSRA from the current ceiling of 20 to a maximum of 23. The bill also allows the minister, at his or her discretion, to make rules for the conduct of elections in the Torres Strait area or in any part of the Torres Strait area by a system of wards, including the power to prescribe the maximum number of members per ward. Two other amendments relate to the zone election rules and clarify when elections for regional councils, commissioners, the TSRA and any other election are completed for the purposes of filing election petitions. I tum now to the major provisions of the bill. Amendments relating to the Torres Strait Regional Authority Clause 7 enables the Prime Minister to confer departmental functions on the TSRA and the minister to confer a function of the commission on the TSRA. These amendments are necessary as the TSRA will, from 1 July this year, exercise ATSIC powers and functions in the Torres Strait and as ATSIC will no longer operate in the Torres Strait area. Clauses 8 and 9 give the TSRA the power to negotiate and cooperate with other Commonwealth, state, territory and local government bodies and to enter into agreements and make grants and loans to the state of Queensland or an authority of that state, including local government bodies. These powers are essential for the TSRA to be able to operate independently from ATSIC in the Torres Strait area, particularly as the island councils, which will be major beneficiaries of TSRA funding, are local authorities. Currently the Torres Strait Regional Council, in accordance with a notice issued pursuant to section 116 of the act, consists of 20 members, constituted as follows: 18 members elected under the Queensland Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984-1990 to represent particular communities in the Torres Strait area; and two members elected under the ATSIC Act to represent particular communities in the Torres Strait area. On 1 July 1994 the Torres Strait Regional Authority will be constituted in exactly the same way as the Torres Strait Regional Council. Those persons elected in March this year will automatically become members of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. In November last year, I commissioned a review of the constitution and electoral process of the Torres Strait Regional Council. The review was conducted by Professor Jeremy Beckett, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Sydney, as chairperson, and Pastor Allan Mosby of Thursday Island, who is a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The review committee expressed concern at the lack of representation given to Thursday Island in proportion to its population. Its report states that, according to the 1991 census, Thursday Island has approximately 35 per cent of the Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal population in the Torres Strait but is currently represented by only two of 20 regional councillors. . Clause 12 allows the Minister for Aborigi. nal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, by notice in the Gazette, to increase the number of members on the TSRA from the current ceiling of 20 to a maximum of 23 members. Such a notice would be subject to parliamentary disallowance. If the minister decides to change the number of members of the TSRA, clause 12A allows the minister to amend a notice under 142S to provide for any additional members and the method and timing of their election. I have reconvened the review committee to conduct further consultations with the Torres Strait Regional Council, the island coordinating council and Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal organisations on Thursday Ishmd as to the extent of any increase in the number of members on the TSRA and whether the increased number will represent Thursday Island as a whole or particular communities or wards on Thursday Island. Subject to the advice of the review committee and the passage of these amendments by the parliament, I propose that a supplementary election be conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission as soon as possible after the enabling legislation is assented to. Clause 13 enables the minister to make rules for the conduct of TSRA elections by a system of wards. It should be noted that the provisions allow for maximum flexibility so that rules can be made for the conduct of elections in the Torres Strait area or in any part of the Torres Strait area by a system of wards. It should also be noted that TSRA election rules, including rules for the conduct of elections by a system of wards, can only be made by the minister after consulting the TSRA and the Australian Electoral Commission. Clauses 14 to 23 are consequential to the amendment providing for wards in the Torres Strait area. Clause 25 broadens the scope of the TSRA land and resources fund. The provision in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Act (No.3) 1993 establishing the TSRA land and resources fundarea through section 144W-stipulates that moneys in the fund may only be spent in making grants for the acquisition of land and in acquiring land. However, because the Torres Strait is essentially a marine environment, the purposes for which moneys in the fund may be spent should be broadened to include development and ongoing maintenance of real property, including improvements to such property and the development of marine resources in accordance with the marine strategy to be contained in the Torres Strait development plan. Amendments Relating to Zone Election Rules Clause 4 varies the current provisions of the act which require that zone elections, including supplementary elections, must be conducted under the rules in force at the end of the election period for the preceding round of regional council elections. The bill provides that a supplementary zone election must be conducted in accordance with the rules in force immediately before the day on which the minister fixes the last day for the close the poll for the supplementary election. A supplementary election is defined as a zone election held to fill a casual vacancy in the office of commissioner representing the zone or a zone election held in place of a zone election in relation to which the Federal Court of Australia has made an order under schedule 4. Clearly, it is proper that any supplementary election be held under the rules in force at time the minister calls such an election. The rules in force for a nonnal round of zone elections following a round of regional council elections will continue to be those rules force at the end of the election period for the preceding round of regional council elections. End of Election Period for Zone and Other Election Purposes Clause 30 amends schedule 4 of the act to provide when petitions may be lodged with the Federal Court of Australia in respect of a round of regional council elections, a round of zone elections, a Torres Strait Regional Authority election for all the wards and for any other election. CUiTently, section 140 provides that schedule 4 applies where there is a dispute in relation to a regional council election or a zone election. Item 3(e) of schedule 4 provides that subject to clause 5, which deals with petitions by the AEC, every election petition shall be filed in a registry of the court within 40 days after the end of the election period. The ATSIC act does not stipulate what the end of the election period is in relation to a zone election. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that the act should be amended to indicate clearly the meaning of paragraph 3(e) of schedule 4 in relation to elections subject to challenge by virtue of section 140 of the ATSIC Act. Clause 30 of the bill expressly provides that any petition disputing an election, whether a general election or a supplementary election, must be filed in a registry of the Federal Court within 40 days after the last day on which a poll is declared. The bill contains non-controversial but essential provisions for the efficient and effective operations of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, provides for supplemenof tary zone elections under rules which are current at the time of the election and clarifies the commencement dates for petition periods for all elections conducted under the act. I commend the bill to the House and I hope it will be passed with the same degree of crossparty support as has accompanied amendments to the ATSIC Act while I have been the minister.",88
193,Mrs GALLUS,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Hindmarsh) (6.33 p.m.)the The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994 extends the authority of the Torres Strait Regional Authority which comes into operation this in Friday, 1 July 1994. The Torres Strait Regional Authority was established under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.3) 1993 with the support of the coalition. The official launching of the authority will be held on Thursday Island on Friday. It will be with great pleasure that I attend this historic event. In the words of the chainnan of the Torres Strait Regional Council, who will now be the chainnan of the authority, the authority will empower Torres Strait Islander people to take control of their destiny and to detennine the future of their children. The amendments in this bill will allow the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function on the Torres Strait Regional Authority and the minister to confer a departmental function of ATSIC on the authority. These amendments were necessary so that from 1 July this year the authority will be able to exercise full ATSIC functions in the Torres Strait. Torres Strait Islanders comprise one of Australia's most isolated peoples, separated by sea from one another and separated by vast distances from the rest of Australia. They have few of the services and amenities taken for granted by most other Australians and nonnal opportunities for advancement are limited. Only recently a fundamental weakness of Labor's approach to Torres Strait Islanders has been its failure to recognise the unique civilisation of islanders and their need, living in a distant region of Australia, to manage their own affairs. The 1993 bill gave the Torres Strait Regional Authority authority to take over ATSIC functions. It is appropriate that indigenous organisations shape government policy, manage government programs and make funding decisions with regard to the communities they represent. The islanders have their own traditions and languages, they have their own legends of origin and they have a distinct cultural history. For thousands of years they were and they still are a seafaring people and the relationship between the islanders and the sea is a key one. Not only has it been the basis of their livelihood, but also it has influenced their cultural traditions, social structures and general well-being. It is appropriate that this legislation allows the authority to use money in the Torres Strait Regional Authority land and resource fund for the development and implementation of a marine strategy that enhances the relationship between the islanders and the sea. Section 144W(3) of the bill recognises that the Torres Strait is a marine environment and allows funds to be used for improvements to property and development of marine resources in accordance with the marine strategy. During the debate on the earlier bill, which set up the authority, the coalition applauded the move to local self-management. The coalition is pleased that the authority will now have the power to negotiate and make agreements with other Commonwealth bodies, and state and territory government bodies. We note those aspects of the bill that provide the authority with the power to conduct elections, make loans, develop its own marine strategy for the Torres Strait area and develop and maintain real estate. Last year, in a paper presented to the International Indigenous Politics and SelfGovernment Conference in Norway, the chairman of the Torres Strait Regional Council, Mr Getano Lui Jr, asserted that there must be a health and medical preventative and clinical service accountable to the people of the Torres Strait with provision for culturally sensitive services. He called for appropriate social services, cultural programs, education administration and public services. He saidand the coalition echoes these sentimentsthat facilities generally available to all Australians and Queenslanders must be available in the Torres Strait. The government stands condemned that islanders as with other Aboriginal communities have suffered from Ii lack of basic services that other Australians take for granted. Recently the federal Race Discrimination Commissioner found that the basic human rights to clean water and good sanitation that most Australians take for granted were not enjoyed by people in remote communities. This reflects on the government which is so good on rhetoric but, when it comes down to services, does not live up to that rhetoric, and the people who suffer are those and other disadvantaged communities in Australia. It is these sorts of issues that the new authority will be addressing. The coalition is pleased that the best interests of the people of the Torres Strait will be decided by the people themselves. These amendments and the original bill affirm that the islanders are citizens of Australia and Queensland but rightly become responsible for their own destiny. The coalition supports the bill.",90
194,Mr GIBSON,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I am pleased to take part in this debate and express my support for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994. As has been outlined by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the main purpose of this bill is to establish the Torres Strait Regional Authority. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh said, that will allow the people of the Torres Strait to determine their own future and their own affairs. I applaud that and I believe the House should support this bill. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have visited the Torres Strait and know of not only the physical beauty of the islands but also the beauty of the people. The Torres Strait is a unique region and I think some of the issues that will face the Torres Strait Regional Authority are unique to that region and therefore will probably require some unique solutions. Unfortunately the people of the Torres Strait, like other indigenous peoples of Australia, are suffering under appalling conditions, as reflected in their health statistics. They have also suffered problems with regard to their access to services that the rest of Australian community take for granted. It goes without saying that if colonisation of Australia had not occurred the appalling health statistics we now have in the Torres Strait would not be occurring. That comes through very clearly when we talk to people from Thursday Island, Badu Island, Murray Island or any of the other islands in the Torres Strait. I have had the pleasure of talking to a number of leading community people in those islands on a number of occasions. I was speaking to a representative of the Torres Strait community last week in my work on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in our inquiry into the implementation report on Aboriginal deaths in custody. Mr Steve Mam, who is an important spokesperson for the Torres Strait community, said, 'We did not have deaths in custody in the Torres Strait before colonisation occurred and European settlement came to Australia because we did not have people in custody. We did not have people who were homeless. We did not have people who were dependent on alcohol or on drugs or on tobacco, which cause some alarming health statistics. We had a sense of community and we dealt with our people with that sense of community.' It has been because of the way European civilisation has so dramatically affected the people of the Torres Strait and set about a progressive destruction of their culture that all of those problems have now emerged. It is our responsibility to restore to the people of the Torres Strait some independence so that they can once more come to their own solutions to these problems. I believe that it is only when the people themselves are in charge of their own future that the correct and appropriate solutions to all of these problems will emerge. That is why I fully support this legislation. By setting up the Torres Strait Regional Authority we are giving the people of the Torres Strait power over their own destiny, a much greater level of power than they have experienced to date. . The other important thing that we need to the understand about the islanders of the Torres Strait is that they have maintained a much stronger link with their traditional culture and with the land than a lot of other indigenous communities in Australia have been able to achieve. It was from an island in the .Torres Strait that the native title issue first emerged. It was a former resident of Murray Island who initiated the action, firstly against the Queensland government and subsequently in the High Court of Australia, to assert his and his community's rights over the land in the Torres Strait, on Murray island, the island of Mer. That needs to be understood very clearly. The people of the Torres Strait have maintained their traditional activity and their cultural identity with their land probably more than a lot of other indigenous communities, apart from a number of communities in the Northern Territory. If we had let them run their own affairs and be in control of their own communities from the start, then I do not think we would have had the alarming health statistics we have had put before us on a regular basis regarding the dramatic way Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal Australians are suffering. I have examples here from a paper that was delivered to the Torres Strait health workshop in April of last year, a paper called, Our health. our future, our decision. It talks about mortality statistics. Life expectancy for Torres Strait Islanders is some 20 years less than it is for other Australians. The average age of death for males is 55.7 years. It declined in the years 1980 to 1989 from what it was in the years 1970 to 1979. So the mortality rates for people from the Torres Strait are worsening, not improving. For females in the Torres Strait the average age of death in the decade 1980 to 1989 was 48.8 years, which is almost 30 years younger than the average Australian mortality rate. Both sides of the House should be ashamed of those statistics. They have not come about because of the last five years of the Queensland Government or the last 10 years of the federal government. This situation has developed over the last 200 years of our administration of indigenous affairs in this country. It is not something that I am proud of. It is certainly something that I am committed to trying to correct. It is not something that we can score political points on. It is something that both sides, when we have been in power at state and federal level, have failed to adequately address. What we are doing in this legislation is saying to the Torres Strait Islanders, 'We have failed. We should be giving the authority to you to see if you can do a better job than we seem to have been able to do.' It is an issue that we have regularly addressed in this House. I chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In our report that was tabled last year in the parliament, Access and equity: rhetoric or reality?, which was a report on our inquiry into the implementation of the access and equity strategy, we made a number of recommendations with regard to access to mainstream health, housing, employment, education and other services for indigenous Australians, and in particular for people in the Torres Strait. I quote from this report: Access to adequate health services is a basic but one which is denied to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Evidence was given by ATSIC that 80 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. people are reliant on mainstream services, and yet the committee heard significant evidence that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do not receive equitable access or reasonable treatment in most mainstream health services. it can therefore be concluded this has resulted in many Aboriginal and Islander people not receiving adequate health care. That is very much evidenced by the information we have got from the Torres Strait. Last year during our hearings in the Torres Strait we were told that Torres Strait Islander communities have spent on them only 50. per cent of the amount that all Australians living on mainland Australia, in Queensland for example, have spent on them. When you take into account the fact that the islands of the Torres Strait also have severe water problems, severe housing shortages, overcrowded housing, severe employment problems, and large numbers of Torres Strait islanders with no access to mainstream employment, it is a severe indictment on the performance of successive governments in this area. I hope that with the formation of the Torres Strait Regional. Authority we will have a genuine commitment from all political parties to give the people of the Torres Strait in the administration of their affairs under this authority some freedom to act properly and fully in the best interests of their own people. I hope that they will not be subjected to massive and corrosive questioning of every single decision and act they undertake, as unfortunately occurs too frequently in the examination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this country. Another thing that members of the House of Representatives committee have come to appreciate is that Aboriginal organisations and Torres Strait Islander organisations are subjected to probably more than twice as much accountability as any other government department or community organisation. I do not in any way reject the requirement for accountability. Every taxpayer's dollar that is being spent needs to be clearly checked and accounted for to ensure that it is consistent with government policy and the community's right expectations. I stand by that, and I believe that should be the same for Aboriginal organisations as for any other organisation. I do not believe that it is fair that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations are subjected to such vigorous, and often personal, inquiry and that intimidation by some people with respect to over-justification for every single decision made. We are forcing Aboriginalorganisations to spend twice as much of their money on management and supervision as we expect other organisations to expend. Therefore, we are taking those valuable dollars and the time of those Aboriginal organisations away from the actual delivery of services. That is not in the best interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or of the taxpayers of Australia. I believe that the people elected to the Torres Strait Regional Authority will be the best placed to determine what is in the best interests of the Torres Strait Islander people. I do believe that they need to be accountable to their people for their decisions. I believe that they need to be accountable to the taxpayers of Australia for the expenditure of their money. But they should not be twice or three times as accountable as any other organisation. They should be as accountable as any other organisation. I believe that the Torres Strait Regional Authority would be very happy to be as accountable as, say, the Department of Social Security or some medical organisations to which weÂ· provide millions of dollars in research funding. It should be as accountable as those organisations. Unfortunately, that has not been its experience. I want to make sure that the dollars that we provide to the Torres Strait Regional Authority to tackle these alarming health, employment and housing statistics are able to be spent on those priorities and that the organisaof tions are not required to spend inordinate amounts of time responding to every little pedantic question raised for political purposes by a lot of people who have no particular concern for or interest in the welfare of indigenous Australians, but who are more interested in scoring cheap political points to pursue their own personal political careers. Unfortunately, that has been the pattern in the past. I hope that it will not be the pattern in the future. I sincerely hope that the Torres Strait Regional Authority is given the freedom and the true flexibility to tackle the issues before it and that it will be accountable to its own people. The first and most important level of accountability is that the people of the Torres Strait believe that their regional authority is working in their best interests and that it is expending the moneys the way that it should. The second most important thing is that we have to make sure that the regional authority gets sufficient financial resources to perform its tasks. That is this government's responsibility, and it is also the Queensland government's responsibility. Both governments need to work together to make sure that that authority is given sufficient funding to tackle those important issues. I comment briefly on the recent suggestions of the Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, and the Queensland Minister for Family Services and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, Anne Warner. Their suggestion is that Aboriginal and Islander Affairs should be fully transferred over to the Commonwealth's responsibility. I support that. I believe that that is a very reasonable objective, but that will not avoid continuing responsibility of all state governments in areas where the Commonwealth does not and could not provide services to Aboriginal and Islander people, such as in education and access to employment in the state public service. It does still mean that the Queensland government or other state governments are responsible for providing roads which Aboriginal and Islander people will want to access. One also has to appreciate that 70 per cent indigenous Australians live in urban communities and that they are part of the mainstream community, as far as their access to health services, hospitals, schools and things like that are concerned. They will still require access to those mainstream services, regardless of whether they are provided by state governments, local governments or Commonwealth governments. Although I support the planning and policy determinations occurring at the Commonwealth level in principle and although I believe that the Commonwealth should fully fund community health services and other specific services that are targeted purely at remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, there can be no complete withdrawal from the services to Aboriginal and Islander Australians by state governments, even if that policy determination process is handed over to the Commonwealth. We cannot differentiate in mainstream Australia and say to an Aboriginal person, 'The Commonwealth is now responsible for you. You can't go to our local state school or our local hospital.' Therefore, Aboriginal people will still be getting access to state services and local services in that respect. The real problem is that state and local governments are not meeting their responsibilities to a lot of Aboriginal communities. They will not avoid their responsibilities by saying, 'Oh, well, we wipe our hands of Aboriginal people; they're all the Commonwealth's responsibility.' I certainly agree that there should be national planning and that the Commonwealth should be setting national targets for a whole range of areas, but I still do not believe that state and local governments can avoid any responsibility for delivering services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This is a very important bill for the people of the Torres Strait. It is a landmark piece of legislation. I sincerely hope that it will receive strong support from all sides of this House and the Senate. I sincerely hope that the Torres Strait Regional Authority will be given the opportunity to fulfil its charter, as set out in this legislation and in the proposals that it has before it, without unnecessary political interference from people who wish to use the question of accountability to pursue their own political agendas rather than as a genuine concern for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.",91
195,Mr TRUSS,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I am happy to follow the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in this discussion on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill, which is an important piece of legislation. The honourable member for Moreton is well known for his deep commitment to the cause of Australia's Aboriginal people and his genuine desire to see our Aboriginal Australians share more fully the wonderful opportunities that our country offers. While we may disagree on occasions as to how those objectives should be achieved, I certainly share his strong view and his desire to see a far better lot for Australian Aborigines. I have also noted his comment on the suggestion that Aboriginal affairs should be transferred entirely to the Commonwealth. For all the reasons which the honourable member for Moreton put up, I would come to the opposite conclusion. I believe that it is appropriate that the states should continue to take a particular interest in Aboriginal affairs and develop necessary programs to ensure that Aboriginal Australians have proper health services, better education and a much better standard of living. Frankly, I do not think there is much evidence to suggest that Commonwealth programs have been any more successful in Aboriginal matters than state programs. While we all want to talk together, reach common objectives and endeavour to develop programs that are worthwhile, I do not believe that any central Commonwealth agency is likely to be more successful in that regard. It is beyond question that aspects of Australia's policy towards its Aboriginal people have not been successful or satisfactory and have failed not only Aborigines but, indeed, all Australians. There needs to be a genuine debate in the community about what can be done to improve the situation. There is a universal desire and agreement to achieve better results for Aborigines. Sadly, we have not got a great record as far as that is concerned. This particular piece of legislation attempts to assist the Torres Strait Islander sector of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in developing a better regional system. I hope it is successful in that regard. Frankly, outward organisations will not of themselves achieve too much. There has to be a genuine commitment from both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to achieve better results, and there has been little evidence of that to date in many areas. This legislation deals with, amongst many other things, suggested changes to the election regulations which apply to ATSIC. I want to use this debate, therefore, to review some of the results of the 1993 ATSIC elections. Those election results and the conduct of those elections are an acute embarrassment for the Australian electoral system. At a time when we are going around the world as electoral advisers, when we are supervising elections in other countries, what happened in the 1993 ATSIC elections is a very poor example to the rest of the world. Many Third World countries would be ashamed to have an election conducted in the way our 1993 ATSIC elections were conducted, and would be ashamed at many of the allegations of irregularity and the concerns about the overall outcome of those elections. The 1993 ATSIC elections chose 573 regional councillors from a total of 2,00 1 nominations. However, only 45,820 of the estimated 147,500 eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people actually voted. There were some 480 polling places and around 400 mobile booths. A turnout of only 32.15 per cent is obviously the first point of concern. There is an immediate difficulty with all of the figures because there is no rolI of who is eligible to vote at ATSIC elections. The general electoral roll is used, and then there is some arbitrary system to determine who, amongst the eight or 10 million Australians on that rolI, are actually able to vote at ATSIC elections. That system of itself is open to widespread abuse and there are many concerns about who was all owed to vote at this election and who was not allowed to vote. While we have a system where there is no specific roll, those difficulties will continue to arise. Part of the reason why there is no rolI is that there is no real definition of who is an Aboriginal. There has been some debate about what proportion of Aboriginal blood a person should have before being entitled to be caIled an Aborigine. Frankly, I do not think that offers an appropriate solution to whatever difficulties arise in determining Aboriginality. But neither does the current system which basicaIly says thaJ, if a couple of people agree that someone is an Aborigine, then he is. That particularly causes difficulty where there are hotly contested elections and where the eligibility for individual people to vote is subject to dispute. So the very identification of 147,500 people who might be eligible to vote at ATSIC elections is in the beginning a debatable figure and one which is seriously open to disputation. Nonetheless, the Australian Electoral Commission, the body charged with running alI of the federal elections in Australia and charged with running the ATSIC elections, came to a conclusion that 147,500 people were eligible to vote in this series of ATSIC elections. As I mentioned before, only 45,820 of those people bothered to turn up to vote. The voter turnout ranged from as little as 8.5 per cent in Sydney to 106.2 per cent at Mornington. Any election that produces a 106 per cent turnout must also leave people asking a lot of questions. The only explanation that the Electoral Commission was able to offer in relation to that unexpectedly large turnout was that more people turned up than were expected. It is obvious that more people than expected turned up, but why did 106 per cent of the expected Momington enrolment vote? How many people voted who should not have voted? Why was the Electoral Commission so out of touch with the number of people who should vote in an electorate like Mornington? With as little as 8.5 per cent turnout in Sydney and as much as 106 per cent turnout in another electorate, alarm beIls should have been ringing immediately in the minds of those who were conducting the elections. Looking around the various states, the turnout in New South Wales was just 20.78 per cent; Victoria, 19.02 per cent; Queensland, 35.74 per cent; Western Australia, 40.25 per cent; South Australia, 25.66 per cent; Tasmania, 16.43 per cent; and Northern Territory, the best of the lot, perhaps not unsurprisingly, 51.19 per cent. So around Australia there was just a 32 per cent turnout. But there is worse. Of the votes of those 45,820 who bothered to turn up, 6,000 were rejected by the commission and a further 2,000 were declared informal. That leaves us with just over 33,000 formal votes in an election which was supposed to involve 147,500 Aborigines; that is around a 20 per cent formal vote. One reaIly has to question the legitimacy of an election that produces a 20 per cent formal vote nationwide. When we look specificalIy at some of the electorates, the news is even more alarming. In the electorate of Nhulunby South in the Northern Territory, four ATSIC counsellors were elected from only 10 formal votes. There were an estimated 845 voters in that particular ward of whom 489 actually voted. However, 477 of the 489 were rejected and another two were treated as informal. Any election which produces only 10 formal votes out of an enrolment of 845 is farcical and an appalling indictment on those organising the election. In southern Queensland only 16 per cent of the 9,000 estimated voters in the Brisbane area bothered to vote, and 28.4 per cent of the 4,500 estimated voters in the Rockhampton region, which includes the coastal areas of my own electorate, lodged a vote. In the Roma area, which includes the western part of my electorate, there was a turnout of 442 per cent of the 3,400 eligible voters. I have received a number of complaints from constituents about the elections conducted in that area. Constituents of ATSIC regional wards are also constituents of federal members of parliament. I have been approached by a number of people who are concerned about the way in which the elections were conducted and, in particular, the elections in their area. One of the difficulties that arises is that, while there are 480 polling places, as I understand it, there is no provision for postal voting for ATSIC elections. In my own electorate many people are obliged to travel several hundred miles to their nearest ATSIC polling booth, or they have to rely on the mobile polling booths which breeze through communities, often with seemingly little notice or advice. If Aborigines who are eligible to vote are not there on the day, they miss out on that voting opportunity. Frankly that is not good enough. Many of the people who were eligible to vote feel disenfranchised. They were faced with the option of either being in their community on a particular day or travelling several hundred miles to the nearest polling booth. There needs to be a better system to ensure that all those who are eligible to vote have that opportunity. There are also allegations of voting irregularities. I shall not be able to go into detail today because some of them are the subject of appeals to the courts, so I guess they are sub judice. Many of them are very serious allegations which go to the core of an honest and fair voting system. The many allegations of rank corruption associated with the ATSIC elections put the legitimacy of the results in question. Even with the poor voter turnouts, something like 10 per cent of all of the votes cast were rejected and a further 5 per cent were declared informal. In my own area, the three local regions elected a total of 54 ATSIC councillors, yet few people are satisfied with the end result. I understand that something like 10 of the election results are now under challenge in the courts. With that number in question, many may argue that the whole election should be nullified and conducted again. Australians should be alarmed that these elections were conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission-the same body that is charged with conducting all federal elections in Australia. The cost of the elections was something over $4 million, or more than $100 for every vote received. Many of the allegations of voting irregularities are directed towards Electoral Commission staff. There are suggestions that many of the staff gave incorrect information to those wishing to vote and that that is the reason why many of the election votes were rejeCted, When false information is given in some electorates to voters about how to cast their votes, one wonders what happens in other places where there are fewer challenges and less obvious concerns. Irregularities seem to have been widespread, so much so that the Electoral Commission is actually lodging some of these challenges in the courts. The AEC was given $4 million to conduct the elections but it is incurring further expense by filing petitions in the Federal Court challenging election outcomes which appear to have resulted from its own mistakes. ATSIC shares many of these concerns about the conduct of the poll, the discrepancies, the poor training and briefing of staff on election day, and the general poor those in standard of conduct of the election. One other matter of concern is the extraordinary time taken to count the votes. Even though fewer than 46,000 votes were cast around Australia, it took six weeks to count the votes in most electorates. It took 41 days to count just 66 votes in Deniliquin in New South Wales; that isÂ· not a distant, remote area, it is an urban town. It took 48 days to count 91 votes at Coober Pedy. The figures in other places are similar. Many weeks were taken even in the capital cities to count the votes once they had been cast. All of this gives rise to suspicion about the nature and the validity of the ATSIC election processes. This bill makes some amendments to ATSIC's electoral laws, but it will not do anything to resolve the sorts of issues that have caused widespread concern in the Aboriginal community arising out of the 1993 elections. We have had observers in South Africa and in Cambodia during elections, allegedly giving advice about the way in which fair and free elections can be conducted. Our own ATSIC elections have been a very poor example and advertisement for our electoral processes. There needs to be a thorough reform of the way in which ATSIC regional councillors are elected, of the electoral processes involved, and of the system we use to determine who is eligible to vote in particular wards, who is eligible to vote in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elections per se, and the way in which people are chosen to represent Aboriginals in their various regional and national bodies. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) should act to restore some credibility to ATSIC as a group by giving serious consideration to ordering a new poll for new elections to ensure that those who are representing the Aboriginal people are seen to be doing so on the basis of free and fair elections. Much needs to be done to reform this system. This legislation only tinkers at the edges and fails to address those significant issues. Frankly, if ATSIC is to have any credibility, it has to have the confidence not only of the broad Australian community but particularly of the Aboriginal population itself. The Aboriginals who talked to me about the results of this 'recent poll have anything but confidence in the way these elections were conducted. We need to look at this matter once again, particularly following the review of the court hearings in relation to the at least 10 results that are under question. We need to consider seriously whether whole new elections should be ordered to ensure that the people elected to represent Aborigines are indeed those whom they want to be their representatives.",95
196,Mr LES SCOTT,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I am very pleased to have the opportunity to rise this evening, in the short time available, to add my contribution to the debate on the very important bill before the parliament tonight-the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill. I acknowledge the remarks made by my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) who spoke about the role of ATSIC and the questiop of accountability. That is important because I am sure that everyone in this place 'shares the view that every government department-and the government itself-is very much accountable for the spending of the Australian taxpayers' dollar. From my observation, the work of ATSIC has been under extreme scrutiny over a long period of time. In a lot of ways ATSIC has not been given the fair go to which it is entitled. I received a letter the other day from Dr Peter Shergold, whose time as executive officer at ATSIC has now expired. I put on record my best wishes to Peter and I acknowledge the contribution he has made to ATSIC over the last few years. He has done a tremendousjob under difficult circumstances. It appears to me that there is always an attitude-(Quorum formed) I thank my colleagues on this side of the House for turning up and for the obvious support that they have for Aboriginal people in Australia. The handful of people across the chamber-three of youse-is about the amount of support that you have for the Aboriginal people in this country. Calling a quorum on a very important bill like this is a complete waste of the time of this House. Do not ever get up in this House again and tell us that we are wasting the time of this House. As my colleague the honourable member for Moreton said earlier, the disgrace of what has happened to the Aboriginal people in this country is the result of continuous problems because governments have not replied to the needs of these people. And you get up in this place and waste the time of this House! You are an absolute disgrace and you should be ashamed of yourself, as your party is. Your leaders should sort you out. I can see why you are sitting back there and not on the bench. It is a disgrace. Before I was rudely interrupted by the member for Wannon",98
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ISLANDER COMMISSION," person Order! The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair. Mrs Gallus- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise point of order, although you have already raised the subject of it. The member opposite was pointing his finger and referring not only to 'you' but to 'youse', which is not in the English language.",99
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,Order! I have addressed the point of order.,99
199,Mr LES SCOTT,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I do not mind if the will honourable member for Hindmarsh keeps interrupting me, because she is supposed to a spokesman for the Aboriginal people. God help the Aboriginal people if that lot were ever to get into government, with people who have attitudes like the honourable Hindmarsh and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who would waste the time of the House during debate on such an important issue. Before I was rudely interrupted by that I was speaking about the good work of ATSIC. Earlier the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) was attacking ATSIC again. That is all we ever seem to get from that side of the House. ATSIC has done a of tremendous work over a long period of there. time. I was paying tribute to Dr Peter Shergold, the former Chief Executive Officer. I understand he wrote to a number of us thanking us for our support. I again put on the record my acknowledgment of the work that Dr Peter Shergold has done for ATSIC over his term as Chief Executive Officer. He has done a tremendous job under difficult circumstances. ATSIC has continually come under quite unjustifiable attack about its accountability. I acknowledge Peter's contribution and the good relationship that I have developed with him over the time that I have known him. I have heard the support of many of my colleagues. In acknowledging Peter's support, I also acknowledge his successor, Ms Pat Turner, who is an Aboriginal person. The honourable front member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) reminds me that she is from Alice Springs, in his electorate. She is obviously a who is held in high regard. I wish her well in her work with ATSIC. It still has - lot of work to do, as we all do in this parliament, a in . addressing the problems that face our Aboriginal people today. This bill is extremely important in continuing the commitment by this government to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It specifically refers to the role of the Torres Strait Islander people. Last week I had the opportunity to visit the Torres Strait with my colleague the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), who be speaking later in this debate, where we met with a number of people. We really be . need to go out first-hand and visit these people and talk to them about problems that they have, for example, in the area of health. I think we need to be very cautious and very member for aware of that. I have mentioned the accountability of ATSIC. I have looked at a couple of Commonwealth community development employment programs, CDEPs, which are lot, well known in many Aboriginal arid Torres Strait Islander communities. They are extremely successful and need a lot of support from this parliament. ATSIC runs the CDEPs now, with a lot of assistance from DEET. The lot training areas will need to continue from The other day I was in a community in Injinoo, neaT Bamaga, in Cape York. I was amazed when the people there told me that about $700,000 a year is spent on the CDEP but it is' costing them $100,000 a year to maintain their accountability requirements. That proportion, 14 per cent, is a very large amount of money to be spent servicing the accountability requirements of the CDEP. They are the sorts of things that we need to be aware of to ensure that the people who are delivering these services under the CDEP can be supported without that sort of money being dragged out of the funds that are contributed to them. . The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bil11994 is important to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This bill gives us the opportunity to show some much needed bipartisan support for an area that often does not receive such agreement because many people perceive it as controversial. Today we have not seen that sort of support. It is very unfortunate that someone would be foolish enough to act this way in this debate. I think it is fair to say that, unfortunately, since the passing of the Mabo decision, just about anything in the field of AboriginalÂ· and Torres Strait Islander affairs that receives publicity is seen by the public as controversial, whether it deserves it or not. In most cases it certainly is not. I am sure that at some stage most honourable members have had to deal with the attitude that exists in certain sections of the community which says that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country are somehow getting something that they do not deserve. There is no doubt about that; it is true that they are getting something that they do not deserve. They are getting poor health, high mortality rates, high incarceration rates and all the attendant tragedies that follow the loss of cultural identity and independence. They most certainly do not deserve to get those things. Unfortunately, that is what is happening in Australia today. It is 200-odd years after British settlement of this country, and we still have these major problems. It is something that we as a society have to change. We have to change our whole attitude to how we deal with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We cannot continue to have the attitude that they are getting too much. That must change. If it does not change, we will never be able to solve the problems and the issues that are facing our friends in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. They certainly do deserve all the support they can get from members of this House. However, these are matters for discussion at other times. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994 arose out of the changes to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989, the ATSIC Act, that were made last year after a review of the act by ATSIC. One of the more significant changes was the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, the TSRA, to exercise the powers of ATSIC with respect to Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people in the Torres Strait. This bill proposes to amend the ATSIC Act in such a way as to allow the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) confer a departmental function on the Torres Strait Regional Authority and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to confer a departmental function of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission on that authority. It is to allow the TSRA to make a grant or loan to Queensland and an authority of that state for the purpose of furthering the social, economic or cultural development of Torres Strait Islanders or Aboriginal persons living in the Torres Strait. I wish to raise a point in relation to the Queensland government. I know the honourable member for Moreton mentioned the comments of the Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, during the week. Yesterday at the Queensland state conference of the Australian Labor Party I took the opportunity to speak to the Premier about his comments on transferring a lot of areas relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to the federal area. He is very cooperative and very responsive to the needs of these people. There have been massive changes under his government. He is certainly aware of the comments made by the honourable member for Moreton regarding the need to maintain the mainstream services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In that process I think we can expect a lot of cooperation from the Queensland government. Debate interrupted. NA",99

201,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"The year 6 and 7 class of the Cowell area school in my electorate recently hel9 a mock election campaign. The campaign illustrated that politics is alive and well in our schools and students are concerned about the future of their country. The campaign also demonstrated the students' depth of knowledge of the problems which our nation faces and gives a . timely reminder of what our priorities should be. At this juncture, I should acknowledge their teachers and the wonderful support that they gave these students. The first campaign speech I will read is from Megan Story. She said: A vote for me will give you a higher wage with less taxes, more family allowance and a wage for house wives. The education department needs cleaning up, I intend to do so. I will build more schools and create more jobs for teachers. Country schools are falling to pieces. I will try and improve the quality of these schools. With health I will make sure most foods made in Australia will be cholesterol, fat, salt and sugar free. I will also make sure my ministers for health and recreation will form a task force to tour the country promoting health and fitness. A vote for me is a sure way of keeping Australia the best country in the world to live in. A country where you can feel safe that your job is secure and so is your future. The next campaign speech for the job of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) came from Claire Kaden. She said: I care a lot about the environment and am willing to help people. If you elect me I will certainly make this country a place to work, rest and play. This country will be safe and enjoyable when I've finished my job. I am willing to heIp young people that are unemployed and are struggling without money. To do that I will build more schools for better education and that will also supply more jobs for young people. I will build more shops that will help unemployment, and give help to smalJ business. I am concerned about the environment and I think that people shouldn't use as much electricity and stop driving their car around everywhere and start riding abike and walking a bit more. The last election speech came from Anouska Zerna. She said: I am running for Prime Minister of Australia. I have many personal qualities, I am good at listening, public speaking and solving problems. I am campaigning for this position because I care about the future of this beautiful country. I am concerned about the high unemployment currently being experienced by the citizens of this country. One way to aIleviate the problem is lowering taxes on the owners of small business so they can afford to employ more people. I also believe that a good education is important as we the children are the future of this nation. When I am Prime Minister I will make sure that everyone, whether they live in the city or country, receives equal educational opportunities by upgrading country schools in particular. I congratulate these three prime ministerial candidates and the Cowell area school for their excellent work. I am sure that we would encourage them to maintain their close interest in our political system and wish them all the best as they progress through life. Cyprus",101
202,Mrs EASSON,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, 20 July this year marks the 20th anniversary of the invasion of the Republic of Cyprus. Cyprus is a member of the Commonwealth, as is Australia. This invasion, illegal and condemned, is still extant. As honourable members will be aware, the island of Cyprus has a mixed Greek Orthodox and Turkish Moslem population. The modem legal basis for the constitutional arrangements on the island of Cyprus is the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. This treaty was one of many that followed the First World War and dealt with the problems left over by the collapse of four empires after 1918. By this treaty, Cyprus was recognised as having been annexed by Britain. Both Greece and Turkey signed the treaty. Turkey also renounced any rights or claims on the island of Cyprus. However, this legal basis has been ignored by Turkey, which has resorted to illegal violence against Cyprus. Not only has the Treaty of Lausanne been broken, but the UN General Assembly has been ignored. Since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and the forcible division of the island by Turkish troops, the United Nations has adopted more than 50 resolutions and decisions regarding the Cyprus problem. These resolutions relate to the central issues of the Cyprus question such as the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island; the return of citizens to their homes and properties; a proper accounting for the fate of the 1,619 Greek Cypriots, as yet, unaccounted for; the implementation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of movement, freedom of settlement and the return of property; and, finally, the re-establishment of the security, sovereignty, territorito al integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus. It is high time that these issues were addressed by Turkey in a serious and constructive way. Australia can help this process by, at the very least, seriously raising, with the Turkish authorities, the question of property return for Australian citizens in Cyprus who have been robbed by the Turkish army. Until now, Turkey has refused to cooperate with the United Nations resolution on Cyprus and still, 20 years later, has an army of occupation on Cyprus. I will not go into details about the desecratand ed churches used as toilets, the murdered clergy and the raped women. I will not delay the House with tales of priests crucified on the doors of their churches or farmers burned to death in their own homes. All wars are appalling in their brutality. But this war is still going on. The aggressor still commits international crimes against the innocent Greeks of Cyprus. Not only does Turkey refuse to cooperate in the humanitarian efforts required to account for the 1,619 missing Greeks, but by bringing onto the island 80,000 settlers from Turkey, protected by 35,000 Turkish soldiers, a policy of ethnic cleansing has been introduced, by Turkey, into Cyprus. In an era when the Berlin Wall has collapsed, the continued division of Cyprus is an affront to all sense of decency. Of course, prior to 1974 the Turkish minority in Cyprus had grievances. However, grievances are alleviated by politics, not by mass murder, theft and military occupation. Would anyone say that the situation for the Turkish minority on the island of Cyprus is now better than it was in the years before 1974? Of course, it is not. So what is to be done? Australia has a large and peaceful immigration from both Greece and Turkey. The sons and daughters of Greece and Turkey have come to Australia, found peace and prosperity and live amicably together in Australia. We demonstrate that Greeks and Turks can live harmoniously. On the basis of this evidence, and our membership of the Commonwealth, I would call on the government of Australia take a higher profile in trying to find a way out of this situation. The foreign affairs department is rightly proud of its efforts in Cambodia. It worked hard and effectively in that country. I am confident that a similar effort could be made towards Cyprus. Australia has excellent relations with Greece, Turkey and the government of Cyprus. We have no great power political ambitions in the area. I believe that we could, if we actually wanted, make a difference. The long-term welfare of all people on Cyprus requires an end to military occupation a return to the rule of law in a unitary Cypriot state. The sorrows and tragedies of 20 years will never be calmed until this happens. Along with my fellow Australians of Greek descent, I mourn the losses and sufferings of the last 20 years. I call on the Australian government to take a greater interest in this continuing tragedy. Bunya Mountains",101
203,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"All my life I have lived at the foothills of the Bunya Mountains. From my verandah they dominate the view and I have always admired the Bunyas as one of the especially beautiful parts of Australia. The mountains take their name from the magnificent bunya pine trees which grow in the area-some of which are thought to be as much as 500 years old. The Bunya Mountains National Park covers more than 11,700 hectares and is perched on the top of the Great Dividing Range, reaching an elevation of over 1,100 metres at Mount Mowbullan and Mount Kiangarow. The national park is divided between three local authority areas and three federal electorates. I share the area with the members for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Fisher (Mr Slipper). The Great Dividing Range is the watershed between the coastal regions and Australia's vast inland. Rain falling on the the Bunya Mountains National Park drains into the Queensland coastal rivers while runoff on the western side enters the Murray-Darling system and, eventually, the ocean in South Australia. About every two or three years the bunyaÂ· pines produce giant pods of nuts about the size of a football which when ripe fall to the ground. In early days, Aborigines travelled hundreds of miles to meet and feast on the bunya nuts and perform corroborees. It is reported that tribal warfare and disputation would even cease during the bunya festival, though the Aborigines thought the area was haunted by evil spirits and so travelled down the mountains in the evening to sleep. In the 1870s, loggers began felling the giant bunya pines, red cedar and the other timber on the mountains. A huge timber industry was established. In 1908, the Queensland government set the Bunya Mountains aside as a national park. It is the second oldest national park in the state. A large state forest provides a buffer zone around the park. The Bunya Mountains have always been highly prized as a picnic area, holiday destination and scenic wonderland. My forefathers were among the local citizens who helped push the initial roads into the area and develop picnic areas. Over more recent decades, national park rangers have done a wonderful job in caring for the area and upgrading visitor facilities. A large team of volunteers and several local organisations which support the work of the park staff conduct visitor programs and encourage and work on the conservation of the area. Not all the scenic features are in the area of the national park. The adjoining Russell Park was donated to the people of the Wambo shire by the Russell family many years ago. There is the adjoining state forest, though there has been no logging for almost 40 years, and quite a lot of privately owned freehold land with a growing population of permanent residents, rental accommodation and tourist facilities. There can be no questioning the local commitment to preserving and enhancing the park on behalf of all Australians so that it will always be available for future eastern side of generations to enjoy. However, local residents are angry that the federal and state governments may be about to nominate the Bunya Mountains areas for the World Heritage List. Two well attended public meetings, one at Bell, on the western side of the park, and the other at Kumbia, on the eastern side, voted overwhelmingly-220 votes to four-to oppose World Heritage listing. Even a survey of hand-picked respondents, conducted with the guidance of Dr A. Keito of the Rainforest Conservation Society, could not produce a majority in support of World Heritage listing. All three local authorities in the region and the South Burnett Local Authorities Association, along with a wide range of farming and community groups, have also indicated their opposition to placing the region on the World Heritage List. These people know and love the area and have a deep commitment to its protection and maintenance. They have been prepared to devote their own time, efforts and money to care for the region in the past and they want the current system of management and care to continue. They have looked with horror at what has happened in some of the other World Heritage areas, such as the Willandra Lakes, North Queensland wet tropics and Fraser Island, and they do not want that kind of interference, bungling and heavy-handed bureaucracy imposed on their communities. There is concern that the rich agricultural lands which surround the park will have farming practices regulated by remote academics who have little or no appreciation of farm life and the hopes and aspirations of the community. There is an urgent need to improve access and provide better services and facilities on or near the Bunya Mountains. However, World Heritage listing will produce no new infrastructure funding and no better care for the national park; it will just produce a tangled web of complicated and restrictive management plans. At this stage, neither the federal nor the state governments have made any announcement that they intend to nominate the area. (TIme expired) Law and Order",102
204,Mr HORNE,ADJOURNMENT,"Paterson) (7.43 p.m.)Earlier this year, after a weekend in the Brindabellas, the federal coalition emerged identifying law and order as a major issue for the people of Australia. On 23 June, in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Premier of New South Wales said: My Government stands for the right to feel safe and secure with all guarantees,benefits and tion that the law can provide, administered with firmness, fairness and compassion. They are fine words. But how ironic it is that, in the year the coalition has identified law and order as a major issue, the state with the longest serving coalition government-New South Wales-has revealed how)ncapable it is of managing law and order. In no way do I reflect upon police'officers-the people who safeguard the community and who uphold the law. Mr Speaker, you and I both know how low their morale is, the conditions under which they work and the encouragement they need that is not forthcoming. I refer today to the resignation of the New South Wales Minister for Police, Terry Griffiths. In a tradition that has long been established by the Greiner-Fahey government-.:the team that has seen the demise of Nick Greiner, Terry Metherall and Tim Moore all under a cloud of doubt; the Packard and Smiles affairs that saw a new low in standards of parliamentarians; and the Pickard affair that cost the taxpayers of New South Wales a cool half a: million dollars-Michael Yabsley and Barry Morris have now been surpassed in accountability, or a lack of it, by Terry Griffiths. What scandal is hidden beneath this latest announcement? Who knows. All we can get from the Premier who demands only the 'highest standards' of his ministers is a comment such as: I can't say a lot about the circumstances surrounding Mr Griffiths' resignation because there has no formal complaint. Mr Fahey of course would not elaborate on the circumstances surrounding the resignation, but he did say he was aware that Mr Griffiths's manner of dealing with some staff members had caused them considerable and unnecessary stress. Mr Fahey said five of Mr Griffiths's female staff members were on stress leave. He then went on to say: I can't take it further than that without there being a further complaint. The obvious question is: whom is the Premier of New South Wales protecting? Mr Griffiths? Perhaps, but he has lost his job. The staff? protec- That is unlikely-they are on leave. The people of New South Wales? He has expressed concern about them, so much so that he said: It is every person's right to feel safe and secure in going about his or her businesseveryone, that is, unless they happen to be a staff member working for the Minister for Police and Emergency Services. Today's action by the Premier of New South Wales plumbs a new depth in political accountability. His major concern is for himself. We have seen a police minister shuffled onto the back bench, and a former police minister who was sacked because he misled parliament brought back into the  was sacked. HeÂ· resigned because he misled parliament following a row with Police Commissioner Tony Lauer about the attempted police cell suicide of Victorian teenager Angus Rigg. We all know the fiasco that that was. We have now the Premier safeguarding a colleague because he knows he cannot survive without him on the back bench. He refuses to call a by-election in Parramatta, he refuses to ask Barry Morris to resign, and now he has to bring in an emergency minister for police in charge of a police force that is already undergoing a royal commission. The shame of it all is that the coalition at state and federal level claims it is concerned about law and order.. Wilkinson, Ms Kellie: Abduction",104
205,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"Deakin) (7.48 p.m.)been During 1993, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) was much lauded for his initiative through the United Nations in securing the so-called peace plan for Cambodia. At that time, we in the opposition felt that credit should be given where credit was due. However, here we are, only a year later, and a young Australian woman with her British companions, while going about their proper business in that country, appear to have been spirited away amidst reports of warlords, ransom demands, sickness and maybe even worse. I am referring to the much publicised abduction, on 11 April this year, of a former Australian model Kellie Wilkinson and her British friends Dominic Chappell and Tina Dominy, who were ambushed while returni-g by taxi to the popular Cafe Rendezvous In Sihanoukville which they managed jointly. Various reports have stated that the three were led into the jungle at gunpoint. Since that time, increasing fears have been held for the young people's safety. A report in the Canberra Times of 20 April this year contained a statement issued by Major General Teng Savong, spokesman for the Cambodian national security ministry, saying: Yes-we can say the kidnapping of Westerners is a new policy of the Khmer Rouge because .there two gains from them-ransom and the disruptIOn of the country's economy by deterring foreign investment. Western diplomatic sources say the abduction could be the work of renegade Khmer Rouge units operating outside the control of their headquarters. Since then, despite the fact that even the revered Cambodian head of state, King Sihanouk, following a visit from Kellie Wilkinson's father, appealed for the unconditional release of Kellie and her companions, this has not happened and it is now almost three months since the abduction occurred. A report in the Melbourne Age of 2 May cited other kidnappings and stated: Diplomats and analysts in Cambodia say the country is becoming increasingly dangerous for foreigners. A further report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 3 June described the kidnapper and stated: General Bo, the renegade Khmer Rouge commander who had demanded ... $205,000 ransom for their return, has a long history of abduction- and some of his Cambodian victims have been killed. In the same article, Mrs Wilkinson, Kellie's mother, castigated Senator Evans, and understandably so, for stating publicly that Australia was considering sending weapons to the Cambodian army to fight the Khmer Rouge while her daughter was being held captive by the rebels. It would seem that Senator Evans's lack of sensitivity is only matched by his lack of activity in this particular matter. In fact, it is all too reminiscent of another case I have introduced into this place on several occasions; namely, the abduction of the Gillespie children from Australia to Malaysia in 1992. In both cases, Senator Evans appears notable by his lack of strength or ability to defend Australian citizens against the governments of foreign countries, yet at the same time he is quite happy to receive accolades for his diplomatic skills on the world scene. Imagine the anguish being suffered by Kellie Wilkinson's parents and friends, day after day, as they wait in terror of what may have happened in a country which a year after Senator Evans's much vaunted peace initiative - is becoming increasingly more corrupt, divided and bloody. Australian Football League",104
206,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"I must say that I find it amazing that someone would blame Senator Gareth Evans for the tragedy which has occurred on the kidnapping of the young Australian and two Britons in Cambodia. Obviously the solution in the mind of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), is that we should send the good senator off armed with a rifle and a hand grenade to traipse off into the jungles and by force of arms rescue the young lady and the two gentlemen. If that is not the resolution the honourable gentleman has, he should tell us in this House what he thinks the senator should do. If he does not have that sort of solution, then really it is just a waste of time of the House. The reality seems to be that it is just another little stir late at night on the adjournment debate. I speak concerning the Australian Football League and its current management. Mr Oakley is a member of the class of 1972, that famous class of people who gained their MBAs at Melbourne University, which class includes Mr Elliott and Mr Jarrett among others. Mr Oakley has brought to Australian rules football the same sorts of management practices. The AFL management today no longer has regard for those people who own the game. The people who own the game are families: families and children who go to the footy on a Saturday, buy a pie and sauce or a hot dog or whatever and dad would have a tinnie. They used to be able to stand in the outer and they used to be able to afford to go and watch their favourite team - playing. Of course, these days those at the Australian rules football are the elite. At most of major grounds now there are glassed in, air conditioned banquet rooms with white tablecloths and silver service. Those who are privileged, those who have taken over the game, sit back before the match starts in air conditioned comfort, with good wines and three-course meals. The weather does not bother them, of course. The view is uninterrupted: they have angled plate glass in front of them with a wonderful view of the ground. Of course, they do not pay for their meal. They are invited guests of the club. It is mum and dad downstairs in the rain in the outer who are paying for the privilege of these free loaders on the system and every AFL club seems to do it. The reality seems to me to be that the ordinary people, the Victorians, the South Australians, the Queenslanders, the New South Welshmen, all of those people who go through the turnstile and pay an increasing fee-indeed, it is getting to the stage in Victoria that families can no longer afford to take their families to the football-are being squeezed harder and harder to pay for the elite. It has been alleged that Mr Oakley is on a salary package in excess of $400,000 a year. It is also alleged that the AFL pays for Ron Barassi to coach Sydney, and it said that he is earning in excess of $300,000 a year. We all know that, for a varietyÂ· of reasons-and I am not being critical-Sydney is a financial disaster as a football team. In Sydney there is a different participation rate of viewing from other states. It is obvious that Sydney is never going to survive as a financially viable club in New South Wales. We have got to the stage where Victorian families are being slugged to go through the gate-we are going to be slugged $52 this year for a finals ticket-to pay for the Barassis of the world and to pay for Sydney. It is said that annually the AFL is pumping over $3 million into Sydney. That situation is an absolute nonsense. It is going to get to the stage where clubs like Port Adelaide will be denied admission to the AFL because the economic rationalism driving the AFL-the Oakley view of the the world-is that it will try to get a composite side up because it means profit. The game that people love, the game that families want to go and see, is being lost because of those who see it as profit only, who see the game as a means of giving them big incomes and privilege behind plate glass windows with white tablecloths and silver service. Ordinary Australian families are the losers. Schizophrenia",105
207,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I would like to bring to the attention of the House a problem that has been brought to my attention by a number of my constituents who are carers of sufferers of schizophrenia. Their concern is the lack of access to the drug Orap through the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits. I want to read into Hansard a couple of letters that I believe are important because they set out the benefit of the drug to sufferers and the assistance that it gives to carers. The first letter is from a Mrs M. Chase. She wrote to me as follows: Dear Mr Vaile The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has once again rejected submissions to list Orap in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits on the ground that it does not offer any significant therapeutic advantage over currently-listed less expensive major tranquillisers. The Committee concedes, however, that some patients may benefit from Orap and also acknowledges the claim that Orap is better than other drugs. The presentation of convincing clinical data showing the efficacy of Orap is severely handicapped because professionals, cognizant of the cost burden, cannot consider prescribing Orap to patients who may benefit but who are barely surviving on their pensions. Testimony from the most relevant sourcessufferers taking Orap, and their carers-would expound the advantages of this medication over a wide range of other neuroleptics many of which, at best, induce numbing sedation and side-effects so intolerable that additional medication is necessary. Orap has enabled my son to regain his independence, rejoin the community and stay out of the psychiatric ward. Considerable savings to our Health system would be possible if more people could be kept out of hospital-not to mention the improvement in the quality of life for those unfortunate people afflicted with mental illness. I should be most obliged if you would bring this matter to the attention of the Minister ... This I have done. The second letter is from Mrs Glad Fernley. This letter is directed to 'Hon. Carmen Lawrence, Minister for Health '. The letter reads: Dear Ms. Lawrence, In 1979 my Son was diagnosed as having Schizophrenia. From 1978 to 1989 he was treated by a local Psychiatrist and given various major tranquillisers but he did not respond to any of them and had frequent admissions to Hospital and was put on an Invalid Pension. In 1989 a Psychiatrist in Newcastle prescribed ORAP for him and his illness improved remarkably to the point where he was able to be employed as a Draftsman with an Engineering Firm. He is still employed, but due to the down tum of the building industry in this area is only employed when work is available so he is not at present receiving full wages. Since 1989 when he commenced ORAP he has had no relapses of his illness or any hospital admissions, has married and is living a normal happy life. I have written previously regarding the cost of ORAP. The burden for paying for the medication is great. The sufferer of Schizophrenia often lives with his mother who is also on a pension. The Hon. Peter Staples M.P. wrote to me and suggested I discuss with my son's doctor whether other listed major tranquillisers would constitute suitable treatment for my son. From 1978-1989 we did just that. You name the drug, we have had it but nothing suited until ORAP was prescribed. I note that the Manufacturer or ORAP (JanssenCilag) was invited to submit to the Committee any scientific or medical data it may have but the data did not convince the Committee to change its view. I would suggest that perhaps carers of these sufferers should be invited to submit to the Committee their hands-on experiences. If my Son went off ORAP he would be back on an Invalid Pension and would have admissions to Hospital which would be far more expensive",106

The following answers to questions were circulated: (Question No. 392) Mr MCGauran asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 September 1993: (1) What is the estimated revenue from (a) the full 5 cent rise in leaded fuel excise, (b) the full 7 cent rise in unleaded fuel excise, (c) the full 5 cent rise in diesel fuel excise and (d) the full 5 cent rise in fuel oil excise for (i) 1994-95, (ii) 1995-96 and (iii) 1996-97. (2) What revenue was received from excise on (a) leaded petrol, (b) unleaded petrol, (c) diesel fuel and (d) fuel oil in 1992-93. (3) What is the anticipated impact on operating costs of (a) the full 5 cent rise in .leaded fuel excise, (b) the full 7 cent rise in unleaded fuel excise, (c) the full 5 cent rise in diesel fuel excise, and (d) the full 5 cent rise in fuel oil excise on the (i) agriculture, (ii) forestry and fishing, (iv) paper and paper products, (v) basic chemicals, (vi) textile, clothing and footwear, (vii) wood and wood products, (viii) food, beverages and tobacco, (ix) petroleum refining, (x) basic iron and steel, (xi) basic non-ferrous metals, (xii) fabricated metal products, (xiii) manufacturing, including miscellaneous manufacturing, (xiv) publicly owned electricity generation and (xv) privately owned electricity generation industry sectors. (4) With respect to each industry sector referred to in part (3), what was the total excise-related payment for (a) leaded fuel, (b) unleaded fuel, (c) fuel oil and (d) diesel oil for 1992-93. (5) Is he able to say whether any gas supply contracts struck in respect of the supply of gas to mining and minerals processing operations are pegged to the delivered costs' of fuel oil plus excise; if so, which operations utilise these supply contracts. (6) Has his Department conducted an analysis of the impact of the increase in fuel oil excise on the operating costs of mining and minerals operations utilising gas supply contracts; if so, (a) what was the outcome and (b) will the additional costs affect the industrial competitiveness of the companies involved. (7) What was the impact of the excise on operating costs for (a) fuel oil used in water transport and (b) diesel fuel used in rail transport for (i) Commonwealth owned and (ii) each State owned railway for 1992-93. NA Fuel Excise (8) What will be the impact of the excise on operating costs for (a) fuel oil used in water transport and (b) diesel fuel used in rail transport for (i) Commonwealth owned and (ii) each State owned railway for (A) 1994-95, (B) 1995""96 and (C) 1996-97. (9) Has his Department conducted an analysis of the impact of the cost increases referred to in parts (7) and (8) for rail and water transport on the (a) mining and mineral processing industries and (b) the farm sector, if so,. what was the outcome. Mr Willis'-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) This part of the honourable member's question has transposed the scheduled rate increases for leaded and unleaded petrol. The Budget measure scheduled increases in the excise rate on leaded petrol of 7 cents per litre by August 1994, whilst the rate on unleaded petrol was scheduled to (iii) mining, increase by 5 cents per litre. In responding to this question, I draw the attention of the House to the Government's decision to contain the excise rate increase for fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene to just the 3 cents per litre which took effect on the night of the 1993-94 Budget and the further decrease by 1.977 cents per litre in this year's Budget, rather than the 5 cents per litre announced in the 1993-94 Budget and mentioned in (l)(d) of the honourable member's question. The estimated additional revenue from the excise increases for petroleum products, other than aviation fuels, is a gain in the following years of: 1994-95-$1363 million; 1995-96-$1446 million; 1996-97 -$1515 million . Successive governments have avoided publishing disaggregated estimates of petroleum product collections such as sought in parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) of question (I), as such estimates are likely to be less accurate than the aggregate estimate. I intend to maintain this practice of publishing only aggregate forecasts. (2) The excise revenue collected from petroleum products in 1992-93 was: Motor spirit-$4462 million; Diesel-$2646 million; Fuel Oil-$56 million The collections data in 1992-93 and earlier years did not differentiate between leaded and unleaded petrol, as there has not previously been any difference in excise treatment of the two products. The amount collected from diesel is a gross figure which does not reflect the rebates paid under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme (DFRS) to eligible primary production, mining and other activities (such as nursing homes and residential use). (3) The Government has undertaken an analysis of the impact on various industry sectors of the total package of indirect tax measures announced in the 1993-94 Budget.. The measures analysed include the package of proposed changes to the excise and sales tax systems announced in the 1993-94 Budget, but do not reflect later changes to the Budget measures (other than the increase in the low income rebate to $150). The results of this analysis were tabled in the Senate on 7 September 1993. However, the analysis was not undertaken separately for each individual Budget measure, such as the excise rate increase for each petroleum product. There would be no value in undertaking such a partial analysis on each individual measure. For example, it is not possible to present results according to the different impacts on industry costs of changes to excise on leaded petrol and unleaded petrol, as there is no basis on which to determine the use of leaded versus unleaded petrol in each industry. (4) Petroleum product. excise is collected from petroleum distributors well before the products are sold to final consumers, whether they be a householder or a commercial user. Therefore, the revenue data for petroleum excise do not provide information about the excise payments actually made by various industry sectors in 1992-93. Nor is it possible to estimate such payments on the disaggregated basis requested, for the reasons given in the answer to (3). (5) I understand that the prices of a number of energy products; including natural gas, may be tied to the prices of alternatives, including crude oil, fuel oil, diesel or a basket of petroleum products in some contracts. I do not have an overview of all contracts for natural gas supply and do not know how many of them may explicitly involve a linking of natural gas prices to other fuel prices. (6) No. (7) Excise collection data are not sufficiently detailed to allow analysis of the excise paid on individual petroleum products by water transport and various elements of rail transport. (See the answer to question 4 above.) However, the Industry Commission's Report on Rail Transport estimated that railways pay approximately $120 million per annum in excise taxes (Report No 13, 21 August 1991). (8) As the answers to (4) and (7 indicate, it is not possible to make disaggregated forecasts on the basis of excise collection data for each aspect of industry identified in this question. (9) As the answer to (3) indicates, an assessment has been undertaken of the effect of the total package of indirect tax measures announced in the 1993-94 Budget on industry sectors including transport and storage, agriculture and mining. But that analysis does not attempt to calculate separate, disaggregated estimates for the effects of any individual excise change. Regional Employment and Economic Development Program (Question No. 886) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 9 February 1994: Has funding for projects under the Australian National Rail structural adjustment component of the Regional Employment and Economic Development Program been frozen; if so, (a) why, (b) is this a normal procedure, (c) how many projects are affected, (d) what are the details of each project affected, (e) when were applicants for funding informed that funding would be unavailable, (f) at what stage were applications for funding when funding was frozen and (g) when were State program coordinators informed of the decision to freeze funding.",107
209,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Funding for projects under the Regional Employment and Economic Development Program has been frozen. (a) Funds were frozen to allow for a review of the appropriateness of the Program in the context of the Government's review of regional development policy and programs. (b) The procedure was designed to ensure consistency in programs relevant to regional development delivered by the now Department of . Housing and Regional Development in light of the transfer of the Government's current review of regional development policy and program. (c) Eight projects were affected. (d) The details of each project affected are as follows: Port Pirie Brass Factory To investigate the possibility of establishing a Brass Factory to source Chinese operations. Monarto Zoological Gardens Infrastructure To provide an evaluation of the feasibility of establishing commercial facilities to support the activities and further development of the Monarto Zoological Park which is developing a rare and endangered species program and which assists in the rehabilitation of sick animals. Murraylands Industry Development To fund facilitators in the sectors of Agriculture, Manufacturing and Tourism and Infrastructure, for 12 months to develop strategic alliances with industry, facilitate the development of a longer term strategic positioning for the industry sector, identify and assist industry to develop appropriate training responses, .assist industry groups to develop their own action plans and foster the establishment of network and similar support infrastructure to enable the. on-going development needs of the sectors to be addressed within the context of the strategic vision for the region.

Northern Spencer Gulf Aquaculture Research and Development To undertake an evaluation of the potential of a hatchery, nursery and grow out production capacities for snapper in the region. This is a joint project with a number of organisations, several of which have increased their funding contribution. (e) Applicants were advised informally in November 1993 and formally in December 1993. (t) All projects had been submitted formally or informally to the Program Coordinator in South Australia who had discussed elements of the applications and had suggested various additions or refinements to the applications. (g) The Program Coordinator was informed of the decision in November 1993. Administrative Building: Refurbishing (Question No. 896)",111
210,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 9 February 1994: Has Australian Estate Management proposed that the Administrative Building in the Parliamentary Triangle be refurbished; if so, (a) what levels of the building are proposed to be refurbished, (b) what is the cost of the proposed refurbishment and (c) what is the purpose of the proposed refurbishment.",112
211,Mr WALKER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foIlows: Yes. (a) All levels of the building. (b) The 1994-95 budget has approved an amount of $1.262m, with a further $1.65Om in the 1995-96 budget, for design and documentation. Overall, the cost of refurbishment, including fitout, is estimated at $64m. (c) The refurbishment is intended to bring the Administrative Building into line with Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) legislation. The building has not been refurbished since its construction between 1947 and 1956. Microeconomic Reform (Question No. 959) Mr Cadman asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 1 March 1994: (1) What financial compensations to State Governments are being considered by the Commonwealth in the implementation of microeconomic reform. (2) How will the compensation be assessed. (3) Will compensation be part of the normal Council of Australian Governments process.",112
212,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foIlows: (1) The issue of financial compensation to State Governments by the Commonwealth in the implementation of microeconomic reform has arisen in a number of contexts. These are: tax compensation following full or partial privatisation of State Trading Enterprises (STEs); compensation to the States for loss of dividends and tax equivalent payments (due to loss of monopoly rents) as a result of exposing their STEs to competition; and case-by-case assistance to encourage States to implement specific reforms. Following the July 1993 and March 1994 Premiers' Conferences, the Commonwealth and - State and Territory Governments have agreed on the following arrangements for tax compensation to State and Territory Governments. On a case by case basis, and so as to ensure that no State or Territory or the Commonwealth will be financially advantaged or disadvantaged, the Commonwealth will provide: (a) compensation in relation to income tax and wholesales tax (WST), for State Trading Enterprises (STEs) which are partially privatised and for trading enterprises which are jointly owned by the Commonwealth and one or more States and Territories; (b) compensation in relation to WST, where an STE is fully privatised; and (c) compensation in relation to income tax, for no more than one bank or insurance office in each State or Territory where the privatisation of the bank or insurance office commences before I July 1995. The Commonwealth will also consider compensation, on a case-by-case basis, so as to ensure that no State or Territory or the Commonwealth will be financially advantaged or disadvantaged in relation to income tax where an STE is fully privatised. The issue of compensation to the States for loss of dividends and tax equivalent payments has been raised in the context of implementation of the Hilmer Report on National Competition Policy. At the 25 February Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting, the Commonwealth advised that, in the context of agreement to the Hilmer competition policy principles, it would consider assistance to the States and Territories for loss of monopoly rents and the process for managing adjustment. The Commonwealth has in certain cases provided assistance to State Goverriments in order to progress specific microeconomic reforms. For example, in One Nation the Commonwealth set aside $100 million for the upgrading of interstate electricity transmission links in return for the States committing to satisfactory grid arrangements. While no firm projects have emerged warranting investment . of this amount, the Commonwealth remains committed to provide funds for further upgrading of grid interconnections where there is economic justification. Some funds have been allocated to a feasibility study of a high voltage transmission between NSW and Queensland. The Commonwealth also provided the largest share of funding for the National Rail Corporation (NR), as part of a reform package for the loss making interstate rail business which had. imposed a continuing drain on State rail authorities. In tion, the One Nation statement earmarked $454 million for rail infraStructure, from which State Governments as well as NR will benefit, on the proviso that NR negotiate a satisfactory enterprise agreement with the unions. NR's ground breaking agreement is expected to yield cost reductions of more than 35 per cent. (2) Given the wide range of compensation issues that are being dealt with, assessment of compensation is undertaken on a case-by-case basis depending on the context in which it arises. (3) In the context of the Hilmer competition policy proposals, the question of compensation for loss of monopoly rents and the process for managing adjustment will be discussed at the August 1994 COAG meeting but the Government does not envisage that compensation or financial assistance would need to be a continuing part of the normal COAG process. Foreign Ownership (Question. No. 966) Mr Vaile asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: . (1) Has his attention been drawn to statistics released recently by Austand, a Melbourne-based enterprise, on the current level of foreign ownership of Australian industry and business. (2) Is there an imbalance between the levels of foreign and domestic ownership of Australian industry and business; if so, how will the Government correct the imbalance.",112
213,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) & (2) My attention has been drawn to the article in question. In recent years the Government's economic policy has included the objective of integrating the Australian market with the global economy and exposing local industries to international and domestic competitive pressures. The Iiberalisation of Australia's foreign investment policy has been part of the deregulatory and market refoml initiatives. While foreign investment in Australia has increased, equity investment by Australians in overseaS countries has increased at a faster rate over the past decade. An important part of the Government's foreign investment policy of welcoming direct foreign investment that is consistent with the needs of the link Australian community is a screening process. Restrictions are applied in a few areas (for example developed residential real estate) where the Government considers that the net benefits to the Australian community are smaller. In the majority of industry sectors, however, smaller proposals are addi- exempt and larger proposals are approved unless judged contrary to the national interest. Australia has traditionally been reliant on over- . seas savings-be they in the form of debt or equity-which is a reflection of our national investment needs exceeding our national savings. In other words, this has enabled national investment to have been higher than it otherwise would be. This is clearly beneficial for the Australian economy, providing the build-up in our net external liabilities (that is, external debt and equity) and the servicing costs thereon do not become excessive. In that regard, there is a greater reason to be concerned about increased external indebtednessrather than equity inflow-because servicing debt involves a fixed contractual obligation, whereas equity financing is serviced only if the investment is profitable. Also the accumulation of external debt makes the Australian economy more vulnerable to external shocks and abrupt shifts in investor confidence. "" In these circumstances, it would clearly be counter productive to try and curtail equity investments in Australia-particularly direct investment. Indeed, it would generally ""be preferable if foreign equity investment increased relative to borrowings from abroad. This makes the objective of stabilising foreign debt as a proportion of GDP less difficult to achieve than otherwise. The Government policy does, however, aim to reduce our reliance on foreign savings by adopting policies that increase domestic savings and it is in that regard that the medium term budget deficit reduction strategy is important, as is the Superannuation Guarantee. The adoption of policies which make the Australian economy more competitive and productive will also help. World Heritage (Question No. 1047) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 24 March 1994: (1) Who attended the 19th session of the World Heritage Committee (Cartagena, Colombia, 6-12 December 1993) on behalf of Australia.

(4) What was the (a) purpose, (b) dates, (c) destinations, (d) cost and (e) travel allowance paid for each instance of travel by each incumbent Secretary. ",115
217,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Information in respect of the matters referred to in the honourable member's question is not readily available. It would be a major task to collect and assemble it and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of money and effort involved in providing such information. Unemployment (Question No. 1066) Mr Cadman asked the Minister for Emcosts ployment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 24 March 1994: Will the Government give real priority to reduccosts ing the level of unemployment. Mr Free (Acting Minister for Employment, and Education and Training)-The answer to the by honourable member's question is as follows: The Government is committed to reducing the level of unemployment. The Government's White and . Paper on Employment, released by the Prime Minister on 4 May, reaffirms and strengthens this commitment. The package contains a commitment of more than $ 10.3 billion over four years to tackling unemployment. The White Paper recognises that there is no alternative to economic growth as the basis for long-term job creation and reductions in unemployment. The Government's economic policy settings 3; have contributed to sustained strengthening of economic growth in Australia. Substantial job growth has been achieved in the past year and a downward trend in the unemployment rate is already evident. Over and above the growth objective, the White Paper demonstrates the Government's commitment to assist all of the unemployed, especially those who have been out of work the longest and disadvantaged groups. Some of the major new policy directions are listed below. The Job Compact and Labour Market Program Assistance For those who have been dependent on income support for over eighteen months the Government has created a Job Compact. The Job Compact will provide over one million I,abour market program places over the next four years, including more than half a million placements into jobs. These places will help the unemployed to re-establish contact with, and compete in, the labour market once more. For People unemployed the longest the Job Compact will break the vicious cycle of not being able to get a job without experience and not getting experience without a job. The White Paper also,provides additional assistance for those who are most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Case management, intensive job search assistance and early access to labour market programs will be provided to those identified as being at risk. Youth Training Initiative The Government is fully committed to solving youth unemployment. To tackle this problem we have developed the Youth Training Initiative. This initiative will provide unemployed young people aged 15-17 with intensive case management and enough program ,places to ensure that they receive worthwhile employment or training. These and other measures will ensure that unemployed young people are given every chance to improve their employment prospects, both immediately and in the longer term. Entry-Level Training In addition, the Government is providing assistance to school leavers and other labour market entrants by expanding entry-level training places by a minimum of 50,000 over the next two years. Other Measures Other measures in the White Paper will assist women, unemployed people with disabilities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and migrants. The variety and extent of these proposals demonstrate that tackling unemployment for this Government. To ensure that unemployment declines in the medium and longer term the Government will continue to implement responsible macroeconomic policy and promote microeconomic reform. To assist employers in creating jobs the White Paper contains programs specifically aimed at supporting them. These include improving the accessibility of CES services and the establishment of Employer Servicing Units. Employment and training opportunities in small business will receive a $6 million boost. Recognising the importance of small business employment, the White Paper has expanded the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme and made available the benefits of employing trainees through Group Training Schemes. ' Enhancements to Service Delivery Better service will be provided to the unemployed by opening the CES to competition from private providers of case management services. To ensure fair and open competition these service providers will be regulated by the Employment Service Regulatory Authority which is independent of DEET. As far as possible the unemployed will be given a choice of which provider they use especially for those who may prefer to deal with a local organisation. The magnitude of these initiatives shows the real priority that reducing unemployment is being given by this Government. As the economy continues to grow the measures announced in these packages will reduce unemployment. Pensions: Income and Assets Test (Question No. 1077) Mr Nehl asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: (I) How many pensioners have lost (a) all or (b) part of their pensions administered by his Department as a result of the Government's treatment of unrealised capital gains as income and the calculation of rates of return on their investments for the purposes of the pensions income and assets test. (2) What is the net savings to his Department of the new provisions and the cancellation of part or all of the pensions. (3) How many extra staff have been required to implement the new provisions. Mr Baldwin-The' answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) and (b) The assessment of income using a rate of return which takes into account changes in capital value on the investment and dividends or income distributions made over the previous 12 months applieS to certain managed investments and is a real priority listed shares. For managed investments, this approach applies to investments acquired after 1 January 1988 (for friendly society bonds) and 9 September 1988 (for market linked investments). In March 1993, the way in which the rate of return is determined changed in relation to market linked managed investments, with the rate of return being based on the investment's actual market performance over the preceding 12 months. From 20 September 1993, similar rules were introduced for listed shares acquired after 18 August 1992. July 1993 1 100,400 September 1993 1 99,200 January 1994 103,400 March 1994 125,400 The July and September 1993 2 Precise figures are not available for reassessments in July and September 1993. were cancelled due to those reassessments. Of these cases, some pensioners held managed investments only, some held shares only, and some held both shares and managed investments. It should be noted that a client whose pension is cancelled at one bulk update may be regranted before the next update and their rate amended because of that update. Also, a client whose rate decreases as a result of one bulk update may have a rate increase at the next bulk update because the overalJ current earnings capacity of their managed investments amI/or shares has decreased. (2) The estimated net savings from the application of the new rules referred to above are: for managed investments: 1992-93-$0.3m 1993-94-$1.2m 1994-95-$1.3m 1995-96-$1.3m for shares: 1993-94-$5.Om 1994-95-$11.4m 1995-96-$16.4m 1996-97-$21.6m (3) For the managed investments changes, additional resources equivalent to around 35 staff positions were employed nationally throughout the DSS network during the 1992-93 financial year. These staff were responsible for implementing the changes and were withdrawn in 1993-94. For the shares changes, additional resources equivalent to around 20 staff positions were employed nationally throughout the DSS network Since the above changes took effect, there have been quarterly bulkÂ· reassessments of the income earned by managed investments and listed shares acquired after 18 August 1992.

Library Services (Question No. 1081) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: Is he able to say which local government authorities providing library services in each local government area in each State fail to meet Australian Library and Information Association standards for (a) library floor space relative to population size and (b) number of library items per capita.",115
218,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My department does not have access to this information. The matter is the responsibility of the relevant State and Territory Ministers. Library Services (Question No. 1082) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: Is he able to say what sum (a) in gross terms and (b) converted into real per capita figures was spent on municipal library services in each State and Territory in each year since 1969. Mr Bowe-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My department does not have access to this information. The matter is the responsibility of the relevant State and Territory Ministers. Library Services (Question No. 1083) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: (1) Is he able to say, for each State and Territory (a) what percentage of the population has access to a free municipal library, (b) which local government areas still provide library services by subscription and (c) which local government areas apply user pays arrangements for book loans from municipal libraries. (2) What sum is spent per capita on library services by the (a) State or Territory, (b) local and (c) Commonwealth governments. Mr Bowe-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2)(a) and (b) My department does not have access to this information. The matter is the responsibility of the relevant State and Territory Ministers. (2)(c) My department does not have access to this information. The matter is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Whistleblower Legislation (Question No. 1089) Mr Latham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: Has he or his Department reviewed the effectiveness of the whistleblower legislation currently before the Queensland and New South Wales Parliaments; if so, what plans and progress have been made to introduce similar legislation in the Australian Parliament.",117
219,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that my Department has not formally reviewed the effectiveness of the whistleblower legislation currently before the Queensland and New South Wales Parliaments, although it continues to monitor legislative developments relating to whistleblowing in all Australian jurisdictions. The Government has been examining proposals for legislation to protect whistleblowers of its consideration of recommendations made by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law (conducted by the Gibbs Committee) on the disclosure of official information. The question of introducing such legislation is also being examined by the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, which is due to report by 30 June 1994 but which may be delayed into August due to the illness of Senator Newman. Hazardous Waste (Question No. 1094) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: (1) Is Australia a signatory to the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes. (2) Are (a) the Minister, (b) the Minister's Department or (c) any of its agencies charged with ensuring that exporters, transport companies, waste producers, waste handlers or any other persons comply with the Basel Convention. (3) What domestic Australian law, Commonwealth or State, is in place to ensure Australia's compliance with the Basel Convention. (4) Is it a breach of the Basel Convention to permit the export from Australia of waste to any country that is not a signatory to the Basel Convention. (5) Is the Philippines a signatory to the Basel Convention. (6) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the impounding by the Philippines' authorities in early March 1994 of containers of computer waste and mixed electronic metal scrap exported from Australia on the Russian ship Gamzat Tsadasa. (7) Has (a) the Minister, (b) the Minister's Department or (c) any of its agencies investigated or received any information on (i) the contents of its containers, (ii) the nature of the computer waste and mixed electronic metal scrap, (iii) the purpose for which the container contents were exported and (iv) the owners, exporters and carriers of the container contents; if so, (A) in each case, what were the results of the investigation and what was the information and (B) has any of the information or results of investigation led to, or will it lead to, prosecutions or penalties being imposed; if so, (I) on whom and (II) what are the penalties. (8) Did any of the container contents include (a) chlorinated compounds, (b) polychlorinated biphenyls or (c) rare metals; if so, what was the compound or metal. (9) Were the container contents capable of as part producing dioxins when burnt. (10) Has it been established whether any breach of the Basel Convention or any Australian law, Commonwealth or State, enacted in support of the Convention, occurred in the exporting of the container contents; if so, what is the nature and extent of the breach. (11) Does the Government continue to support the Basel Convention in its existing form. (12) Will the Government take steps, either within Australia or in international forums, to extend the effect of the Basel COnvention to restrict further the export of hazardous waste from Australia; if so, what are the details.",118
220,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Both the Minister and the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, an agency of the Minister's Department, are charged with the task of ensuring that exporters, transit companies. waste producers, waste handlers and other persons comply with the provisions of the Basel Convention, as provided for in the Commonwealth Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Imports and Exports) Act 1989. (3) The Commonwealth Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 seeks to ensure that Australia's obligations under the Basel Convention are met. (4) It is a breach of the Basel Convention to permit the export from. Australia of hazardous waste to any country that is not a Party to the Convention, unless. the export in question is permitted by a bilateral, multilateral or regional agreement or arrangement made under Article 11 of the Basel Convention. (5) Yes. (6) Yes. (7) (a)-(c) Yes, the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency has investigated and received information on these matters. (c)(i)(A) The contents of the containers were computer waste and mixed. electronic scrap. (c)(ii)(A) The company concerned has indicated that the nature of the computer waste and mixed electronic scrap was circuit boards, plugs, backplanes, pin boards, steel, copper wire, transformers, motors, blowers, pumps, aluminium, bright copper buzz bars, castors, fans, diodes, leads, ducting, transformers, PVC plastic, plastic casings and cabinets. More detail regarding the composition of the computer waste and mixed electronic scrap is being sought by the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. (c)(iii)(A) The computer waste and mixed electronic scrap was exported for manual separation into waste streams. The separated streams were to be distributed as follows: any useful computer chips, nuts, screws and bolts, and steel base plates were to remain in the Philippines. Some 70% of the scrap, consisting of printed circuit boards and other precious metal bearing components, was to be returned to Australia for re-sale to another company for recovery of silver, platinum and gold. More detail on the fate of the remaining items, e.g. the plastic casings and transformers, is being sought from the company by the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. (c)(iv)(A)The containers were exported from Australia by Hitechnology Metal Recyclers Pty Ltd (HMR). HMR also own the materials. The ship Gamzat Tsadasa is operated by the FESCO shipping company. (c)(i-iv)(B)(I-II) No Australian legal action has been commenced in relation to the matter. In the Philippines, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources has ordered the return of the containers to Australia, and this is being contested in the Philippines courts by the importing companies. No penalties have been imposed in relation to the matter. (8) Chlorinated compounds and rare metals are typically constituents of computer waste and mixed electronic scrap. Components containing small quantities of polychlorinated biphenyls may on some occasions be included. More detail regarding Basel the composition of the computer waste and mixed electronic scrap is being sought by the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. (9) Chlorinated material will typically produce dioxins when burnt. However, the facility to which this material was destined did not intend to incinerate the waste or heat it in any way. The process is essentially one of manual sorting. (10) No, it has not been established whether any breach of the Basel Convention or the Australian Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 occurred. This is because it has not yet been determined, by either Australian or Philippines authorities, whether the respective governments regard computer and electronic scrap to be a hazardous waste under the Basel Convention. (11) Yes. (12) The Government will take whatever action is necessary to give effect to its obligations under the Basel Convention and other international agreements to which it is or becomes a Party. (Question No. 1101)  Services and Health, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: (1) What is the current rate of suicides in Australia and what was the figure and percentage increase over the past 4 years. t (2) How does the Australian suicide rate compare with other countries. Year Number of Suicides 1992 1991 1990 1989 Source: Causes of Death Australia Over the four year period there has been a 4.8% increase in the overall suicide rate. (2) The following table shows the overall suicide rates in OECD countries, age-standardised to the European population .. The year is the most recent year for which data are available. Country Year Austria 1991 Australia 1988 Belgium 1987 Canada . 1990 Denmark 1991 Finland 1991 France 1990 Germany 1990 Greece 1990 Iceland 1991 Ireland 1990 Italy 1989 Japan 1991 Luxembourg 1991 Netherlands 1990 New Zealand 1989 Norway 1990 Suicides (3) Can she confirm whether Australia has the second highest suicide rate in the world. (4) Is the recession being wholly or partly blamed for the very high rate. (5) What initiatives has the government taken in order to reduce the incidence of suicide.",119
221,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The most recent year for which Australian data are available is 1992. Suicide rate in Australia last four years Rate (per 100,000 mean % change from previous pop'n) year 2,294 13.1 -4.4% 2,360 13.7 +7.9% 2,161 12.7 +1.6% 2,096 12.5 1992, ABS (Cat.

Population estimates 3.4 to enable calculation of rates from various issues 15.3 of the World Health Statistics Annual. 10.8 7.2 (3) As the previous tables show, Australia does 15.8 not have the second highest overall suicide rate in 19.1 the world. 9.6 (4) Suicide is a complex social phenomenon 14.3 which cannot be simply related to the state of the 15.5 economy. (5) The Government is awaiting the advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council on a national strategy for suicide prevention. However, there are some initiatives in relation to mental health which may be of relevance. For e.lf,:ample: the national mental health policy and plan embodies the Government's on-going commitment to mental health. As a result of budget deliberations, the National Mental Health Strategy will be expanded and enhanced at a cost of $133.6M over four years; and mental health has been identified as one of four priority focus areas in the national health goals and targets. Draft goals and targets aimed at substantially reducing the rate of suicide in key population groups are currently under consideration. Road Funding (Question No. 1107) Mr Thckey asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: What population data is used to determine road funding allocations for local government areas and to which year does it relate.",120
222,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Road funding allocations are made in accordance with the recommendations of the Local Government Grants Commission in each State. The Commissions are required to make these recommendations in accordance with distribution principles agreed to by the appropriate State and Commonwealth Minister in consultation with local government in that State. The distribution principles for Western Australia and the Northern Territory do not take population into account. I am advised that in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia anj:I Tasmania the Commissions. use the most recent estimate of population available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This is normally the 30 June preliminary estimate of population at twelve months before the start of the year for which the grant applies (i.e. recommendations for the 1994-95 grants will be based on the estimate of population at 30 June 1993). . I should emphasise that population is just one - f Ii number of factors taken into account by Grants Commissions in these States. Other factors include road length and type of road (i.e. whether sealed, paved or just formed). One State also considers topography and rainfall and others include a factor for bridges. Daw Park Repatriation Hospital (Question No. 1109) Ms Worth asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: Is the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital to be integrated with the South Australian health system; if so, will the Government provide sufficient .. . funding to the South Australian Government to allow the hospital to operate at or above its existing standard. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth wishes to integrate RGH Daw Park in order to ensure its future. At this stage no decision has been made as the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments are seeking to resolve the complex issues being considered. Price Waterhouse Urwick have been engaged to assist in resolving certain outstanding fi-ancial issues. The Commonwealth will provide appropriate funding. Rural Adjustment Scheme (Question No. 1119) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 4 May 1994: (1) Do the policy guidelines applicable to the exceptional circumstances provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) confine support only to loans made by commercial institutions; if so, why. (2) Does the wording of the guidelines place wool growers whose debts comprise arms-length vendor terms or inter-family loans at a significant and unreasonable disadvantage. (3) Will the Minister (a) seek a solution to the problems caused by the restriction or (b) alter the guidelines to allow RAS agencies sufficient discretion to enable an apparent inequity to be overcome. (4) Is it a fact that (a) in some cases under the RAS, arms-length vendor terms are treated as eligible loans for the purposes of exceptional circumstances subsidies and (b) inter-family loans the have the same legally binding obligations as loans from commercial lending institutions and exist in many cases because lenders and borrowers needÂ· to avoid the premiums charged by banks. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries andÂ· Energy has provided the following ansewr to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. The policy guidelines of the exceptional circumstances provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) stipulate that the State RAS authorities may provide support under the exceptional circumstances provisions for loans provided by a commercial institution. When the RAS.was introduced in January 1993, it was intended that it should act in concert with the commercial financial system and target assistance to long term viable farmers suffering from short term difficulties. The Government wished to encourage commercial lending institutions to work in close co-operation with the State RAS authorities and to share the responsibility of assessing a farmer's prospects of long term viability. It was considered that, during periods of exceptional circumstances, backing by a commercial lending institution would be an appropriate indicator of longer term viability. (2) Farmers whose financial arrangements consist of inter or intra-family loans are generally precludAustralian"" ed from receiving assistance under the exceptional circumstances guidelines. Arms-length vendor arrangements, however, may be treated in the same manner as commercial loans; providing the loan interest is set at a commercial rate. There is little evidence to suggest that legally binding intra-family loans, or vendor loans that are at arms length, are a significant element of overall rural debt. Data from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics indicates that in 1992-93 private debt made up less than 10 per cent of average farm debt in broadacre agriculture. Private loan arrangements are excluded from exceptional circumstances support because of the difficulties associated with establishing whether they are truly arms-length in character. The question of whether such private loan arrangements should in future be included within RAS assistance is being examined by Commonwealth and State officials. (3) The Minister does not consider that the exceptional circumstances guidelines require amendment at this stage. (4)(a) Consistent with the current provisions in the policy guidelines, some States treat arms-length vendor arrangements as eligible loans under the exceptional circumstances provisions. (b) Advice from the States on intra-family loans indicates that such loans vary in terms of the extent to which they appear legally binding, repayment and security conditions. Without assessing each loan on a case by case basis, it would not be possible to establish whether the loans have the same legally binding obligations as loans from commercial lending institutions. 'Buy Australian' Program (Question No. 1129) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, I.lpon notIce, on 4 May 1994: (1) Does the Minister's Department follow a ""Buy Australian"" program; if so, (a) when was the program introduced and (b) what sum was spent in advertising and promoting the program in (i) 198889, (ii) 1989-90, (iii) 1990-91, (iv) 1991-92 and (v) 1992-93. (2) What sum was spent within the Minister's Department on Australian made and overseas produced goods in (a) 1988-89, (b) 1989-90, (c) 1990-91, (d) 1991-92 and (e) 1992-93. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department does not have a ""Buy program in relation to the purchase of goods. However, the Department follows the policies outlined in the Commonwealth Procurement Guideline issued by the Department of Administrative Services in relation to the purchase of Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) supplies. The guidelines aim to maximise the competitive opportunities for ANZ suppliers in Commonwealth procurement. In addition, the Department uses contracts arranged by the Department of Administrative Services for common use items. (2) The Department does not separately record the cost of Australian made and overseas produced goods. To collect and assemble this information would be a major task. I do not believe that the expenditure of money and effort involved in assembling this information is warranted. 'Buy Australian' Program (Question No. 1130) Mr Moore asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, up-m notice, on 4 May 1994: (I) Does the Minister's Department follow a 'Buy Australian' program; if so, (a) when was the program introduced and (b) what sum was spent advertising and promoting the program in (i) 198889, (ii) 1989-90, (iii) 1990-91, (iv) 1991-92, and (v) 1992-93. (2) What sum was spent within the Minister's Department on Australian made and overseas produced goods in (a) 1988-89, (b) 1989-90, (c) 1990-91, (d) 1991-92 and (e) 1992-93.",121
223,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Department's purchasing is undertaken in accordance with theÂ· Government's purchasing policy which emphasises maximising opportunities for Australian and New Zealand suppliers to compete for Commonwealth business on the basis of value for money. (la) Not applicable (l b) Not applicable (2) The details sought by the honourable member are not readily available and would require considerable resources to extract and' collate. I am therefore not prepared to direct that this work be undertaken. (Question No. 1141) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 9 May 1994: Further to the answer to question No. 940 ard, 3 May 1994, page 130), (a) what component of the sum of $423 280 identified for Du Pont' Operations was devoted to overseas travel expenses, (b) how many days were spent visiting overseas plants for benchmarking purposes many persons were involved in the benchmarking visits.",122
224,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Du Pont Operations devoted $181,382 of the $423,280 grant to overseas travel expenses, for two benchmarking missions, one to Europe and the United Kingdom, and the other to Asia. Duration (mths) Caboolture 0-12 4147 12-18 748 18-24 413 24-30 308 30-36 278 36 plus 638 TOTAL 6532 The data provided in the table should be treated with caution. Data on the number of persons registered as unemployed with the CES are not an indicator of unemployment or a reliable indicator of changes in employment. This is because: some jobseekers remain registered with the CES although they have either independently (b) 15 days (inclusive of travel) were spent on each benchmarking mission, making a total of 30 days. (c) A total of 15 people representing a range of work areas were involved in the benchmarking visits. Both of the benchmarking visit teams had eight members, with the same team leader for both visits. Registered Jobseekers (Question No. 1145) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 10 May 1994: (1) How many persons registered with each Du Pont office of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) on the Sunshine Coast and in Caboolture, Qld, as looking for work had been registered for (a) less than 12 months, (b) 12 months, (c) 18 months, (d) 24 months, (e) 30 months, (t) 36 months and (Hans- (g) more than 36 months as at 1 March 1994. (2) Were any persons referred to in part (1) registered previously with other CES offices; if so, (a) how many, (b) with which offices and (c) for and (c) how how long in each case. Mr Free (Acting Minister for Employment, Education and Training)-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following table shows the number of jobseekers registered as unemployed at each CES office. Noosa office is not included as it did not become operational until mid March 1994. Caloundra Maroochydore Nambour TOTAL 3391 4332 4344 16214 612 735 796 2891 415 440 484 1752 310 367 432 1417 300 291 315 1184 761 818 847 3064 5789 6983 7218 26522 found employment or left the labour force but have not notified the CBS; the CBS register can change over time as a result of changes in labour market conditions, variations in administrative procedures and the effects of Government policy, especially the impact of changes in labour market programs; and not all people seeking employment register with the CES for assistance. A more accurate indicator of the number of unemployed by duration is providedÂ· by the Australian Bureau .of Statistics (ABS) which measures unemployment according to standards set by the International Labour Organisation. In this case ABS collection areas do not match the geographic areas specified in the honourable member's question. (2) The following. table provides numbers of unemployed jobseekers. who were previously registered with another CES office.. Data on previous offices and time registeredÂ· for individual jobseekers with another office are not available. CabooIture-1546 Caloundra-1836 Maroochydore-2160 Nambour-1842 TOTAL-7384 The data should be treated with caution. The CES opens offices where necessary to provide better service to jobseekers. For example, .Noosa CES opened in mid March 1994. Office openings and closures result in the transfer of registrations for. j-bseeke.rs without the jobseekerS actually changmg thetr places of residence. 27.8% of jobseekers in the Sunshine Coast! CabooIture area have been previously registered with another office. This compares with an estimated 25.3% nationally. Regional Development (Question No. 1147) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Devel()pment, upon notice, on 11 May 1994: Following the initiatives on regional development announced in the ministerial statement entitled Working Nation on 4 May 1994, will the Government produce budget papers similar to those of 1974-75 and 1975-76 which consolidate expenditure programs for regions; if so, when.",123

In the latter area, three of the projects listed above are specifically directed at the goal of Organisation Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne Sydney Metropolitan Teaching Hospitals Nursing Consortium Consumers' Health Forum University of New South Wales (UNSW); Latrobe University; the University of Newcastle; the University of Technology, Sydney; the University of Wollongong University of Central Queensland KPMG Peat Marwick KPMG Peat Marwick QLD Health Department NSW Department of Health NA NA Neville Jeffress Advertising University of Sydney Australian Nursing Federation NA NSW Health Department 3M Australia Australian Institute of Health and Welfare IIIawarra Area Health Service, NSW NSW Health Department South Australian Health Commission Health Information Managers Association of Australia Coopers & Lybrand QLD Health Department developing strategies for hospital output based funding, that is: the OVA simulation project; the University of New South Wales Casemix Classification and Payment Formulas project and the Queensland Health Department project for the Development of a Casemix Based Funding Model for Queensland Public Hospitals. In addition, most of the other projects under the Strategic Plan can be categorised as having the aim of building the information base to support output based funding of hospitals. However, the introduction of any case payments system remains a matter for decision by each individual State and Territory Government. Tendering Procedures (Question No. 1163) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport, and, Territories, upon notice, on 12 May 1994: Do tendering procedures within the Bureau of Meteorology comply with the Commonwealth Purchasing Guidelines and normal proper evaluation procedures.",126
228,Mr BRERETON,UNSW,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Yes. The Bureau of Meteorology's tendering and evaluation procedures comply with the Commonwealth Government Purchasing Guidelines and follow established administrative practice. Following a complaint by an unsuccessful tenderer for flood warning equipment, these procedures were the subject of recent independent scrutiny by both the Commonwealth's major purchasing authority, Purchasing Australia, and the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office and found to be in order. Flood Warning Equipment Tender (Question No. 1164) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 12 May 1994: (l) Did tenders for the provision of Alert flood warning telemetry equipment to the Bureau of Meteorology close on 4 June 1993. (2) Did the Bureau accept an unsupported statement of compliance with a tender as evidence that prototypes met the requirements of the specification; if so, why. (3) Did the Bureau accept further correspondence pertaining to the performance of equipment from one tenderer after the close of tenders although the information should have been provided with the tender; if so, why. (4) Was the Bureau proposing to accept a tender as late as nine and a half months after the close tenders even though compliance with the specification was still not proven and other tenderers had provided proof of compliance; if so, why. (5) Did the Bureau make assumptions regarding costing for alternatives, not covered by the tender, which had no basis in fact and on which tenderers were not consulted; if so, why. (6) Was a, contract awarded to a tenderer whose equipment cannot comply with the specification as written although other tenderers were compliant; if so, why. (7) Has the Bureau locked itself into outdated technology with serious limitations by awarding a single contract for a 5-year supply; if so, why. (8) Did the Minister's predecessor accept assurances from the Bureau that allÂ· was well without conducting a proper independent investigation.",128
229,Mr BRERETON,UNSW,"The Minister or the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. The closing date for lodgement of tenders was 2.00 pm (Melbourne Time) on 4 June 1993. (2) No. The evidence used by the Bureau that prototypes met the requirements of the specification included the direct examination of equipment by Bureau staff and results of testing undertaken in accordance with requir.ements of the specification. (3) The tender specification does not require that all information be provided at the time of submission of tenders and specifically states that the 'Tenderer also shall submit samples of the equipment, if so requested, for independent testing by the Bureau'. Indeed, a number of Tenderers state in their submissions that additional technical information can/will be provided on request. (4) No. The Bureau completed the tender evaluation in September 1993 and a tenderer for supply of the required equipment was recommended. The requirement to address complaints registered by an unsuccessful tenderer delayed completion of the contractual arrangements until March 1994. (5) All assumptions with respect to the costing of alternatives were based on material provided in the tender documents and were applied to all tenderers in an equitable manner. (6) No. The Bureau is satisfied that the equipment offered by the selected tenderer meets the requirements of the specification. (7) No. The selected equipment meets the requirements of the specification which was updated in March 1993. The selected tenderer has also offered a clear path of future equipment development. The contract specifically requires that of the 'Project Manager of the Bureau of Meteorology and the Contractor meet at 12 monthly intervals or within (1) month from the receipt of a written request from either party to review the specification and Quality Assurance implementation. This clause shall provide both parties with the opportunity to address changes in technology and developments in the Water Resources Industry.' (8) The normal practice in reviewing matters drawn to the Minister's attention about Departmental activities is, in the first instance, to refer the matter to the area of the Department concerned. In this case, on receipt of the initial complaints the tender process was reviewed by senior Bureau staff and found to be compliant with the Commonwealth Government Purchasing Guidelines. Subsequently, the procedures have also been reviewed independently by the Commonwealth's major purchasing authority, Purchasing Australia (part of the Department of Administrative Services) and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Both provided asSurances that the procedures were compliant with the Guidelines.

239,Dr LAWRENCE,PRISMOD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department has very little information concerning public hospital waiting list by speciality for Queensland public hospitals. This is because Queensland does not presently collect waiting lists data centrally on a regular basis, and what data are co\1ected at the hospital level are not consistently. collected in terms of a standardised method across Age hospitals. The Department has no regional data, only some waiting lists information for a single public hospital in that region, which was provided to the Commonwealth on the understanding that the information would not be disclosed. Commonwealth funds to Queensland under the Hospital Access Program are being used to develop the State's information systems on waiting lists, including urgency ratings and clinical protocols. (2) No, at the present time it is difficult to make comparisons of waiting Jist data across Australia for it is inconsistent and incomplete. Waiting list data from State and Territory health authorities differ in both scope and quality, and there are no uniform definitions or rules to make data meaningful. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) has been contracted by the Department of Human Services and Health, under the Hospital what Access Program to implement the development, collection and publication of accurate, comparable and timely data on waiting lists and times across different areas and specialities. The first comprehensive national report on waiting list data will be published by the AIHW in late 1994.

(Question No. 1234) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 1 June 1994: (1) Is it a fact that Proscar is a drug which (a) is known to reduce the size of an enlarged prostate gland and (b) costs up to $132 for a course of 30 tablets. (2) Is Proscar on the pharmaceutical benefits list; if not, (a) why not and (b) will the Government make the drug freely available to men who suffer from prostate problems but cannot afford the drug. (3) Has Proscar been tested in Australia; if so, what were the results.",133
241,Dr LAWRENCE,PRISMOD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Proscar is the brand name of the drug finasteride. (a) Proscar is indicated for the treatment and control of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia Date signed for AusTitle tralia United Nations Convention on the 10 December 1982 Law of the Sea International Sugar Agreement 31 December 1984 Convention against Torture and 10 December 1985 other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment .

It is suggested that it reduces the size of testosterone dependent tissues in benign prostatic enlargement. Clinical studies indicate that finasteride results in a 14-20% reduction in prostate volume after 48 weeks of treatment in 50% of patients. This is compared to 20% of patients on a placebo. (b) The dispensed prices for 30 tablets listed in Proscar the Pharmacy Guild of Australia price list ranges from $106.28 to $131.24, depending on the markup applied. (2) No. Proscar is not available under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. (a) The drug is not listed under the PBS as applications for listing have been rejected by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). The PBAC is of the view that the clinical place and value of finasteride in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia remain unclear. The Committee considers that efficacy is modest and the real clinical benefit represented by small improvement in some measures (e.g. increase in urine flow) is difficult to assess. Furthermore, the cost to achieve these modest improvements is not favourable. (b) The Government is unable to list a drug in the PBS unless it has been recommended by the PBAC, and as no exceptions for individual patients are available under the PBS, the Government cannot make the drug freely available. (3) Several clinical trials of Proscar have been initiated in Australia. The sponsoring company has advised that the results of some of these trials were included in the efficacy and safety data that was independently evaluated before the drug was approved for. registration in AustraJ.is. The. main studies in the application were from America.

Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The information requested by the honourable member in his latest question relating to Young Homeless Allowance recipients is not available by federal electoral division for each State and Territory in Australia. Young Homeless Allowance information for each regional office in Queensland was previously provided to the honourable member in response to House of Representatives Question No. 1168 on 30 May 1994. The information provided in this answer was the lowest level data available for the requested period. I am not prepared to authorise the further use of the considerable resources that would be required to extract and collate the necessary information in response to this latest question.
