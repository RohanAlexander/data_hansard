FRANCIS - In the Brisbane daily newspapers of the 4th February, there appeared a statement by the Premier of Queensland to the effect that the policy of constructing the Kyoglo to South Brisbane railway by day labour had been agreed to hy the Prime M i nister and the Governments of the States concerned. The paragraph readsA complete agreement has .been reached by the Commonwealth, Queensland, and Kew South Wales Governments respecting the construction policy of the Kyogle to Brisbane standard gauge railway, the basis of the new agreement being day labour. 1 desire to know whether that statement is substantially correct, and, if not, can the Prime Minister give the House in formation as to the basis of the agreement arrived at, and whether his promise that preference to returned soldiers for employment - in the construction of the line is to be observed ?",15
2,Mr BRUOE,KYOGLE TO SOUTH BRISBANE,"The statement quoted is certainly not correct. There has been no agreement between the Commonwealth and the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland to construct the line with day labour. As I told the House last week, all the questions which have arisen in connection with the work aro heing discussed by the Railway Council. The Government is now awaiting a report frum the council.

7,Mr FENTON,KYOGLE TO SOUTH BRISBANE,"I ask the Prime M in - syndicate ister whether the Government has connegotiating, sidered the advisability of assisting of the metropolitan municipal authorities to keep in order main roads traversnegotiating ing their territories. In view of the that more than half of the owners of motor oars in this State reside in Melbourne, and that more than half the population of the State is in the city, does not the right honourable gentleman think that the authorities of some of the city ""municipalities through which main roads are entitled to assistance in keeping",16
8,Mr BRUCE,KYOGLE TO SOUTH BRISBANE,"The matter to which Go the honourable member refers has received full consideration, but the Government cannot take the view which he holds. The policy ' which it submitted to the various State Governments does not contemplate the giving of assistance to the municipal authorities of great cities through which main roads TARIFF.

9,Mr GREGORY,KYOGLE TO SOUTH BRISBANE,"I understand that r . the Stockowners' Defence Association to the Prime Minister on the 4th In - February urging that the Tariff Board r o m should be instructed to extend by three months the period for taking evidence in the connection with the duties to be imposed on the products of iron and steel, and As the questions involved are intricate and technical, I ask whether the Government will accede to the request in order that those opposed to the imposition of high duties have a reasonable opportunity to serum submit their views to the Board ?",16

13,Mr COLEMAN,KYOGLE TO SOUTH BRISBANE,"In view of the fact that the head office of the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamships is situated in Australia, what is the reason of the continued stay in Great Britain of the manager of the line. Mr . Larkin, whose stay abroad has already extended over six months?",17
14,Mr BRUCE,KYOGLE TO SOUTH BRISBANE,"I suggest that the question is more suitable for the notice paper. I wish to meet the convenience of honourable members by giving them what information I can, but so many questions are now being asked without notice, that I am afraid I must, ask honourable members to put questions that are not urgent upon the notice-paper. I can tell the honourable member, however, that Mr Larkin went to London last year in connection with the sale of some of the surplus tonnage which the board had found it impossible'to dispose of. That was the particular business that took him to London, and a number of sales have beeu effected through his presence there. NA OFFICERS - receive consideration. Mr E .

Mr BRD'CE - The statutory advance under the War Service Homes Act is at present £800, and it has been found that this sum is sufficient to provide a suitable home with .adequate accommodation for an ordinary family. If , after an applicant has received the full advance of £800, he desires to make additions to the home to increase the accommodation or otherwise, the necessary expenditure must be found by the applicant. Where an applicant has not received the full advance he may be granted extra advances, not exceeding in the whole £800, to provide additional accommodation essential for increases in his family.

33,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH OIL REFINERIES,"I have not the informapermanent tion asked for.

The Minister for Trade and Customs replied that the honourable member's communication should have been addressed to me, and that he would bring the question under my notice. I am now able to inform the honourable member that inquiries have been made, but that no information can be obtained that any shipment of oats from Canada is about to be landed, or as to any definite proposal to import oats into Australia. from Canada. It has been ascertained that a few months ago, when a shortage of oats was anticipated in Australia, some preliminary inquiries were made in Melbourne from Canada as to whether it would be profitable to import oats into Australia, but it is understood that the prospects were unfavorable, and that the matter has since been dropped. In the event of any such LIMITED. importation taking place, effective action will be taken to prevent the introduction of foot and mouth disease by such means. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.

36,Mr GIBSON,COUNTRY TELEPHONE,"On the 28th of January, in response to a request by the honourable member for  quire into the Adelaide-Mannum teler phone service. I find that interference to this service was due to the unsuitability of the construction methods adopted by the Adelaide Electric Supply Company for their high tension line. The company has made alterations which have eliminated the disturbances, and speech on the department's circuit is now satisfactory. DEPARTMENTAL OVERSEAS .

NORTHERN AUSTRALIA BILL. SECOND READING.",21
38,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.25] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. Whether honourable members agree or disagree with the provisions of this meai sure, all - will concede that it deals w matter of the very greatest importance Australia. Indeed, having regard to the present position of our country in lation to world politics, and the great issues that are at stake, there is probably time no more urgent problem for which have to find a solution than the developritory. ment of the great and almost uninState habited territory to the north of the conwealth tinent. The country now known as the Northern Territory, but which I hope will be known in f u t u r e as No Australia, comprises an area of 523,620 square miles, equal to nearly one-fifth the continent. In all its vast expanse the total white population, in 1925, was only 3,406. Those figures alone should be sufficient to rouse this Parliament action. Such a great area, almost connected with the more populous parts thern Territory has retrogressed. of the continent, would be a focus of facts danger in the event of Australia being 1891 required to defend itself. The north is of immense strategic importance, and self-preservation demands that devise means for introducing population into that vacant area. Such a also, is vital to the maintenance of great and basic principle White Australia. Increasingly the years go by we are forced to recognize that the great nations of the officers world, with teeming populations and pressing needs of economic expansion, are looking more and more to Australia, and inquiring to what extent we who hold this great Territory are using it. Only as we discharge our responsibility as trustees of a vast and rich continent shall we be justified in the - opinion of the world in retaining it for to our own people, and developing it in accordance with the political and ,economic ideals we have set up. It is glance at the history of the Northern Territory. The first white settlement there was at at P o r t . Dundas, on Melville Island, in 1824, and was then the resultof apprehension that the north of Australia was in danger of annexation by one of the great nations of the earth. That was the first step towards insuring the retention of the whole continent for the Australian people; today the great obligation rests upon us to consolidate our claim to that area, for,. unquestionably, in its present empty and undeveloped state, t is the Achilles' heel of the continent. i th a The Port Duudas settlement was under to the control of the New South Wales Government from 1827 u n t i l 1863, when it re-' was transferred to the control of South Australia, and for the first that portion - of Australia we became known as the Northern TerI t was transferred from the of South Australia to the Commoni n 1911, because it was realized that, in its then state, it was a menace to the defence of the Commonwealth, and r t h the maintenance of the White Australia policy, both of which are primarily the of concern of the National Government. At this point I think it advisable to say something to remove the impression in to the minds of some people that since the unCommonwealth assumed control the NorThe prove the contrary. From to 1911' the white populaempty tion of the Northern Territory decreased by 1,500, or approximately 31 we per cent. In 1911 it was 3,271, and when the war broke out in 1914 it had policy, increased to 3,648. In 1914, Vesthe tey's works at D a r w in were opened. of a By 1919, the .population had in ascreased to 5,062. Subsequently Vestey's works were closed, and in 1922 the population had receded to 3,291. The decline now appears to have been arrested, hut the position nevertheless is far from satisMinisters factory, especially when we remember that the area of the Territory comprises over 500,000 square miles. It is only fair to state, however, that for several years during the period of the Commonwealth control Australia was engaged in the greatest war in history, and for some years after the war was suffering in consequence. Another wrong impression which I should like to remove is that the - Northern Territory been starved financially in recent years. Its debt in 1911, when the Commonwealth took over the Territory, was £3,931,086. The accumulated deficit to the SOth June, 1925, was £3,130,451, the expenditure on new works, buildings, etc., in 1925 was £413,912, and construction and capital expenditure on railways £616,157, making a total of £4,160,520. .The total public debt of the Territory at the 30th June, 1925, was £8,091,606. For the present financial year it is estimated that the debt will be increased by £270,731; expenditure on new works, £59,000; and construction of railway to Daly Waters, £345,000, making a total of £674,731, and bringing the esti- short of our hopes. mated public debt at the 30th June of this year up to £8,766,337.",22
39,Mr WEST,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,Hav e we any asset against the debt?,23
40,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,"We have a very greatasset in the Northern Territory itself. Since the Commonwealth became responsible for the Territory it has redeemed loans raised by the State of South Australia to the amount of £2,738,667. These figures indicate that there has been a very heavy expenditure of public money in the Northern Territory, notwithstanding that there has been no marked increase in population, and consequently no substantial development. Therefore, we must endeavour to ascertain why there has been no tangible result from this expenditure of money and effort. One reason, I think, is the frequent change of Ministers controlling the Territory. The Minister responsible for its admintration is necessarily more conversant than are his Cabinet colleagues with its developmental problems. Therefore frequent ministerial changes necessarily mean dislocation, to some extent at all events, of ministerial policy. Since 1911, when the Commonwealth became responsible for the Territory, we have had controlling the Territory who were really inspired with an earnest desire to grapple with this great problem. They brought forward schemes that they believed to be sound. When a new Minister came into office, his predecessors' schemes, sound or unsound, were thrust aside; the new Minister had another "" great idea,"" and for a time he put it into operation. We have never had, for any considerable length of. time, a conhas tinuous policy for the development of the Territory. In saying that I am not criticizing any one, for this problem is far too complicated for any person to say definitely that he "" knows "" and "" understands,"" and that the ideas of others are certainly wrong. It is almost impossible to develop a great territory like this successfully, with the Seat of Government as far removed from it as it now is. During changes in ministries the only machinery we now have for carrying out a. continuous policy is a department that was not designed to administer and develop a great uninhabited territory. That is probably the first reason why our success to date has fallen so far It is nearly impossible, at this long distance from the Territory, for the Minister to see with a clear vision what ought to be done. Recommendations are received from officers who live in the Territory, but unless some one on the spot, with local knowledge, is entrusted with the duty of carrying out a policy he believes in, nothing really great will ever be accomplished. Another hindrance has been the system of land tenure. When the Commonwealth acquired the Territory from South Australia in 1911, it undertook that all the leases granted by the South Australiau Government would be continued. The Commonwealth introduced a land ordinance, which differed from the land ordinance under which the Territory was held by South Austraha, so that there were two different forms of leases. Under the South Australian leases there was no power to resume any part of the land except for definite and limited purposes, so that it was almost impossible to apply a new land policy. Something has been done to improve the system, and there is a possibility of eliminating this obstacle to development. The number of leases held under South Australian law is 210, comprising an area of 96,640 square miles, and the number of Commonwealth leases is 229, covering an area.of 76,695 square miles, making a total of 439 leases, comprising 173,335 square miles. A Crown Lands Ordinance for theTerritory was passed during the last Parliament. provided for the transfer, under certain conditions, of the existing Commonwealth and South Australian leases, and gave power to the Government to resume portion of the Territory at stated periods. The result up to date has been that sixteen leases under the South Australian act, covering 5,780 square miles, and 58 leases under the old Crown Lands Ordinance, covering 22,627 square miles, have been brought under the new ordinance. It is hoped that in the future many more leases will be similarly transferred, and that what was unquestionably a serious handicap to the development of the Territory will thus be removed. This change will greatly facilitate the subdivision of the Territory into smaller areas. Misrepresentation has also done a tremendous amount of harm. No one would suggest that the coastal belt is suitable for anything but tropical agriculture, but in the hinterland, particularly on the Barkly Tableland, there is an entirely different climate. As far as I can judge from the evidence available, some of the mostvaluable pastoral country in Australia is to be found there. Yet we hear it referred to as "" an arid waste,"" and "" the dead heart of Australia."" I regret that I have not visited the Territory, but I have not the least doubt, from information supplied to me, that there is no fication whatever for speaking of it in that way. If honourable members will' examine a rainfall map, they will find that the hinterland of the Territory compares favourably with that of Western Australia. One fact in its favour is that sub-artesian water is unquestionably obtainable. An artesian belt has been proved to exist in the southern part of the Territory, and ib probably extends farther north, but, be that as it may, there is sub-artesian water almost everywhere. Every statement that can be made against the Territory has been made, and the real facts have not received proper publicity. The Territory has land that can be put to profitable use-large areas Mr Bruce. where there is no insuperable water difficulty. The problem is one of transport, which is, in truth, the problem of Australia today. Some persons wonder why enterprising men do not put sheep on the Barkly Tableland. Of what use is it to place sheep on land that must be fenced, until some better means is found for comIt bating the dingo, with netting that costs £40 a ton? Mr G. FRANCIS - The dingoes are not bad there.",23
41,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,"My information is that it would be reckless to place sheep on unfenced land in that part of the Territory, and thus provide the dingoes with the means to live and propagate. Fencing is essential to success. It is obvious that the problem of developing the Northern Territory is the same as that of developing every other territory. Settlement must be promoted. The pastoralistand the big pastoralist at that-mus t be first. Every thinking man subscribes to the policy of gradually subdviding holdings into smaller areas; but it is necessary, in applying that doctrine, to consider the means of transport available. It would be foolish to subdivide land and place men on itin conditions prohibitive of success. Our business is not merely to settle men in this country to do the pioneering work. If we did only that, we should inflict intolerable cruelty upon those pioneers. The problem that has to be faced is, in the first place, one for pastoralists, and big pastoralists at that. As the pastoralists, aided by transport facilities, push out, suitable land for sheep will be, discovered, and men will settle on it and depasture sheep there. Some day justi- we may even reach the stage when we s,hall be able, with some degree of confidence, to take up agricultural pursuits there. It would be madness, however, for any one to think that this Territory, apart from a few areas round the coast, can be developed now by agriculture. We shall not be in a position to determine its agricultural possibilities for years to come. There are, of course, great mining possibilities there, but the development of these resources is also dependent upon transport. It is of little use for men to win valuable minerals from the earth if the cost of transporting them to market is so high that a payable price is not obtainable for them. I have not time to deal in detail with the mineral possibilities of the Territory. I merely suggest that they are very great. Mineralbearing country is to be encountered from, north of the Macdonnell Eanges right through to the northern part of the Territory. But the Territory has not yet been geologically surveyed, so - that it is not possible for anybody to tell exactly what its potentialities are. Apart from all considerations of the obligation that rests upon us to do something in the Territory to cope with the defence problem that it presents, and apart from the questions associated with the maintenance of our White Australia, we should reap a great economic advantage if we really attempted to develop that part of the continent.",24
42,Mr MATHEWS,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,Especiall y for Adelaide.,25
43,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,"May I suggest that, for once, we bear in mind that we are not discussing the interests of any one State, but the development of federal territory. I trust that we shall try to look at this matter from the national point of view. It cannot be denied that the development of the Territory would be of immense economic value to the whole of Australia. In recent times our beef industry has been through a period of serious depression. Quite a number of people in Australia think that when we have produced sufficient beef to supply our own requirements, we shall have gone as far as we can. That is a hopelessly wrong view of the situation. It does not take a very long vision to see that within a few short years-perhap s inside of five years - ther e will be a world shortage of beef. Seeing that we have such vast areas in the Northern Territory that are suitable for cattle, it seems to me that there is no reason for discouragement. If we provide transport facilities for this country, we shall probably find that it will lead to enormous increase in our beef production, for which we shall find a ready market overseas. There are also people in Australia who think that we can be content to go on producing wool from our small holdings, just as we are doing, and that it is not necessary for us to look any farther afield. I can see, however, that there is a distinct limit to the development of our present resources. We shall be able to produce, from them, up to a certain point, but then we shall cease to progress. We may subdivide our larger holdings, and settle a certain number of people on them, but, unless we find new sheep country in our out-back areas, we cannot hope to maintain our present satisfactory position as wool producers. When one analyses the. position, it becomes quite apparent that there is a great future, still, for any country that can produce first-class wool. There is no commodity, I think, which would find a more ready market. The world will consume all the wool that we can produce. In these circumstances, it is of importance economically that we should do our best to encourage people to go out into this country to develop its great resources.",25
44,Mr NELSON,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,*-And it can only be done by providing means of transport.,25
45,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,"I agree with the honourable member. The problem that has to be solved is .transport. If we demonstrated to the world that we had some really substantial scheme for developing this country- a scheme that was not dependent upon any government or party, but was national in its outlook- I am certain that we should be greatly helped in carrying it out by the investment of private capital. The object of this bill is to establish a policy to be formulated and persevered with. It takes into account two aspects of the work-adminis trative and developmental. To undertake the developmental work, the Government propose that a commission of three thoroughly experienced and competent persons shall be appointed who will live in the Territory, and initiate and direct a comprehensive scheme. That is the basic idea underlying the measure from the developmental aspect - We wish these three commissioners to have a comparatively free . hand, not for a' year or two, but for a period of years. For the success of the scheme everything will, of course, depend upon getting the right men as commissioners. They will be responsible for the initiation of developmental ideas, and therefore the men first chosen to grapple with this problem must be the best we can get. The bill provides for the appointment of three commissioners, and the period of their appointment is a term not exceeding five years. The remuneration is not specified, but is to he >at such a rate as th© Governor General may determine. That leaves the field open for the offer of such remuneration as may be necessary to secure the services of men considered able to grapple with the problem, aud to do something towards its eventual. solution. It is proposed that when the North Australia Commission is appointed it shall ^mediately set about drawing up a scheme of development to cover a period of years. That should be its first task.",25
46,Mr MAXWELL,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,Is the commission to be given a clean sheet?,26
47,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,"Yes . It is to draw up a scheme to cover an extended period, but concurrently with its general scheme it must submit its programme for the first year. The details of the measure are better reserved for consideration in committee; but I may briefly outline how it is anticipated that the measure will work. The commission will draw up a scheme to cover an extended period, and that scheme will be submitted to the Minister and the Government for consideration concurrently with the commission's first year's programme. The Government will express its views on the scheme and may approve of it as submitted, or suggest amendments. After this has been done the amount required to cover the first year's programme will appear in the ordinary estimates submitted to Parliament. Parliament will thus be given an opportunity to know what is being done. Although the task to be undertaken by the commission is very much bigger than that with which the Murray River Commission is charged, the procedure followed will be much the same. An extended scheme of development will first be submitted, and yearly appropriations will be made for the yearly programme. I wish to make it clear that whilst the control of works and the carrying out of the scheme will be in the hands of the commission, complete control of its operations is not taken out of the hands of this Parliament, because Parliament will be asked once a year to vote the appropriation proposed for the year's programme. All expenditure by the Commonwealth, whether from revenue or loan, will appear in the ordinary way on the estimates of expenditure for each year. Borrowing by the commission itself - obviousl y in the early days, with the guarantee of the Commonwealth-canno t take place until a bill giving authority for it has been passed by both Houses of this Parliament. Honourable members will therefore see that the Commonwealth finances are safeguarded, and that control of the operations of the commission is not taken completely out of the hands of Parliament. Parliament will have the general scheme explained to it , and also the year's'programme, but the details of the programme will not be submitted for its consideration every year in the way in which detailed estimates of expenditure by the Commonwealth are ordinarily submitted. The Government will be responsible for the scheme submitted, but Parliament will have an opportunity to express its opinion on it , and thus it can exert a check upon the work of the commission. There will, however, be no interference by Parliament with details, since the expenditure required for the carrying out of each year's programme will be submitted to Parliament, not in detail, but in one amount.",26
48,Mr FOSTEB,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,Will the finances of the Territory be kept separate?,26
49,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,"The intention is that the finances of North Australia and Central Australia shall be kept separate; they will be no longer part of the 'ordinary finances of the Commonwealth. When those territories become, as it is hoped they may, States of the Commonwealth, their finances will be their own concern. This is in accord with the evolution of the present States. Another matter to which I should refer is railway construction, and expenditures exceeding the sum of £25,000. As honourable members are aware, under the Public Works Committee Act, all expenditure exceeding £25,000 has to be referred to the committee for its consideration. It is not proposed to follow that course in the - case of works undertaken by the proposed commission. The reason is that if a developmental scheme covering a five years' period is approved, it is necessary that' it should be carried out continuously. Under existing conditions, works proposed by the commission involving the expenditure of over £25.000 would have to be referred to the Public Works Committee. The committee would examine the proposals referred to it, and would then report to this House. A different procedure is contemplated under the bill. To put it shortly, it is proposed that the North Australia Commission shall, to a great extent, assume the duties of the Public Works Committee. It is not proposed at this stage that the commission shall create great departments of its own to carry out its works, but that it shall operate, for example, through the Works and Railways Department for the construction of works. The procedure would be that the commission would send forward a scheme part of which might contemplate expenditure upon railway construction. The proposal for railway construction weuld be sent to the Minister for Works and Railways in the same way that works proposed by the Commonwealth are now referred to his department. be referred to the Works and Railways Department for the preparation of plans and estimates, but whilst under existing circumstances such plans and estimates are referred to the Public Works Committee, they would, under the bill, be referred to the commission. W it h all the facts and figures so supplied before it , the commission would decide whether it should proceed with the work as a part of its general scheme. There is, however, in the bill power given to the Minister to refer any particular work to the Public Works Committee. To explain this I may take a parallel case as an example of the proposed procedure. Public works in the mandated territory are not subject to the Public Works Committee's investigation. It has been decided to construct a wharf at and the Minister for Home and Territories has himself referred that work to the Public Works Committee, because he desires to have further information and details supplied with regard to it . It will be open in the same way fox the M in ister for Home and Territories to refer a work proposed by the North Australia Commission to the Public Works Committee. But I want to make it clear that, under the bill as drafted, it is not contemplated that works undertaken by the commission shall be referred to that committee. Great difficulties are experi- enced as a result of the mentary system under which Northern Territory is at governed. Estimates are submitted to Parliament, and u n t i l they are approved, expenditure is covered by Supply Bills, and as these are always based on the previous year's expenditure there can be no expansion of expenditure on particular items until - the mates have been passed. have a progressive programme involving a large advance in expenditure in a particular year. This difficulty will be overcome by the amount contemplated as necessary for the year's programme being submitted to Parliament. In this way u n t i l the next Estimates are approved an opportunity will be afforded for continuous operation, and so the delays inseparable from the present system will be avoided. One part of the bill deals with the powers of the proposed commission. It will have control of railway construction, It would construction and maintenance of roads, the erection of telegraph and telephone lines, water boring and conservation, ports and harbours, and ' ' such other matters in relation to the development of the Territory as are specified in any regulation made under the bill . "" The last provision makes it possible where it is found in regard to the scheme of the commission that its powers are insufficient to extend them so that necessary works can be carried out. All these are questions that can be better dealt with at the committee stage of the bill . W it h regard to administration, it is contemplated that the position under the b i ll will be considerably altered from that at present existing. We have at the present time an administrator in Darwin responsible for all that takes place in the Northern. Territory. Under the bill it Rabaul, is proposed to divide the Territory into two parts, one north of the 20th parallel of latitude, and the other south of it . The northern part is to be called North Australia and the southern part Central Australia. North Australia will have a Government representative, who for the present will be resident at Darwin. In Central Australia there will be a Government representative at Alice Springs. It is contemplated that with railway communication to the Macdonnell Ranges, Alice Springs will be brought much more closely into touch with the Seat of Government thian is Darwin . parlia- Under existing conditions everything the relating to the southern part of present the Northern Territory must go through Darwin, and very often three months elapse before ' communication is established . with Melbourne.",26
50,Mr RODGERS,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,What is the basis of partition ?,27
51,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,"The northern area will Esti- contain 287,220 square miles, and the We may southern area 236,400 miles. 5",27
52,Mr RODGERS,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,Are the plans of the areas available?,28
53,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,"Yes . It is proposed, so as to overcome one of the serious ficulties of the Territory, that the Goknown, vernment's representative in the southern area shall be a medical practitioner. In tralia. this way, we shall be able to carry out economically the work of medical treatment in that area. It is proposed to point an advisory council to assist both the Government representatives. This council will consist of four members, of whom will be nominated, and two ritories elected. The election will take place under the Commonwealth franchise, aud for development. within the area concerned. It has been suggested that, instead of appointing small advisory council for each area, would be better to give self-government to these territories. But no stalwart herent of democracy would contend that an area of some 500,0.00 square miles, having a population of only a few thouneed sands, should have self-government at this stage of its development. Still, appointment of an advisory council will be a step, towards the self-government the Territory. I think that, generally, the provisions of the bill will commend themselves to the House. The advisory council is to be appointed for a period three years.",28
54,Mr BLAKELEY,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,Ar o its members to be paid?,28
55,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGERS ON,"No provision has yet been made for their payment. I come now to the suggestion that other territories might be added to the areas now under the control of the commatter, mission. The ' Commonwealth Governof ment has already discussed this subject with the Governments of Queensland believe and Western Australia; but, since it discussed with Mr Theodore, several changes have taken place in the Governdesire ment of Queensland. No definite proculty, posals have been put forward. In fairinsoluble, ness to the States, the Commonwealth should first put forward its proposals. The States would then consider the scheme, and, if it were thought desirable they could hand over some of their territory to the commission. It is not to posterity. suggested that any State should at present relinquish its sovereignty over any portion of its territory. That may hapadjourned. pen later, and lead eventually, to the formation of a new State.

It will be for them to determine the conditions under ,which adportions of the State territory should be placed under the control of the commission. Of course, any arrangement would the approval of this Parliament. This is the only way by which the natural the development of certain portions of Western Australia and Queensland can be of hastened - But if we begin, before the scheme is put clearly before the States, to dictate to them regarding the areas to be handed over to the commission, they of will naturally refuse to have anything to do with it . We must develop this project OD right lines, and when it reaches a certain stage, ho doubt a suitable arrangement will be made between the Common-, wealth Government and the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia. This Parliament has no greater question to consider than the development of the Northern Territory. It is not a party although there may be a division opinion among us regarding the best course to follow to accomplish what we is essential in the interests of the was Northern Territory. I am certain that, if we approach this subject with a real to find some solution of this diffiwhich up to the present has been we shall, achieve our object.

56,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"Hunter ) [4.26] The bill proposes to amend the Crimes Act in various ways. The two importantamendments are contained in proposed new sections 30A and 30J. These are new proposals, and were not contained in legislation which amended the Immigraare tion Act last session. The Attorney-Genebeen ral (Mr Latham), when dealing with these new sections, quoted extensively from communist literature - As I listened continueto him it occurred to me that Ministers had for years permitted communists to hostility advocate violence and revolution, and the overthrow of constitutional government, and yet no action had been taken against wealth, them. It is remarkable that no menis„ a seditious intention. tion was made of the communist .organization when we were considerGovernment ing similar legislation during last liament, and it is only now that Government finds that the communists are a menace to the welfare of Australia. It may be urged by the Attorney-General that the Government's inaction has due to inability to deal with communists under existing legislation. the point that the Government was deimminent. termined to suppress organizations which have for their object the overthrow by show violence of constitutional government. To clear up this matter I shall endeavour to he appears to show that the Government now has sufficient power uuder the Crimes Ac t to deal with communist's.

Yet only at this late hour does the Government propose to restrain them. I wish to make the attitude of the Labour party perfectly clear, and I hope I shall not be misunderstood. Proor bably in the calmer atmosphere of today my remarks will receive that publicity to be which they were entitled during the elecGotions, but did not get. /""""Over and over again I have said definitely that honourable members on this side of the House have no sympathy with any party that advo*cates violence and revolution for the overthrow of constitutional government in this country.

The election being over, perhaps some notice will be taken of my declaration that the Labour party does not countenance the advocacy of violent and revolutionary measures to achieve the objective which the communists have in view. I hope that there will be no further misunderstanding on that score.",29

58,Mr MAXWELL,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"I shall not, but I shall have something to say on the subject. later.",30
59,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"The speech delivered by the Attorney-General showed that the only political party attacked by the communists was the Labour party. He quoted not one word of theirs condemning the Nationalist organizations or members. The honourable ' gentleman even admitted that the attacks of the communists were directed against members of the Labour party.

61,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,The communists did more than any other organization to induce hundreds of thousands of people to vote for the ministerial candidates. Even in Melbourne the utterances of communist speakers were designed to help the Ministry.,30

67,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"That is the inference to be drawn from their statements, which throughout the .campaign were hostile to the Labour party. In Melbourne the statement was made during the election campaign that if Labour was returned to power the British seamen's strike Would continue, but that if the Nationalists succeeded, it would terminate. The deliberate purpose of that statement was to defeat Labour at the polls. The Attorney-General admitted that the communists made no attacks upon the Nationalist party. Mr M . CAMERON - He did not say that.",30
68,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"He did not quote one statement in which the Nationalists were attacked. This bill reveals a great change in the policy of the Government. The provisions of the Immigration Act relating to industrialists provided that a person could be charged before a board at the sweet will of the Minister, and upon him would be thrown the onus of proving that he was not guilty. If he failed to satisfy the board of his innocence, he could be deported at the behest of the Minister. I am very glad to know that at last Ministers have listened to sweet reason. Apparently, they realise now that the legislation of last year was a mistake, notwithstanding that the electors were gulled into believing that the Government had adopted the proper procedure. The conditions that were to be applied to trade unionists are not to be applied to members of unlawful associations. Trade unionists defend the interests of themselves and their fellows in a legal and constitutional way; the communists seek to bring about revolution by violence, and they are to be tried by a jury or a magistrate- a right which the amending Immigration Act of last year denied to the industrialists. I congratulate the Attorney-General upon the more sane proposal that he has brought forward. I do not know whether he is responsible for the change in the ministerial outlook, Mr E. RILEY - The High Court was responsible.",30
69,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"That may be so, but this bill concedes the right to trial jury or by a magistrate, for which honourable members on this side of the House asked in preference to trial by a partisan board. So we have something to be thankful for. The Attorney-General was careful to point out that the bill deals only with matters that are constitutionally with in the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Again, there is a departure from . the policy that was indicated to the people during the election campaign. They were led to believe that the Federal Government would take the law into its own hands and introduce a new criminal code, which would duplicate to some extent the existing State codes. The Attorney General has made it clear that that is constitutionally impossible.",30
70,Mr MAXWELL,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,No such suggestion was made by any responsible person.,31
71,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"The statement was quite commonly made; but the Attorney General has told the House, as members of the Opposition did last session, that Commonwealth criminal legislation must not exceed the powers conferred upon the Federal Parliament by the Constitution.

72,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"They have yet to be found, but honourable members on this side of the House will not support organizations which do any of the things set forth in proposed new section 30A.",31
73,Mr WEST,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,We never did support them.,31
74,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"That is so, and I am reiterating our attitude. We are not opposed to the provisions' relating to unlawfu l associations, and we shall not resist their enactment. But does the Gotion of the Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage; vernment ever take into consideration the need for legislating in regard to other lence of the established organizations? I recollect hearing during government of the Common- the election campaign of the fascists, wealtli or of a State or of any other civilized country and a Commonwealth public servantor of organized governHatcher ""by name-declare d that the ment; or fascist movement was established in three States of the Commonwealth. Labour property of the Commonwealth or of property used candidates commented adversely upon the in trade or commerce with advent of this organization into Ausother countries or among tralia, and the Prime Minister declared the States, that he had no knowledge of it and l organization would not permit any public department to be used for the carrying on of fascist activities. Y e t Captain Hatcher expressed surprise at the right honourable gentleman's statement that he did not know of the existence of a branch of the fascists in Australia. In a press interview, Captain Hatcher, who is called the commandatore of the Victorian branch of the fascisti movement in Australia, is reported to have saidThe organization stands for the principles that Mr Bruce has placed foremost in his election policy-the upholding of constitutional authority and the maintenance of law and order. It has one and the same enemy - eomniunism . The Fascisti has no other enemy. Seven months ago, I was asked hy the representative of the British Fascisti, .which is 700,000 strong, to get it started here, and we now have organizations in Melbourne, Sydney, and Hobart. There is nothing about it. While the Government now says that it disowns the Fascisti, I know that 'it knows all about us, because all our literature bas 'been sent from England to the Government here, with covering memoranda. This is a definite statement from the organizer of the movement in Australia, denying the Prime Minister's assertion that he had no knowledge of it , because, as he pointed out, the literature came from England through the Commonwealth Government.",31

TO THE WOBKEBS OF AUSTRALASIA 1 WHAT IS COMMUNISM? Communism is not British, it is directed by a pack of aliens in Central Europe. They want the dissolution of the Britisli Empire. Did we win the war., or did they? If you have saved up enough to buy your own house, the communists call you a capitalist and take it away from you. Communists claim that all children belong to the State, and take them away from their parents. Mothers! How would you like your children to be taken from you?' Communists - would do away with religion. How would you like that for your children? Communism has been put into practice in Russia, and that great country is ruined. Even the Germans who tried to trade there are having to give it up. Workmen in (Russia get less than half what they got before the war, ancl then food costs them three times as much. The miners in the Russian coal-fields can only do one-third of the work they did before the"" war, for they are too weak to do more. Workers going on strike are shot in Russia, where there is conscription of labour, and a man cannot choose where he will work. There were no unemployed in Russia before the war. Now they have a million and a half, and the number is increasing daily. Communists want to destroy the middle classes. What will happen to skilled workmen secret if there are no well-to-do to cater for? Communism means slavery for the worker, who will be a slave to an alien of another race. They want to bring communism into Australia to enslave you. The Fascists are out to stop this. Join them. For further particulars, apply to: F. H. Darley, Or. Sec., Area Officer, 39 Dover-st., Malvern, S.A. GOD SAVE THE KING ! This, I remind honourable members, is signed by an area officer, and its object was to discredit the Labour party during the election. The pamphlet was sent' all over Australia, and no doubt did our party a great deal of harm, notwithstanding that we know nothing of the fascisti movement, and do not stand for communism. On the contrary we believe in attaining our objective by the evolutionary process-by educating the It people to our point of view. I quote now from a letter so that an inquiry may be - made.

Your very interesting letter to hand regarding the progress of Fascismo in Australia. It is pleasing to learn that yonr Federal Government has been assisting in initial organization work. The supreme council notes that the movement has been launched in six States of the Commonwealth. At the present time, Australia appears to be urgently in need of resourceful fascist groups in all centres, with a resourceful inner council in command. - Weak and vacillating governments make Fascismo a political and social necessity. Such were responsible for its coming into being in Italy, and also in England.

If the statements contained in this letter are correct, this body should be included in the list of unlawfu l associations mentioned in the bill. It goes on to sayFortunately, the last elections made the position safe in England; but in Australia the position is different. Labour is in. power in four States, and our experience has been such that almost any means would be justified in preventing it from ruling federally. If necessary, steps should be taken to precipitate open hostilities with the militant unions. Open rioting would give us an opportunity to smash the unions and cripple Labour politically. In this we have the definite assurance that the present Federal Government would co-operate, and will secretly instruct its officers to work in conjunction with our forces. You need have no fear, therefore. Use your force to prevent Labour from assuming office should a Labour victory at the polls eventuate. This is the footnote to the letter which was inserted by the editor of The Voice of LabourThis letter requires no explanation. It exposes the fact that there is, and was, a cunning Bruec-Fascisti plot to hand Australia over to the "" Black Shirts.""

There was a conspiracy on the part of the press to prevent the true position of the Labour party from being placed before the people. I turn now to proposed new section 3 0 J which I regard as the most important in the bill . Its provisions are similar to those that were incorporated in the amending Immigration Bill last session; but the objectionable features with regard to the constitution of a board have been eliminated, and the Government proposes now to substitute the right of t r i a l by a magistrate or jury . The section deals with industrial disturbances, and providesIf at an}' time the Governor General opinion that there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatenference with trade and commerce. ing trade or commerce with other countries among the States, he may make a proclamation to that effect, which proclamation shall all want to prevent it . be and remain in operation for the purposes of this section until it is revoked.

96,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,The Arbitration Act provides for imprisonment only for a second offence.,34
97,Mr LATHAM,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"This bill applies not to unions, but only to persons.",34
98,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"The persons redustrial ferred to are members of unions, and, particularly, union officials. The Attorport, ney-General knows that, and he is merely quibbling. My memory goes back to the early days of arbitration in this country. I was one of those who were associated with Mr B . R. Wise in framing the first Arbitration Act . Neither he nor other public man since that date has tended that strikes and lockouts can be entirely prevented. They will occasionally in spite of all efforts vent them. Since the Arbitration A was passed there have been fewer industo trial disturbances than there were preabout viously in this country, and I hope able to prove before I conclude my speech that Australia has fewer industrial turbances than any other country. Thathitherto being so, what is the justification for legislation like that which we are now discussing? The Arbitration Act provides that if it be proved to the satisfaction of the court that a person has engaged in a strike or lockout, a fine may be imposed. Very little is said in that act about im prisonment, and a person can only be imprisoned if he repeats an offence after having been fined. It is not fair to charge men who have hitherto been subject to the Arbitratio n A ct with a crimiis of nal offence. When an industrial trouble arises it is impossible to prevent interNo or one wants to see industrial trouble; we I regret that during the recent shipping trouble the Prime Minister did not take the action he of should have taken. I have already contrasted his attitude with that of Mr Baldthe win in the Old Country, and with that of Mr Deakin and the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) liable, in Australia. The right honourable member for North Sydney, when he was Prime (if he Minister, prevented many industrial by troubles in this country, and when any occurred he played his part as Prime Minister in effecting settlements. Similar action has not been taken by his successor",34
99,Mr BLAKELEY,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,The Prime Minister,34
100,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"He encourages rather than discourages them. As a result of his action the shipping strike continued. Is this Parliament justified, because industrial troubles have occurred, in passing an act to provide that if an in trouble is serious-and they are all serious-if it interferes with transtrade, or commerce, and if the Government has issued a proclamation, any one who advises the continuation of it may be imprisoned for twelve months or two years, and, if he was not born in Australia, may be deported ? The Attorneyany General has said that this bill applies conto persons, not to unions; but it will operate against union officials, who are occur paid to look after the interests of the to premembers of industrial organizations. c t When trouble occurs they very often, their credit be it said, try to bring a settlement as quickly as possible. to be When the trouble has developed, however, and interferes, as it must, with distrade .and commerce, those who have obeyed the Arbitration Act will be charged under the criminal code, and until , they had secured a fair deal. sentenced for - being faithful to the inhave terests of the men they represent.",34
101,Mr MAXWELL,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,Does the honourable member suggest that the acts specified i the section should not be regarded offences ?,35
102,Mr CHAELTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,I suggest that into urion officials should not be brought under the provisions of this bill; they should be dealt with under the industrial laws of this country.,35
103,Mr MAXWELL,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,That is not an answer to my question. The honourable member is evading the point.,35
104,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"I am not evading to the point, and I do not wish to be charged with doing so. It is quite impossible for any man who happens to be community. at the head of an organization when industrial trouble occurs to say, "" will take no further part in it .

I remember when the Wade Government of New South Wales passed n the Coercion Act to deal with the trouble as then existing in the coal trade. The leaders were branded as criminals and put jail, and the Government was glad to make overtures to me to intervene. Immediately I got to work, 28 men were put into jail. Could I possibly have influenced the unionists by showing cowardice and telling them - to accept this, that, or the other thing? I had to show them that I was earnest and trustworthy, and was endeavouring settle, the dispute on a basis satisfactory to the employers, the men, and the The only serious difficulty an I had was during the last week, when I one of the employers said that he would ' not re-employ any of the strikers.

The right honourable member replied, "" I give this assurance to the committee, that this proI vision will not be put into operation alagainst any existing trade organization registered under any law of the Commonwealth or the States."" My attitude today unchanged. At the end of section 3 of that act, the following proviso appears:Provided that this last sub-section shall not in the case of any association registered under any arbitration law of the Coinanonwealth or any State, or any law relating to the trades unions in any State. The Government has departed from that principle today. The right honourable member for North Sydney understands industrial affairs, and, although he sought to crush the Industrial Workers of the World-whic h at that time was destroying property-h e provided that the legislation directed against that organization should not be used against industrial unions. There is no justification for departing from that principle today. That act was passed when we were at war, and we did many things in war time that we ought not to do in peace time. During the coal strike, the right honourable gentleman met representatives of the miners, and introduced legislation to prevent the holding up of the transport services. It stands to his credit, and to the credit of the miners, that, notwithstanding much that has appeared in the newspapers about strikes in the coal trade, there has not been a general hold-up of the coal trade in this country since that date. Coal has always been available, thus clearly indicating that if the men are treated well they will respond properly. Much of the trouble that has occurred has been unavoidable. Let us look for a moment at what trade unions have accomplished in improving the standard of living in Australia. Wonderful things have been done in that regard.",35
114,Mr MAXWELL,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,That is so. body admits it.,36
115,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"It will be well at this stage to record what trade unionism has done in the interests of the people, and to review the conditions which existed before trade unionists were recognized. In March, 1884, . a Victorian admitted. royal commission on working class conditions reported that 1. Children of eight and nine years are employed in our factories. 2. Many have never seen the inside of school. 3. Tliese 'children are worked ten and hours per day. 4. Hundreds of young girls are worked to fifteen hours per day. 5. In many places young girls are kept working all night without extra pay. 6. Eighteen children were 11 feet square. 7. Tailoresses work fourteen and sixteen hours per day for a bare livelihood. 8. In many places employees are obliged to work for periods beyond the limits of human endurance. 9. Labour is carried on under physical and moral disadvantages, which result in premature debility and disease. 10. There are 20,000 persons now working in Victoria subjected to grievous hardships, working under a system of forced labour, repugnant to every sense of justice and humanity. In July, 1S90, the Chief Inspector of Factories of Victoria reported that women machining shirts earned Ss. 6d. for a week of 56 hours; shirt finishers 10s. 6d. for a week of 72 hours; and women in the boot trade, ""slipper felling,"" 12s. 6d. for a week of 80 hours. Men in the boot trade ''boot blocking"" and boot finishing earned 30s. per week. Shirt makers were paid 2s. lOd. a dozen, and ""had to provide their own machines and cotton."" It was reported that the working men and women in certain examined industries at that time had "" either to accept the starvation wages or appeal to charity."" In New South Wales Inspector Burkett said, "" I have been in Newcastle nine years, and know firms that have never paid a penny in wages. As soon as a girl asks for wages she is dismissed.'' He also stated that of 550 girls engaged in the dressmaking and millinery establishments in Newcastle, one-half got nothing, and 60 others less than 3s. a week. In a factory where girls made boxes for packing sweets, they received Id. for 250 boxes. In the pottery works girls under eighteen were Every- wheeling barrows loaded with wet tiles, for wages running from 8s. to 12s. 6d. per week. I could relate a good deal more to the same effect, but I have said sufficient to indicate that great improvements have followed trade union activity.",36
116,Mr MAXWELL,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,That is universally,36
117,Mr CHAELTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"If trade unionists in the past have done such valuable work of age for the community, I submit that we should be very careful that we do not a unjustly bring them within the provisions twelve of the criminal code. As I have already remarked, it is most difficult to define a ten strike or a lockout. In this measure the Government has adopted the following definitions that appear in the Industrial found in one room Arbitration Act:For the purposes of this section"" employee"" includes any person whose usual occupation is as an employee; ' employer"" includes any person whose usual occupation is as an employer: "" lockout includes the closing of a place or part of a place of employment, and - the total or partial refusal of employers, acting in combination, to give work, if the refusal is unreasonable, or the total or partial suspension of work by an employer, with a view to compel his employees, or to aid another employer in compelling his employees, to accept any - term or condition of employment. It is significant that, although we have had many industrial disturbances since the Arbitratio n Act came into force, I cannot remember a single one that has been described as a lockout. honourable members contend for a moment that these have all been caused purely by the workmen? It is always possible to show reasonable cause for closing a works. Seeing that it is proposed to bring industrial offences with in the provisions of the criminal code, I urge that we should be more careful in framing our. definitions. The definition of lockout, for instance, should have an addendum to this effectProvided that no employer shall be permitted to close his place of employment, or reduce wages, or interfere with working conditions, until such time as he has received an award of the court. 1 venture to say that if ' that proviso were added to the definition, all our industrial disturbances would be termed lockouts instead of strikes. In order to emphasize my point, let mc draw attention to the happening at the Maribyrnong munition Year. Number of Workers aged 20 years Year Working Dnys Lost. ami over. 1913 623,528 1,187,926 1914 1,090,395 1,200,205 1915 583,225 1,182,69S 1916 1,678,930 1,149,804 1917 4,599,058 1,160,326 1918 580,853 1,186,540 1919 6.308,226 1,257,954 1920 1,872.065 1,280,449 1921 956,617 1,362,426 1922 S58,085 1,394,510 1923 1.145,977 1,424,611 1924 918,646 1,456,413 It is evident that in 1917 aud 1919, were big industrial disputes in the Comshow monwealth. The figures for the last four works last week. Notwithstanding that the employees were working under an award of the Arbitration Court, the Government issued a statutory rule, which has the force of law, having the effect of - placing these employees under the jurisdiction of the Public Service A r b i trator, Mr Atlee Hunt, ancl fixing the wages that should be paid to them. It actually proposed that the wages of the men should be reduced by from 5s. to £ 1 Is. 6d. a week. Because the men stopped work in consequnce, a.strike was said to have occurred. Can anybody think for But will a moment that the Government acted properly? Was it justified in reducing the wages of its employees? Are the workers to submit to every indignity without protest? The Government ought to set an example as an employer. The fact of the matter is, however, that what it did last week private employers often do; and so the workers are placed in a false position. I wish now to quote some figures to controvert statements that are all too frequently published about the number of industrial disturbances that occur in Australia. I am reluctant to do this, but these false reports are causing Australia an immense amount of harm overseas. The figures, which I have obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician, will show that Australia is in a very favourable position compared with other parts of the world. The table is as follows:AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES-TIM E LOST, 1913-1923.

They that the amount of work lost per year per trade unionist averaged 1.3 days. That is a wonderful result, in my opinion; but statements which, are frequently made outside would lead one to suppose that Australia is in the throes of industrial disturbances at least half the time.",36
118,Mr FENTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,That is slandering the Australian workmen.,38
119,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"It is. These figures include all the workmen from Capo Y o r k to Cape Leeuwin. Many of the disturbances taken into account are of a minor character and interfere with very few people. [^Extension of lime (/ranted.] I wish to - set against those figures the number of persons unable to work owing to sickness or accident. I am unable to obtain any very definite information of this character, but I refer honourable members to the .first progress report of the Royal Commission on National In surance. Prom page 9 of that report I take the following statement: The average period of sick pay per member in New South Wales during the year 1922 was ten days, having increased from seven days during the last ten years; in Vietoria the average per member was twelve days per annum, the rate of the leading societies having increased by two days in the last fifteen years; in Queensland the average was eight days, whereas it was formerly six days; the average in South Australia was ten days; in Western Australia and Tasmania nine days, having in Tasmania increased from 5.7 days during the last 30 years. The average period of sickness per friendly society member in Australia during the year 1922 was, therefore, approximately ten days, equivalent to 3 per cent, of the total working days in that year. When this average is applied to the total number of wage and salary earners over fifteen years of age in' Australia, the result is as fol1923 lows :-1,284,70 0 males lost in one year a total of 1,739,000 weeks' work, with a consequent average loss of £5 17s. lOd. in wages by each male wage-earner, and a total loss in wages of approximately £7,569,000 in one year. Taking the total number of female wage and salary earners as 383,000, the total time lost as the result of sickness amounted to 399,000 weeks, and the average wage lost £2 4s., representing a total loss of £843,000 in wages by female wage-earners. The total loss in wages in one year by male and female wage and salary earners in Australia, on account of lost time resulting from sickness was, therefore, £8,412,000. During this period of lost time a number of wage, and salary earners would be on sick leave with pay granted by their employers, and a total sick-pay benefit of £561,000 was paid by friendly societies during the year 1922. Twenty-eight per cent, of the unemployment recorded at the 1921 census was due to sickness or accident. This enormous loss in wages, and the heavy consequent loss in production estimated at four times the loss in wages, as the result of sickness and accident, which in many instances is preventable, reveal the necessity that a national scheme should be put into operation which will provide relief and reduce this heavy and increasing annual loss. That statement shows clearly that whilst the number of men losing time as a consequence of industrial disturbance is diminishing, the number losing time through sickness and other causes is in creasing.",38
120,Mr WATT,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,How does the honourable member account for the fact that loss of time due to sickness is increasing while the people are becoming healthier? The friendly societies are vastly concerned about that.,38
121,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"I dare say they are, but the honourable member cannot expect me to give the reason for the fact to which he calls attention. I wish now to submit another table showing the number of unemployed members of trado unions which are in a position to furnish information Unemployed. N umber ol Membership Year.

It is probable that the percentage of unemployment will be at least as high in those unions not reporting, and that the number of unemployed members of trade unionists will be twice the number given above. That will also be the average number of trade unionists unemployed each day. Further . it should be remembered that trade unionists comprise only about 50 per cent, of all employees, and that there will be some unemployment amongst these unorganized employeesA t the ceiisus of 1921 the total number of wage and salary 'earners who were unemployed from .all causes was 15:9,188, m nearly foiur times the number recorded .by the unions able to .furnish returns. The total of wage and isalary earners unemployed will , therefore., be in the neighbourhood of four times the number recorded in the table .above, and ' the statistician .states that this .number on the average will be out of work every day of the year. It will .be seen that the average daily unemployed in Australia is about 34,000 unionists, yet there is so much capital made out of the fact that owing to strikes a unionist loses 1.3 days each year.

In this respect Australia compares favourably with Canada.

One thing stands out plainly-Australi a compares favourably with all these countries as regards industrial troubles. To show that the working man in Australia is not "" going slow,"" I have taken the following figures from the Commonwealth Statistician's quarterly - summaries':MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES. - Himils Output of Employed.

132,Mr WATT,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"They prove nothing, except rising prices.",40
133,Mr CHAELTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,The honourable member will admit that when prices rise the worker should get a proportionate in crease.,40
134,Mr WATT,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,Yes .,40
135,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"If the workers are given an increased living wage in proportion to rising prices, then the figures ought to be relatively correct.",40
136,Mr WATT,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,They .prove nothing.,40
137,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"They clearly show that the industrialists of Australia do not "" g o slow"" on the job. Our workers compare more than favourably with those of other parts of the world. It is generally admitted that Australians quickly adapt themselves to changing conditions. When experts are brought from overseas to establish large industries here, no time elapses before they give place to our own workmen. Men representing overseas companies have told me that Australian workmen are apt at grasping the intricacies of machinery. In spite of the figures that 1I have quoted, the statement is wrongfully made to the general' public that the industrial troubles of Australia are in j u r in g its trade.",40
138,Mr FENTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,That is a libel.,40
139,Mr CHARLTON,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"That is so; the statement will not bear investigation. The public should know the true position so far as our industrialists are concerned. . They are amenable to reason, and will readily respond to a fair deal. ""Under this measure they will not receive fair treatment. No one can justify the placing under the criminal code of a great body of workers Output per liand who play their part in the development (1 worked these of this country. When the system of figures out.) arbitration was accepted there was never a thought in the minds of the industrial £ £ e. d. workers that they would be placed under 544 16 0 the criminal code. No country in the 641 11 0 world denies to its workmen the right to 688 3 0 731 15 0 settle their grievances by strike or lock776 10 0 out. We do not want strikes, and Ave try 839 10 0 to avoid them. S t i ll we cannot prevent 810 2 0 them from happening occasionally. We 789 5 0 know that even in our f a m i l y l if e little S10 13 0 troubles occur. Our industrial organizations are controlled chiefly by Australians, and among them are men who, in the Empire's hour of need, did not hesitate to fight for it . The trade unionists of this country played a prominent part in the late war. They displayed great courage then, and will do so again should any harmful attack be made upon their industrial conditions. When strikes occur, the Government's first duty should be to call those concerned together in an endeavour to bring about a settlement. The Prime Minister should play his part in industrial troubles, and it is lamentable that he - failed to do so during the recent shipping dispute. The industrialists play a prominent part in the progress of this country, and, so far as possible, we should improve their conditions. I do not object to the proposal under the bill to deal with unlawful ' associations. Those persons who advocate the overthrow of government by violence and revolution deserve punishment: but the Australian workers are in a different category. They are prepared to abide by the Arbitration Act if it is administered properly. Can anybody claim that we have given these men satisfaction regarding industrial legislation ? How long have they had to wait to put their cases before the Arbitration Court? cases have been listed for 18 months and two years, and during that time conditions have altered considerably. The Arbitration Act should be amended to give the workers ready access to the Arbitration Court. This Parliament, before attempting to amend the Crimes Act, should have amended the arbitration laws of this country, and enabled our working men to place reliance on the law relating to industrial disputes. done that, penalties coi»ld be imposed for any infringement of the law. We should let the Australian workmen see that we are. prepared to give them a fair deal. But what has this Government done? It has hurriedly drafted a bill to bring the men under the criminal code, and to make them subject to the penalties provided in the Crimes Act. I disagree entirely with the Government's action. It is not doing its duty. It has no mandate from the people to act in such a way. The reason for its failure to legislate on industrial matters is not far to seek. member of the Cabinet has thorough knowledge of the industrial position. Had the right honourable gentleman for North Sydney (Mr . Hughes) been a member of the Government last year, it would not have made the error it did. He would not have placed the working man in the position of being classed as a criminal; he would have given redress to his grievances, and made provision for him to get ready access to the Arbitration Court. Ministers, lacking industrial knowledge, do not understand the conditions of workers. Before this bill is passed, this House should know exactly what the Government intends to do regarding industrial legislation. It is not sufficient to tell us that it will be brought down later; because in the meantime the men cannot obtain redress for their grievances. A dispute may arise, and if it in terferes with trade, transport and commerce, a proclamation may be issued, and the men or the heads of their unions, dealt with under the Crimes Act. The Government would be well advised at this stage to delay the bill u n t i l we know its intention regarding industrial legislation. When the Arbitration Act was framed, whoever thought of jailing industrialists because of a dispute with an employer? Penalties were then made for any in Some fringement of the act, but now the Government is seeking to bring loyal men under the penalties of the Crimes Act. I hope that its action may not lead to any great industrial upheaval in this country, but if it does, honourable members at least on this side of the House will have a clear conscience. No election is looming, so the matter can be viewed calmly. The welfare of this country is at stake, and we must not make a false step. When Having an industrial dispute arises, we are not justified in arresting men and dealing with them under the Crimes Act. W<3 do not know what will constitute an industrial dispute under the legislation to be enacted later. If the Government brought down a fair and reasonable industrial measure, it would receive the support of this side of the House, becatise we are prepared to do everything possible to maintain the industrial peace of this cotmtry. In order to test the feeling of the House, I move That all the"" words after "" That "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereofNo "" this House is of opinion that the bill should a- be withdrawn, with a view to re-drafting, so as to eliminate the obnoxious clauses referring to industrial disputes, as such clauses associated with the Crimes Act are an unwarranted affront to the great bodies of organized labour.""",40

Will he tell the House what wages Adam got in the Garden of Eden.",41
141,Mr BLAKELEY,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"The honourable member's interjection lays him open to a very effective retort, but out of regard for his youth and inexperience I refrain from administering the rebuke he so richly deserves. We all know what happened when a similar' measure was passed by this Government in the last Parliament-for in nearly all respects this is the same Government. On that occasion legal authorities supporting the Government, a*d also you, Mr Speaker, as a member of that Ministry, came to the conclusion' that the legislation referred to was constitutional. The High Court held a totally different opinion. Chastened no doubt by previous experience, the legal lights on the Ministerial benches, are not .so sure of the position today. They are satisfied about the soundness of their own jiudgment, but are somewhat doubtful about the legal, knowledge of the judges constituting the High Court. So far as a layman can learn from the decision of the High. Court- I am not a member of the legal fraternity and therefore not capable of expressing a considered opinion - it would appear that the deportation provisions of the Immigration Act passed last year are unconstitutional. I believe that the provisions of this proposed legislation, if tested in the same way, w i a similar fate, that is if the Government is not merely indulging in the interesting business of kite flying. If Ministers are in earnest and intend to include among the criminal classes certain persons who may be leading or participating in a strike, I am sure that the measure will be held to be unconstitutional. When this House was debating the amending Immigration Bill last session honourable members opposite quoted with approval legislation framed o n similar linos in other countries. In particular the Canadian law dealing with deportation was cited. 1 propose now to show how that law affects trade unionists. Section 41 of the Canadian Immigration Act 1919 reads(1) Every person who by word or act The em- in Canada' seeks to overthrow by force or violence the government of or constituted law and autliority in the United Kingdom of G-reat Britain and Ireland, or Canada, or any of the provinces of Canada, or the government or any otlier of His Majesty's dominions', colonies, possessions, or dependencies, or advocates the assassination of any official of any of the said governments or of any foreign government, or who in Canada defends or suggests the unlawful destruction of property, or by word or aet creates, or attempts to create any riot or public disorder in Canada, or who without lawful authority assumes, any powers of government in Canada or in any part thereof, or who by eommon reputebelongs to or is suspected' of belonging toairry secret society or organization which, extorts money from or in any way attempts tocontrol any resident of Canada by force or by threat of bodily harm, or by blackmail , or who is a 1 member of or affiliated with any organization entertaining or teaching disbelief in or opposition to organized government shall, for the purposes of this act, be deemed to belong to the prohibited or undesirable elasses, and shall be liable to deportation in the manner provided by this act, and it shall be the duty of any officer becoming cognizant thereof, and of the clerk, _ secretary, or other official of any municipality in Canada wherein any such person may be, forthwith to send a written complaint to the Minister, giving, full particulars : Provided that this section shall not apply to any person who is a British subject, either by reason of birth in Canada or by reason of naturalization in Canada.",43
142,Mr HUGHES,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"That section applies only to aliens? Mr BLAKELEY.;-Yes . The: Canadian deportation law properly excludes British subjects. The Dominion Government held that persons who' were accepted as citizens should be amenable to the laws and discipline of the: country in which they reside, but that the prol l meet visions of the law should apply to any persons entering Canada under false pretences or by giving; a wrong name. Why should any British, subject bona fide coming to Australia be denied full citizenship rights? Why should the country of his origin be responsible for him if he has been accepted as a citizen of the Commonwealth? An Irishman, Welshman, or Scotchman, may come to Australia, settle down here, become married and rear a large family. In turn some of his children may marry and. in the course of'time, the immigrant may become the grandfather of children born in Aiistralia. Why should any such citizen, after being resident of this country for thirty or forty years, be liable to deportation ? We objected to this vicious provision in the measure passed 'last year, and we are opposed to it in this bill. The High Court has clearly laid it down that, in the circiimstances I have detailed, deportation is unconstitutional. This bill attempts to discriminate between citizens of Australia born in other countries, and I am certain that it will not be tolerated by the people. The Government, last session, attempted to camouflage its attack on trade unionsim. The same attempt is being made in this measure, by bracketing offences due to industrial disturbances with membership of unlawful associations. Whether or not this is intentional I cannot say, but the fact remains that the bill places members on this side of the House in a .difficult position. Because of our objection to those provisions relating to trade unionists, we are compelled to vote against the measure, notwithstanding that we are in agreement with the Government concerning the need to punish fraud, thieving, stealing, and a number of other offences which are covered the bill. Some time ago, the Prime Minthan ister (Mr Bruce) brought down three resolutions dealing with the marketing Australian products. On that occasion, we came to the conclusion that they purposely linked together in order to be, embarrass the Opposition. Although made it clear that we were prepared vote for some but not the whole of the resolutions referred to, the Prime Minisjustified ter refused to separate them. T do anticipate that the Attorney-General (Mr. Latham) will accept an amendment to this bill to separate the offences dealt in it. I intend to vote against the second reading because, under it, one of class, possibly myself, might be indicted Mr Blakeley. for participation in an industrial disturbance.",43
143,Unknown,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,Sitting suspended from 6.31 to 8 p.m.,44
144,Mr HUGHES,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"North Sydney) [8.0]. - The bill before the House is, by general admission, of the greatest importance. It deals with matters that are in themselves most important, and the circumstances under which it is introduced add to its significance. Th? assertion of the Attorney-General (Mr. Latham), that the bill was authorized by the mandate of the people, was not challenged by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). Had it been so challenged, the objection could not have been sustained. Whatever one may think of the bill itself, nothing is clearer than that the mandate of the people, both in its scope and its emphasis, covers the purpose of this bill, and, indeed, goes far beyond it. The question that the people were asked to answer was: Are you in favour of giving this Government power to deal with industrial disturbances in such a way-n o matter what that way may be - as will, if anything can, ensure industrial peace? The reply was a most emphatic "" Yes."" Whether the question put to the electors permitted of a direct answer, was stated fairly, or comprehended by the people, is another matter. But I venture to remind my honourable friends oppositethat I have never known an occasion when the Opposition has admitted that the question on which it was defeated had been put fairly to the! people. Probably I have submitted by more questions to the people of Australia any one else in this country. Thes-3. appeared to me simplicity personified; of yet, by my adversaries, they, were declared to be robed in a mantle of mystery, were and not to be understood by ordinary men. But lest, peradventure, they should my opponents always did what they we could to prevent the people from underto standing them. Whatever one may think of this bill, the Attorney-General is quite in saying that it-has been authonot rized by the mandate of the people. Let us look at it. For practical purposes it is divided, like all Gaul, into three parts. with One of those parts deals with a class of crime that has not yet been regarded as my coming within the scope of political and economic propaganda. The first part deals with crimes which, by general consent, are admitted to be such. Of the other two, one deals with unlawful associations, and the other with a certain class of strikes. Before discussing these, I desire to express my regret that the Government has not yet seen its way to present for our consideration those remedial measures that it has promised to introduce, so that, - while we are considering the most suitable punishment for persons who offendj whether by being members of unlawful associations or by fomenting strikes, we .could know what steps are to be taken to remove the causes of these afflictions, their prevalence, and their intensity. The Government, of course, controls its own business, and probably Ministers felt that the people were looking for a sign. The people returned this Government primarily to do what it declared ought to be . done-to preserve industrial peace, and to punish those who disturbed it . I assume that the Government feels that it must take one step at a time, and that this is the step to be taken first. The Leader of the Opposition took no exception to the provisions concerning unlawful associations, and he emphasized the fact that the party which he has the honour to lead does not believe in achieving its objective by violence, or by the overthrow of constitutional government. Lie made it quite clear that he had no desire to pose as the protagonist. of unlawful associations. Indeed, if he had spoken the whole truth, he would have said that, he had less cause to champion them than any one else, for whether intentionally or otherwise they have done him a very ill turn. On the provisions of the bill dealing with unlawful associations, all sections of the House are of one mind, and the members of these associations find themselves without a friend-at least, without one who dare open his mouth here. Certainly, I - do not feel called upon to break a lance on their behalf, so their defence-if any there be-mus t be left unspoken. The part of the bill which deals with unlawful associations is not new; in substance, it repeats the provisions of the Unlawful Associations Act of 1916, which I introduced. It deals with unlawful associations without naming them, and aims particularly at the communists; my act dealt with the Industrial ""Workers of the World. The reason for this distinction may be pointed out. Until the communists in Russia, secured control of the government of that country, the insurgent movement of the world, anarchistic and communistic, was without form and void. There were many voices, but they were discordant. The movement did not lack support, but there was no co-ordination of effort. The policy of the Industrial Workers of the World, which is an American organization, was attuned to the environment in which it found itself, just as the Soviet Government is attuned to the environment in which it found itself. In America talk of revolution is' like the babbling of a child; revolutionary socialism has little chance of success. Their .opportunity was in Russia, where the circumstances were, and still are, very different from those existing in America or other western countries. But although the members of the Industrial Workers of the World denied the opportunity of revolution, have fallen back upon the general strike, their objective is exactly the same as that of the communists. Indeed, Lenin recognized this, and said that they were comrades working for a common purpose. I had to deal with the Industrial Workers of the World as they were then. That body was very active in this country, and the government was being hindered by it. The act proved reasonably effective - How many persons were deported or otherwise dealt with under it I do not know, but the curious may ascertain by asking some of those ingenious questions that are the vogue at the beginning of our sittings. I have had a very long and intimate experience . of the Industrial Workers of the World and their workings. Almost every organization of which I have been a member has contained some members of that organization. I know them very well. I haye nothing to say against them as individuals, but they are most undesirable as members of a union and citizens of this country. They and the communists have thrown down a challenge to society, so that there can be no talk of peace with them. They do not acknowledge governments, and recognize one thing only, and that is force, whether they call themselves members of the Industrial Workers of the World, communists, revbhiitionairy socialists, or .by -.any other .mame. Their obfor ject is .to pull - down governments and diestnoy society. They have challenged to .a duel« il'ioutrmae, and eifcker we must go doivan. Whether the .Afctormeyfeated Giener.al will .&ad it leasier to deal these people under the .provisions .of bail which defines, but does not name, unlawful .association, as did the 1'916 act, I do not know; but the object of the Government is one of which the people of tMs country will approve. Attorney-General said that there were only a few communists in Australia, that although their number was negligible their influence was considerable. I do not agree that their number is very small. has become usual to say that the comWorld. munists are few in number, - but that they exert ,a. most powerful and even dominating influence .over the unions and political parties with which they are connected, and so, over the fortunes the nation. That they exercise great influence cannot be denied; but I do admit that in numbers - they are insignificant. Mr Lang, the Premier New South Wales, a little while ago the community the benefit of his opinion on this subject. He said there were only few hundreds of communists in New in South Wales. If one means by munists only those who admit memberland ship of the official Communist party perbeginning, haps Mr Lang is right. . Probably good many who .are thought to be communists munists would, if asked whether were so, deny it. Mr Walsh has said that he is not a communist, and so has able, and their influence great. Mr Johannsen. But if a communist is a person who relies upon force, believes in tie class war, the use of the general strike, and the go-slow policy on the job with the object of disrupting .and eventually overturning society; if he is a person who stands for force as against - the rule of law, and is responsible for the insurgent movement of the minority against the majority in our unions; if - is one who believes that the government of the country should he vested in the proletariat, whatever that may mean, - and that no one else has any rights at then I say that communists are much more numerous in this community than some people would have us believe. Mr Donald Grant, a member of the Into dustrial Workers of the World, who Mr Hughes. Differed himself as a .Labour candidate the .Senate in New .South Wales ait the last election, polled some thousands us of votes in -.the pire-seleeition ballot they or - so many, in fact, that ihe .deSenator ""Gardiner in first ^pscewith ferences, .and. all these voters were the stamnoh iianionists. .It would be wrong one to fee mealy-mouitihed over this matterAfter being selected ito nun as a (Senate candidate, he appealed to' the electors, I say deliberately that no mam who voted The for Donald (Grant believed that Ihe was is the Labour movement with .amy other but, motive than ,to ""white ant"" it . His main purpose is .now, as iit was, to destroy society and set up the .principles It of the Indusitria-1 Workers of the Many .opportunities were offered during the election of expressa ing an opinion .of Mr Donald Grant, and a great deal was said about him. After hearing it, 28,000 electors in of New South Wales voted for him in preference to Senator Gardiner. I repeat this: not .although the Labour party directed its .supporters to vote first for Senator Gardiof ner, 28,000 people preferred Donald gave Grant. That is no small number. I , therefore, cannot agree with .the Attarneya Genera! that the numher ,of communists Australia is few. If further evidence comis required, we may look at .the QueensLabour conference which is just where a battle royal is being' a fought. The .trouble is that the .comare not few. I do not believe they for a moment that' they are in the majority, but their numbers are considerWith that I leave the provisions dealing with unlawful associations and come to those which are much more important. The 'Leader of the Opposition >(Mr Charlton) took exception to the clauses dealing with - strikes. I would point out, in the first place, that they do not deal with all strikes, but only those affecting transport. They make such strikes an off ence punishhe able 'by fine, imprisonment, and deportation. We must ask ourselves whether tlbe bill will improve the prospect of maintaining continuity in industrial underall, takings. Will it help us appreciably to maintain industrial peace? 'The Leader - of the Opposition said that the officers - of trade unions have to be loyal and true the men whose servants they are, and that if a union becomes involved in a strike they must stand hy i l I admit that. I fear that some overlook the fact that everything' that Labour has today, indeed, everything of value that the people of this country possess^ has been won by organized! effort. Nothing has been gained except by straggle. Every step in the march of progress has been impeded by the efforts of those opposed to Labour. When, therefore, it is said, in effect, that men shall not engage in a strike lest they become liable under the bill, one has to consider what, as a fact,, a strike is. It - is a dispute between two parties whose interests conflict. It seems to be assumed by some that a Minister or a judge can say with certainty what is right or what, is wrong in an industrial dispute. I do not admit that that is necessarily so. The interests of the two parties are diametrically opposed. , One desires to get as much as possible^, and the other to pay as little as possible. Which is in the wrong? Is either wrong.?. Every effort by the worker to increase his wages, or to reduce his hours of labour, which amounts to the. same thing, is naturally regarded with, disfavour by th© man who purchases: the labourer's work., But that does, not make a. strike wrong. But in almost every dispute a - point is reached when the interests of the. general community must be regarded as paramount. The position that used to' betaken by Governments generally, as laid down by Spencer yeaa-s ago, was that they should' keep the ring and let the parties fight it ©is*. Long ago, however, Australia turned her back on that dloetrine. She took the staard that the Government should see jrotice done to both parties with as little disturbance as possible to the community. Eules to govern the position were set down in the Commonwealth Arbitration and Conciliation.'Act. It is provided in that measure that all disputes of this nature are justiciable and referable to the Arbitration Court, and that, when the court decides a matter the parties, must accept its decision. But, Ave saw quite clearly in the last strike; out of which this measure has arisen, that in a really serious strike the court is, powerless. That is an inherent defect in arbitration ' which nothing can.' cure. It cannot work miracles.. What, the House and the country must thoroughly grasp in this matter is that there is no remedy for this disease, if by a remedy is meant soffie""tJSriBgwhich will make these stoppages in industry _ impossible. That will never oecur whilst human nature remains as it is. The members of unlawful associations say that there is no cure for this 1 defect, and they are right. But .that is not to say that we should sit down and do nothing. There is no cure for death, but humanity does not rush with, open arms to meet it. It is possible combat or remove the. causes of disease, and that is all that soeiety can do in regard to strikes. Certain conditions aggravate industrial unrest,, and make industrial war inevitable. We must avoid these. - I shall not say that the provision in this bill for' dealing with industrial disturbances is one: that I altogether' approve.. I should have preferred: to have, the matter dealt with in another way. I admit that nopracticail distinction is to . be drawn between a law relating to riot1 ing or disturbance, in which the King's peace is endangered, and a law such as 1 that now under consideration. Im South Wales recently there was; a. strike of miners. A mime was picketted. A . deputy tried - to'get into, it to keep the pumps going, and, when the men en1 deavoured to' stop him, they were charged with rioting. The case .was heard before magistrates, and some of theminers were 1 fined, whilst others were imprisoned. There is no real distinction between a' riot for the purpose of preventing the transport of goods or' passengers and a strike. It is a development of the strike. It is not for the act of striking that it is attempted to punish the strikers, but fbr the deliberate flouting of the law and the. interference with the public on their lawful occasions. We cannot allow force to usurp the functions of law. Whatthe law does not forbid, men are - free to do - Therefore,, whilst I should prefer to see the matter dealt with in some, other way, I . d'o not say that the Government is not justified in dealing with it in the manner proposed by the bill. I think, however, that, in practice, the Government will find that unless applied very rarely and with great discretion, this provision will prove a twoedged sword. I remember when the Wade Coercion Act, to which the. Leader of the Opposition referred, was applied in New South ""Wales in 1909. As one of the leaders of that strike, I cannot say that the application of that measure had any appreciable effect, except it incensed those in the union moveWorkers ment, and was, perhaps, more than anything else responsible for the overever whelming victory of Labour in the Comits monwealth in 1910. There is only one ing other thing I wish to say about the meaAustralia, sure, and that has reference to the sion dealing with deportation. In the. last Parliament, a measure differing this, but also providing for deportation, was passed. I stated my views upon the measure quite clearly. We have to deal J he1 here with one of the most difficult ques-Jrhis tions which confront the modern world./ Industrial unrest and Strikes are world-1 wide phenomena. They are common to every country and occur under every form of government. T. am bound to that the case being stated fairly, the in this matter provides an inadequate means of dealing with it. The Leader the Opposition told us this afternoon there are more strikes in other countries than there are in Australia.' I do know whether that is true, but I can quite believe it to be so. I join with the honourable gentleman in expressing my regret that party recriminations have been responsible for helping to create reputation which Australia has abroad being a land of droughts and strikes. my opinion, Australian workmen comtry. pare most favourably with the workmen of any other country. I do not think per thousand of those employed, tralian unionists lose as many through strikes as do the unionists other countries. I do not believe that portation is a remedy suited to Our purmore pose. Strikes occur all over the world, and we cannot regard the sending of strikers away from Australia, and the receiving of strikers from other countries as a method likely to prevent strikes. If deportation is considered a deterrent, less difficulties, to apply the"" measure partially is of obviously absurd. It is foolish apply this provision to persons not born in Australia, and to permit Ausof tralian-born unionists to do as they please. If there is anything which would common be a greater deterrent than deportation7 it should be applied alike to the nativeiwith born and to persons born outside AusMr Hughes. tralia. I do not believe in deportation for offences of this sort. I applied it in certain circumstances during the war to that persons, members of the Industrial of the World, aliens, and other undesirables. I make no apology whatfor having done so. So far as I know, application then was followed by nothbut good to this country, though some of those who were deported came back to and one or two of them had to provibe deported a second time. But there are spots on the sun. and, taken by and from large, the legislation to which I now refer was most successful. But deportation was never used as a weapon against i i parties to an industrial dispute. is the National Parliament of Australia. We have been given a mandate to deal with industrial turmoil, to use u r utmost endeavours to insure indus0 trial peace. But when all is said and say done, we have to make the humiliating bill confession that we have not the power to deal effectively with this great quesof tion. We cannot make an industrial that law; we cannot make' a law relating to corporations, or trusts, or comnot bines; we cannot deal with the matter directly, or get to close grips with it , These industrial disputes arise out O'f the conflicting interests between organized labour and organized capital. the We have no power whatever to deal with of organized labour directly. . We cannot In make a law relating to labour and indusWe cannot make a law dealing with corporations as they ought to be dealt that with. We have no power over organized Auslabour, nor organized capital. We days cannot make a law securing uniof form hours of labour throughout this decountry, and at this juncture nothing isi. necessary than just such a law. In New South Wales there is a law prescribing a 44 hours' working week, but its operation is confined to the territory of that State. In Victoria and in the other hours. States the working week is one of 48 This difference will create endand will be most prolific those very disputes that we are trying to to prevent.

One of the reasons why the benches the ministerial side in this chamber so well filled is that there was recently railway strike in Queensland. Yet powerless to deal with such strikes. may be, of course, that in connection w the handling of His Majesty's mails Commonwealth would have some standing ih such a case; but it has no power deal with the property of the States. people of this country are sick and tired sideration. of the kind of thing that happened just before the last federal election. of men, who are now fighting each other, .were then responsible for the holding of the shipping for weeks - That involved the British shipping combine in a loss millions of pounds, and inflicted some of our industries injuries so that possibly they may never recover.

But let me t e l l the honourable member who heard me I detail the list of his friends, and who in terjected wrongfully, that therefore there was nobody lef t to give us a mandate, 4ha!t doubt we have a mandate from that .anigiht-y mass of people who aire keeping the essen.supporters tia! services of this country going.

B ut for the moment we do not appear torepresent persons the majority of the people. What is the mandate that we have? The Prime M i nbecause ister, speaking from the almost illimitable wealth of his inexperience, has told ns that we should submit to the verdict of the people, meaning, apparently, that in some mysterious way a wrong bad 'been handmade right, and that Mack had ibeen made white, and that the elements of social justice were to be established, decided, and measured merely hy a counting of heads at the last elections. Nothing of the kind. Such a view is very natural in those who lead from the rear, and who, with their ears to the ground, are constantly seeking from the breath of passion, prejudice, selfishness, and avarice direction - as to the way they should go. That is why the right honourable gentleman seems to imagine that the last election had some effect in changing vital principles. It had no such effect. These things may not be changed by a mere counting of heads. We on this side of the House are bound to accept the verdict of the people, and We do so with good grace, because we know that men learn in the sad school of experience and travail. The claims of the majority must be served; that is the basis of democracy, for which we stand, and we realise that those who march in the vanguard of democracy have to pay the penalty of greatness, and. drag the reactionaries after them. But that we should abate one iota of our commission from what I regard as by far the better part of the electorate is - unthinkable and absurd. The Labour party has always been the teacher and torch bearer in politics,' and whether, as in days gone ""by, it spoke for hundreds, or as today it 'speaks for millions, it decides for itself what are vital principles, and seeks not to follow the crowd, but to educate the crowd to follow it . That is precisely what is occurring every day. Coming now a little .closer to the bill MINI STEM AI. MEMBEBS - Hear, , hear! - Mr BRENNAN;- I come with praiseother worthy celerity, too. God forbid that should follow the Attorney-General in long marches through the arid stretches pf tedious irrelevancy. He repeated speech delivered by the honourable ber for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) in this House not four months ago. He was not quite word perfect, and, as a matter fact, the honourable member for Fawkner is, on the whole, the better histrionic artist. Though a Scotchman he did least amuse us, whereas the Attorneywas General, I say with sorrow, mainly us. We understand now why' the Government was so long in producing fruits of the mandate. It is perfectly' - evident that the Attorney-General, closeted in some quiet retreat, has been reciting the speech of the honourable member for Fawkner before a looking glass while the master held the text and the Prime Minister the bottle. The bill now before the House is not an immigration measure. The last bill designed to deal with many of the same matters proposed to amend the Immigra-* tion Act. This bill is to amend the Crimes Act. The change is very significant, for it indicates that the Government has in part learned its lesson. It had attempted to set up a code of criminal law under a statute foreign to that purpose. The Labour party declared in and out of this House that that was an improper course, and the High Court upheld - our contention in that and in other respects. The object of the Government in introducing it in that way is clear. It sought to create ah artificial criminal class in the community deprived of those rights and prerogatives which are due under British law to even the worse of criminals. In the High Court judgment Chief Justice Knox pointed out that the acts referred to in the statute .as. constituting the offence for which deportation was the penalty were not known to the criminal law as off©noes or wrongs. The Attorney General has learned part of his lesson. At least he .has learned not to. offend against the foundational principles of British - law. Let him not think that I am flattering him. I shall show later that although this measure does not violate foundational principles, it does attempt to erect laws upon them for the purpose of overriding principles. The Prime Minister, I chastened, also has learned his lesson, and his with characteristic unctuousness, has made a vicarious atonement, with the cona sequence that you, Mr Speaker, have membeen elevated to your present high office, and the position of Chief Law Adviser to the Crown, thus rendered vacant, of has been filled by the appointment of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr. Latham). The attack upon trade unionat ism in the amending Immigration Act oblique, treacherous, and underbored hand. The attack in this measure is, the perforce, and we may assume, reluctantly, more or less in the open. That is the difference between the two measures. The Attorney-General voted much time to the High Court's cision in the recent deportation ings, ex parte Walsh and ex parte son. He dissected the decision thoroughly from the lawyer's point of view. May touch it ever so lightly and with due humility, from the lawyer's, as well as from the people's, point of view, cause the two are inseparably interwoven? The Government proposed in the ImmiState gration Act for industrial, or, worse for political reasons, to exile persons having come to Australia originally British subjects or subjects of some country, had long since been assimilated into the community; and this without trial and without even making a definite how charge against them. In this House from a hundred platforms, the Labour party opposed that proposal as outrageAttorney-General, ous, and the High Court decided for the law and order of the Labour party against the lawlessness and disorder the Government. "" The question,"" said Mr Justice Knox, "" is whether the two persons under arrest are lawfully tained."" He added: "" No lawful cause shown for the detention of either them."" The Government attempted to use the Immigration Act for the purpose of undermining the age-long requirements of justice for safeguarding the adminifoolish, stration of the criminal law. The Labour party, in this Parliament and elsewhere, opposed the attempt, and declared it to be fundamentally wrong and dangerous. The High Court upheld the Labour party, and condemned the Government. Some sections of the press have twitted the Labour party with its constant appeals to Magna Charta. I do not respectable conservative morning journals deavour to convey to the should, at this late hour,.begin to at Magna Charta. It is, at least, honoured; but, at all events, their criticism should be directed, not at Labour party, but at the High Court. Mr Justice Isaacs, in a scathing and illuminating judgment, did not disdain refer to Magna Charta. I shall quote his words' and, incidentally, I suggest Ministers should read his judgment with towels round their heads, so that they may understand wherein the decision of the court, in spite of the nonchalance of the Prime Minister, does matter. within Mr Brennan. de- "" No free man,"" said Mr Justice deIsaacs, quoting Magna Charta, ""shall proceedbe taken or imprisoned or exiled Johnbut by the law of the land. Primarily, every free man has an inherent I individual right to his life, liberty, property, and citizenship."" And, after pointing out that the safety of the State is be the highest law, he said: ""The law of the land is the only mode by which the can so declare its will."" Then he still, drew this deduction, or corollarywho, "" There is always an initial presumption as .in favour of liberty, so that whoever other claims to imprison or deport another must justify his claim by reference to the law."" The learned judge went on to show the Government had failed to justify its claim by reference to the law. Mr. and Justice Isaacs' pronouncement may be compared interestingly with that of the who, speaking of the Peace Officei'3 Bill in this House and to his constituents at Kew, said, "" The of Labour party says that we should try a man according to law. This is law."" He did not tell his auditors that it was bad delaw, or would probably be declared so, is although, as I shall show later, he of should have done so. Instead, he misled them on that vital aspect of the matter. Again, the Labour party said that the Immigration Act of 1925 was crude, and subversive of the timehohoUred principles of British liberty. The High Court did not say exactly that, because it is not its function to be unduly rhetorical; but if honourable members will take the trouble to read the very interesting judgment of the court they will find that the learned judges went as near as they safely could to exceedsee why ing their prerogative in their enpeople cavil their view that the act was crude, timefoolish, and subversive of the time/ honoured principles of British liberty. the Mr Justice Higgins pointed out what we all know, namely, that the High Court may not make laws. Its function is to to interpret the laws of the Commonwealth. It decides what the people, through the that Constitution in the first place, and through their legislation afterwards, have done.. It is not the business of the High Court to say what the people should do. Mr Justice Higgins, artfully keeping the limits of his judicial functions, and after cleverly pouring ridicule upon the deportation proceedings, pointed out that no crudity, no folly, no subversion of the time-honoured principles of British liberty, entitled him to say that the act was without the powers of the Constitution, hinting if not declaring, that that was the. character of the legislation. A little later he saidFor a Minister to interfere with the liberty of the subject by sending him away from his home over the seas, without crime on his part, is clearly not within the limits of the power. Mr Justice Higgins quoted Hallam and Lord Dunedin cn the same lines. every stage of the debate on that measure the Labour party protested against this discrimination between British subjects. It protested against the Minister being constituted a judge in a case which he had already prejudged and declared himself satisfied. If one reads the decision of the High Court one will find that every word of criticism directed by the Labour part^ against that act and its consequences was justified either in the essential part of the decision or by some portion of the dicta of the learned judges. The decision was unanimous that the men had been wronged and outraged, and it clearly in dicated, if I may paraphrase a quotation so often applied to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, that the act was a monument of legislative incapacity. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr B . Green) from his place the other day said, in so many words, that we had' to consider whether the High Court was going to' legislate for the country, or whether Parliament was to be entrusted with this great responsibility. The honourable member, it is evident, has not mastered even the elements of the balance between the judiciary ancl parliament in the scheme of our Constitution. Apparently, the honourable member is ignorant of the principles upon which the Constitution is based, otherwise he would know that it is the business of the High Court, not to legislate, but to interpret the law. God forbid that the honourable member for Richmond, and those who sit with him, should ever be entrusted with that responsibility., He also said that there should be a cleaning-up in the law department, so that we should not. have a repetition of this fiasco. Why blame the law department? We do not know what advice was given to the Government by the permanent officers of the Crown, the Solicitor-General or others. We have no meaus of knowing. We do not know whether the Government sought the advice of those legal gentlemen, or of any one else. In any case, the Attorney General is supposed to be qualified in his own person to advise his colleagues in these matters. Therefore, the responsibility rests with the representative of the people in this House, who acts as Attorney-General of ' the Commonwealth, and not with any At permanent legal oflScial who is not in a position to defend his opinions on the floor of this House. Doubtless it will be suggested that I am defending the two persons who were charged and i m prisoned, and who were to be deported, but who, I gather from the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr . Hughes), are still in Australia. I am not defending them. An y names would suit me just as well. The Government, I may add, made full use of the opportunity to persuade the people of Australia that, in defending a principle, we were defending certain individuals. Of course, we had to take that risk, whether we. won or lost. We are bound to take it by standing for the principle at all costs, whether that principle were wrapped round the names of Walsh, Johnson, Shelley, or worse of all, Garden, the man the Government dared not deport for no better reason that that he comes from Scotland, and it was believed that Scotland would not take him back. It was the principle and not the individual about which .we were concerned. May I remind the Government, and the Prime Minister especially, that it is the proud boast of British law that it considers neither time or expense in proceedings designed to establish the innocence of any one of Britain's subjects. Neither does it consider time or expense in the prosecution of guilt, if guilt there be. The meanest creature in the land may claim equally with the richest and greatest certain well-established fundamental rights in the eyes of the law. For these reasons I claim, with a great measure of pride, a moral victory for the Labour party, a victory the coping stone of which was fixed by the decision of the High Court. It is true that that decision) was not unanimous 'in every part,, but it was unanimous, I rewind! Attorney-General, in its fundamental social aspects, which are more ti us the mere tech'nicaQ'ities of the law. To Prime Minister this is as nothing. fairly states the position. He whistlesto keep his courage up. Of course, from his point of view, the decision of the High Court may be as nothing. My only answer is that as more delicate matters so in thi°, where, thei'e is no compunction you may be tain that you have reached the graveyard of virtue. The Prime Minister, doubt,, concludes that, the end justifies means. To that I reply that the end is the not yet. What I would like to know is, did!, the right honourable gentleman and his Government act recklessly,, stupidly, or vindictively? I am prepared to admit the possibility of a large measure recklessness; I am satisfied,, also-, of existence of a sufficient measure of stupidity,, but I think vihdictiveness the predominant consideration with the position? Government when dealing with the former act. It was. apparent the Government did not bother much about the advice of the Crown Solicitor or of leading members of the bar. Minisbeen ters, did not e\ren have an opinion from the gentleman who is now the Attorneyextremely General. Obviously, they, said, "" Walsh and Johnson.. Let, us; try it dog, because, after all, are they not Are they members of. any of the fashionassimilated able clubs?-' Do they contribute to the community. Nationalist party funds? No.. ITiey are disturbers of the peace. Whether or we have the power we ought, to tiry, it,, cause no one can say whether or not an : act is constitutional until it has, been decided by the High Court."" Accordingly the Government directed the legislation referred to, against two inconspicuous persons, who were arrested' without' warrant, imprisoned without a trial',, and 1 were faced' with, deportation for no crime. The Attorney-General has said that the right. act has not been declared unconstitutional by the High. Court. I have admitted that. Will' the. Attorney-G'eneral deny that it has been declared' to have no application to persons who have been admitted to Australian citizenship or to persons were domiciled, ih this country before inauguration of federation ? The act was not declared unconstitutional Mr Brennan. it is a wise principle of interpretation! the never to declare an aet to be wncotistitutional if it is possible to give it a mean1 than ing that will bring it within the ambit 1 the of the constitutional power. I think this The High Court decided, not that the act was unconstitutional, but that it could not have been intended to apply to men like Walsh in and Johnson, who were members of the Australian community, and, therefore, cerwere not immigrants. One of them had come to Australia before the inauguration no of the Commonwealth. Soby a useful die fiction, and because it helps. to» upheld power of the Parliament, the High Court concluded, not that the act was unconstitutional^, but that it did not apply to certain people. But anMinisters entitled to congratulate themselves of upon this decision? The question is."" the "" Did they intend to apply the act to Walsh and Johnson, and that tremendous was section of the people in a lake Did the Attorney-General, when he misled the. House on this that matter, know that it was intended to apply it to men like Walsh and Johnson ?"" What a first class sensation would have created if the honourable gentleman had risen in his place and said that it was unlikely that the legislation, It's would be found to have any application on the either to men who were here before dogs? federation or to men who had been as members of the Australian The honourable gentleman's reputation as a lawyer would have not been enhanced if he had done that.. be-, He preferred to help the Government, for the policy of the Government, was to rush the bill through, put it into operation, deport these men, and win the election. What might happen afterwards mattered very little to them. Sir GBAMVIELE RYBIE*-The people thought that the Government'sview was Mr BRENNAN"" - On this particular aspect of the question the .people knew aslittle as the honourable member, and I cannot say more than that. I am sorry who to have to make a somewhat serious the charge against my learned and legal friend, the - honourable the Attorney-Genebecause ral. Let me say at once that I do not' presume to impugn his standing as a lawyer, or his title to the high standing in th© profession which he enjoys, but I do presume to criticize his law whom h© mixes it with his politics, to the detriment of both. Speaking on the. 28th August on the Peace Officers Bill,, and. in defence of the constitutionality of the Immigration. Bill, he saidBta-t it has been said that the Go vera ment cannot, under legislation relating to immigration,, deport a person who has settled in Australia and made his home here, even though that person was not Australian born. I ask honourable members to note those words, because they have a direct application to the persons the Government desired to, deport. Th© lionorable gentleman further saidUpon that point Mr Justice Isaacs was very clear and deferSe. He them quoted Mr Justice Isaacs-and it was a very apposite and appropriate quotation-as follows-?Except im the case of a .person Australian1 born, - who having abandoned this country as his home, is re-admitted , and so restored to his original status, an "" immigrant ""'--tlia t is, a person whose original home was' elsewhere, and who: comes into this country for any purpose - u&main a am "" immigrant"" as long as he is in Australia.. As. to him,, while in Australia the rule hold's. once an immigrant, always an ,r immigrant,"" and the pairlianmentary power is newer abandoned, and cannot, be abandoned. That, quotation is designed to show the act would have application to persons' as Walsh or Johnson.. The orable the Attorney-General then tinuedIn the judgment, in this; cose four judgesof the High Court concurred. It will be therefore,, that the High Court has already heltl that if a' 'personwho - mas not born' Australia entersAustralia as, an inaanigrant, the Australian Parliament can legislate foi deportation by reference to either as moral) qualities. I hope that. that, statement meets theobjections whichi lave been raised in this debate to the. validity of the amending Immigration Aet. Note what the honourable genii! email-, said, "" In the ju'dgmiemit in. this' case four judges 1 of the High Court eoncurred."" Surely Juqnorable members wonoicli suppose from - that statement that four judges concurred; in> the view expressed by Mr Justice Isaacs, but that was> noil so. The' foin? jirclges' concurred in a decision on other grounds; and not only"" that, but Mi*: Justice Knox: atmd a majority of the court dissented from the views expressed' by Mr: Justice Isaacs. On page 533-, volume 32, of the Commonwealth Law Reports, in .the case of King v. Macfavlane, Mr. Justice Kmox is reported to have saidThe condition imposed section &A is that if, during, a period of three years after his entry, he shall not remain free from certain disabilities, he shall be liable to be deportedthat is. fo say, his entry is permitted on pre batiora.. If, during, that probationary period, he proves to be unfit for certain reasons which, in the opinion of Parliament, are sufficient, to become a member of the Australian community, his conditional permission to enter may be revoked, and its revocation, enforced by the only really effective method-deporta tion. Tile argument against the validity of the section was really founded on the hardship that might result from its enforcement, but this is irrelevant,, when,, as here, the question is as to the extent of the power conferred on Parliament. Mr Justice Starke saidBut restriction must operate upon persons; and' if it is to foe effective; the Parliament must have authority to refuse; to> a. person who doea not belong to the. people of Australia,, permission, to enter the Commonwealth, or "" to annex: what conditions it pleases to the permission to enter,"" and, further, to expelor deport from the Conimorawe.'ilth, ait pleasure; any such person, if the Parliament eonsiders his presence in Australia ""opposed to its peace, order,, and good government,, or to its 1 social or material interests,"" or to &e welfare off its people. that Mr Justi.ee Starke went on to say that such the ""act hit the immigrant, not the member hon- of the community. So far from the con- decision of Mr Justice Isaacs being, the -< decision of the majority of the court on this point, whichisthe only point that seen, concerns ua at the moment, there, were three justices against him- Mr Justice in Knox, Mr Justice Higgins,. who held) that his the act was of doubtful validity, and Mr. Ms physical Justice.

149,Mr BRENNAN,PRECIOU SMETALS PROSPECTING,"I accept the honortria able gentleman's assurance of bhat, though he was ab the time discussing the other bill. I agree, anyhow, that he was maintaining his "" balancing titude."" The Government does not pear to realise how gravely it has misused on such a charge. its position as trusbee of the public. It him does not seem bo realise, or care to realise, how sacred is the principle of liberty of the subject, and how jealous British jurisprudence has always been of. those rights. It has been emphasized that the ciples esbablished in Magna Charta have been affirmed and re-affirmed in a thousand judgments by eminent lawyers in Great Britain and the dominions. is Acting, as I suggest, either stupidly vindictively, and at all events sloppily, the Government allowed these men, withposed oub legal warrant, to be seized and jusbly debained. When I remember, the great, imperishable tradition of misleading. British law, which is worth maintaining, and when I remember, secondly, that to be misleading. members and supporters of the Governgrettable, ment made profit out of their lawlessness by arresting and attempting to deport these men, I am driven bo conclude that this is not a matter that ought to be dealt with by individual claims for combis fellow citizens. pensation by the people injured . Those claims relate to"" personal rights and man about the wrongs, but they are nothing as comthe Immigration Bill . pared with the rights and wrongs of the general public. A man must be assumed to contemplate the natural consequences of his own act, and must be understood to know the law. Even a layman is supposed to Know the law, and to act at his peril, so surely eminent lawyers should has know the law and act at their peril. mainTherefore, I reluctantly draw the conthab nob civil, bub criminal, action should properly be taken against members of the Government, and that they should be placed in the dock on tria l for criminal conspiracy. They should have appreciated the fact thab they doing wrong, they profited their wrong, and they acted criminal recklessness of a kind bhat would enbible a man bo along sentence for, say, manslaughter, where bhere is no actual malice or desire to k ill . Bearing Immiall bhese facts in mind, members of the Governmenb could properly be placed on l for criminal conspiracy. The At altorney-General's position is, however, a little different. He had not the same responsibility, and therefore he will be atgratified to learn that I do not apsuggest that he should be arrainged All I say about is that he .entirely subordinated his position as a leading lawyer the to the needs of the political situation. Instead of giving Parliament the benefit of a carefully considered opinion which already it had the right to expect from a public prinman who enjoys the distinction of being the King's Counsellor and a leader at the Bar, and whose word on legal questions entitled, for that reason, to respect, or he utterly failed to discharge the high duties that, by circumstances, were i m on him. The opinion he gave was unpolitical rather than legal, and, for first, the most part, entirely wrong and In fact, it looks as if it were, obviously wrong, and designed It is most rei n my opinion, that a gentleman of his standing in the community should, upon the platform, and in this House, deliver an opinion on a vital question which involved the liberty of Not one word of doubt was uttered by this gentle- constitutionality of He in no way suggested that it was very likely that the proceedings were so far wrong that they could not possibly be directed effectively against those whom they were intended to deal with . The Attorney-General was very careful to point out at whom the proceedings were being directed. He referred to the people - who were holding up our shipping services, to agitators and lawless persons who, not members. of trade unions, were standing in the way of the ordered services of the State. In a word, he made it perfectly clear to whom only this law could, in fact, reasonably apply. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) who, I regret, is absent for the .moment, ranted and raved-hi s speech being in the ratio of f if t y and humbug and hypocrisy-o n matters which he did not understand. He also is a member of a learned and privileged profession. So far as the matters of his own craft are concerned, he hopelessly bungled his subject, and misled his constituents and the people. If he had been a tradesman, say a bricklayer or a carpenter, and had acted in such a way, he would have been sacked at a minute's notice. Such are the great' advantages that we enjoy from being members of a learned profession! I am sorry to have to speak in this way, for I have a great admiration for the members of my own profession, generally speaking. I believe a high standard is due from them to the general public in return for the privileges they enjoy as members of a close corporation, who are, in a certain sense, engaging a monopoly. I have very little to say at the moment on the details of the bill. I hope to deal with them as they arise in committee. I consider the measure to be an open attack upon trade unionism in this country. The bill is the result of the chastening and. gruelling that the Government has had at the hands of the High Oourt. On this occasion, at least, I think the Government has taken the trouble to keep with in the clear limits of constitutional rectitude, but that is a small matter by comparison. In fact, the more constitutional this measure is the less we like it . Because the ' measure which had a similar object was ' practically unconstitutional, we made the Government look ridiculous by holding it up to public opprobrium. this measure is probably constitutional, we. oppose it more bitterly. It attacks vital principles in which we believe. In pursuance of its provisions the Government may make a proclamation that any kind of minor industrial dispute, such as the recent shipping strike, is a serious in dustrial disturbance within, the provisions of the measure. It may do that just whenever it suits its purpose, and so make any twopenny-halfpenny dispute a serious strike, and at once put it on a political basis. The bill seeks to compel men to work under conditions and for a reward distasteful to them. Men should have the right to refuse to work for wages and under conditions which are disagreeable to them. The Government is also seeking to comfifty, pel a man to become u n f a it h f u l ' to his fellowmen. It . is endeavouring to turn back the hands of the clock 100 years. For that reason the measure is bound to be futile. I have already said that it is not likely that the Government - will attempt to make the measure operative; but if it did it would cause the revolution which some honourable members are so fond of talking about. Men will still abstain, when they think fit, from working. They will still remain f a it h f u l to their fellowmen, and do the manly thing when they ought to do it . In spite of al l that the Government can do, they will still stand for those standards and rewards of labour which, by the sacrifices of themselves and those who. have gone before them, have been built up in this and other countries, but in this country particularly. We treat the section of the measure which deals with unlawful associations very lightly . We think this is the mare's nest of the Government. We think that the saga of the Attorney-General about some Russian celebrities, of whom I know not half as much as he does, is a good advertisement for the communist movement. It w i ll give them a great fillip. They are the natural friends, allies, and helpers of the Government, so it is proper that they should be considered. We are opposed to bloodshed. We are opposed to reforms won by bloodshed. We believe in reforms won by majorities through constitutional effort. We believe in that, not only in connection with local matters, but also in connection with international Because matters. That is a principle for which I myself have suffered in the past.

150,Mr RODGERS,RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH,"Wannon) [9.55] --I desire to draw the attention of the Government to a cabled report from Canada that the trade treaty which was entered into between the Canadian and Commonwealth Governments, the amended agreement in connection with which was ratified in this Chamber on the 2nd of September, 1925, seems to be in danger. It appears as though the special circumstances surrounding the matter in Canada are more political than otherwise. I regret very much to have to make this statement. The agreement was the subject of negotiations which extended over many years. I had the honour to act on behalf of the Commonwealth and with the Tariff Board in negotiating the somewhat difficult details of the treaty. Canada at that time was represented by Mr Robb, who, I am delighted to notice, according to the reports, is standing four-square by the agreement. Mr Robb came to Australia with a purpose and very definitely set about fulfilling it. It is questionable whether, at this stage, certain producing interests in Canada are not unduly obtruding themselves. Mr Robb knew that the treaty was based on the give-and-take principle. The balance of trade between the two countries is overwhelmingly in favour of Canada. If the amended agreement that was ratified by the two Parliaments is to be disturbed, the whole of it may have to go back into the melting pot. This, I think, is the time when we should inform our great sister dominion that we cannot allow a trade treaty, that was made after so much deliberation, to become the plaything of party politics. I hope that the Government will take cognizance of the position, and that at the right time the Prime Minister will make the statement that he does not look upon this treaty as a scrap of paper, to be torn up at the most expedient moment, or to be held lightly by any or all of the three parties in Canadian politics. It is a solemn trade treaty, made in pursuance of the wide policy of Empire reciprdcal trade preference. So much is involved in the matter that I feel that I ought to say at this juncture that many other countries were prepared to give Australia definite trade preferences during the period sh& occupied in negotiating this treaty, but the Government resolutely set itself to bring the treaty to a successful issue, because it wished for friendly reciprocal arrangements to be made within the Empire wherever possible. In pursuance of our policy of upholding Empire trade, wn first made arrangements with the British Government. Then we made an agreement with New Zealand which, I am glad to say, is being faithfully honoured. Next came the Canadian agreement. We did not expect that, eo soon after it was ratified, party politics would be allowed to interfere with its smooth and satisfactory working.",58
151,Mr BRUCE,RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [10.0] - I quite appreciate the reasons which have led the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) to raise this question. He was closely associated with the early negotiations when Mr Robb, then Minister for Customs in Canada, visited Australia, and spent some time here in discussing the basis upon which a treaty might be entered into between the two countries. The honourable member will recognize that, as head of the Commonwealth Government, I cannot possibly express any view as to the action with regard to the treaty which may or may not be taken by the Canadian Parliament. We in Australia welcome the treaty, and we certainly entered into it for the reasons the honourable member has suggested, that we might do something to promote reciprocal trade within the Empire, and bind closer the links which join us together by mutual trading benefiting our respective countries. The treaty is based on those principles, but, of course, in it the rights of the parties to it are set out,- and it is for the governments of the day in those countries to take whatever action they may think wise, and such as they believe they are entitled to take under it . While I . appreciate what the honourable member has said, I cannot, as head of the Government, subscribe to the view he expressed as to the treaty being the plaything of party politics in Canada, npr can I express any view as to the action which our great sister Dominion should take in dealing with the treaty. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.2 p.m.",58
