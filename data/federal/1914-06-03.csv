1,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [2.31] - Before - we proceed to the business of the day, I wish to make mention of the' appalling shipping catastrophe, which 'occurred in the St: Lawrence a few days ago, whereby nearly one thousand persons were, without warning, sent to' their long home. Our human relationships are subject to these sudden interruptions, and a heavy toll is levied on the transportation of our commerce across the seas. The. circumstances of the wreck of the Empress of Ireland are peculiarly shocking. Two years ago the world's largest steamer foundered through striking an iceberg during a fog. It was thought in that case that the precaution of slowing down sbould have been taken earlier; the Empress of Ireland met disaster after all the precautions for avoiding injury in a fog which human ingenuity could suggest and prudence dictate had been taken. Again and again after we have made our best arrangements, and enforced the wisest regulations that thought can devise, the element of human error, which seems incalculable, creeps in, and upsets our plans. Now there is recorded another big sea tragedy, nearly one thousand persons of all ranks and degrees of ability and service being swept to a watery grave. These events strike a chord of common feeling. All we can do is to express our sympathy with those near and dear to the victims for the irreparable loss - which they have suffered. Yesterday, in obedience to this prompting of our common humanity, the Governor General, on behalf of the Government, despatched to the Governor General of Canada the following cablegram :Will you kindly convey to Canada Australia's deepest sympathy with sinter Dominion and relatives of those who have perished in terrible shipping disaster. There we must leave it, paying our tribute to the bravery of those who did their best to save what was left of the wreck.",11
2,Mr FISHER,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"Wide Bay) [2.36] - I join' with the Prime Minister in offering sympathy to the relatives and friends of those who have been lost in this sad disaster, the suddenness and magnitude of which must bave appalled the whole world. ' In every continent, and possibly in nearly every country, there are today citizens who have been bereaved by this calamity, which is therefore worldwide in its effects. Accidents like this, whether great or small, can be made less liable by the wisdom of the legislators of civilized communities, but when everything has been done, mental failure, unconscious misdirection, or circumstances which human effort cannot control, will still occasionally bring disaster. I agree with the Prime Minister that the greatest sympathy should be shown with the Dominion of Canada, and I am glad that the message which he has read was sent by the Governor General. I have read that in every town of importance in the Dominion there are persons now in mourning. We must express our sorrow with them, and the hope that, in the future, thero will be fewer of these sensational disasters than there have been in the past. I am sure that whatever this Legislature may do with a view to preventing accidents on the waters surrounding our own coasts will receive the hearty approval and support of the people of Australia.

3,Mr LIVINGSTON,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"A motion was carried in the Senate last Friday disallowing the distinctive uniforms of the national regiments. Inasmuch as the regulation, allowing such uniforms, was framed by the last Government, what steps does this Government intend to take to give effect to it ?",12
4,Mr KELLY,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"Eithe r House of the Parliament has . power to disallow a regulation. The disallowance by the Senate of the regulation referred to is greatly to be regretted. ' "" . v DOUBLE DISSOLUTION.",12
5,Mr HUGHES,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question in relation to a position that has arisen through the rejection by the other Chamber of this Legislature of a measure sent up to it by this House, in order to satisfy the conditions of section 57 of the Constitution Act. I wish to ask whether his attention has been drawn to the provisions of the Constitution in regard to the period during which the power that is given to His Excellency the Governor General to dissolve both Houses runs; because it is a matter of most vital importance to this House and to the country to know whether the Government propose to give the of advice to His Excellency at such a period of Vicas will enable His Excellency to follow' that advice, if given. The section concerns the privileges of this Parliament, and of every member of it , and, in my opinion, the power embraced in it must papers. be immediately exercised, or else it lapses. Does the Prime Minister propose to take immediate steps to enable His Excellency to act in accordance with section 57 ?",12
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,I wonder why my honourable friend brings up these unpleasant questions.,13
7,Mr THOMAS,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,We are dealing with business; do not joke. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Dealin g with business ?,13
8,Mr THOMAS,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,Certainly . It ought be important enough to be dealt with seriously.,13
9,Mr SPEAKER,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,Order ! There can be no debate.,13
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"The honourable member has not been serious since he has been dislodged from this bench, and I am afraid he will never be serious again or newspapers against another. happy while be is over there.",13
11,Mr SPEAKER,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,Order ! This is a be question.,13
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"It was not a question that was submitted by the able member; it was a deliverance. However, all I have to say, i u reply, is that I hope that the Government know their duty, and will perform it at the proper time. FEDER AL CAPITAL SITE. PARLIAMENT HOUS E DESIGNS .",13
13,Mr FINLAYSON,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,A statement has been published that a commission has been appointed to sit in London and judicate on the designs for the House Parliament at Canberra. Why has Lonpointed don been selected for such an important work instead of a place in Australia ?,13
14,Mr KELLY,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,L o n d o n has been cided on as the place for the adjudicaCommissioner tion of these designs by this Government just as it was by the last; for the reason that it is most readily accessible to the four other members of the Committee tirely to the States? over whom the Australian architect will preside. ELECTORAL ROLLS.  Home Affairs say whether there is any truth in the rumour that instructions have been given by the Government that enrolment under the Electoral Act eease within three weeks?,13
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,I do not know of any such order or direction.  Adelaide newspapers.,13
16,Mr RILEY,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,And in the Sydney newsMr JOSE PH COOK - All I know is. that for some time past every effort haa been made to get the rolls into good condition. POSTA LDEPARTMENT . PRIORIT Y OF MAILMATTER .,13
17,Mr ARTHUR,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"Is it a fact that Melbourne newspapers are treated as first class mail matter, thereby gaining priority of delivery, while provincial newspapers, to such as those of Bendigo, Ballarat, and Geelong, are treated as second-class mail matter, and their delivery is delayed in comparison with Melbourne papers? If this is a fact, will the Postmaster-General see that some alteration is made?",13
18,Mr AGAR WYNNE,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"No instructions have been given to favour one set of The in structions are that all newspapers are to treated as first-class mail matter, but if any honourable member will point out where that rule has not been observed, I honorshall look into the matter for him. PANAMA EXPOSITION.",13
19,Mr JENSEN,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,Has Mr Deakin been appointed as Commissioner representing the Commonwealth at the Panama Exposition ?,13
20,Mr GLYNN,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"Mr Deakin was appointed about two months ago, and he has been acting here as chief representaadtive of the Commonwealth in conjunction of with the Committee of members apby the States who are acting in co-operation with the Commonwealth. Mr JENSEN"" - Will the Minister of deExternal Affairs state whether the Chief representing the Commonwealth at the Panama Exposition has the right to appoint representatives of the States, or are such appointments lef t en",13
21,Mr GLYNN,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"The Chief Commissioner really makes no appointments. The Commonwealth appointments are made of by me on behalf of the Conunonwealth; but, of course, in the case of the appointment of an officer who has to act in close relation to members of the Commission, I must consult the Chief Commissioner as to whether such an officer will be suitable. The States, however, appoint their own officers. Each State that has joined in the the representation of Australia at the Exposition will send a representative to the Commission, which will meet here next week, when I hope all the States will be represented. I did notice that Tasmania gave forma l notice of withdrawal, but I think that on reconsideration that State will j o in in with the others, especially i u view of the fact that the expenditure is comparatively small. It may be that some details of administration have been overlooked by the State Minister. Mr JEN/SEN"" - What salary and travelling expenses do the Government propose to allow the Chief Commissioner? Mr Glynn "" - I am certain that Mr . Deakin will accept no salary. My difficulty is to get him to accept even reasonable expenses. I am certain that all I shall be able to induce him to accept is such expenses as he will incur in doing the Commonwealth work at the Exposition. K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA tion. TEESDALE SMITH CONTRACT. - Mr YATES - Is it correct that the line? Teesdale Smith contract will not be completed for another six weeks, and if so, ar& any penalties being imposed?",13
22,Mr KELLY,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,My information is that the suggestion of the honourable member that it will take six weeks to complete the contract is not correct. I anticipate the completion of the contract any day now. An y penalties that are enforceable will be enforced. NAVIGATION ACT.,14
23,Mr TUDOR,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,Can the Minister of Trade and Customs say whether it is likely that the Navigation Act will be proclaimed and brought into operation during this year?,14
24,Mr GROOM,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,It is impossible for me to fix upon any definite date. The Act certainly cannot be proclaimed for several months yet. PINECREEK TO KATHERINE roughly RIVER RAILWAY.,14
25,Mr FENTON,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"Seeing that £400,000 was placed on the Estimates last year for the construction of a railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River, I would like to know how much of the line has been constructed, and how much of the money has been spent?",14
26,Mr GLYNN,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"The work of constructing the Pine Creek to Katherine River railway has only really been begun withi n the last three or four weeks. The work of construction has been just handed over to the Department of Home Affairs, and therefore I cannot tell at the moment what has been spent on preparatory work, but there has been no delay on the part of the Department of External Affairs. If the work was to be carried out by a single contract a start could not have been made before about A p r i l , but the line is now being built under the method of small contracts that I foreshadowed in the House, and the only delay has been caused by such matters as inquiry into any change that may take place in . regard to the rails. I awaited information in this regard fro m the Engineer-in-Chief lately appointed. There has been some expenditure in regard to material, but I am sure that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs will be only too pleased to supply the honourable member with any informa being made with the construction of the Is the work being done by day labour or by contract?",14
27,Mr GLYNN,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"The actual work of construction has just about begun. Mr. Davis, the officer in charge of the construction work at Darwin, was to arrive yesterday at that port, and to commence iin mediately the work of construction under the direction of the Engineer-inChief. The honourable member will find that the construction is being pushed on very expeditiously, and with a view to there being as little delay as possible; also to combine settlement along the line with the engagement of workers for the railway, the constructional policy being a mixed one of small contracts and day labour. POLICY OF THEGOVERNMENT .",14
28,Mr MATHEWS,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"There was a rather strong article in Monday's Anjus dealing with the Opposition, and speaking of the strong policy of the Government.",14
29,Mr SPEAKER,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,Order ! The honourable member is not in order in asking a question founded on a newspaper statement.,14
30,Mr MATHEWS,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"It is generally said that the Government have a strong policy, and I think that if the policy was given to the newspapers the Opposition ought also to know what it is.",14
31,Mr SPEAKER,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,Order ! BUILDI NG STRIKE IN LONDON.,14
32,Mr WEST,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"Is the Minister of External Affairs aware that a strike in connection with the building trade has taken place in London? If so, has that strike interfered with the construction of the Commonwealth offices in London?",15
33,Mr GLYNN,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"I noticed in the press that a strike had taken place. It did for a time delay the building operations, but so far as I am aware, no serious inconvenience has been caused. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",15
34,Mr MAHON,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"B y way of personal explanation, I desire to draw attention the omission from the Mansard reports of the pairs arranged in recent divisions. have had a standing pair with the honourable member for Werriwa for some possible. time; but I find that the pairs are omitted from several divisions. I am aware, of course, that pairs are not recorded in the Votes and Proceedings, but it has been a rule throughout the whole of this Parliament to record them in the Hansard reports. I was unavoidably prevented from being in the House, and the omistable sion of the pairs from Hansard, implythe ing my non-participation in the divisions, may be misinterpreted, especially as the voting was close in each case. Therefore, I desire to make it clear that I had in the divisions recorded on pages (closure), 1403 (two divisions) (closure), 1404 (clause 1, Government Preference Prohibition Bill ) , 1414 (closure), (omission of the word "" f a v o r it is m "" ) , the only 1419 (amendment moved by the honorshadowy, able member for Melbourne), 1420 (new clause proposed by the honourable member, for Cook), 1421-2 (new clauses proposed by the honourable member for Caprii cornia), and 1423 (closure).",15
35,Mr SPEAKER,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"The Hansard staff Assistant generally rely for their information garding pairs on th© pair-book, which is placed at the end of the table, and which pairs are usually recorded. It appears that on the occasion mentioned by the question-No . the honourable member the pairs had not been recorded in the book, which, however is not official in any way.",15
36,Mr MASSYGREENE,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,"May I explain that entered up the pairs on the principal divisions. I did not enter up the pairs for each separate division, but I assumed that Hansard would copy the pairs f r one division to another. BI - MONTH LY SCHEDULE.",15
37,Mr FINLAYSON,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,When does the Honorary Minister hope to fulfil the promise which he made to me last week in regard to the issue of the bi-monthly schedule of public works.,15
38,Mr KELLY,WKECK OF EMPRESS OF,I hope to get it back from the printer today. NA AGREEMENT.,15
39,Mr HIGGS,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"Will the Prime M in ister say when he proposes to introduce PAIRS. legislation which will enable him, as he stated in a speech made after the to Premiers' Conference, "" to go nap for a m ill i o n "" with regard to the M u r r ay I River Waters Agreement?",15
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,As soon as KALGOORLIE - PO RT AUGUST A RAILWAY. PREFERENCE TO UNIONISTS .,15
41,Mr JH CATTS,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,Is the Honorary Minister yet prepared to place on the a copy of the agreement in which Government provided for preference to unionists on the east-west railway?,15
42,Mr KELLY,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"The r e is no such agreement, and consequently it cannot paired be laid on the table. I have already 1394 explained to the honourable member several times that the agreement with the men is not signed, and the honor1415 able member knows by this time that possible excuse, however for pretending that the agreement gives preference to unionists is the fact that an agreement between the union and the Government is necessarily limited n its scope to members of the union.",15
43,Mr JH CATTS,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"I wish to ask the Minister of Home Affairs if , in restead of making voluminous explanations, he is prepared to lay on the table in of the House the d r a f t agreement?",15
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,I will answer Later,15
45,Mr JH CATTS,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"I wish to ask the I Honorary Minister a question in regard to preference to unionists on the transcontinental railway. I remind the honourable gentleman that he did not answer o m the question that I asked a few moments ago. Is it not a fact that about a fortnigh t ago he promised to lay a copy of the agreement on the table, and said that he only required time for his typist to copy it? Does he now propose to lay the agreement ou the table, or is he going back on his promise?",15
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,I ask whether the honourable member is in order in asking questions conveying statements which he knows are not correct?,16
47,Mr JH CATTS,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,That is not true.,16
48,Mr SPEAKER,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"The honourable member for Cook must withdraw those words. Mr J. H. CATTS - I withdraw words, and say that the Prime Minister's statement is inaccurate.",16
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"The same question has been asked aud answered repeatedly, and the statement which is contained in the question every time has been emphatically denied. Is it in order for an honourable member to keep on asking such a question incessantly and interminably ?",16
50,Mr SPEAKER,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"It certainly is not in order for an honourable member to knowingly ask a question conveying or implying an inaccurate statement. I am not prepared to say that the honourable member for Cook has done this, and I am certainly not in a position to know whether the question asked is correctly described by the Prime Minister.",16
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"I am a f r a i d, Mr . Speaker, that you have not grasped my point of order. My point is that this question has been asked a number of times, and that the statement in the question has been denied over and over again by the Honorary Minister. I wish to know whether it is in order under cover of a question to keep on repeating a statement which is alleged by the Honorary Minister to be not in accordance with fact.",16
52,Mr SPEAKER,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"Statement s of any kind made under cover of a question are not in order except such as may be necessary to explain the question. As to the other point, I am not in a position to judge Whether the information has been given; but if such information has been given, certainly it is not in order to repeat the question.",16
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"I did not say that the information has been given, but that the statement has been denied repeatedly.",16
54,Mr JH CATTS,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"I desire to make a personal explanation. A week or two ago, when the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was under consideration, I produced a newspaper report of an agreement which had been entered into on behalf of the Government, and signed, I understand, by one of the officers, with the Adelaide Branch of the Australian Workers Union, providing for the strongest preference to unionists that one can conceive. I asked the Honorary Minister whether he would lay a copy of that agreement on the table, and he promised the to do so. When I repeated my question a couple of days afterwards, he said the delay had taken place because it was necessary to have a day's notice in order that his typist might copy the document. The Honorary Minister kept on stating that the agreement did not provide for preference to unionists, and I wish the document to be laid on the table, so that honourable members and the country may judge for themselves.",16
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"The honourable member will not get it now, anyhow.",16
56,Mr JH CATTS,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,The Prime Minister is afrai d to produce it .,16
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,There is nothing to be a f r a i d of. ' Mr KELLY - I hope that this is the last time that,16
58,Mr SPEAKER,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,Do I understand the Honorary Minister to be making a personal explanation ?,16
59,Mr KELLY,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"Certainly . The honourable member for Cook did some time ago ask me to lay on the table an agreement .that had been made, as between the Government and the men, and I said I would be happy to produce a copy. But no agreement has been signed between the Government officers and the men, as the honourable member for Cook has siuce been many times informed. I stated what was the nature of the d r a f t agreement, which is under the consideration of the Crown Law authorities. That agreement was simply for the payment of a wage of l is . 8d. from the present place of working right up to Tarcoola. No such thing as preference to unionists, or anything that could be mistaken for one moment as such, could be read into the agreement",16
60,Mr JH CATTS,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,Then lay the agreement on the table.,16
61,Mr KELLY,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"It was thought by the railway people that this agreement with the union might be put in documentary form, and a draft was prepared. In the d r a f t agre.ement the union undertook to do certain things, and the Government undertook to do certain things. What the Government undertook to do was to pay l is . 8d. as far as Tarcoola, and what the union undertook to do",17
62,Mr JH CATTS,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,The members of this union had preference.,17
63,Mr KELLY,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"No , certainly not. So far as the union's obligations are conpointment cerned they are declared in the d r a agreement to be restricted, as they must necessarily be, to the members of the Attorney-General inform the union. I volunteered to let the orable member see a copy of the agreemade, ment, but I withdraw that offer now, inquiry though I will let the honourable member for Kennedy see it , if he wishes to, this cil? afternoon. It would be mere nonsense to lay an unsigned and unfinished agreement ment on the table. Afr. J . H . CATTS - Is it not a that work is proceeding on the transconRoyal tinental railway under the agreement with the Australian Workers Unionthat the terms of the agreement have been settled even though the agreement Affairs is not signed ? Is the union not already working for the Government under the agreement ?",17
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"I am going to answer that question. It is time, I think, that the attention of the honourable memcent ber's constituents ouside was called to way in which he is constantly taunting sent. the Government for having anything to do with unionists. That is what the position has come to. The honourable member has done nothing in recent days. biit persistently persecute this Government, because, as he imagines, we have treated unionists fairly. It is time"" honourable member's constituents knew just where he is in relation to this vernment and unionism. Mr J. H. CATTS - My constituents know and understand the Prime Minister pretty well.",17
65,Mr SPEAKER,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"I remind honourable members that there is no obligation on Ministers to answer questions without notice. No debate can be permitted in connection with questions, and what is going on now is, apparently, an attempt to carry on an irregular debate under cover of questions. This must not proceed.",17
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MURRAYRIVER WATERS,"It has beeu going on for some time, and I wish to say now that we shall answer no more questions without notice today. NA COMMISSION .",17
67,Mr ARTHUR,BE EP TRUST ROYA L,"In view of the apof Mr Justice Street as a f t Royal Commissioner to inquire into the operations of the Beef Trust, will the House honunder what Act the appointment was and what powers of compulsory the learned Judge will have, in view of the decision of the Privy CounMr W . H . IRVINE - The appointwas made, not under any Act of Parliament, but by virtue of the usual fact prerogative of the Crown to appoint Commissions. The honourable member, I thought, would have heard the notice of motion given by my honourable colleague, the Minister of External",17
68,Mr AHTHUH,BE EP TRUST ROYA L,"I did. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It was a notice of motion for leave to introduce a Bill to vest the Commissioner with the necessary powers, which, according to the redecision of the Privy Council, if it the be right, are not vested in him at preNEW HEBRIDES.",17
69,Mr SAMPSON,BE EP TRUST ROYA L,"In view of the fact that the Anglo-French Delegation is about to visit the New Hebrides to in the quire into methods of government there, I desire to ask the Minister of External GoAffairs whether Australia is to be represented upon that delegation ?",17
70,Mr GLYNN,BE EP TRUST ROYA L,I have no official knowledge that the Commission is to visit the New Hebrides. All that I know of the matter is that which I have gathered from the newspapers. There has been no communication between the Home Government and that of the Commonwealth as to such a visit being made for the purpose of collecting facts. NA PROHIBITION BILL .,17
71,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"In view of the challenge which the Attorney-General threw out to the Opposition a few days ago, when he said that if the Government Preference Prohibition Bill were rejected the Government would take a certain course, I desire to ask the honourable gentleman whether, having regard to the rejection of the Bill by th® Senate, he is going to take the action which he then indicated ?",18
72,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I must refer my honourable friend to the Prime Minister. MARCONI LITIGATION.,18
73,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"In regard to the litigation proceeding between the Commonwealth and the Marconi Company, will the Postmaster-General state whether the Government ' are negotiating with the company? Is the honourable gentleman prepared to inform the House of the exact position at the present time in relation to the matter?",18
74,Mr AGAR WYNNE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Some new phases of this case have arisen, and we are to have a consultation tomorrow morning with our counsel.",18
75,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Who are they?,18
76,Mr AGAR WYNNE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Mr Starke and Mr Garran.,18
77,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Will the Postmaster-General inform the House of the nature of the negotiations now proceeding in connection with the Marconi litigation, and whether his Department is acting upon the advice of the Attorney General ?",18
78,Mr AGAR WYNNE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The only persons who are advising me in the matter are outside counsel, the Minister of External Affairs, and the Crown Solicitor. I have not consulted the Attorney-General in any way whatever in regard to the case. BUREAU OF AGRICULTURE BILL .",18
79,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs what has become of the Bureau of Agriculture Bill? If it has not been abandoned by the Government, is it proposed to introduce it again this session ?",18
80,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill has not been abandoned. Had the honourable member shown last session the interest which he is now displaying in it , the Bill by this time would probably have become law, and haye been helping the Australian farmers. NA TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT.",18
81,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"Will the Treasurer state whether the Government have made any definite arrangement with regard to the future control of the Savings Bank of Tasmania, and whether it is the intention of the Ministry to place Tasmania, so far as its Savings Bank business is concerned, in the position of the other States ? - Sir JOHN FORREST - An arrangement has been made by the Tasmanian Government to hand over its Savings Bank business tb the Commonwealth Bank. At the recent Conference, it was arranged between the Commonwealth and the representatives of four of the States, that we should introduce legislation providing that, subject to certain conditions, Savings Bank business should be carried on only by the States themselves. It was 'also agreed that Tasmania should be at liberty, if it so desired, to come under that arrangement. The representative of Tasmania said that he felt sure that it would do so. That is how the matter stands. Leave has been obtained to introduce a Bill to give effect to this agreement, and, under it, the door will be left open for Tasmania to come in with the other States if it so desires.",18
82,Mr JENSEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"I - desire to ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that Tasmania is the first State to fall into line with the spirit of the banking legislation of the Commonwealth ? Is it not a fact that the State Government has agreed, as from 6th instant, tb conduct all its financial business through the Commonwealth BanR, and to allow that bank to arrange whatever borrowings it may desire ?",18
83,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"I believe that an arrangement to that effect has been made, but I am not able to give the honourable member a definite answer to his question. If he will give notice of his question, I shall consult the Governor of the Bank as to the exact arrangement made. STEAM - SH IP COMMUNICATI ON WITH TASMANIA. WIRELESS INSTALLATION.",18
84,Mr JENSEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,I wish to ask the M i nister of Trade and Customs whether he has yet carried out a promise which he made recently to negotiate with the shipping companies trading directly between Tasmania and the mainland with the object of securing a wireless installation on their steamers for the greater safety of human life at sea?,19
85,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"The suggestion made by the honourable member was received by us, and I dare say that it is being acted upon in accordance with the instructions issued. PURIFICATION OF THE ROLLS.",19
86,Mr HANNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"I wish to ask the Minister of Home Affairs a question relating to the purification of the rolls. Complaints are being made in different parts of Australia as to the wrongful removal of names from the rolls. W it h in the last day or two cases have been brought under my notice where names appearing on the rolls were objected to on the ground that the persons concerned had not been living for one month at the addresses given, whereas they had actually been residing there for nine years. W i ll the Minister of Home Affairs issue directions to the Registrars to exercise more caution in the discharge of their duties ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - If the honourable member will place his question on the notice-paper we shall have full inquiries made into it . I am afraid that sufficient general directions have already been given. Whatever direction we may give, either to the Registrars or to any other officials, we shall still have to contend with the element of human error., and I fear that we cannot provide against it in every case. PREFERENCE TO UNIONISTS .",19
87,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"Has the Prime M in ister any information in regard to the application for employment at Jervis Bay, to which I referred during the debate on the Government Preference Prohibition Bill , and in regard to which the applicant was requested to state to what union he belonged ? I understood that the Honorary Minister was going to give us some information; and it certainly is a matter on which we ought to have some.

88,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"I have been obtaining the information in question, and I would prefer that the honourable member asked his questions categorically, and placed them on the notice paper. I do desire to say, however, that the insinuation that a person, who was not a unionist, has been appointed over the head of a unionist, has already been disproved, in so far as that person has himself been a member of the same union as the other man for the last fifteen years. We have ample proof that there is no foundation whatever for the insinuation made.",19

Where there is a difference of opinion amongst reputable qualified medical men as to the physical fitness of a youth for military training, what is the practice of the Defence authorities? 2. Do the Defence authorities insist on submission to training in cases of doubt, on the ground alone that the authorized medical officer is satisfied of the trainee's fitness? 3. In such circumstances, what rights, if any, has a trainee by way of appeal, and what is the procedure for testing such rights? 4. Who is the proper medical officer in each case?",20

V.",20
98,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o w s :- LT - COLON EL Lieutenant Pollok is an officer of the British Army, and has been appointed with the temporary rank of Lieutenant to the Administrative and Instructional Staff on loan from the War Office for four years. Aii examination is not necessary when an officer is on loan from the British Army. The only Australian officers who could be compared with Lieutenant Pollok would be officers of another branch of the Permanent Forces, such as the Artillery or Engineers, who transfer to the Instructional Staff, and they would not he required to pass a further examination. Militia officers seeking appointment to the Administrative and Instructional Staff are required to submit to examination, and it is not considered desirable that they should be appointed without examination. The granting of temporary rank, as in the case of Lieutenant Pollok, is a reciprocal arrangement between the British and Australian Governments.",20
99,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"for Mr MATHEWS ) asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that a church parade of cadets was held at Mildura on Sunday, 24th inst.? 2. Is it a fact that an intimation was conveyed to cadets invited or instructed to attend that such attendance would count as a halfday's voluntary drill? 3. Is it permissible, in respect of this or any church parade under the Defence Acts and Regulations, to make concessions to any body of cadets conditional upon their attendance at the church of any one denomination to the exclusion of others? 4.

Yes; it is reported that cadets short in HMAS. drills were informed by the company commander that they would bo given credit for attending this parade. As this is against the regulation, further inquiries are, however, being made in this matter. 3. No. 4.

102,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:As the matter referred to is still sub judiee, it is not considered desirable, in the interests of the officers and others concerned, to make any statement at present. The papers, &c, will be made available at as early a date as possible after the matter has been dealt with. Mr HANNAN ask'ed the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. In view of the fact that Colonel Tope, being on the unattached list, is still available for duty-wil l the Minister, under all the circumstances of the case, consider the desirability of restoring Colonel Tope to his former position of Brigadier? 2.

Courtney, at the Kilmore camp, 1912, and Heidelberg oamp, 1913? 3. Will the Minister state the reason of Colonel MCShane not being given command of a battalion on the expansion of the forces on the 1st July, 1912, whilst two juniors in his own battalion were appointed commanding officers, and he was not then of retiring age? 4. Was not Colonel MCShane recommended for and promised command of the 49th Battalion, and did he not for several weeks actually perform and carry out the duties of the commanding officer of the battalion ? 5. Was it not after the command of the 49th Battalion had been given to an officer junior to Colonel MCShane that Colonel MCShane applied to be placed on the retired list?",21
103,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as foll o w :1. Colonel Tope was placed on the unattached list at his own request, he-as well as all other available officers on the active listwill be considered when any future appointment of Brigadiers are made. 2. The papers in connection with the inquiry concerning the matter referred to at the Heidelberg camp, 1913, will be made available for the honourable member's perusal. There is no record of any such inquiry with regard to the Kilmore camp, 1912. 3. 4, and 5. Lieutenant-Colonel MCShane was placed on the retired list at his own request. On the 9th September, 1912; that is, before the present Government came into office. The following answers have, however, been supplied by the Department:3. The re-organization of the militia forces, consequent on universal training, took place on the 1st July, 1912. Lieutenant-Colonel MCShane was considered for the command of the 49th (Prahran) Infantry, but as he was within four months of the ape for retirement, he was deemed ineligible by the Promotion Board. [67] 4. Lieutenant-Colonel MCShane was recommended by the District Military Commandant for the command of the 49th Infantry, but no promise of such could be given. He administered the command from 1st to 30th July, 1912. 5. Yes. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. SYDNEY - WOLLONGONG TELEPHONE LETTEB-PILLAK PILFERING-GLADSTON E AND TOWNSVILL E COASTAL MAIL .",21
104,Mr BURNS,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"the Postmaster General, upon notice What progress has been made regarding a promise of the Deputy Postmaster-General, New South Wales, to a deputation from Wollongong early this year to give better telephonic facilities between Sydney and Wollongong?",21
105,Mr AGAR WYNNE,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"In q u i r y is being made, and a reply will be furnished - as early as possible. On Thursday last the honourable member for Batman asked the following questions: 1. Is the Postmaster-General aware that pilfering from letter-pillars in the metropolitan area is a matter of frequent occurrence? 2. Is there not a larger number of complaints in respect of non-delivery of mailed letters under consideration in the Postal Department at present than at any time previously? 3. What, if anything, does the Minister propose to do about it? I was not aware of any complaints, bufc I have had inquiries made, and the Deputy Postmaster-General, Melbourne, has furnished the following information2. The number of complaints received at this office in regard to the non-delivery of letters generally since 1st January is slightly less than those received during the corresponding E eriod of last year, but more complaints haye een received of missing letters posted in letter-pillars this year than usual. During the past four months, on several occasions, adhesive substances have been found in letterpillars in the metropolitan area, which would indicate that unauthorized persons have been tampering with the pillars. 3. A device designed for the purpose of preventing the illegal abstraction of letters from letter-pillars has been adopted by the Department, and will be fitted to a number of pillars within the metropolitan area as early as possible. On Friday last the honourable member for Capricornia asked .the following questionWill the Postmaster-General bo good enough to stipulate that coastal mail steamers carrying mails to Gladstone, Townsville, 4tc. (see Commonwealth Gazette, page 841, Oth May instant), shall also carry produce and other cargo, if required by residents of Gladstone district? The Deputy Postmaster-General, Brisbane, has furnished the following reportThe service between Gladstone and Townsville is intended to secure expeditious transmission of mails between those places and ports en route. The time allowed under the mail contract would not permit of any delay by the contractors for the purposes of shipping or unshipping cargo at various ports of call between Gladstone and Townsville, and, consequently, they have been compelled practically to refuse cargo for Mackay and Bowen. If the request made by the honourable member were complied with, the time-table would require to be materially altered, and the value of the service for mail purposes would be correspondingly diminished. Shippers at Gladstone bave opportunities for sending cargo vid Port Alma at frequent intervals by coastal vessels not under the contract. The Deputy Postmaster-General does not recommend compliance with the request, as it would seriously impair the usefulness of the mail service. PRIVILEGE.",21
106,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"I rise to a matter of privilege that concerns the business paper. On the last day of sitting there were on the business-paper two notices of motion, one by Sir John Forrest, to ask for leave to bring . in a . B i to Savings Bank business, and the other by Mr Groom to ask for leave to bring in a Bill to amend the Australian Industries Preservation Act;, a measure which we understood was to deal with the Beef Trust. The Government said they wanted to go on with these Bills as matters of urgency. Neither of these notices of motion appears on today's business paper. I should like to know where they have gone.",22
107,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK AND,"There is no question of privilege. Leave was given on the last day of. sitting to bring in the Bills referred to, but those Bills have not yet been presented, so they do not appear on the notice-paper. This is the usual practice. NA SECOND READING .",22
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [3.29] - I move- . . That this Bill be now read a second time. The .Bill is similar to that introduced last .session, which received, its; quietus in.' much the rsamaway as'l the measure which reference has been made: so-'fre'-quently of late. I do not know whether it is necessary that I should traverse the ground again and attempt to make argument for it ; the obligation is rather on those who are opposed to it to show reasons why the Bill should not pass.",22
109,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Does the Prime Minister wish to pass it for the purpose of getting a double dissolution? Mr. JOSEPH COOK.;- I wish to pass it for the purpose of enfranchising women who need it , and to perform a simple act of justice to the women of this country who are doing their duty, but who, from one cause and another, happen to be laid aside by illness on polling days'.",22
110,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Will the honourable member confine the Bill to such persons?,22
111,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I ask that the Prime Minister may be allowed to speak without interruption.,22

113,Mr BURNS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Ou t at Kooyong.,22
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,It is wonderf u l how honourable members sneer at the sick and invalid of the community when l l relating any reference is made to them.,22
115,Mr JH CATTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,You know that that is not true.,22
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Why , then, all this derisive laughter ?",22
117,Mr BURNS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I rise to order. I object to the remark that we are sneering at the sick and invalid, and ask that it be withdrawn.",22
118,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I did not understand the Prime Minister to apply his words' to any individual member. I 'would remind honourable members generally that if they persist in interjecting, especially after the Chair has called them to order, they invite rejoinders, which aire not always of a pleasant character.",22
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I did not apply my words to any particular individual, but I say that when reference is BILL. made to the infirm and sick of the community there is almost unanimous and derisive laughter from the other side. As to the need for the Bill , the Commonwealth Statistician tells us that the daily average of women requiring the right to vote by post for a certain reason is 22,000; that the' daily average of the sick is-' 30,000""; ran'd ""that thecd'fiily average of a the infirmwho 'are unable to go to the poll is 25,000. In all, there are, on the average, every day of the year, 77,000 Bick and infirm persons in the community, and it is to provide them with the facilities for voting that this Bill has been introduced. . Mr HIGGS - How many of them would like to be left alone by the political canvasser ?",22
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I do not know. I have not been a political canvasser amongst these persons. Perhaps the honourable member has done that work, and, therefore, interjects so confidently. He, perhaps, has been rounding them up in the institutions or at their own homes. At any rate, the criticism comes pat, that they ought to be left alone. How does he know? I know that the Commonwealth Statistician alleges that the number I have stated is in need of the postal vote, and must suffer disfranchisement because of physical disability or ill-health if pelled to comply with the condition imposed on ordinary electors of having to present themselves in person at the polling booths. Mr J. .H. CATTS - Does Mr Knibbs say that they require the postal vote ?",23
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I hope that he has not so far forgotten his duty as to dabble in politics.,23
122,Mr JH CATTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Thos e were the Prime Minister's words.,23
123,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order !,23
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"What am I to do, Mr Speaker?",23
125,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I have already called the honourable member for Cook to order.,23
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Bu the does not stop. I would not mind if there were a tittle of justification for anything he said. I never met such a brazen individual in my life. The bulk of the members of this House have some desire to preserve a reputation for credibility.,23
127,Mr JH CATTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,You have not.,23
128,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I ask the honourable member, for Cook not to interject.",23
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member seems to be absolutely reckless. .,23
130,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Will the Prime Minister address himself to the Bill?,23
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I have called attention to the figures supplied hy the Government Statistician, givingjhe daily average numbertof the persons unable-to present themselves at the polling booths [67]- 2 by reason of sickness or infirmity. They are the persons whom it is in contemplation to benefit when a measure providing for postal voting is presented to this or any other Legislature. In 1910 84,000 postal votes were recorded. That is the clearest possible proof that this machinery has been availed of, and that it has fulfilled a useful function, and met the needs of the people. I do not know how else we are to gauge it. I do not know how honourable members imagine that it is taking advantage of people who do not need it . However, there is no proof of that assertion; we have simply the bald statement without a tittle of justification. On the other hand is the fact thaf>&4,000 postal votes were recorded in 1910, and the only argument on which the protest against the postal vote is based is the fact that 49,000 of these postal votes were supposed to be for Liberals, while 33,000 com-, were supposed to be for Labour men. I say "" supposed to be "" in each case.",23
132,Dr MALONEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Do you say that there were 84,000 postal votes cast in 1910?",23
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am speaking of the total absent and postal votes, and saying that the fact that the majority of these votes was cast for Liberals is alleged to be conclusive argument that something was done to manipulate .the postal vote. I know of no provision in the Electoral Act which is as safeguarded as are the postal vote provisions. The penalties are heavy, the requirements are strict to the point of severity, and the fact that there have been only a few cases of irregularity brought to the Courts and dealt with is the clearest possible proof that nothing very wrong has taken place' in connection with the postal vote. Not one case of actual fraud has been dis-' covered.",23
134,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Not one.,23
135,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What about the case of' the J.P. at Coleraine?,23
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member is not distinguishing ""between irregularity and fraud. . For fraud, the penalties are severe, ranging up to £100 and three months' imprisonment, Let us run through the safeguards and see ' if anything could be better in that regard. In the first place, the duty of an authorized witness is laid down very clearly, and for any deflection in the performance of that'duty, in a:case of clear fraud,-there' isja penalty off. £50, or one month's im* J prisonmenfci - - - - - ",23
137,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I would not give information in order to get a girl imprisoned for three months for voting by post, though I know of plenty who voted by post, and should not have done so.",24
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member, would rather take the vote from the innocent than punish the guilty. It is. the duty of any one who knows that deliberate fraud has been committed to report it.",24
139,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,They were deceived. They were told by the canvassers that they could vote by post.,24
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member's answer is not sufficient.,24
141,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,You r crowd managed it all right.,24
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"All I know is that I dare say ""our crowd,"" as the honourable member calls us, knows just as much as the other side about these things. I do not pretend that every one in our party is an angel, and that every one on the other side is the other thing. I dare that if we investigated the matter closely we should find that there is much of a muchness in human nature on both sides in regard to operating this electoral machinery. The point is, however, that there is only one party that is complaining about this particular machinery. Our party do not complain. Why do the other side complain ? Does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports suggest that they are not able to take care of themselves, and that these persons are poor little innocents who need to be taken care of kindly and safely by some motherly Act of Parliament?",24
143,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What I do suggest is that the methods are more suitable to your side than to ours.,24
144,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order !,24
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member must go further than that when he makes that allegation, for, whether he knows it or not, he is impugning all .the forces in this community which are set for the preservation of law and order; in effect, he is saying that all the administrators of justice, and all officials concerned in the administration of the Electoral Department, are winking at their duty, and are political partisans to boot.",24
146,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I have not said that.,24
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No ; the honourable member has not said it, but what [I have said is implied in his statement. He has said that our party manipulates votes, and that the other party do not. The same penalties apply to this side as to that. The same impositions are placed on honourable members on this side as on honourable members on that side. The electoral law is for both sides, and all sides', and all parties, and no party; it is for every one who wishes to vote. Therefore, every argument we hear from the other side that this or that violation of the law takes place, is simply an implication that the officials of the Electoral Department are not doing their duty, and that they are favouring one side as against the other. I come back to the question again-Why is it that our party do not complain as to the postal vote, while the whole of the other party do ?",24
148,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Because your organizations use it mostly, and can do so because they have the methods,",24
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Here , again, is the same implication-that the officials say who are operating these provisions' are conniving at wrong-doing by this side.",24
150,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I did not say that. I said that your organizations could use it better.,24
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What ' other explanation is there if it is followed point by point?,24
152,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,You - are too^ innocent.,24
153,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order ! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is out of order.,24
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I try to interpret the English language in a plain and straightforward way; aud when the honourable member says that our party is permitted to do wrong, while the other side do nothing but what is right, I say that it is a gross reflection on the officers of the Department, as well as upon those people outside who are set to administer justice. But what are the facts? From 1904 until 30th April, 1914, that is ten years, there have been only ten cases of irregularity. If that is gross and widespread wrong-doing, I should like to know the honourable member's idea of what immunity from crime is. There are ten cases, and not a case of fraud in the whole period. The fines tell their own tale. They ranged from £ 1 up to £ 5 . The offences have been confined generally to irregularities, mostly on the part of justices of the peace who have not ascertained the truth of the statements they have witnessed. Those are the irregularities that have been hauled up before the Courts. Not one case of a man manipulating the postal vote has been brought before the Law Courts. While that is so in regard to postal voting, there have been numberless cases of fraud in regard to the Electoral Act generally. Therefore, this conclusion emerges-that the postal voting sections ql the Electoral Act have been most faithfully administered, and most, severely safeguarded, and that of all the provisions of the Act, they are the one part which has worked well, and as to which there has been no fraud that has been discoverable and punishable. There is the record of ten years, and it is a deadly one for my honourable friends oppositeonly ten cases of irregularity in ten years ? operation of the postal vote.",24
155,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I would not believe that you could be so easily deceived.,25
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am always prepared to ber deceived by official facts given to me by persons who have no object in. life whatever but to state the factsmen outside our own party feelings, who - are not dominated by party passionsas .we are. Those are the facts that they - give to us, and they say, in trumpet that if ever a part of the Electoral Act was fairly and properly administered, if - ever a portion of such a measureworked well, it was the postal-voting sections-. Every other portion of the Act has been indicted at some time or other because of some fraud or other being perpetrated under it.",25
157,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,There must be a lot of sick people in Kooyong ,25
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I have heard a great deal about Kooyong in connection with this matter. What does it. mean ? Simply that the people in Kooyong exercised their vote.,25
159,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,B y post. Mr RIOHAEDFOSTER:-In accordance with the law.,25
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Quite so.,25
161,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,-There must be a lot of sickly people there.,25
162,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order ! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports must not continue to interject.,25
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Has it come io this, that when we get a good' poll in an electorate it is evidence of fraud and chicanery? ' Mr Mathews interjecting,",25
164,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I have just pointedly asked the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to cease interjecting, and I am sorry the honourable member has again immediately done so. If he continues to disregard my authority, I shall take another course.",25
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"It is the most' astounding thing that I know of, that, because a vote is taken advantage of to the fullest extent, because it is used extensively, the very thing we are encouraging people every day to do, that is to be regarded as proof positive of fraud and chicanery. The object of the postal-voting provisions is almost to compel people to vote. There is compulsion in our electoral law. We say that people must register, and we say, also, by the mouthsof the Opposition , 1 that if they do vote, and vote well,, they are fraud's* That is what honourable members are saying. What else is there in the argument about the Kooyong electorate?' Bas-any voter in Kooyong been punished for fraud? There are plenty 1 of agencies for finding out what is going on, and we may be sure that if Fraud did take placein Kooyong it would have been unearthed long ago. Some people tonesj know nearly everything - that is going on to-d!ay, sometimes even before Ministers d'o, and yet as to these matters; concerning whichthey make the most astounding allegations, they know nothing and cando nothing. All they do is to insinuate and imply that fraud has taken place, simply because the people of Kooyong recorded a plumper vote. I say that these facts-,, rightly considered, show to what extent this vote has been availed of; show the need that this vote was intended to meet; and show that the result is satisfactory. All these reasons honourable members bring forward, when they are analyzed, are reasons for the perpetuation of the vote, and not for its destruction or abolition. The reason why there have not been many prosecutions underthis postal vote section is the severity of the safeguards imposed in the Act. Take one or two f acts , 1 for instance. An authorized witness has to say that he knowspersonally the person whosesignature he is witnessing, and if he-cannot show that he does-know that person, and if he does not fulfil other conditions) he is liable to a. fine of £50 and a - month's, imprisonment. , A man r must be--indeed a scoundrel who will run many risks under that proposal, and there are not many of the kind of individual in Kooyong who are fond of running their neck into a noose and risking a month's imprisonment or a fine of £50 for the sake of certifying that somebody is somebody. The same thing applies all round. When the signature has been witnessed, the application, properly accredited, goes to the Returning Officer. He is supposed to check it , to find out whether an absent vote has been polled from the same person or if a postal vote has been obtained previously; and if he is satisfied that the application is in order - he sends back a ballot-paper. Then another process has to commence. Further witnessing has to take place. The applicant has again to obtain an authorized witness, who has to certify that he knows something about the person to whose signature he is a witness, and that witness is under penalties that he shall not divulge the direction in which the vote is given. Again, the penalty staring him in the face is a fine of £100 or three months' imprisonment. The vote is sent to the Returning Officer, and the signature is again checked. I venture to say there has never been a more complete system of checks devised in connection with voting anywhere in the world than is the case with regard to the postal vote. On top of all that, honourable members opposite say, ' ' You cannot safeguard it ; you can manipulate the vote as easily as winking."" Such is not the case, and the fact that the alleged frauds have not been brought to justice and that fine or imprisonment has not been imposed in a single case is the best of all indications that no such manipulation is possible. Mr WEST,- A lot of robberies take place, but you do not find the thief. "" Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That is true; but a lot of robberies have been perpetrated, and the robbers are in gaol today and anxious to get out. There, is hot in gaol one of those rascals to whom honourable members opposite refer. Is it not singular that, though there , is a daily average of 70,000 or 80,000 sick and infirm adults in Australia, honourable members cannot sheet home a case of abuse to any of those people? Honourable members say that abuse goes on, but the fact remains that they cannot prove any case of manipulation of postal vptes. Therefore, . I , - think j we may.,.reasonably infer, that the postal vote has: not been abused, but has done a very great deal of good to invalids and sick people in the community.",25
166,Mr WEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Non e are so blind as those who will not see.,26
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Quite so, and none are so blind as those who cannot see. There are two kinds of blind people, those who will not see, and those who cannot see, and I do not know that there is anything to choose between the two. What is the reason for this postal vote? The tradition, the underlying argument all down the years from generation to generation, is that the country is best governed when all the people take a hand in the government. That is the fundamental theory of our Democracy. It rests upon that principle that the country is most safely governed-whethe r it is best governed or not is a question open to argument-bu t the theory is that society is safest when everybody is given a hand in the government of that society. That is the principle upon which we proceed, and, therefore, the vote becomes a duty to be performed, as well as a privilege to be enjoyed. There are a lot of people in the community today who think that the vote is given to them to use or not just as they choose. That is not the fundamental idea of the vote at all. The vote is not given as a mere pleasurable exercise on their part to enable them to confer a favour on some individual. The reasons for conferring the vote go further back than that. The vote is given to people in these democratic days so that the State may be safely governed, and it is believed to be more safely .governed when all the people take a hand in the governing. Clearly, therefore, voting is a duty, and that is why compulsion .has been imposed upon people to register their names. If we apply compulsion as we have done; we come across many anomalies which will require a great deal of rectification before we reach ideal conditions. Let us take this case: We compel a sick woman to register her name, and we tell her that if she does not register, she is liable to a fine of 40s. After compelling her to register, honourable members opposite are deliberately declining to give her an opportunity to record her vote. Is there anything fair about that? Honourable members lay compulsion on that woman to qualify *4so>-vote, and then deprive her of the only opportunity open to her to exercise the vote. The whole thing is illogical to the last degree. There is no reason in that sort of compulsion. Responsibility must carry its corresponding privileges, and the aim of all our electoral measures should be, as far as possible, to confer equal opportunities for voting throughout the length, and breadth of the country. The opportunities never can be equal. Even when we have done our best, there can never be equal opportunities when one man has to travel 20 miles, and lose a day or two days' pay in order to record his vote, while another has only to travel across the street at a cost of ten minutes' effort. The opportunities are not equal there, nor can they be equal when women and infirm and sick people are compelled to qualify to vote when honourable members deny them the privilege of recording their votes. They have not equal opportunity when voting day comes round. They suffer disabilities which are due, not to their own fault, but to the fact that we have laid upon these people the obligations of a civilized community. Honourable members say to them, "" Notwithstanding that we have compelled you to register, and will fine you for not doing so, you shall not vote because there is a fear that somebody might persuade you to vote wrongly."" That is the position to which honourable members opposite are driven in their opposition to this Bill .",26
168,Mr WEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,There is the violation ol the secrecy of the ballot.,27
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"All I have to say in answer to that is that if these pro visions of the Bill are carried out, the ballot ought to be very secret indeed, and if the secrecy of the ballot is being violated, then the people who connive at the opening of the ballot should be punished and put in gaol. That is the place for them; but do not deprive a woman who is lying ill in bed of the vote because some miscreant outside has not done his duty. Do not punish the innocent because of something the guilty man has done. That is what honourable members are doing in connection with the postal vote. I admit that if the manipulation of the vote had gone on to half the extent that honourable members say, it would mean a revision of the postal provisions of this Bill ; but I do not care what manipulation, has taken jplace, .we. have no right --to deprive these people of the vote,' simply because of the possibility of some miscreant doing what he should not do. Honourable members make out an argument thereby fjor"" betueir machinery, and not for the abolition' of the machinery we have. I need not worry the House further. This matter has been threshed out fairly well, and this Government, believing as we do in the fundamental basis of democratic government, believing that people ought tb be encouraged to vote, and that opportunities should be provided for them to do so, propose, if permitted, to re-impose these voting provisions in the Electoral Act, so that those women engaged in their high and holy duty, even when laid aside, and who may not mix with the crowd'to record their votes, shall still be cumbered amongst those who believe in it e i r country, and desire to help in its government. In regard to the sick and the infirm, the same argument applies. Tha Government believe that, notwithstanding that those people suffer disabilities, illness, and infirmities, yet by reason cf their lifelong service to the State, by reason of the fact that they are still residents of the State, and subject to all the disabilities that the State sometimes imposes upon them, that they are subject to all the responsibilities of taxpayers, they shall not be denied their voice in the government of the country merely because some temporary - malady has overtaken them. That is the argument for this Bill , and at that I leave it . I move the second reading and I hope that our friends opposite will assist us to put the measure on the statute-book.",27

The party to which I have the honour to belong is the party that has done more to extend the franchise and give voting facilities, consistent with the secrecy of the ballot and protection of the voter, than any other party in Australia. Our policy in that matter is unaltered. The reply to all these heroics of the Prime Minister is that he stated in 1911 that the absent vote is as good as the postal vote.",27

The honourable gentleman asked us to compare the situation of such persons with that of electors who had merely to step from one side of a street to another in order to vote. We were asked whether it was nob reasonable to facilitate the exercise of the franchise by the sick and infirm, who could vote if a ballot-paper was brought to them.

My objection to the system is absolutely sustained by the fa/it that it is beyond the wit of man. to devise a means by which any abuse of such a system can be exposed. No one can deny that the system is abused. Money, position, and social circumstances are used as a powerful lever to induce many people, jwhen voting by post, to vote other than ibheir judgment would dictate if they were free from such influences.  member is slandering the electors.",29
193,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No interjection will ideter me from saying what I intend to say in regard to this matter. Bread and butter considerations, or a desire to mainjfcain peace, induce some people exercising the postal-vote system to vote other than * they would do if they were free to exe'r-cise their independent judgment. When .we were in office we extended the facilities for voting by providing polling booths at places where sick and infirm people wei'e located, in order that they might actually place their own ballot-papers in the ballot-boxes. I do not think we could have done more than that, and, as the result of our efforts, the percentage of votes recorded throughout Australia at the last general election was greater than ever before experienced in the history of the 'Commonwealth. It is perfectly clear, therefore, that, although voting by post was abolished, the electoral machinery provided by us enabled a larger percentage of people to vote than would otherwise have been possible.",29
194,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,We had polling booths in the hospitals in some of the States.,29
195,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I have just mentioned that we established polling places where infirm and sick people were receiving attention, so that they might vote as they flesired, and actually place their own ballot-papers in a ballot-box. - Mr SAMPSON - Bii t what about the sick people living in: their own homes ?",29
196,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member for Hunter made a proposal last session to enable every sick or infirm elector to vote at home, but the Government .would have nothing to do with it. If the secrecy of the ballot is not to be violated, then every person recording his' vote should put his own ballot-paper in a ballot-box. I have referred previously to a serious disability that arises under the postal-vote system, and also where absent votes are cast prior to the day of election. In these days, when parties are so evenly balanced, the result of an election might be determined by the postal vote recorded'. Under this Bill postal votes must be cast before election day. Between the day on which they were recorded and the date of election, the political situation might have entirely changed, so that, in such circumstances, the verdict of the country might be given on the political circumstances actually existing,, not on the day of election, but at some prior date. With the postal-vote system in force, it is impossible for the will of the people to be declared as at any particular date. That is undoubtedly a serious defect. I think I am correct in saying that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs last year said that the postal-vote system was capable of fraud.",29
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"It is impossible to devise any machinery that is not capable of fraud. As long as there are fraudulent people there will be fraud, no matter what the machinery is.",29
198,Mr EISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs spoke of fraud creeping in, in a wider sense, in connection with the postal vote. Even the Prime Minister himself holds that the system, at best, is a very risky one.",29
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I have seen no reason yet to condemn it.,29
200,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"A great 'deal has been, said about depriving the - sick and the infirm of the franchise. I venture to say that large numbers of the sick and infirm have no desire to be troubled with election matters at all. The statistics furnished by Mr Knibbs as to the number of sick people are, no doubt, perfectly correct from a statistician's point of view, but I would like to add that there are many people, seriously ill , who ought not to be approached, and have no wish to be approached. Nothing in the world, however, will prevent political agents trespassing if they think they can secure a vote. It will be seen, therefore, that there are two sides to. this question. First, - we have to consider the health, and welfare of the subject, and, secondly, to safeguard the secrecy of the ballot - and provide against fraud and abuse.",29

If this Parliament is going to establish procedure of this kind, all sorts of troubles will arise.

224,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The members of the Senate are elected by the same electors, and in the same way, as are the members of this House, on a broad, democratic basis; they use the same ballot-box, and the electors are handed similar ballot-papers for both Houses. In this House, a Government with no majority seeks to deny to members of another place, even the right to deliberate on measures, and challenges that other Chamber, not only in Parliament, but in the country. Even the Governor General has been hustled and bustled by statements made publicly by the Government, in the most indecent way possible. In all my experience and reading, I never knew of a Government so forgetful of their duty, and. of the dignity of their position. Lately, however, there has been what I might call a quiet and serene calm; .a little decency has been introduced, and, perhaps, as suggested by an honourable member, near me, . a dignified representative of the , Crown has resented the making of statements regarding what may subsequently be said to him directly.

236,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The prejudging of the verdict is just the same in' either case.,31
237,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"-Honourable members know that this Ministry has trespassed in this matter in a manner reflecting no credit on it. It has been the first in the Commonwealth, and, I hope, will be the last, to do so. . Ministers claim to be, not like their Labour predecessors, unskilled in the duties and unable to uphold the t - dignity of advisers-of the Crown, but fc versed in the best traditions of responsible ""goveniment, - anoV desirous of ""upholding them. I am not one of those who .speak of the position of the Crown ligntly. The. representative of the Crown here, the Governor General, stands impartially between the political parties of the Commonwealth, to do what he considers right according to law. An y attempt to coerce him will be to the disadvantage of the nation. I could quote hundreds of passages showing that there has been such an attempt, but I do not intend to do so. Compared with a short time ago, there is now a dead calm, which is significant. We do not now hear members of the Government saying, "" Come on. Shake her up."" They say now, "" Please do not hurry with this thing."" The Caucus has been at work. There were a few plungers until it was seen that business was meant, and then their tails went down. Whatever may be the fate of the Bill , it will not determine matters. But Ministers cannot escape the consequences of their words and actions. I should like to put on record, in this connection, the opinions of some of those who framed the Constitution, and who anticipated a situation like the present. There was considerable discussion in the Federal Convention about the settling of dead-locks between the Senate and the House of Representatives. At Adelaide, in 1907, one of three proposals for dealing with the matter was the double dissolution, which was defeated. That proposal was again submitted in Sydney during the same year, when the present Treasurer was one of its strongest opponents, although he is a leading member of the Government which is now trying to force a double dissolution. It is interesting to recall at this juncture the views expressed by the right honourable gentleman when he spoke in the Convention as one of the representatives of Western AustraliaAU these precautions are unnecessary, and may ""be found mischievous, because they will encourage differences rather than put an end to-, them. If you give the power to dissolve both Houses-the double dissolution, as it has been called-allowing the Government of the day to appeal to the constituencies whenever a conflict of opinions occurs, it may, as time goes on, be used for a very different purpose from that for "" which it is being advocated at the' .present time. I can imagine that a Government, which - felt, itself somewhat weak, or which thought. that an . occasion was an opportune one for an appeal to the country, might encourage 'conflict rather than try to avoid it, 4n orderthat .in this way it might be. .able,, to,. recommend. ;a. dissolution, of bothHouses, ip (he, hope that that would strengthen their following, or at'any'length give it more ilfr. Fisher. time. . . . Knowing as we do, that the Constitution of the United States of Americahas been used for purposes foreign to the intention of its framers, you may depend upon it that, as time goes on, every possible device will be used to gain political influence and power by taking advantage of the form of the Constitution. That is what the Government is doing. The Constitution is being used by a Government of which the right honourable gentleman is a member. He knew the possibilities. Speaking again in the Convention in 1897, he saidWhat will happen under the proposal for a dual dissolution? A measure will pass tha Lower House, we will say, without any difficulty, and it will go to the Upper House. In that Chamber there is a great discussion about it. The newspapers favourable to the Government will at once begin to threaten the Upper House that if they do not pass the measure they will be dissolved. History written in advance I Apparently the Treasurer showed this Governmenb how to do whafc is proposed. He said in. advance that it would be done. While they are considering the measure & pistol will be held at their heads. Is that the sort of Constitution we want to create in this country? Is that what we desire? That theUpper House should be coerced at the beginning, that it should be told, "" If you do not pass this measure in the way we have passed', it you will be dissolved."" They would be threatened before they had actually eome to any decision, and great disaster would result. The Senate has been threatened from the day of the last election, a policy being, manufactured for the purpose. The partynewspapers were invited to make thisa cry. "" Never mind the evidence,"" they were told, "" make assertions, and create a public opinion. We are going to tackle the Upper House."" Ministers said to their political organizations and supporters in Parliament, "" We have nopolicy. Prevent us from having to produce a policy by making the obstruction of the Senate a cry. If we can stop progress in Australia, it will suit our cause,, and it will suit the capitalists who helped us into office."" Mr Justice Barton was the distinguished Leader of the Federal movement after the death of the lamented' Sir Henry Parkes. He did great' work, and deserves great credit for what he did . When he took up-the cause, he did not turn back. Whether good, bad, or in different, he stood by it u n t i l he brought about f r u it i o n. Speaking in 3897 at theConvention, Mr Justice ""Barton said„ "" Dead-lock"" is not a term which is strictlyapplicable to any case except that in which the constitutional machine is prevented from: properly working. I am in very great doubt whether the term can be strictly applied to any case except the stoppage of Legislative machinery arising out of conflict upon the finances of the country. A stoppage which arises on any matter of ordinary legislation, because the two Houses cannot come to an agreement at first, is not a thing which is properly designated by the term "" deadlock,"" because the working of the Constitution goes on-r-the constitutional machine proceeds notwithstanding a disagreement. It is only when thefuel of the machine of governmeut is withheld that the machinery of government comes to a stop, and that fuel is money. I suppose that Sir Edward Barton's opinion must count for nothing compared with that of the Cook Government when a party cause is at stake. In 1898 Sir .William MCMillan summed up the situation in this wayI do say that if you create any machinery which, under the guise of settling dead-locks, will really be used to create dead-locks, you will strike a blow absolutely at the power and dignity of the Senate. During the discussion on these Bills, M i nisters have made their position clear in regard to an, even more important matter than the double dissolution. An attack has been made on the bi-cameral system of the Constitution and the equal representation of the States in the Senate. The Prime Minister, repeating the statement originally made by the Attorney-General, has challenged us to say whether we believe in an Upper House constituted as the Senate is. Before the Constitution Bill was adopted, I did not regard the constitution of the Senate as the best that we could have, and, with others, sought to the utmost of our ability to prevent it , by constitutional means, from being accepted. Now we have a proposal fro m the Government to alter the representation in the Senate, not in a constitutional way, but for party reasons having no connection with the constitutional issue. The basis on which the Senate is elected is one State one vote. Surely that can be allowed. We have provided for one man one vote and one woman one vote, not on the ground of intellectual fitness, but because each man and each woman is a separate and distinctive entity in the community. For the constitution of a revising Chamber can you have a more logical basis than the equal representation of each State?  - votes in the ,Senate for .every vote..pos-' sessed by New South Wales!''",31
238,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"^ T he hphorabie' member must have been dreaming; wish to argue this question from a purely party point of view, because I seek to get from the Government a clear, definite, and distinct declaration. It is not a matter that can be passed on gently in order to see how the country feels 65 it. I am referring to a fundamental part of the Constitution, and the question must be tackled in a straightforward way. If the other Chamber, which is a co-ordinate House in some respects with this, is not to have a say in these matters, let it be wiped out altogether; but do not let any step with that object in view be associated with a political question of this kind that had no particular significance at the last general election. My last complaint aboub the Government is that they have no warrant from the electors to proceed with these Bills as they are doing, and that twelve months ago they had no justification in coming to this House without a programme, determined to do nothing unless they got these Bills. They are the worse enemies of Australia-worsee than trusts, combines, and monopolies, because they have an opportunity to protect the interests of the people and will not do it They do nothing, and prevent Parliament doing anything. A gentleman said today, "" Y o u seem to be busy up at the House "" ; and the reply was, "" No, nothing is being done; and that is precisely what the Government want."" They have stopped business for party political ends'. They have hindered the machinery of government in Australia for more than a year in the hope of getting a longer term with a majority in order to do what they have not the courage to do now. They have condemned much of the legislation passed by previous Federal Parliaments; they condemn it now secretly and viciously under the breath; but they say, "" We shall not interfere with it now,, We cannot do it . "" But if they can get another election on a false 'issue, with powerful press influence behind them, they hope to get a majority; and knowing them as we know them, we do not hesitate to believe that they will then nob stop short of carrying out what are their intentions, but not what they have put before the' electors. W h at does the Attorney-General.say about the maternity allowancer-^ev'en about the invalid and 'old-age pensions? W h at did the ViceI do' hot President of the Executive Council say the other day regarding the maternity allowance? ""That he is against it , but that he will not touch it now."" But if the opportunity comes "" later on,"" what will they do? They pledged themselves to deal with the Tariff, but when they got the opportunity the other day they said, "" Not now."" So with any legislation. They have delayed every urgent matter. When the question of the high cost of living came up during the last Parliament, honourable members showed how, from their point of view, they were going to'protect the interests of the poor men struggling with families; but what have they done since they came into office?",33
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Is this the postal vote?,34
240,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I was dealing with the constitutional question.,34
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,There is no constitutional question arising out of the second reading of the Postal Vote Restoration Bill. ,34
242,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Ver y well, I shall pass away from that subject. The Prime Minister says that there is no constitutional question involved. And that is what 1I have been saying. I have just been pointing out, during the absence of the Prime Minister from the chamber, that, until last week, the Ministry did little else but talk about their determination to put through these two test Bills. We only knew them as test Bills. We did not know them by their titles, but, by the language used by the Government and their supporters and the press, we knew them - as the two test Bills - And the Prime Minister said to all the world, including His Excellency the Governor General, if he would listen or read, "" We must either go on or go out.""",34
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,-What do you wish ?,34
244,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Prime Minister smiles. I do not wish to misquote him. He quite admits that "" Go on or 'go o u t "" is the proper quotation of something he has said outside the House.",34
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Yes . I do mind.,34
246,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"^-The Minister of Trade and Customs, who was - representing, the ^Prime Minister during the latter's absence from the chamber, had denied it ; but I had put the quotation to the Prime Minister previously, and he, had .admitted, 'We'shalF not delay this B i ^ long..

248,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"We feel that a young country cannot afford to waste an unlimited amount of time on stagnation. The Government have had ample opportunity to show the country whether they have a policy or not, or whether they intend to go on with anything; but they have failed absolutely to propose anything or suggest anything.",34
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What nonsense I,34
250,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Declamator y statements about the Opposition are not the business of the Government. It is a recognised principle in deliberative assemblies and Parliaments constituted on a representative and responsible government basis' that, in regard to policy, the Opposition may. say or do what they please; but that it is the bounden duty of a Government, while the people are calling for legislation, to even anticipate their wants; or, at any rate, when their duty is plainly to be seen, to proceed with legislation that is urgently called for-=as advisers of the Crown, to see that that legislation is brought in, and to do everything possible to pass it through Parliament. The present Government have failed in their duty in that respect, and it is the duty of the Opposition to see that Ministers are afforded the earliest opportunity of "" getting out,"" so that the business of the country may go on.",34
251,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Werriwa) [5.0] - An interjection by the honourable member for Maranoa has brought to my mind an utterance of the Leader of the Opposition, in which he stated that blame rested with the Liberal party for not dealing with the Tariff during the last twelve months, during which time the Inter-State' Commission has been appointed particularly tp deal with that subject. In other words, he is asking this Housey before the report of an independent body of men",34
252,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable memnot ber 'must discuss the Bill. Irrelevant interjections do not .justify an irrelevant speech.,34
253,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"^I just wish to say that' the honourable member had thr.ee years in which tp ""deal with that question, and did not deal with it at all. it . ""When .the^hbnorjable ..member takes, ex""cep^ioji '.to JP*tfili ,'ipjr rest^rirjg the postal M vote',''and says that it. is a measure, that is aimed' against the Labour party, which the Liberals have brought forward with no hope of being able to pass it , I am astounded; because, if we are to judge by his own utterances, the restoration of the postal vote is one of the very first things that should be attended to. Speaking on the l l t h December, 1905, after the late Mr Batchelor had moved an amendment against some of the provisions of the postal vote, the Leader of the Opposition said I am sorry to hear so many of my friends attacking the postal vote provisions of the Electoral Act. I regard those provisions as the necessary corollary to a universal franchise Because certain persons may have misused the privileges conferred by an Act of Parliament, we ought not to deprive even one eligible voter of the opportunity to exercise the franchise. One would imagine, from the statements of some honourable, members, that these postal votes are ope.i to the publio. As a matter of fact, they - re, and ought to be, as secret as if they were placed io the ballot-box. Then after an interjection by Mr . Batchelor, he saidDoes he say that we cannot reach such offenders I",34
254,Mr BATCHELOR,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I am certain that we cannot.,35
255,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I say that we can. Whan sueh offences are proved, the Government which failed to reach their authors would not continue in office very long. Upon the proposal to require an elector who wishes to avail himself of the postal provisions of the Act to go before a postmaster, I am opposed to the honourable member for Boothby, for the reason that there are many cripples who are mentally sound, but whom it would be absolutely impossible to take to a post-office. Why should they be deprived of the right to exercise the franchise f The honourable and learned member for Corio points out that the mere fact of another person looking at the signature of a voter is an offence. In these circumstances, the honourable member will see that we are merely restoring the provisions of the Electoral Act to which he gave his full support.  with the sick and invalid alone. "" Mr CONROY - The Bill merely restores the postal vote as it was, but with further safeguards against the violation of it .  safeguards ?",35
256,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"There is even a penalty for looking at the signature of a voter. When the provisions were first adopted, a good many safeguards were passed, so many' that the honourable member for Gwydir pointed out that we f a n a danger of abolishing the chance of its being properly exercised. When we look at the number of votes exercised, and at how many thousands of women who think it much more pleasant to vote in that way, and when we think of the number of people who reside 4 or 5 miles from a polling booth-whe n we add them all up, the surprise to us as a Parliament is that greater advantage was not taken of the postal vote.  grant facilities to those people, but not to everybody.",35
257,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"We are only reinstating the electoral law exactly as it was before, and to try to deal with the matter in any other way is to endeavour to throw dust in the eyes of the public. The honourable member's remark cannot be said to be a genuine and valid excuse. The number of persons who exercised the postal vote throughout the Commonwealth at the last election in which that vote was in use was only 29,000, and in some constituencies there were not more than 1,500 postal votes recorded, although there were as many as 35,000 voters on the rolls of some electorates.",35
258,Mr TUDOR,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No electorate polled 35,000.",35
259,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"But there were that number on the roll, and the highest number of postal votes recorded in any one constituency was, I think, 1,430. Therefore, all this talk about the abuse of the postal vote, and about the necessity of safeguarding the public against imaginary dangers is not correct.",35
260,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"They were real dangers in Queensland, and everywhere else.",35
261,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I do not know what happened in Queensland, but the evil could not have been great, otherwise the Ministry, of which the honourable member was head, would have put the Act into force. I give the honourable member that much credit, that if there had been any frau d he and his Ministers would have been too sound in administration to allow such a thing to take place without trying to fit the punishment to the crime. The total number of postal votes polled in Queensland was only 4,020, so that the proportion was not very great.",35
262,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Does not the honourable member see that that is the same proportion as for the Commonwealth as a whole?,35
263,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Yes , just., about' the same proportion, which"" is exactly what one would expect, . ad Queensland is becoming more settled. In fact, I should expect a closely settled constituency like Melbourne to exercise a slightly larger proportion of postal votes than country constituencies, because there are perhaps alarger number of old people who have come to live in the cities, and a greater number of women who are necessarily living in the big centres. In the circumstances I have mentioned, any objection on the part of honourable members opposite to the passage of this Bill must be on the ground that they do not propose to allow any legislation brought forward by the present Government to pass. When welook up the utterances of honourable members, this seems to be the very measure that they ought not to have opposed, seeing how carefully it was selected to meet their wishes, as expressed in the utterances by the honourable members for Wide Bay, Gwydir, and Herbert, and other honourable members. It really seems, as if the Prime Minister had gone to extremes in his desire to meet the wishes of the Opposition, aud to try to legislate on a matter in regard to which this House has always been in entire accord. That is to say, all the leaders and Ministers of the Labour party were fully in accord with the restoration of the postal-vote provisions. Therefore, when this Bill was brought forward, so far from being treated as introducing an element of discord, it ought to have been accepted as a matter of harmony between us all,  ward as a test measure.",35
264,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"There was no word said at that particular time about a constitutional difficulty, beyond the expression of opinion by members on both sides of the House that with parties so equally balanced it would be difficult for the Government to carry on, unless a spirit of conciliation were shown by the Labour party. To cultivate that spirit of conciliation, and to try to meet the wishes of members of the Opposition, what did the Government do? They ransacked Hansard to ascertain what Bills the Opposition were likely to agree to. found that the Leader of the Labour party, and the great bulk of Labour members, expressed the desire that the provisions of the postal vote should be in. operation. - Now we bring, forward this measure, and such is the. forceof party, opposition that, I regret to say, honourable members seem not to recognise the olive branch that is thrown out to them, but treat the Bill as if it were a measure which had been brought down by the Government in a manner hostile to them. If honourable members were not treating this Bill in an absolutely party spiritif they were desirous of supporting any legislation at call-the y would recollect what they said in times past, and would bear in mind the words of the honourable member for Wide Bay, that "" We ought not to prevent any citizens exercising the franchise if it is possible to grant it to them."" I have already said that 29,000 citizens did exercise the franchise by means of the postal vote when it was last in use, and those people we now debar from exercising the franchise: Therefore, honourable members can only be opposing this Bill in a spirit of factious opposition. I am glad to hear that the members of the Opposition are not going to put forward much argument against the measure; they will only vote, no doubt being anxious to restrict discussion, lest they should be confronted with their own speeches on the subject. I think it is only right that the country should know that the Labour party are acting in such a spirit of opposition that the very measure which the Government have picked out as the measure which more members spoke in favour of than any other measure that could be suggested, is being opposed by them most bitterly, as if it were likely to injure thousands instead of being a boon to thousands of people. Again, on behalf of the great mass of workers in this community, I take exception to the utterance of the honourable member for Wide Bay that, merely because of monetary or social influences, electors will vote against their own convictions.",36
265,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,He did not say that.,36
266,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member said that money and social circumstances were brought into play, and that those interfered with the exercise of that right to vote that ought to be exercised freely by every adult. It is clear that We that slander-if one is to treat it as such . - can . only apply to the working people who support the Labour party. The honourable member's remarks, cannot apply to the Liberal voter, because if. he votes ^a§ he."" had .intended to. vote,5vthere could'<ii . ; have been no influence brought to bear -' upon, him, and therefore there was no injury done to the community. The only slander is upon the working man, who thinks with the Labour party, but, owing - to certain influences, votes the other way. I decline to believe that amongst the honest, sound workmen of 'Australia can be found people so amenable to influence as to barter their votes for money or for a word of praise. If that is the case, the sooner we find out those voters and take the franchise away from them the better. And the sooner the members of the Labour' party cease talking about such voters being "" the voice of God "" the better, because clearly men of that type are much more fitted to belong to the criminal class than to any other. On behalf of the ordinary average elector - of Australia, I must take exception to the statement made by the Leader of the Labour party that amongst the workers there are so .many with Labour tendencies who yet vote against their convictions. I do not believe that statement, and I say that the honourable member's remarks are a slander on so many workers in the community that ought not to be uttered by a member professing to be acting in the interests of Labour. Members of the Opposition should cease cackling about protecting the interests of Labour when we find them opposing a Bill that would recognise the right of the whole of the workers of Australia as against the 400,000 who are organized. Honourable members say, "" No ; we will stand for the 400,000 organized men, and they may be able, by reason of their organization, to beat the others who are disorganized.""",36
267,Mr TUDOR,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"We do not want "" scabs.""",37
268,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"If the honourable member means that nobody is to live unless he belongs to a union, let him say so. However, I am not going to be drawn into an argument as to whether everybody should belong to a.union or not. All I contend is that, whether a man is in a union or out of one, if he has the right and the capacity to exercise a vote, but is in ill-health, or; for any of various other reasons mentioned in the Bill, is unable to attend a polling booth, he should be given an opportunity to vote. We seek to broaden the franchise. I am not going, to argue at this moment whether this is the simplest way to do it , or .whether the mere restoration of'the postal vote would be the best method' which one would wish to adopt to give effect to our desire, but in this way we are restoring those clauses of the previous Electoral Act which allowed a postal vote to be recorded. It is manifest from their opposition to this Bill that members of the Opposition would, if they had the chance, deprive the people of'the country of any opportunity of exercising a postal vote.",37
269,Mr LATRD SMITH,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Why did your party knock the postal vote out in Queensland ?,37
270,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I have nothing to do with what any party did in Queensland or elsewhere. Considering the expressions of opinion from members on both sides, and the number of members who, by their previous speeches, were fully committed to the postal vote, I say that the Labour party, in opposing this Bill, are acting unwisely. They may be blocking legislation, but I am not sure that that is a good party move, even at the present time, although the people have not had a full opportunity of understanding what has been done. Where the general elector has an opportunity of seeing what is being done by the Labour party, and of seeing how it may Tall to his lot to be deprived of his vote, and to hundreds of others who are mentally capable of voting, but who are incapacitated by illness from going to a polling booth, the elector must, if he believes in adult franchise, record his vote against those people who seek to deny him and other citizens of their right to vote. We seek to restore the postal vote, which 29,000 electors exercised on a previous occasion. By the action of the Labour party, probably an even greater number were deprived of the opportunity of voting at the last election, because once the provisions were better understood they would be made more use of, and many people would have been able to exercise the vote who, not aware of the absent-voting provisions, found, themselves disfranchised through being unable to attend a polling booth.",37
271,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Will the honourable member tell us what became of the thousands of the postal votes that were not recorded after they were issued?,37
272,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Eve n if it does appear that in one or two cases postal vote papers were missing, it is manifest that' they were never recorded at'.alT. JWe cannot prevent fraud or the breaking of any law. No one has' ever asser{ted that an 1 ; Act of Parliament can be so framed as to prevent any violation of it . It is precisely the type of men who are constantly breaking the law that we recognise as belonging to the criminal type. The Government have met the Opposition in a spirit of conciliation. The Government Preference Prohibition Bill, for instance, did not affect awards made by the Arbitration Court. It related only to Government employees. I would have gone very much further, but the Government apparently desired to conciliate honourable members opposite, just as they are accommodating them now in connection with this Bill. There has been too much conciliation. I would have cleared the ground at once, and would have said that no man has a right to force another-to enter a union, and to contribute to funds which may be used by secretaries or any one else for political purposes. The Opposition have been met by the Government in a spirit of conciliation, and yet they are not satisfied. They talk of the two test Bills. The Bills were really to test the sincerity of the Opposition-to test whether they would allow us to do any business.",37
273,Mr SHARPE,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Who 'called them test Bills?,38
274,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member and his leader have done so.,38
275,Mr SHARPE,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,They were so described in the first instance by the Government.,38
276,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Something had to be brought forward to test whether honourable members opposite would allow the Government to deal with any business whatever. In this Bill the Government are proposing something of which approval has at one time or other been expressed by members of the late Administration. We are, therefore, holding out the olive branch to honourable members opposite.",38
277,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Surely the honorMinistry, able member does not mean .that ?",38
278,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"It is true that some honourable members opposite regard it , as an olive branch, but rather as a piece of prickly pear. They may yet find that it is a prickly pear,-and their digestions will suffer accordingly. There is probably a good deal of confusion amongst honourable members opposite. No doubt many of the more moderate members of the party would be prepared, but for party rule, to pass this Bill without any trouble of my remarks. whatever . They know that it should hive 1 their support.",38
279,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,It would have been through by now if the honourable member had not risen to speak.,38
280,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Bill is designed to enable votes to be recorded by manycitizens who would otherwise be disfranchised. In opposing it, honourable members are utterly losing sight of the interests of the electors.",38
281,Mr HANNAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What is the object of this obstruction?,38
282,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"To allow the Labour party time to reflect. I am afraid, however, that they are not prepared to give much consideration to a matter of this kind. They are afforded an opportunity to vote with us to restore the postal vote system, and if they avail themselves of it they will show that they have at last reached the stage of repentance. The olive branch is held out to them by the Government, and if it be accepted they will find a willingness on the part of honourable members on this side of the House to meet them.",38
283,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member might afwell save his treacle.,38
284,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member need not take advantage of it . If the Opposition, even at this late stage, showed some desire to allow legislation to proceed, I am satisfied that they would find the Ministry and the great bulk of honourable members on this side willing to meet them. Every one knows that a dissolution must involve great expense,' and the present state of affairs is such; perhaps, that it is undesirable, in the best interests of the country, that a general election should take place if it can be avoided. But honourable members opposite are forcing it upon us. They are declining to allow any business to be done, and even now are opposing a measure which, if introduced by any other would have received their support. The bulk of the legislation introduced by the late Government was opnot posed to the interests of the people. The legislation of the Labour party has been in the direction of making capital dearer, and making it harder for the poor to live.",38
285,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What has this to do with the Bill?,38
286,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am glad that the honourable gentleman is feeling the sting The objection that,,,is being offered to this Bill cannot commend itself to the thoughtful members of the Opposition. Party rule, however, is being exercised, and, although the bulk of the Opposition are at heart in favour of this Sill, they are absolutely determined not to allow it or any other legislation to be passed by the present Government. I adjure honourable members opposite to forego their party prejudices. Surely they must recognise that it is the duty of Parliament to afford every citizen an opportunity to vote. To the wealthy man who owns a motor-car, and who can travel some distance to a polling booth without any inconvenience whatever, this Bill means nothing. The wealthy man can afford to pay for a conveyance, but the poor cannot, and the Labour party, in opposing this Bill, are seeking to deprive many poor persons of the right to exercise the franchise. They pretend to be in favour of the workers of the community, yet they legislate against them. The poor who cannot hire a conveyance to go to a polling place are to be deprived of the right to vote by post.",38
287,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member would be the first to vote for any measure that would deprive the worker of the right to vote.,39
288,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No , I believe in voting by post. The Labour party. have legislated on behalf of trusts. Are they now going to deprive large numbers of the poorer section of the community of the right to vote? If they could do so, they would deprive of the franchise every one who had declared that he was not in-favour of their party. - Mr ARTHUR - Eve n the honourable member does not believe that ",39
289,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I know that the honourable member would object to anything of the kind, but the attitude of his party suggests that they are working in that direction. I appeal to them to vote as they think. They voted at one time for the postal-vote system, andwe are now seeking to restore it - But it seems that they are not prepared to allow even the proposals they favour to go through, so that when they say to the Government, "" If you had brought along something else, we would have voted for it , "" they must know that they are saying what is not correct.",39
290,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"That isf fi serious stateftefc't to makeW> . - members , 1tfr.. CONROY-And I.am unable.to r qualify it j in fact, I think that the late Mr Batchelor was the only one that disagreed with the then attitude of the Labour party. Are honourable members opposite going to vote in accordance with their opinions, or as the Caucus may dictate? It is clear that the rejection of fchis Bill would not affect the wealthy people, but would strike at what may be called the poorer voters. There seems fco ,be an impression that the opposition to the Bill is on solid party grounds, but that is not so, because there is scarcely a Labour man who is not in full accord with the measure. Honourable members opposite who disregard their previous votes are not a Labour party, but a "" trust "" party, whether the "" trust"" be called a "" union,"" or by any otlier name.",39
291,Mr ARTHUR,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Then it is a wonder we do not get any help from the trusts.,39
292,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Does the honourable member deny that the Labour party do get help from trusts? Certainly, the party on this side of the House never get any such assistance. The Bill is to restorefcoevery citizen a right, the exercise of which worked very well for at leastthree elections.",39
293,Mr SPENCE,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Why was it repealed?,39
294,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Because , as it was said, the Labour party considered that more postal votes were cast in favour of the Liberals than for their own side. That is a statement that I never made use of myself, but, if it were true, it was not a reason for repeal, but for scrutinizing the electoral machinery - Every one should be able to exercise his own judgment in political matters.",39
295,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,That is what we desire.,39
296,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"But some unions declare that if a member votes other than as"" they direct he shall be excluded from membership.",39

306,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"If honourable members opposite are prepared to permit legislation, and thus make a dissolution unnecessary, no one will welcome the fact more than will the Government, who are simply forced to their present position by the attitude of honourable members opposite. This Bill makes a proposal of which the Labour party formerly expressed approval; and if they will not accept such legislation, what kind of legislation can we expect them to accept? Their present attitude is contrary to the interests of the country, and certainly contrary to the .interests of large bodies and it will have the effect of forcing on the community a dissolution-a n event which has not been sought by the Liberal party, and would not be sought by them now, were it not for the rejection of legislation of this kind..",40

I agree with him. I go further, and say that it weakens the power of the Senate to a degree which may, perhaps, be found unwholesome at some future time, and in a manner of which I , as a Constitutionalist, do not quite approve. But there is no other course left open to us. If honourable members will persist in their opposition, we must do what we are doing, because the country cannot be allowed to clamour, unsatisfied, for necessary legislation.",40
309,Mr ABTHUB,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member is, therefore, consenting to destroy the Constitution ? Mr CON/ROY -^N-o. The Constitution was framed under the belief that it would be used by men exercising their intelligence and judgment on public matters, but honourable members opposite are not doing that. TJnder these circumstances, we have no option but to send these Bills to the Senate, though even at this late hour the Labour party has a chance to show its regret for what has been done, aud to alter its attitude. honourable Mr JH CATTS (Cook) [5.52] I wish to show the hypocrisy of the Government in this matter, and to convict Ministers out of their own mouths. On the l l t h September of last year the Honorary Minister brought in a Bill to amend the Electoral Act. That Bill provided for the restoration of the postal vote under certain conditions. By it the exercise of the postal vote was surrounded with many safeguards, which were not in the Act in 1909, an admission by the Government that the exercise of the postal vote, as provided for in that Act, was not sufficiently safeguarded against corruption - The main additional safeguards that were provided in the amending Elecof electors; toral Bill number nine1. Additions to authorized witnesses. 2. Safeguards re absent voters. 3. Official envelopes to be used. Addresses to be printed thereon., 4. Envelope with ballot-paper to be sealed by elector, not authorized witness. 5. Voting certificate to be enclosed in envelope with^ ballot-paper. 6. Direction to authorized - witness 'to The take charge of and post ballot paper, struck but. 7. Returning officer not to open envelope if signature doubtful. Previously this direction applied to the ballot-paper not the envelope. 8. Returning officer to consecutively number envelopes containing postal ballot-papers. 9. General alterations in directions to returning officers in regard to the count and scrutiny of postal ballot-papers. Although all these safeguards were contained in the amending Electoral - Bill introduced last September, the Government now asks us to pass a Bill providing that sections 3, 4, 14, 23, 35, and 38 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1911 shall be repealed, and the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-9 which were repealed by those sections revived and re-enacted. I u other words, Ministers now propose to go back to the provisions relating to the exercise of the postal vote which were contained in the Act of 1909, although in September of last year they regarded those provisions as lamentably deficient in safeguards against bribery and corruption.  object to those safeguards?",40
310,Mr JH CATTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No . The Government dropped the Bill during its second reading stage. The Bill , besides providing for the safeguards to which I have referred, - made an attack upon the secrecy of the ballot; and had the Bill been passed, it would have revived a condition of things that obtained in 1830, the time of the rotten boroughs. When it was pointed out to Ministers that they had got themselves into a hole by interfering with the secrecy of the ballot by compelling each elector to sign the butt from which his ballot-paper, numbered in the same way, was torn, Ministers dropped the Bill .",41
311,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member is not now discussing the Bill before the Chair.,41
312,Mr JH CATTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I propose only to add to what I have said that proof of my statements is easily obtainable. The first safeguard that I have mentioned can be found by comparing section 109 of the Act of 1909 with clause 110 of the Bill introduced last September. 1 : TKe second''safeguard can^be found by"" comparing section 110 of the Act of 1909 with clause T12 of the 1913 Bill . The third and fourth will be proven by comparing section 118A of the 1909 Acb with clause 116 of the 1913 Bill . The fifth will be found by comparing section 118A of the 1909 Act with clause117 of the 1913 Bill.. The sixth is the omission of section 11 8B from the 1909 Act . The seventh can be found by comparing section 119 of the Ac t with clause 119 of the Bill of 1913. The general alteration of instructions to Returning Officers in regard to thetreatment and counting of the postal ballot-papers will be found by comparing section 119 of the Act of 1909 with clause119 of the Bill of 1913.",41
313,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I have not yet been able to connect the honourable member's remarks with the Bill before the Chair. ',41
314,Mr JH CATTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Bill provides for the re-enactment in their entirety of the repealed sections of the Ac t of 1909, which provide for postal voting; and the Government is clearly convicted of hypocrisy in connection with the introduction of the present Bill , because in September last it introduced a Bill to amend the Electoral Act , which provided for the restoration of postal voting surrounded with the safeguards thab I have mentioned, all of which are now omitted. The omission of these safeguards shows that the present Bill is introduced for an ulterior purpose, and not bond fide' for the re-establishment of the postal vote. The Prime Minister, in referring today to the invalids and women folk, spoke with his tongue in his cheek, having regard to the Bill introduced last September and immediately abandoned. If the postal vote were surrounded with reasonable safeguards, such as those suggested last session, there would be less objection to ib. I am in favour of the postal vobe, and of affording every facility to the women of Australia to exercise the franchise. If the Government is prepared to deal seriously with the matter, and to accept suggestions for reasonable amendments to safeguard the exercise of the postal vote against corruption, it can claim my vote. But u n t i l I see evidence of sincerity I cannot support the Bill . I do not wish to occupy further time. I recognise that the Government is not out for honest legislation, but merely intends a b it of party trickery. If it 'is to be a battle of wits, the best way in .which to ; treat Ministers is to give them the Bill as soon as possible. We know that they have no other legislative proposals that they seriously wish to bring forward. Let them go to the Governor General and receive the rebuff which they are sure to get. Then we shall have a change of Government, and there will be a chance of getting needed legislation of a national character.  no intention of occupying much time, but after the glaring statements of the honourable members for Wide Bay and Cook, I should be wanting in my duty to my electors and the country if I made no reply. The honourable member for Cook has stated that the Government should have inserted in this Bill the safeguards contained in the amending Electoral Bill of last year; but, according to honourable members opposite, the weak thing about the Amending Bill was that the safeguards introduced were not sufficient to prevent corruption in connection with the exercise of the postal vote. Now, if there was one point on which they centred their attack on the Bill, it was the weakness of the safeguards proposed. Yet the honourable member for Cook has the audacity to say that were those safeguards incorporated in this Bill, honourable members opposite would vote for it. Eor three or four weeks the Amending Elec- torarBill was discussed until we were sick and tired of it, the whole attack being centred upon the weakness of the safeguards proposed for the protection of the postal vote. I represent a country electorate, and I think that it is high time that the opinions of the country electors should be voiced. ' The people living in the country are the backbone and sinew of the They are the pioneers who have sacrificed the pleasures of living in big cities, where there are all .the advantages of cation, amusement, and where there are .churches, telephones, and everything that makes life agreeable, and where, at poll. ing time, all a man has to do is, perhaps, to go across the road and record a vote. Country electors should have equal rights with city electors. . Honourable members boast of the principle of "" one man one ' vote, one. vote one value "" ; ""but where equality of value come in when one rrfan has,' perhaps, to travel fo*"" flays to 1 cord his vote-the honourable member for Maranoa has repeatedly told us that many electors in his district have to travel 100 miles to record their voteswhile in the city a man can jump on a tram and record his vote in ten minutes? In the country a man may have to spend a week or ten days in order to record his vote. Yet honourable members have the audacity to say, as a party, that they believe in the principle of "" one man one vote, one vote one value."" Their claim is simply nonsense. There is no such thing as "" one value "" in it, when a man in the city can vote in ten minutes, and the man in the country has to lose, perhaps, ten days in order to vote. In regard to the safeguards attached to postal voting, if we look into the absent-voting provisions dealing with persons who are leaving Australia for other countries, we find that the conditions under which these people vote are. exactly similar to those under which they are asked to vote under the postal-voting provisions. The difference is that between tweedledum and tweedledee; it is so microscopic that it may be said to be invisible. Honourable members put that provision in regard to absent voting on the statute-book because they knew that the majority of the sailors who would vote under it would be voting for their side, and, so long as they secured a majority by means of that system, they were perfectly satisfied with it , though they strongly objected to postal voting, because at one election the Liberal party secured a majority of 12,000 votes, which was the assertion of the three Labour Senate candidates in New South Wales. They made that statement at Dubbo and Wellington, and in other parts of the State. It - was repeatedly said that, through the postal-vote proviland. sions, the Liberals got a majority of 12,000 votes. One reason more than an: other why I support the postal-voting edu- provision is that stated by the honourable member for Werriwa, that the rich people have motor cars and buggies, whereas the poorer people have fo tramp to the polling booths, Those who have to. tramp long distances to - polling booths . should, be permitted to vote by post. It would seem, from the - obstruction and interjections, pf does honourable members, that, the Liberals are <Be'v strongest supporters, o.t the. working - reclasses, who; should not Beucompelled «jfe> put' down^ theirtools and leave their 1 work, and waste their time, to record their votes, if other means can be devised which would avoid that waste of time. The honourable member for Wide Bay occupied some little time in dealing with the system in force in Queensland some years ago. He did not compare the Queensland system with the Commonwealth system. I wish he had done so. He told us how Queensland had first adopted postal voting, and then abolished it, and he quoted speeches by Mr Kidston ; but he did not quote his own speech in which he favoured it, because it did not suit his purpose to do so. Nor did he tell the House that the system had been re-introduced into Queensland; and he did not speak of the numerous safeguards attaching to the Commonwealth system, and of the few in regard to the Queensland system. Between the two systems there was as wide a difference as the difference between the poles. Then the honourable member inferred-and it was a wicked insinuation-that the postal-voting system opened the door to fraud and corruption, and that money could purchase scores of votes for the Liberals. The honourable member travelled through New South Wales during the recess, and complained about the manner in which the Prime Minister had slandered the electors of Australia, but the insinuation of the honourable member that the votes of the sick and crippled and halt, and those far removed from polling booths, could be bought, was a most gross slander upon the people of Australia. I can hardly imagine such words being uttered by one professing to lead the Labour party. The honourable member explained that facilities for voting had been extended to all hospitals. He showed that the inmates of hospitals and such-like institutions could vote. But if they have that right, why should not those outside hospitals have it-the sick, laid up in their own homes? Why discriminate? Simply because the Leader of the Opposition knows well that the class who are likely to vote for him will be inmates of hospitals, while those who are laid up in their own homes are likely tb vote for the Liberals. That is the inference I draw from the argument of the honourable member. He also argues that people who are so sick that they are either mentally incapacitated or. enfeebled in mind, and are, perhaps,"" not conscious of what they are doing, should have votes, yet people in their full mental capacity are to be denied the right to vote by post if they happen to be mora than 5 miles from a polling booth. The franchise in Australia was the most perfect under the sun until the Labour party interfered with the inestimable privilege granted to the people living over 5 miles from a polling booth; and those who are sick and infirm; and w» cannot say that Parliament'is representative of all the electors until we give all the electors the right to vote. When we extend the right to vote to every person, no matter what his position may be, or what may be the condition of his health, we shall be representative of the whole of the electors of Australia. In New South Wales and Victoria, there are pastoral and agricultural societies composed of both Labour and Liberal members of the community. These societies do not recognise parties, they comprise all parties, and the members have real happy times at their annual shows. Each society has a board of directors, or committee of management, and the method of electing these directors is to send out ballot-papers' to be filled in and returned by post. Each member has a postal vote sent to him. There are no complaints about the system. Though there are many Labour members on these committees, they do not complain. They are perfectly satisfied with the system. The local governing boards of New South Wales have power to adopt the principle: of voting by post, and half the shires in that State have adopted it / And those councillors, six for each shire, are elected by the postal vote in many shires. There is no complaint about it ; there are no indignation meetings throughout the country to protest against that application of the postal-vote system. The people are perfectly satisfied, and everything goes on all right. Another instance is that of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, the biggest financial institution in Australia. I insured with that society about twenty years ago, and every year I receive fronfSydney ballot-papers so that. I may vote for the board of directors. The Australian Mutual Provident Society is not a Liberal institution. An. analysis of its policy-holders would probably disclose that there are just as many amongst them who haye Labour principles as have Liberal principles. Yeb they are satisfied to carry on their business through a board of directors elected by postal vobe. Surely if the principle is good enough for the Australian Mutual Providenb Society, for the local governing bodies and for other institutions, there is abundant reason why it should likewise be satisfactory as part of our electoral law. I .am not speaking with any party feeling, but because I am honestly interested in the country people of Australia, and for their sake I support this Bill. I may be permitted to relate a little experience of my own. A few years ago I vislbed the Bourke district, with a view to buying Winbar station, along the Darling River. The station comprises about half-a-million acres, and carried a lot of sheep; it seemed a very cheap proposition. The homestead was 20 miles from a polling booth, and the boundary-rider lived some 40 miles from the homestead. When we reached his hut, we were discussing politics with him, and he told us that in order to record his vote he was obliged to travel 40 miles to the homestead and then another 20 miles to the polling booth, making a total of 60 miles. I consider that that man ought to have the right to vote by post.",41
315,Mr TUDOR,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,How could he?  have found a justice of the peace within shorter distance than he had to travel to a booth. As soon as one mentions ljustices of the peace there is a storm of abuse from the Opposition side; but a very careful analysis made in this House only a few months ago showed that there Were more justices appointed from the Labour side than from this side.,44

320,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"West Sydney) [6.25]. ' - We are again confronted by bhis measure, which is placed before the House to effect a purpose bo which the Governmenb declare they are irrevocably committed. .That being so, we have a right to inquire whab that purpose is. While that inquiry is pertinent and proper in connection, with all measures, it is emphatically necessary in the case of a measure which, on the, face of it , is designedly introduced for the purpose, not of giving votes to those who have no votes now, but to afford the party on the Government bench an opportunity of going to the counbry while the voting machinery remains as it is. That is to say, this Bill is a sham. I contend that if this Bill were rightly treated, you, Mr. Speaker, as custodian of the liberties and privileges of the House, would declare it to be an abuse of the processes of this Legislature, because the time of the representatives of the people could surely be better occupied bhan in a fubile discussion on a mabter which, by no manner of means, can affect the well-being of any human being in bhis country. The rapidly increasing number of orations: which we hearfrom, the Government bench in favour of this much-needed, reform, as it is called, are intended, not for the purpose to which they are temporarily attached by label, bub for anobher and quite obvious purpose. I propose-, during the very brief time bhat I intend, to occupy the Chamber; bo direct, my remarks-to one or two of the most important features of the measure as such, as well, as bo the real and deliberate purpose for which ib is introduced. Silting suspended from 6.30 to 7.^.5 p.m.",44
321,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Considerin g this Bill first of all as a measure of electoral reform, the whole circumstances show it to be a sham. Let us look at the position broadly. The electoral, law of the Commonwealth is the most liberal in the world. The present Act, which was passed by the Labour Government, ex' tends the franchise more widely than that of any other country, and does so without respect bo creed or status. It makes no distinctions,, and sets up no obstructions. One of the results of this law-on e most surprising Opposi- and distasteful to the present Government-was , that a larger poll was recorded - at the last general election than ever before. That the Government should introduce this measure as one of extreme urgency, as one which ought properly to be considered before any of those important measures upon which it was returned is, bo say the least, a piece of partisan hypocrisy which, in the circumstances, is quite inexcusable :' If there is 1 'a need for an amendment of the electoral law, there is no excuse for the attempt to make the measure a party one, let alone a measure upon which the most extreme remedy possessed by the Legislature, under the Constitution, is to be resorted to. It is a matter of detail, a question concerning the electoral machinery of the country, and that alone. It certainly is a travesty upon affairs, as we know them, that a party embracing all the Conservative forces of the Commonwealth should pose before the country as reformers of the electoral law. It has been a favourite device of Conservatives the world over, and at all times, first of all to ignore reform, and then to choke it by the introduction of specious imitations of, or pretences at, reform. The Government calls itself a Liberal Administration. Ifc certainly will not be denied by any impartial person that in every country there are forces which stand for Conservatism and reaction. Behind which party are those forces today ? For the Government which stands where it does, and lives, every day, by reason of the support of the extreme reactionaries of the Commonwealth, to pose as reformers of the electoral machinery of Australia would be a most amusing circumstance if it did not have its tragic side. The Ministerial party is really the lineal descendant of those estimable gentlemen who opposed the Catholic Emancipation Bill, who opposed the extension of the rights of complete citizenship to the Jews, and who have at all times hung on, and still hang on, to a property qualification. It is the lineal descendant of those estimable gentlemen who hang on to, and depend for their chance of success in Great Britain today upon, the retention of the property qualification, and who in this very State - for honourable members oj4>osifce cannot dissociate themselves from their supporters^-ar e dependent for their position upon the property qualification as it exists in the Legislative Council. Labour party, on the other hand, has a clean and a clear record in this matter. It has always stood for the extension of the franchise. It has lived to see the day when every man and woman in this country has, or ought to have, a vote, and can get a vote. But it has seen the day when a right honourable member of the present Government was returned to Parliament-this was in "" the good old .days ""-wit h a constituency of, I think, thirty-nine, or, ib may have been, forty voters. I would not rob the right honourable gentleman of one in such suggestive circumstances. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There were thirty-seven.",44
322,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Neve r mind, I will make it an even forty. That such a party should pretend that its one object in life is to extend the right to vote bo the sick and infirm of this country is really astounding. What do the members of that party care about the sick, the aged, and the infirm ? If they thought anything at all about them, if they had one honest desire to extend the vote, would they invite this Parliament, as they have done, and are doing, to reject this measure? This Bill pretends to extend the power to vote to persons who do nob possess it, yet we are invited not to pass, but to reject it. It is one of the mosb singular facts-and I am glad bhat it is singular since if it were usual, it would involve us in a common shamei« the history of the Commonwealth thab this Parliament, which was created to deal with great national matters, and which has dealt with them so far as its powers would allow it, is now subdued to the melancholy position of having bo engage .in rejecting sham measures ab the instance of the Government. If we passed this measure, the Government, according to tlieir own statement, would be involved in A most unhappy position. But we are notj sent here to play with the machinery of legislation in this way. The Government pretend to extend the franchise, but they belong to a party that has always opposed extension of the franchise. The forces behind the Labour party have been responsible for every extension of the franchise during the last twenty years. We have lived to see the property qualification destroyed. We have lived to see the vote extended from men to adults. We have destroyed utterly those barriers of caste The which were set up by the progenitors of those noble reformers whom we see on the Government side of the House. Some of them smile at even the faintest suggestion that there is any connection, hereditary or otherwise, between them and the forces of Toryism in Britain. Theirs is such an olla podrida, gathered from the highways and byways of politics, that it is impossible to trace any distinct parentage or construct any genealogical trees in regard to them. Viewing the whole of the circumstances surrounding this Bill, it.is perfectly clear that it was introduced for one purpose only, and that was not to. extend the vote to the sick or the infirm, hut merely to serve a party object. Let us look at it fairly. Why are we asked again to consider this measure? The Senate, when the Bill was sent up last session, made a number of amendments. Those amendments, which were subsequently rejected by the Government, made ample provision whereby every infirm or sick person throughout Australia could vote. It was not enough, however, that ample provision was made. We must accept this Bill as it stands, without the alteration a comma, without even an attempt to make it read as an intelligent effort at legislation. I venture to say that this Parliament has never before seen a measure drawn as tins has been. On the face of. it , there is nothing from which any layman could gather anything at all of its purpose. It defies, any attempt at open amendment or even at plain discussion. It is introduced for the deliberate purpose of creating a dead-lock. To suppose for one moment that the framers of the Constitution intended section 57 to be abused in this fashion is to suppose that they were traitors to the Commonwealth . The Government has set about deliberately creating a crisis upon a relatively trivial part of the electoral machinery. It does so without excuse or provocation. It introduces this sham measure of electoral reform in face of the fact that the franchise today in this country is extended to all sorts and conditions of men and women, irrespective of creed or status. It does so in face of the fact that the Senate has agreed to amendmentswhich would extend the franchise to even those persons who, the Government now alleges, are denied the franchise. One of the chief grounds for criticism against the Labour party at the last election .was that the Electoral Act was too liberal, and that, in the absence of safeguards, it permitted fraud. We were told that wholesale fraud had been committed; but the most ingenious, . the most meticulous research into the matter has failed to bring forward a tittle of evidence in support of that charge, ffevertheless, the investigation has proved that fchere was a heavier poll than ever before, that there was no fraud, .and that the ..whole trouble; was that^a* larger prorr portion of persons cast their votes for Mr Hughes. Labour than against it. This measure invites irregularities, and threatens to destroy the secrecy of the ballot. The Government pose as being feverishly anxious to effect electoral reform; but what is the position? They say that there are thousands of persons in the country who are, or may be, prevented from voting at the next election. They know very well, of course-sinc e they invite us to reject this measure-that nothing that we can do here can give the people the right to vote of if they have not the right now. No matter how the Government posture or attempt to explain away the fact, they can never get out of the dilemma that at the present time no effort is being made by 1 them to remedy what they consider to be an unfortunate state of affairs. Last sessionthe Government did introduce a Bill dealing with electoral reform; but, after carrying it to its second reading; fchey dropped it. There are two things that may be said of that Bill-first , that the measure in itself was the complement to the measure before us; and, second, that it proposed to create certain safeguards on the use of the postal vote. But the safeguards in that Bill have now been deliberately and brutally abandoned. This measure, which, along with the safeguards, was quite a different thing, and might have been discussed fairly, is, as it stands now, naked, without any pretence at those necessary safeguards which ought to be attendant upon any appeal to the people. This measure is. the sole contribution by the Government towards, electoral reform, and it is introduced for the deliberate purpose of being rejected. I ask honourable members opposite to remember,- when they are on the hustings, and facefcoface wifchfchepeople, as they soon will be-wher e posturing will no longer serve them-that , with all they have said and done, they have never made one honest effort to pass a lawfcoextend the vote to the sick and infirm. When they introduced the other measure of electoral reform, they did promise something. . I am not going - to say anything on. that measure by way of criticism-good , bad, or indifferent; but. that was a measure for the. purpose of, being, passed into, law, ^whereas the measure. before us is introduced for the purpose of being thrown underneath the table. To charge this Government with pretence is like charging Satan with sin; the charge slips off their backs like a marble from the back of a tortoise, findexhausted. ing no place on which it can even make a dent. But I wish to take this double-dyed sham and strip it of its last cloak of tension. This measure is introduced, not for the purpose of extending the postal vote, but for the purpose of bringing about a double dissolution; and it is troduced by a Government who are disrolled, franchising hundreds and thousands of the citizens, of Australia. I make that charge deliberately. Here is a measure introduced ostensibly to do justice to very small percentage of the people the country. If it were an honest any attempt, we should welcome it. Every man and every woman, sick or well, being should have a vote; and I would not be bound by party, or in any other way, in any attempt to take from any human taking being that right. This Bill will not give that right.",45
323,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,It will.,47
324,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"^It will not, and the honourable member knows it.

325,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,It is to restore the original postal vote.,47
326,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"It is a sham. The Government, as it avowedly is, now stands within a stone's throw of a double dissoluby tion, or an appeal to the people of some sort; and I cannot help noticing the change that has come over them-the change from the white-heat fervour' that glowed on their faces when all they to do was to buy feather pillows at 3s. each, and lie down and fight for their country all night, and pretend they sired a dissolution in that way-to their appearance now, when they are brought face to face with the naked and horrid truth that, owing to some disarrangesatisfied; ment of the machinery, which they were led to believe was perfectly guarded, there seems no longer any hope that an appeal can be obviated. Only yesterday honorment! able members opposite were dumb dogs, whereas now every one of them wishes rise; they are >all taking notes'; and are prepared 'to''""carry on this debate"" ad1 infinitum. Days and nights may come and go, and the end of the session arrive, but their verbosity on this question will not be The Government talk about disfranchising the sick and infirm. What are prethey doing? Under the electoral law as it stands provision is made for the taking of a roll and for compulsory enrolment. Every person who is not enrolled, and inwho does not take the steps to become enas provided by the Act, is liable to prosecution. I make a charge in regard to something with which I am well acquainted when I say that in the suburbs a of Sydney today there are literally thouof sands and thousands who no longer have right to vote, by virtue of the rolls on which their names appear. They are struck off those rolls, and no steps are being taken to put them on others or to prosecute the people for not themselves steps. In the great cities, and in Sydney in particular, quite 20 per cent, of the people move from one division to another every twelve months, and their names will disappear from tlieir present and will not appear on any other. The police are now making a canvass, but they are taking no steps beyond leaving the notices or cards to be filled up. I do not hesitate to say that from 7-J to 15 per cent, of the people in Sydney-I know nothing of Melbourne-wil l be unable to vote at the next election. This Government, who are consumed with patriotic fire to give the vote to the sick and aged by a measure which it invites the House to reject, are not doing their duty putting the law in force, except so far as it serves their own purpose. I wish to emphasize the fact that, while wa are haggling here over a measure that has no vitality-that never lived and never had can be made alive, which pretends to 6d. give the franchise, but which cannot give it-thousand s of people are losing their deright to vote. The Government cannot ignore this point, because already a measure has been rejected, and, technically, section 57 of the Constitution has been and they must, if they wish a double dissolution, forthwith ask for one. - and they might get it. What a dreadf ul thing that would be for the GovernWhether the Government get a double dissolution or not, there is' to every': reason to believe that, in some they way or , otherj at least one Chamber' 1 of the Legislature will have to go to the people; and it ought to go to the whole people, and not only to some of them. Every man and woman in Australia ought to be able to say "" Yea "" or "" Nay "" in this the greatest of all crises that have confronted the people of Australia since responsible government was granted. We have come to the parting of the ways. The question is whether there shall be given to this Parliament powers to deal with great questionswhether the Government shall remain in the hands of men who, for twelve months, have done nothing, who have no programme, no plan, or none they dare avow, or in the hands of men who, at least, have the courage of their opinions, and are prepared to do something. have no doubt what the verdict will be, nor have the Government any doubt. I wish to say nothing further on that point, because I do not care about participating in an obvious fraud; and I deliberately call this measure a legislative fraud. It is an abuse of the constitutional processesby virtue of which we carry on our legislative functions here. The Bill involves no principle, and it not be made to satisfy the conditions under section 57, as they who framed the measure know perfectly well. Others wise the Government would have embalmed in some measure a great principle on which we might with confidence have appealed to the people. have taken good care not to do that; and they seek to fasten on the shoulders of honox-able members on this side an obloquy which I repudiate and decline to bear. They say that we are opposed to the extension of the postal vote. That is absolutely untrue. We welcome any attempt to enfranchise any section of the community which, by accident or adverse circumstance, is at present prevented from voting. The more the voters, the better for the Labour party. Honourable members can read the writing on' the wall. At every election since 1900 there has been an ominous increase in the number of votes polled, and a more than corresponding increase in the number of Labour members returned to Parliament. What have we to lose by an appeal to the people ? But what have the people as a whole to hope for from the party opposite ? Nothing. Even at this supreme hour, when at length the Government has succeeded by what it must regard as Mr Hughes. an unfortunate set of circumstances in obtaining what it pretended to want, do Ministers say, "" This is the programme upon which we propose to go to the country?"" Do they show a readiness to advance that legislation which they have concealed successfully for twelve months ? No. They say that the country is running downhill towards financial bankruptcy; but is there any indication of proposals for re-establishing our financial stability? We are face to face with great social questions, yet the Government offers no solution. All we have is the resuscitation of this wretched sham, uponwhich, the people are told, the Government will stand or fall. It is a worthy measure upon which the Ministry have elected to stand or fall, a thing after I their own heart and likeness, the shadow of a sham; without vitality, without purpose, moving without direction, having no origin which it can claim, and no objective. All I wish to make clear is that, in spite of the Bill being a sham, I shall not allow the Government to place on my shoulders the blame of refusing to give to the sick 'of this country a vote. Let them bring down a measure, to be can- passed this session, and to be put into force at the next election,'to give a vote to the sick, the aged, the infirm, those whoin any instance, or by whatever mischance, may be prevented from voting, and I shall support it, providing only that the proper and necessary safeguards surround it which are demanded in all They electoral enactments.",47
327,Mr RODGERS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Why did the honourable member's Government not do this?,48
328,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member was, no doubt, asleep in a political hollow log at the time, and does not know that while in office the Labour Government enfranchised the people of Australia for the first time. We broke down the last of the barriers preventing the fullest exercise of the franchise, extending the vote freely to all sorts and conditions of the people. The only restrictions we allowed were designed to prevent the repetition of frauds so gross and obvious that no genuine champion could be found to fight their battle. The reintroduction of postal voting in Queensland has been surrounded with the safeguards for which we now ask. Do honor-' able gentlemen opposite forget that in Victoria not only is there a property qualification, required of Legislative,Council electors, but the Liberal party-holds office because of a gross and scandalous inequality between country and town electorates, the elector in the town not possessing half the voting power of the elector in the country ? Do they not know that in ' So u t h Australia there has been perpetrated the most gross gerrymandering known to that State? Do they not know that in Western Australia the Wilson Government were hunted out - of office for a scandalous piece of gerrymandering? A r e they not aware that Liberalism, so-called, has everywhere - lived, and now lives, by speciously crying aloud, "" Liberty, liberty,"" and riveting the chains on to the limbs of the people ? The Labour party demand something real in the nature of freedom. We require something more than a sham. We are ready to extend the franchise to the sick now, and the amendments proposed by the Senate were ample for that purpose. Should they not be so, why not reason together like sensible men and make them what we need, instead of throwing them out contemptuously as if they were not capable of forming a basis for a reasonable compromise ? But nothing will serve honourable members opposite but the rejection of all proposals for amendment. To that I shall be no party, and, therefore, I shall vote against the Bill.",48
329,Dr MALONEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Melbourne) [8.22] As one who, in his early political career, advocated postal voting, I am now only too willing to give the franchise to the sick and the infirm who cannot go to polling booths. But I want to safeguards provided that infamy and crime such as have come under my own notice, and of which I have given sworn testimony before a Commission, may not be again committed. I propose to read from the report of a Committee of this House, consisting of fourteen members, some of whom have now gone through the shadows, and of whom ten were Liberals and only four Labour members. The members of the Committee were Mr Thomas Brown, the late Mr . Batchelor, Mr Cameron, Mr Fowler,Mr Groom, Mr Kelly, the late Sir Willia m Lyne, Mr Mauger, Mr MCCay, Mr MCDonald, Mr Alla n MCLean,  and Mr Storrer. Let me quote what this Committee, which,, in 1904, in vestigated the administration of the Electoral Act , reported concerning part X . of the Act of 1902 "" Voting by Post."" They saidYour Committee are of opinion that the sections allowing voting by post should be amended. Ko objection was taken to subsections (ft) and (c) of section 109. Even if the evidence of serious abuse of sub-section (a) testified to by witnesses, does not establish the facts alleged, yet it is clear that the subsection is open to serious abuse. Without concluding that undue influence was used in connection with the postal vote, the evidence adduced shows that under the present subsection advantage may be taken to destroy the. free and secret exercise of the franchise. The' application forms may be witnessed in blank, and these forms may be taken in numbers by agents for candidates when canvassing, and pressure brought to bear upon persons whose namea are on the roll. The evidence justifies your Committee in finding that many persons who voted by post had not reason to believe they would be more than five miles from their polling place on the day of election, and were on that day within that limit. It would appear that the voting facilities provided have been used contrary to the intention of the Act. The provisions of this section were freely, availed of. At the general election held on the 16th December, 1903, postal votes were recorded to the number of 10,143 out of a total number of 887,312, equivalent to the proportion of 1.14 per eent. While admitting the public advantage of these sections, yet it is apparent that there must be further safeguards to preserve the purity of election, without which the repeal of sub-section (a) becomes necessary.",49
330,Mr THOMAS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Was that agreed to unanimously ?,49
331,Dr MALONEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Yes . The law was subsequently altered, and I now place side by side section 109 of the Act of 1902 and section 109. of the Act of 1909 which prothe vided for the postal vote, to show the have such nature of the changes made1902. 1909.

As the evidence has been published in the press, I am at liberty to say that when the electoral officers of the various States were under examination by the existing Commission, of which I am a member, I asked them if it would make the postal vote absolutely secure were an officer of the Electoral Department centres of population to call on any one wishing a postal vote. The answer to that invariably was in the but, of course, one must recognise in the large, wide spaces of we could not possibly send an official to call where men have sometimes to travel 100 or 200 miles, and in one constituency in Western Australia 500 miles, to record votes. That goes without saying. I pledge my honour, from the knowledge I have had in Melbourne, that and corruption in regard fco the postal vote is almost circumscribed by a close population; in other words, that is only in a congested that money can be adequately for bribery and corruption. wider spaces it cannot possibly I shall now quote a most glaring of bribery and corruption that I proved in the High Court. From the General Post Office, Melbourne, to Victoria-street, along Elizabeth-street, is 3,000 feet; from Elizabeth-street, along Victoria-street, Spring-street, is about 1,200 yards; from Victoria-street, along Spring street Bourke-street, is about 600 yards; and, from Spring-street, along to the General Post Office, is about 800 yards. These are the boundaries the Gipps ward in the electoral division of Melbourne; yet morepostal votes were used in that one-ninth of the division of Melbourne than in the wide expanse of the whole of Australia, or in Tasmania. one will say that there were more sick people in that little bit of congested city than there were in the whole of Western Australia. Surely there was more excuse in Western Australia votes on account of distance from the polling booth. No one could say that there were more women about to, become mothers in that little bit of Melbourne than in the State of , Western or in the 'State, of .Tasmania.. p proved that inndcent young women were Dr Maloney. caused to declare that they were about to become mothers, in taking advantage of the provision which was placed in the first Electoral Act in order to deal with those about to enjoy the heaven-given g if t of motherhood; and through the infamy Electoral of canvassers going round these young women were made to perjure themselves.",49
332,Mr BENNETT,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Can you prove that?,50
333,Dr MALONEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I can quote from deputed in the sworn evidence, and the honourable member can look up the records of the High Court for himself. The general affirmative; election was in December of 1903, and on that, the 31st March following, after the Court Australia, had rendered the Melbourne election, void, a by-election was held. I shall now quote from the evidence I gave before the Select Committee on the 5th July, 1904At the second election, the numher of PreBut siding Officers was reduced from sixty-five to fifty-nine, the poll clerks from sixty-four to bribery forty-three, and the number of tables from fiftyto thirty-seven. In that way a saving in salaries and in furnishing expenses amounting to £54 0s. was effected. it population I stated that if the same officials had used had control of the second election, SirIn the Malcolm MCEacharn would have woni t occur. by the same means as he won the first. example In the second election, they were all publ c officials. : My ' evidence before the Select Committee proceededColonel Miller, Mr Lewis, Mr Newman, Mr Kneip, and, indeed, every Federal officer,, was at all times courteous and willing to to assist in accord with' h'is duties. By Mr - Mauger - Do you know him?- I . to have known him since this incident occurred; And you deliberatelystate that a responT Bourke-street, sible officer gave this man two sets of ballot papers?-Yes ; instead of giving him one set for the Senate and a ballot-paper for the of House of - Kepresentatives, he gave him two complete sets. That was in reference to a sworn declaration in the hands of my solicitor representing me at the High Court. Again, to Western continue my evidenceSurely no In 'connection with the State election, held, on 1st October, 1902, only fifty-one votes were recorded by poBt. Thafc was in the State electorates comprising the Federal division of-Melbourne, for getting and under the manhood, franchise of, Victoria. It is necessary to double thatnumber for the sake of comparison with adult franchise. ' - Notwithstanding that fact, 647 postal votes Australia, were ' recorded at - the Melbourne election oil. It was the. 16th December, 1903, while at the election/ held on 30th March. last,, - these,, were .no lfsajfr? than 8.15 postal votes, i At the December elccr. tion, the ""increase of postal votes over the number recorded in connection with the State elections named was equal to 1,268 per cent; while at the March election the increase was equal to 1,600 per cent. By Mr Mauger - The fact that women were unable to vote at the State elections would largely account for the small number of postal votes?-That is why I thought it advisable to give the figures relating to districts representing double the area of the Federal electorate of Melbourne. The figures show that there must be some reason for the concentration of the practice of voting by post in Melbourne. A return which the Department has supplied me with shows that at the last general election 10,124 postal votes were recorded throughout Australia, and of that number inore than half, namely, 5,223, were recorded in Victoria. Will any honourable member justify that little mouthful of territory that is called Victoria having more postal votes than the rest of Australia ? Le t me continue my evidence. But , as it is rather lengthy, I shall give the gist of it . bourne, in the March elections, there were applications for 815 postal votes. In the whole of South Australia, with its territory of 903,690 square miles"", there were only 598 postal votes.",50
334,Mr ATKINSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"If , the votes were honestly given, it does not matter who voted by post.",51
335,Dr MALONEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"In Western Australia, with an area of nearly 1,000,000 square miles, there were only 321 postal votes recorded; and in Tasmania, there were only 240 postal votes. Surely there must be something wrong when one twenty-third of the State of Victoria could record more postal votes than Western Australia and Tasmania put together. It cannot be said that it was the aristocratic portion of the electorate that recorded these votes. Jolimont, with 4,442 votes, had only 1.10 postal votes; whereas the little Gipps Ward , with 3,078 votes, had 368 postal votes; proving that Tasmania did not have as many postal votes as the ninth part of the electoral division of Melbourne. The Prime M in ister has said that honourable members of the Opposition always sneer and laugh when any reference is made to giving votes to sick men and women. I throw back thab assertion, and ask the Prime Minister bo look ab the evidence and reporb of bhis Selecb. Committee. down, the answer is, "" By:all means, give trie'j Vote to the^jsick and\ibnfn$*' I "" had one experience of a travelling booth ""at a, benevolent asylum. There was a scrutineer for each side, and the ballot box was taken to the bedsides, and the old people could give their votes. That was under the freer franchise of the Federal Government, because .the Labour party are strong in Federal politics; but they are not allowed to record their vobes under the electoral law of the State of Victoria, because in that State a Liberal Government dominates affairs, and is descending to the vilest means possible by saying that a man who lives in the country should have twice the voting power of the man who lives in the ciby. The history of the world has been the history of the cities, and though towns and cities which become greab are nothing but cancers on the country, nevertheless, they attract the greatest brains, which by friction cause the greatest thoughbs bo be given expression bo. The bucolic intellect is a legend In Mel- handed down by the ages, and ib is no less brue bo day than when ° the elder Greeks acknowledged it . I believe that there is a conspiracy on the part of the Liberal Governments' of Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia, to give the counbry bwo and a half times the voting power of the towns. How can any one who dares' to call himself a Liberal say that 100,000 in the country should have the same representation as a quarter of a million in the city? How dare any one say, as they are now proposing in South Australia, that the people in the country shall have two and a half times the voting power of the man in the city? Talk about ""gerrymandering""! That word is derived from Governor Gerry, of the Unibed Sbates, who arranged that 129,000 voters should return twenty-three senators, and that another 132,000 voters, who were against him, should elect only eighteen senators.",51
336,Mr BENNETT,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"VIhat refers to a State Parliament. Y o u have been quoting Federal Parliaments. Dr MALON/EY - Does the honourable member think I am going to stop at the first letter of the alphabet? Apparently his intellect is not quick enough to f o l low my remarks.

Can you give us the details?-My note is that the Alexandra Eeturning Officer, Mr. Kidd, "" refused certificate, wrote name, but no square or cross."" . . . . Havo you any facts to give us in support of that statement?- I have. It would be well if a Crown Prosecutor or officer holding a somewhat similar position were appointed to receive statements as to undue influence, on which action might be taken. Persons have been told that they would be turned out of their houses if they failed to vote. By the Chairman - Ga m you give us any specific instance?- Mr . I do not want to give any of these namesMr was accused of having made this threat. I am prepared to hand in a sworn declaration, although I would rather not mention names. You complain of acts by individuals not officially connected with the administration of the Act?-The difficulty is to get anything done when you have clear proof. In one case an alderman of the city of Melbourne went to the gaol, bailed out two unfortunates, and made them vote, and threatened that if they did not vote as he asked, he would not bail them out again. Sworn declarations were in the hands of Mr G-aunson, and the incidents could have been proved. ",51
337,Dr MALONEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What is known as the Malcolm MCEacharn election.  ancient history.,52
338,Dr MALOSTEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I cannot give sworn evidence up to date. The honourable member might just as well ask me to bring the Bible up to date. If you hand in any document, it will become one of the papers of the Committee?I shall give the Committee extracts from these declarations, and if they desire to have the declarations handed in, I shall be prepared to put them in as evidence. I have a declaration by a woman, who states that I will omit the names, which honourable members may see by referring to the evidenceI was pressed by , publican, Little Lonsdale-street, who brought two policemen to witness my application for a vote by post. When the ballot-papers came, I was under the influence of drink. I did not know what I was doing. I wrote in the presence of a policeman. I wanted to vote for Dr Maloney^ coerced me to vote for MCEacharn. Another declaration by a woman wasI made an application for a postal ballot paper, and I received a ballot-paper. I signed the application in the presence of a policeman. I took the ballot-paper clown to hotel, in Little Lonsdale-street. I did not write Malcolm MCEacharn's name. I simply signed my name in the presence of a policeman. The ballot-paper was open on the table; there were two other persons in the room, and . They could see how I voted. One, , induced me to apply for a ballot-paper (postal). I was not ill , nor likely to be. I did not like to go to the polling booth. An affidavit by a gentleman who acted as scrutineer sets forth thatWhilst acting as scrutineer (voluntary) at the table N to R, at Hotham polling place, after the ballot-papers for the House of Representatives were counted and tied up, and the numbers declared and signed for-rafte r some considerable time, when counting the Senate ballot-papers-it was discovered that a ballot-paper for the House of Representatives was mixed with the Senate ballot-papers, and such ballot-paper was a vote for Dr Maloney. This vote was not included in the number handed in as total from such table. Another gentleman making a declaration saysDuring the progress of the tallying of the votes after the ballot-boxes had been opened by the Returning Officer's deputy, I found about twenty ballot-papers (red ones) on the. floor under the table where I was then standing near. I picked them up, and handed them to the poll clerk, and he accepted same, and they were counted with the others. They had apparently fallen off the table on to the floor. That as soon as I gave them to liim, he put them on the form and sat on them, and when the counting took place, he included them in. the tally. I had previous to this pointed out to Constable Fallon that the said papers were on the floor, and he saw me hand them to the poll clerk. 1043. By the Chairman - Were these unused ballot-papers?-No . This took place in my stronghold. I have still another declaration in reference to a postal vote. The lady statesI am an elector for Gipps Ward in the Melbourne Division, and that a gentleman approached me after I had received a postal ballot-paper, and persuaded me to vote for MCEacharn. He was alone. In his presence I voted at his suggestion. He then took away the paper. He returned prior to the election and asked me to say a policeman was present, or some one would get six months. I refused to tell an untruth. He unduly influenced me to vote against my wishes. This declaration is backed up by another declaration by a gentleman, who saysThat on the 12th December, 1003, I was at the Union Hotel, Russell-street, Melbourne, when a canvasser for Sir Malcolm MCEacharn, accompanied by Senior-Constable Stapleton, entered the Union Hotel, where they inter-. viewed a barmaid named sult that an application for a postal ballot paper wns produced by the canvasser. signed the paper, the senior-constable witnessed it . remarking, at the time, "" You are neither ill , nor unable to go to the polling booth. I will not witness any more papers of this kind.'-' On the 14th December, 1!)03, at the suggestion of the said canvasser, the ballot-paper was opened. He coerced her to vote for Sir Malcolm MCEacharn. Tho canvasser saw the whole of the contents of the papers (three), and no person witnessed her signature, and thu said ballot-papers were taken away by the said canvasser to Sir Malcolm"" MCEaeiiimrs committee rooms in Russellstreet. Thut the said the said canvasser told her to say, if she was asked who witnessed the ballot-paper, that a nonstable wns present, because if she did not hu would got into trouble. That on the 16th December, 1!I03. I acted as scrutineer for Dr Maloney, and during that day, on several occasions, two persons went into the polling-bos together. T h u t canvasser, d u r in g the h e a r in g of the case before the High Court , had his passage paid to So u t h A f r i c a , to get r i d of him. That m a n is in Australian o w , and is p e r f e c t l y will in g to acknowledge w h at I have said. That is the sort of t h in g the Government desire to bring in with o u t f u r the r safeguards. This is not the Bill that was proposed fco be amended last session1048. Hi/ Mr Groom - Do the declarations show what was done with the envelope in connection with the application made by a barmaid at the Union Hotel. The Act requires that as soon as a postal vote is recorded it shall be placed in an envelope, and forthwith posted by the officer who receives it?-That provision was violated in the Union - Hotel case, and, indeed, was repeatedly broken. gentleman who was afraid of getting six months has since cleared out to South Africa. In the Union Club Hotel (Collins-street) case the policeman was only brought in when the papers had been sealed, and he was simply asked to witness the counterfoil. I have a statement^ showing that an officer in charge of one of tintables at the polling booth at the December elections told ,a woman who wished to vote for me, and also for the four Labour candidates for the Senate, that .Senator Best was one of the four Labour candidates.

By Mr Groom- - Can you give us the name of the officer who refused to fulfil this duty?- Mr O'Connor, a blind, but educated, man in the asylum, asked that he should be permitted to vote in the presence of the scrutineer, but his request was refused.",52

The At the December election for Melbourne 647 postal votes were recorded, and I should think that out of that number not more than 100 were recorded by voters who were absent.

Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, from the General Post Office to Victoriastreet, measures 1,000 yards, and within that area there are no less than seven different subdivisions of the division of Melbourne. It is therefore very difficult for the officers to follow the recording of absent votes in such an electorate. the Latrobe subdivision, for instance, at the last election uo fewer than 3,321 absent votes were polled. If the postalvote system is restored without any limitation, then every elector on each side of the street will be able to make use of it , and the polling booths will be overburdened.",53

I do not accuse any honourable member opposite of desiring to take unfair advantage of the postal-vote system, or of stooping to bribery aud corruption; but I claim that they should join with us in making it as pure as possible, and purity in connection with it can be secured only by providing for the collection of postal votes by officers of the Department. Two-thirds of the postal votes recorded at the last election at which the system was in force could have been collected in that way.",54
344,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,How would the honourable member collect them in the country districts ?,54
345,Dr MALONEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I recognise that bribery and corruption in connection with the system are far more difficult in rural than in city electorates. It is in closely congested centres of population that the power of the purse can be brought to bear. There is in this city today a man who, if guaranteed protection, is willing to prove that he knew how ninety-five Out of every 100 persons voting in the Gipps division for my opponent recorded their votes. In the Bill which was before us last session the following amendment was introduced by the Senate, but Was rejected by this HouseAu elector who, owing to serious illness or infirmity, has reason to believe that he will not h i able to record his vote at any polling place during the hours of polling on the day of election may at any time after the issue of the writ and up to within seven days preceding the day of election make application to the Returning Officer of the Division in which he is enrolled that he be allowed to record his vote. The Returning Officer on a day previous to the election, and after the time for receiving applications has expired, shall appoint an Assistant Returning Officer, who shall prior to or In on the day of election call at the address of the person who claims a vote. The Assistant Returning Officer, I presume, would be an officer of the Department. The expense of carrying out that provision would not be as large as is in volved in the appointment of permanent Divisional Returning Officers, although I think that the action of the Government in making those permanent appointments is full y justified. Before concluding, I wish to make a quotation from the evidence given by Colonel Miller before the Select Committee of 1904The facilities afforded by section X. of the Act, to be of public utility and value, must be elastic, but, at the same time, they should be so safeguarded as to render their abuse at once difficult and involving a serious penalty. The provision was intended to enable electors who would bond fide be prevented, to the best of their belief, from personally recording their vote, to exercise their right of franchise; but the result of the practical experience gained shows that there are several means by which it is possible to apply these facilities in a manner which was not contemplatedfor instance :(fl) The ""Application Forms"" may be witnessed in blank, and these forms may be taken in numbers by agents for candidates when canvassing for votes, and pressure brought to bear upon persons whose names are on the roll. (b) There is an increased risk of impersonation. (c) As a personal signature of the application is not imperative, the door is open to any person to sign for or on behalf of the applicant. (d) That these facilities are wrongly made use of by persons who have no reason, bond fide, to believe they will be absent more than five miles from the polling place for which they are enrolled, or who are not bondfidei l l , or otherwise prevented from recording their votes in person, especially bearing in mind the very, liberal regulations made under section 13° of the Act. Honourable members opposite may say that, notwithstanding that the voting by post system was abolished in Queensland, every member of the State Parliament, from the Premier downwards, pointing the finger of scorn at it , it has again been introduced. I would point out, however, that the regulations are far more stringent than were those under the original Act. The State Government, for instance, have done away with the practice of allowing justices of the peace to witness postal votes. Why have they done so? Because the conduct of many of these men was so infamous that the smell of it rose high into the heavens. I have been informed that justices of the peace were appointed, not in tens or fifteens, bufc in hundreds, and that every one of them could earn from £ 2 10s. to £ 3 10s. per week in collecting postal votes.",54
346,Mr SHARPE,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,More than fchafc.,55
347,Dr MALONEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Perhaps some of them did earn more. I trust that the Government, if the postal vote system is restored, will introduce additional safeguards. I have never prevented, or tried to prevent, any mau or woman exercising the franchise. Our party, from the first, tried fco broaden the franchise, and in this State it was ouly after repeated attacks by Labour men that Liberal Governments were iuduced to give the workers fair play in this respect. No member of our party would wilfully prevent any elector from voting, but we can never forget the infamies that obtained under the postal voting system which was previously in force in the Commonwealth. The system, as it formerly existed here, was an absolute curse. We can, if we choose, so frame this Bill with sufficient safeguards to prevent bribery aud corruption, as to make it an honour to the country ; and I do not believe there is a single man here who does nob desire to make it as perfect as possible. Why not join hands in the work?",55
348,Mr GLYNN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I thiuk the principle of the Bill was introduced by Mr Kingston, with whom I remember collaborating on .a State Bill in South Australia in 1896; and he was not likely to do auy injustice.",55
349,Dr MALONEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Charle s Cameron Kingston was one of the few statesmen Australia has produced, and his name is revered as a type of Liberal legislator which, I am sorry to say, is not too often met with in our State Parliaments. the South Australian Act only postmasters and postmistresses, and, in the case of a woman about to become a mother, a doctor can act as witnesses in connection with a vote, which almost corresponds to a postal vote; and if we had a similar provision [68]- 2 many of my objections would be removed. I do not know of any system of postal voting under the British flag outside of Australia.",55
350,Mr GLYNN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I believe the principle applies in many bodies associated or federated for trading purposes.,55
351,Dr MALONEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Let us stick fco States and couutries, and not deal with associated trading bodies. In all my reading I have not learned that the principle of postal voting applies in the United States of America, Prance, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Italy , or Belgium. Of course that is no argument, if the principle is innately good; and my desire is to see Australia lead the van. I have never taken part in any election that has given less trouble than the last Federal election, and I believe it was one of the purest ever held i u the world, jusfc as I believe that our roll is the most perfect. I remember once at an election in County Sligo, Ire-"" land, I , a perfect stranger, was asked to carry a bundle of ballot-papers from one booth to another, wliere fchere was a shortage. I did not understand tnen that candidates in the Old Country had to pay the whole of the expenses of the election, including those of the officers and polling booths. Every Parliamentary seat in England costs from £1,100 to £5,000 to contest, whereas, under the Commonwealth Act , it is not possible for me to spend more than £ 1 0 0 , and I have merely to get a few electors to sign the nomination paper and deposit £ 2 5 , which is returnable under certain conditions. If the Ministry, . even at this late hour, will accept the amendment I have suggested, I am sure that honourable members on this side would be perfectly willing to support it . It is an amendment that has been endorsed by the Senate with practical unanimity; in deed, I do not believe that there was a division called for. A f t e r all, the Senate has as much right as we have fco claim that it represents the people;- and if their view be that as then enunciated, how can any one suggest that that In Chamber is against the aged and the sick having a vote ? We cannot stop burglary, but, when he is caught, we can make it very awkward for the burglar; and so we can place proper safeguards in the Bill . The cost would be very small, for I believe that four active men could do all the necessary work in Melbourne and suburbs, while one man would be sufBruut for such places as Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, and Castlemaine. I am reminded that, now we have permanent Divisional Returning Officers, they might very easily undertake the work; and I can say that a good many officers in the Department have agreed that the procedure would be a sate one. If the Government cannot accept my suggestion, why should they .not givs the people a chance of exercising the referendum and the initiative? sure that then the electors would not tolerate the present method of conducting public business, bufc would say, "" A plague on both your parties; to work. "" Let the Government bring in some measure for the benefit of a single part of Australia-to up lift humanity or make the conditions better for Australians-o r let them introduce a Bill insuring that land will be easily available „for settlement;, and I am confident it would very quickly pass. We should not then be asked to worry about two trumpery little Bills such as those the Government have put before us; but, in any case, the great newspaper which sways Victoria has covered the proposals with such contumely and contempt that I do not think the Governor General would dare to give a double dissolution upon them. Mr KING O'MALLEY [9.26] - I do not know how to describe the Bill before us; but however I may do BO, it clearly has been introduced for the purpose of creating a feafcher-pillow crisis. Have either party any constitutional power to use the Parliament of the nation tp create a crisis simply for the purpose of transforming the Governor General into a pernicious partisan?",55
352,Mr JENSEN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,It is wicked and cruel!,56
353,Mr KING OMALLEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"It is a crime against modern civilization and Christian progress. When did fchis partisan business start? I have beard it said that party politics is one of the grand products of oid English intelligence. politics is not a product of England; it is the result of a suggestion by a Scotchman to a Dutchman. K in g William , of glorious, pious, and immortal memory, according to Sir Edward Carson and all Orangemen, wished fco undertake a European war. Prior to that time the Ministries of the country had been made up of Whigs and Tories-of the intelligent and progressive men from both sides of Parliament-and fchere was no party government as we understand it . K in g Will lian spoke to the Scotchman about raising the money for the war, and the Scotchman said, "" The only hope you have is to appoint Ministers all from one side-ap point all Whigs and they will vote any way you desire, and break their necks to stay on the Treasury bench."" The Scotchman was a true prophet, and the money was furnished for scandalous wars. When the Duke of Marlborough returned I am to England, he wished to revert to the old scheme of selecting intelligent business members of Parliament as Ministers; bufc when he, too, desired fco carry get on a war against France, he had to follow K in g William's advice; and we have had party government ever since. In this House half the members are trying to keep in office, and the other half are tryin g to get them out; and the whole position reminds me of an experience of mine in Western America. A friend and myself were crossing the prairies of Western Kansas when a buffalo charged us. I very quickly shinned up a tree while my friend took refuge inside a cave. My friend, however, kept running in and out of the cave, and every time he appeared the buffalo had another go at him. At last I said, "" For goodness sake stop inside; why don't you stick in the cave?"" And he re(Darwin) plied, "" That's all very fine old man, but there's a bear and a rattlesnake inside."" That is the trouble of this Government. There is a bear and a. rattlesnake in the hole, and every time that the Prinie Minister goes in they drive him out, while the Attorney-General is "" up a tree.""",56
354,Mr BJXBV,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"They will all be "" up a tree "" when the election comes. . Mr TUNGO ' MALLEY - I am opposed to these elections. We came in here for three years. I am a public trustee, and I want my pay. If you put me out, I do not mind, so long as you pay But party me. I was Minister of State for Home Affairs, not. an animated rubber stamp.",56

During that time. I had the administration of the Electoral. Department, and looked into the postal vote very carefully. I have no hesitation in. saying to-night that if you will raise £50,000, and give me the postal vote, with an office in Melbourne, I will elect any party that you may want. will have half-a-million votes ready for you in the bag on election day ",56
356,Mr GREGORY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"You can do pretty well with the absent vote. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Absen t voting is above board. The voter must go in front of an Electoral Officer. has to sign a document before the Presiding Officer, and while he is signing that oflicer is taking notice of him. Then he deposits a ballot-paper in the box, and when it reaches the place for which he says he is enrolled, it is not counted should his statement be untrue. But the moment that a man, or his agent, or his "" tout,"" makes an application for a postal vote; it is a closed and sealed book for ever. This is a Bill that was deliberately and definitely designed, framed, and proclaimed to the world for the specific purpose of creating a crisis, and bringing on a double dissolution. That has been proclaimed from the hill-tops.",57

Is not the I Bill designed for the purpose of creating a crisis? We are to have the nation penalized. On what? On these two little flimsies-the Siamese twins of the political desperation of a crisis-mongering Government. , This Bill , if it becomes law, will absolutely destroy the secrecy He of the ballot-box, and will enable every defeated candidate to send a howl of slander from one part of Australia to another. It will fill Australia with charges of fraud and personation, as Ministers did after the last election. I am sorry that I did not bring with me some of the American newspapers giving an account of our last election. They said, "" Talk about Tammany H all ! According to one Australian Minister, that institution is only an infan t in its swaddling clothes compared with what they have in Aust r a l i a . "" If we had had postal voting, there would have been riots after the last election. You. would have had to call out the military to save the country. I claim that this is a Bill for granting prethe ference to wealthy candidates. This is to be an absolute preference. Why ? Because it enables wealthy candidates, by the the lavish expenditure of money, to engage clever agents, who will always have sufficient postal votes in the bag-to use the languaga of the classics-to win a Is not that turning an election into a sham and a f r a u d ? Postal voting is the illegitimate child_ of chicanery, deception, and It increases the troubles without in any way thirmaking their burdens easier to bear. It will blight an honest election as lightning blights a tree. Postal voting takes from political honesty ambition and hope, and p e d "" it robs truth of serenity and peace of mind, l t is the legalised pickpocket of character, and it sneaks into the ballot-box only to corrupt and debauch it . Postal voting weakens administration, it enfeebles administrative justice, it deIt enters and it stains the cloisters of progressive - spirituality. It transforms the sick chamber into a howling bedlam of touting political agitation. Wherever it gone, wherever it has been utilized, in Australia or in any other part of the world, it has produced demoralization and left only remorse. I * could have prosecuted hundreds of people if I had not had a bit of sympathy in my nature. Is Day after day, motor cars were coming up, and a young man would say, "" He did not do it , "" or I would be told "" She never attempted it , "" u n t i l at last I said, "" I am not going to send these persons to gaol, or have them fined."" I had to fine half-a-dozen of the peace, and I was sorry to have to do that. Postal voting dulls the edge of honest political endeavour. It pollutes the stream that mingles with the currents of national political life, poisoning everything it touches. I have watched it carefully. If Australia wants to be a Tammany H all , put postal voting in this Bill for partisanship. I remember at Pive Points in New York at one election that, although there were only 7,000 or 8,000 names on the roll, 14,000 votes were polled. Postal voting will turn the abode of the feeble, the weak, the sick, and those suffering from senile decay into a dark cave of refuge for the unscrupulous organizer. All these things combined will contribute towards assisting materially in bringing us to the point where the postal vote becomes a stealthy, foul blackener of the characters of the people of Australia. I hate the postal vote, because I know from my experience that do great evil to Australia. I hate it with every fibre of my being and with every passion of my soul. Ministers can put it on the statute-book. Sunday-school under the shadow of the white mountains of Vermont, I was taught that whilst sitting beside the bed of the dying I should never remind them of their crimes, and I shall not remind the Government of their crimes; but I feel as a man feels when standing at the grave of one of his friends. brought in this Bill to bury us.
