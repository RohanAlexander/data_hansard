2,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"Hon. G. J. Bell) I desire to report to the House that, accompanied by honourable members, I attended the Senate chamber on Wednesday, the 24th October, 1934, and participated in the presentation to His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester of the joint Address which was agreed to by this House on the 23rd instant. Before the presentation the President of the Senate addressed His Royal High Address, and presented a bound copy of it to Hie Royal Highness. On behalf of honourable members. I then addressed His Royal Highness in the following terms:Your Royal HighnessOn behalf of the Members of the House Representatives, I assure you of the deep of pleasure with which we join in welcoming you to Parliament House, Canberra. We rethe matter. call the happy occasion when Their Majesties the King and Queen opened the first meeting of tlic Commonwealth Parliament in 1901, the visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in 1920, and that of His Royal Highness the Duke of York and the Duchess of York in 1927 on the occasion of the inauguration of the meetings of the Parliament at Canberra. It is now our privilege to extend to Your Royal Highness our most sincere greetings on your arrival amongst us. We earnestly hope that you will enjoy your tour throughout the Commonwealth, and that, on your departure, you will take away abiding memories of the loyalty and affection of the Australian - people. In accepting the joint Address, His Royal Highness was graciously pleased to make the following reply: of the House of Representatives of the monwealtli of Australia. I gratefully acknowledge your message loyalty to the King, my father, which I shall have much pleasure in conveying to him. am equally appreciative of the sentiments which you express in referring to the satisprevent faction which my visit gives you. In carryably ing out this mission, at the bidding of His commodity ? Majesty, I have set forth, like those of my family who have preceded me, in the hope that my visit will help to strengthen the bonds existing between the peoples of the Empire and to increase our perception of the advantages which we enjoy under a free system of Government. The welcome which I have received ever since I landed in Australia encourages me to think that my object is being achieved: and I need hardly say that I particularly value greetings from Australia's representatives in the Heart of the Commonwealth. I ask you to express to the people my gratitude for the wonderful reception which they have everywhere accorded me, and my sincere regrets that I am unable to see more of their country and of the conditions in which they live. Finally, gentlemen, in all that you undertake I wish you success and prosperity. MELBOURNE'S AIRPORT.",10
3,Mr HOLLOWAY,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"""Will the Minisby the consignees. ter for Defence take into consideration the claims of Fishermen's Bend, in the division of Melbourne Ports, which experts believe to be the natural site for Melbourne's principal airport, before making a definite decision as to which site should be chosen?",11
4,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"I give the honourable member the assurance that inquiries will be made into his suggestion, and that full consideration will of be given to the site he has mentioned, sense before a determination is arrived at in EXPORT OF ORANGES.",11
5,Mr JOHN LAWSON,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"Has the Minister for Commerce seen recent press statements to the effect that the quality of New South Wales oranges at present being exported to England is deplorable; that while the overseas demand for oranges is good, and those marketed by California and other countries are selling at from 17s. to 19s. a case, consignments from New South Wales are selling at as low as 6d. a case; and that insurance companies are losing heavily and are suspending payments pending an inquiry as to whether the New South Wales fruit was entitled to an export cerComtificate? Is this condition of affairs, if f correctly stated, due in any way to lack of of adequate supervision prior to the shipI ment of this fruit ? Will the Minister indicate what steps are being taken to the continuance of such a deplorbad advertisement for an Australian",11
6,Mr STEWART,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"I have seen press reports dealing with some of the circumstances that the honourable member has specified. An investigation has been made departmentally, and the circumstances as officially reported do not justify the alarmist nature of the statements that have been referred to by the honourable member. The explanation given for the breakdown of some of the New South Wales fruit is the extraordinarily wet season which prevailed while the fruit was ripening and being gathered in New South Wales. Steps are being taken to investigate the matter further, including an inquiry into the provision that is made for the safe carriage of the fruit on the ships used many GREAT BRITAIN TO AUSTRALIA .AIR MAIL SERVICE.",11
7,Mr R GREEN,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"In connection with the air mail service which it is understood is to be inaugurated at the end of this year between Great Britain and Australia, will the Minister for Defence state whether the contract that has been given to a certain firm is irrevocable, seeing that the time allowed for journey is so greatly in excess of that recently occupied by a machine flown under commercial conditions? If it .not irrevocable in regard to the time allowed, will the Minister take whatever steps are considered advisable to see that at Mascot? this service is speeded up to an extent that will still allow for safety?",11
8,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE," Steps were taken by my predecessor, tor Pearce, as Minister for Defence, to draft specifications in connection the air mail from Great Britain to tralia, and on those specifications tenders for the service were called. vided that the time occupied between Great Britain and Australia should be twelve days. Since then, of course, as the honourable member has pointed out, the result of the Centenary Air Race shown that, by flying at night and by adoption ,of all the artifices associated with stunt and race flying, the distance can be covered in a much shorter space of time. I would point out, however, that the two sets of conditions are eatirely different. With respect to the air mail service, numerous stops have be made, the engines have to be confor stantly overhauled, the mails have to delivered at various places, and there other delays sot out in the specifications which do not apply in connection with the example he has cited. Moreover, I manian produce ? think it will be generally admitted that it is not expected that commercial aviation should be governed by the same ciples as those that governed the Cenpolicy tenary Air Race. The contractors, I believe, consider that in the circumquestions stances twelve days is not an unreasonhe able time to allow. But they have no doubt that as soon as the contract the service can be speeded up. Of course it could be expedited by a considerable expenditure in regard to landing grounds and by the adoption of night flying, but the question is whether that is justifiable in the present circumstances. The posiin tion is that the contract is let foT twelve-days flight between Great Britain and Australia, .but I am having sations with the British representatives here, and any suggestions which they can make to reduce that time will be most favourably received by the departthe ment and encouraged in every way.",12
9,Mr JENNINGS,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,Will the Minister is for Defence state whether arrangements have been completed to have the terminal air port in connection with the air service,12
10,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE," That matter has not been finally determined. The arrangement set out in the existing specifications stands at present, Senabut the phase to which the honourable member has referred is under review as with the outcome of negotiations with the AusPost and Telegraph Department, details of which have not yet been settled by I m They properial Airways Limited. NAVIGATION ACT.",12
11,Mr EROST,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"Will the Prime Minishas ter inform the House whether the Go the vernment seriously intends to repudiate the promise made by him on its behalf to amend the Navigation Act to enable overseas ships to carry interstate passengers between Tasmania and the mainland ? If that is the Government's intention, is it to be presumed that the Government proto poses to go on with the alternative plan a national steamship service, owned be by the Commonwealth, to give an equivalare ent passenger and freight service between Tasmania and the principal ports of the mainland, and overseas markets for Tas",12
12,Mr LYONS,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"The honourable member prinhas raised a question of Government which it is not the practice to answer in reply to questions, particularly without notice. In due time and other honourable members will know exactly what is the policy of the is begun Government on that subject. MATURATIO N OF SPIRITS.",12
13,Mr STACEY,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"Has the Government received a report from the Tariff Board regard to the time limit for the maturaa tion of Australian spirits? If not, will steps be taken to expedite the report, as converthe matter is most important?",12
14,Mr WHITE,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"That report has not yet been received by the Government. I do not know that the question raised by the honourable member is of greater importance than some of the others which are now before the Tariff Board, but I shall have inquiry made as to when the report may be expected. WHEAT BOUNTY.",13
15,Mr THOMPSON,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"Is the Minister for Commerce aware that a number of claims by farmers for the wheat bounty portations of coal? payable last year have not been met by the New South Wales Government, and that many of these claims are in dispute ? Will he call for a report from the Minis-' ter for Agriculture in New South Wales in order to see whether these disputes be satisfactorily settled?",13
16,Mr STEWART,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"I have knowledge that in one or two oases, at least, finaliza700,000 tion in that matter has not yet been reached. The money for the payment of the bounty having been handed over by the Commonwealth to the States, the or wheat. matter is now one for the States; and I suggest that, instead of asking the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales a general question such as that indicated, if the honourable member will supply with details of the particular cases has in mind, I shall have investigations made, and an appropriate reply will sent to him. ADELAIDE MILITARY PARADE that GROUND.",13
17,Mr MAKIN,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"Has the Minister for mining industry? Defence or his department received a protest from ithe authorities in South Australia against the proposal of the department to erect certain buildings upon the present military parade ground facing King William-road, Adelaide, to indicated. which strong objection is taken because it will interfere with the beauty of that roadway, which is one of the finest in Australia? If the Minister that intimation, will he indicate whether he intends to heed the protest and not proceed further with the building?",13
18,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"My strike. recollection of the matter is that it has already been settled by my predecessor, but I shall make inquiries regarding it. IMPORTATION OF COAL.",13
19,Mr JAMES,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"Has the Prime Minister seen the report published in the Sydney Sun of the 29th October, stating that 5,700 tons of coal had been shipped from Poland to Melbourne? In view of the depressed condition of coal-mining in Australia, and the Prime Minister's promise to do everything possible to rehabilitate the industry, what does the Government propose to do in the direction of restricting any further im",13
20,Mr LYONS,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,The Minister for Trade and Customs will answer the honorahb member's question.,13
21,Mr WHITE,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"There is a primage duty can of 10 per cent, on coal. The cargoes of coal brought in from overseas are negligible, except that during 1930, when tbci'e was trouble on the coal-fields, about tons was imported, largely to South Australia. The coal that has been recently imported was, I presume, used as ballast for some ship coming here for wool",13
22,Mr LAZZARINI,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"In view of the fact that the South African Government pays a bounty of 6s. 9d. a ton on coal for exme port, and that coal is mined in Java he by convict labour for which from 6d. to Is. a day is paid, will the Minister for be Trade and Customs place a complete embargo upon the importation of coal into this country and so afford at least degree of assistance to those who are endeavouring to rehabilitate, the coal",13
23,Mr WHITE,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,The present primage duty on coal seems adequate to prevent any excessive importation. The only importations now occurring are those under the circumstances that I have already,13
24,Mr JAMES,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,Will the Government prohibit the importation of coal from Poland has received or any other country?,13
25,Mr WHITE,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,Larg e importations of coal into Australia occurred only when the miners of New South Wales were on,13
26,Mr LAZZARINI,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,They were locked oufr,13
27,Mr JAMES,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,They were not on strike. RURAL REHABILITATION .,13
28,Mr SCHOLFIELD,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"Is it true, as stated in certain newspapers, that the Government has shelved the consideration of the subject of assistance to rural industries ?",14
29,Mr LYONS,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"It is not true, and there is no justification for such a statement.",14
30,Mr JOHN LAWSON,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the following statement which appeared in yesterday's Sydney Sun:It is stated to be unlikely that rural rehabilitation will bo given serious consideration before next May. Will the right honourable gentleman make a statement rebutting that assertion and give an undertaking that the Government's plan for rural rehabilitation will be put into operation as speedily as possible with a view to the making of considerable progress with the scheme prior to Parliament entering upon the Christmas recess ?,14
31,Mr LYONS,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"The honourable member will recollect that it was specifically stated in the Governor General's Speech that action would be taken without delay. A representative of the Government has already conferred with representatives of the State Governments. It wa's intimated from the beginning that consultation between the Commonwealth and State Governments would be necessary in order that schemes satisfactory to the peculiar needs of particular States could be adopted. Such consultation has already taken place. The subject will now have to be considered by the different State Governments. The Governments of New South Wales and South Australia have already prepared schemes for submission to the Commonwealth Government for consideration, and at yesterday's Premiers Conference an intimation was given by representatives of the other States that they would take immediate action. It will be seen therefore that the Commonwealth Government is doing everything possible to bring the scheme into operation.",14
32,Mr CURTIN,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"In view of the doubts that have been expressed about the intentions of the Government respecting its rural rehabilitation scheme and its employment proposals generally, will the Prime Minister enable honourable members to peruse any statements on these subjects that were submitted to yesterday's conference ?",14
33,Mr LYONS,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"Statement s were made at yesterday's conference on both these questions by representatives of the Government, and a brief resume of those statements was made available to the press. At the right time the fullest information will be given to honourable members of this House. I give my assurance that no time is being lost in dealing with these matters. As I have already said, it was indicated clearly in the Governor General's Speech that consultation with the States on these subjects was necessary. As it is only a few days since that Speech was delivered and the Government has already taken the first step by consulting the States on the matter, it will be seen therefore that we are determined not to lose any time. Mr CuRTm - We only wish to know what the Premiers know. TAXATION OF COMPANIES.",14
34,Mr BAKER,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to the press statement that bogus shares are being issued by certain companies for the purpose of evading federal taxation? Will the right honourable gentleman see that no evasion of federal taxation acts is allowed; and, if necessary, will legislation be introduced to tighten up the provisions of the present law?",14
35,Mr LYONS,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"1 do not know to which companies the honourable member is referring, but 1 can assure him that, so far as the Government is concerned, it will see that nobody evades the taxation laws of the country. EMBARGO ON GLASS.",14
36,Mr GREGORY,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"In view of the losses being sustained in our export trade owing to the embargo on glass, and the evil effects on our trading relations with other countries when such restrictions are imposed, will the Government consider removing at an early date the embargo on glass?",14
37,Mr LYONS,HIGHNESS THE DUKE OE,"The honourable member knows-becaus e it has been said so frequently-that negotiations have been, and are now, proceeding . on this particular question with the representatives gium. He knows too that until the negotiations are finalized no announceMinister ment on the subject can possibly be made either in this House or outside it. NA AU STRALIA N WATERS.",14
38,Mr R GREEN,POACHING IN NORTH,"A number of statements have been made in the press alleging poaching by foreign vesselfl, chiefly sampans, supposed to be manned by Japanese nationals, in Australian terrireturned torial waters, and that certain regulations have not been complied with, as was shown by a recent successful prosecution at Maron, near Manus, in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. In view of very gravo importance of this matter, the Prime Minister prepared to make statement regarding it, indicating what the Government proposes to do for the purpose of reserving to Australian citizens what aro internationally regarded as Australian territorial waters?",15
39,Mr LYONS,POACHING IN NORTH,"The honourable member may rest assured that everything that can be done in the direction he indicates be don£. There is a clear understanding between the Queensland Government the Commonwealth Government on the subject of poaching, and outsiders will dealt with in exactly the same way of our own people responsible for such acts. No concessions will be aiders. I can make that statement for both the Queensland Government and the provided for them? Commonwealth Government. GRASSHOPPER PLAGUE.",15
40,Mr LAZZARINI,POACHING IN NORTH,"In view of the fact that the Government of New South Wales has definitely refused to take any action whatever in connection with the threatened grasshopper plague in that State, will Prime Minister exercise his recognized influence with the leader of the Country party in this House in order to get him to discipline the Country party of New South Wales with the object of ensuring that something definite will be done in connection with this menace to the wheatat the moment? growers of Now South Wales?",15
41,Mr LYONS,POACHING IN NORTH,"I do not think that honourable member really expects me to answer a question couched in such of BelB CLASS WIRELESS LICENCE. Mr MoEWEX - Will the Prime inform the House why the Government has departed from the policy of preference to returned soldiers by granting a B class wireless licence to the Young Nationalist organization of Victoria, when the Returned Soldiers League was also an applicant for it?",15
42,Mr LYONS,POACHING IN NORTH,If the honourable member studies the legislation on this subject ho will discover that preference to soldiers was never intended to apply to the granting of wireless licences. The policy of preference to returned soldiers has been applied by this Government as previous governments have the appiied it. No question of preference is to returned soldiers can arise in regard a to the grant of a wireless licence. AIR LINER MISS HOBART.,15
43,Mr MAHONEY,POACHING IN NORTH,"Will the Prime Minister state whether, at the inquiry now being made into the loss of the air liner Miss Hobart, the Government will make counsel available for the relatives will of those who were lost? Will he also indicate when the committee's report is and likely to be received?",15
44,Mr LYONS,POACHING IN NORTH,"It has already been be announced that, relatives are free to be as any represented at the inquiry.",15

47,Mr LYONS,POACHING IN NORTH,No ; the Commonwealth does not intend to provide counsel. NA FIGURES.',15
48,Mr BEASLEY,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"In view of the fact that requests were made during the last the Parliament, and also during the election campaign, that the unemployment figures disclosed by the last census should be made available., will the Prime Minister state why a request for them was refused at yesterday's Premiers' Conference, particularly as they are of such importance",15
49,Mr LYONS,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"I understand that no the request for the figures was made at the conference. At any rate, no one is terms. withholding the figures.",15
50,Mr SCULLIN,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,No doubt they will leak out by and by.,16
51,Mr LYONS,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"I am no more responsible for the delay than anybody else. I understand that the census investigation is now reaching such a stage of detail that the figures should be made available at an early date. Tbey will be published State by State, beginning with New South Wales. TRADE WITH NEW ZEALAND.",16
52,Mr EROST,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"Wit h regard to the prothe posed ministerial delegation from New Zealand to Australia to confer on reciprocal embargoes, will the Minister for Trade and Customs see that Tasmanian interests are fully consulted before any decision is reached which may prejudice the Tasmanian apple and potato industries?",16
53,Mr STEWART,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,It is the policy of this Government to protect the interests of every section of the community during the course of tbese negotiations. WAR SERVICE HMS.,16
54,Mr GANDER,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"In view of the difficulties experienced by purchasers of war service homes in keeping up their payments, will the Minister administering this department take steps to have made an immediate re-appraisement of the homes? Will he also consider reducing the rate of interest?",16
55,Mr FRANCIS,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"It has always been the policy of the department to reduce interest rates on money owing on war service homes in accordance with the reduction of interest on the money borrowed overseas for the purpose of building the homes. Within the last two and a half years the interest rate has been reduced by 1 per cent. Regarding reto-morrow at 2.30 p.m. appraisement, I have nothing to add to what I have said in this House on many previous occasions. RESOLUTIONS OF SYMPATHY.",16
56,Mr SPEAKER,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"Hon. G. J. Bell) I have to inform the House that letters thanking the House for resolutions of sympathy passed during the last Parliament have been received from Lady Novar; Mrs Thomas Brown; Mrs. Richardson, daughter of the late Honourable Agar Wynne; Mrs D. C. MCGRATH; and Mr W. Thomson, brother of the late Mr John Thomson. ESTIMATES 1934-35.

ADDEESS-IN-REPLY. Mr MCCALL , for the committee appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to H is Excellency the Governor General s Speech (vide page 6), brought up the proposed address, which was read by the Clerk.",16
57,Mr MCCALL,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"Martin) [3.35] - I move That the following Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech be agreed to : MAY IT PLFIASE YOU R EXCELLENCY : We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. I appreciate the honour conferred upon me in being selected to move the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General. It could, with every justification, have been placed in older and more able hands. I am sure that I express the opinion of every member of this House when I say that we very greatly appreciate the recent visit to the Seat of Government of His Royal Highness, the Duke of Gloucester. It is indeed a rare and distinguished honour to have a member of the Royal Family with us, and we all appreciate the gracious gesture of His Majesty in sending one of his sons on this far distant Empire mission, the chief result of which must be the strengthening of the links in the Imperial chain. I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) and the members of the Government on the renewed confidence that has been placed in them by the people of this country.",17
58,Mr BEASLEY,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"Why , they have not even a majority !",17
59,Mr MCCALL,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"The vote recorded shows that the people were thoroughly alive to the gravity of the momentous issues at stake, and the result was an emphatic endorsement of the record and policy of the Government. The pre-election policy speech of the Prime Minister was clear and well-defined, embodying the achievements and record of the past, together with a constructive programme for future rehabilitation and progress. I congratulate the Government on the fact that the people rejected all doubtful and unproven monetary theories. The financial principles upon which the Government bases its policy have stood the severest tests of adversity. I admit that none of those financial systems so inextricably woven into our economic fabric are perfect, and believe that they are capable of improvement. I claim that there is no reason to doubt the solidity of the system under which this country is today operating so long as it is allowed to function in harmony with many perplexing non-monetajry factors, the importance of which are too frequently overlooked. The Governor-.General's Speech must of necessity contain only a brief outline of the Government's policy. Nevertheless, the matter it contains is based on sound premises and the major issues are clearly set forth. It is gratifying to read of the Government's practical proposals for overcoming the problem of unemployment. This problem transcends in importance all others at the present time, not only in this country, but also in practically every country in the world. Tho Government has always held the view that there can be no easy, miraculous or spectacular method of solving this world problem, and it maintains that the only avenue affording permanent employment is that which is provided by private enterprise. At the present time, private enterprise provides 82 per cent, of employment in this country, various government departments providing the rest. During the last three years the Government has freed private enterprise of many of its most pressing burdens, and it proposes in the future to remove those others which still remain, and which are impeding the progress of industry. The Government, by rendering financial assistance to the States, by bringing about a reduction of taxation and interest rates, by assisting primary and secondary industries, and by balancing its budgets, has stimulated trade and preserved economic equilibrium. Now that we have established a solid basis upon which to work, further progress in this direction will be possible in the future. Honourable members may rest assured that the Government will do nothing which might prevent the people from obtaining the maximum amount of employment which industry has to offer. I now desire to present some figures recently issued by the Economic Department of the League of Nations, which show conclusively that this country has travelled far along the road of progress. Unfortunately, in most countries unemployment has not decreased, but this report shows that whereas, on a percentage basis, unemployment has been reduced by 18 per cent, in the United States of America, 23 per cent, in Sweden, 23£ per cent, in Canada, and 25 per cent, in the United Kingdom, Australia icads the world with ati improvement of 30 per cent. 1I have just outlined what may be looked upon as the Government's long range policy. A short-range policy provides for the alleviation of the immediate distresses of many thousands of people who, unfortunately, are not able to be absorbed by private enterprise or government"" services. In this regard the Government proposes, in conjunction with the State Governments, to embark upon an extensive programme of reproductive public works of a national character. Before concluding with the subject of unemployment, 1 desire to make a special point of the position of the unemployed youths, perhaps the most tragic and dangerous feature of the whole prohloin. Unfortunately, there are no statistics to reveal its dreadful compass, but figures compiled by the Board of Trade in Great Britain indicate that, whoreas general improvement has taken place in that country within the last twelve months, there has been no substantial improvement in the position of unemployed youths. The situation in Australia may not be as bad as that in Great Britain, but it is, nevertheless, gratifying to learn that at the Premiers Conference held yesterday in Canberra, practical proposals were put forward for the alleviation of distress among our unemployed youths. I now come to the all important and complicated problem of the tariff. All honourable members will agree that the approach to this important question should be made with a mind as free as possible from extreme fiscal views. We must remember that a country like Australia, which exports about one-third of her total production, cannot, without damage to herself, pursue an ultra selfsufficient policy. I have always considered that excessively high customs duties, whatever advantages they may possess, must increase the difficulties Mr MCCall. restrict the progress of our export industries. So long as Australia is a debtor nation and in need of goods and commodities which she cannot herso-Lf produce, a substantial volume of exports will always be necessary. On the other hand, it has been the declared policy of this country over a long period of years to establish and maintain secondary industries by means of protection against competing imports. From an economic standpoint therefore I would not support any sudden or fundamental reversal of fiscal policy. The practice of this Government in the matter of altering the tariff schedules has - been to rely upon the reports of an expert and independent tariff board. This procedure must commend itself to ivery rtiasonable person. My business ar'*ivitics have brought me into contact witn hundreds of primary producers, affording me an opportunity to examine at first hand the conditions of rural industries both in good times and in bad. During a series of educational addresses delivered in many factories over a number of years, I have also had the privilege of coming into direct contact with both the manufacturer and the worker, examining at first hand the products of their industry. This practical experience has enabled me to appreciate this important side of Australia's economic life. Thus, when tariff issues are being discussed in this chamber, I shall find myself in the fortunate position of being able to view the situation from both sides. The question of the restriction of exports has been foremost in many people's minds. To-day practically every country in the world is applying a policy of economic nationalism to such an extent that international trade is only a little more than one-third of what it was in 1929. This trend towards autarky has practically forced Great Britain to protect many of her important industries, particularly her agricultural production, and as a consequence Australia must realise that she may not be able to export the same volume of goods to Great Britain as in the past. This applies equally to other countries. Australia may thus be forced to regulate the volume of her exports. In principle, I am and definitely opposed to the restriction of Australia's export trade. Restriction offers no real solution to the problems which confront mankind. Indeed, it may easily accentuate our difficulties. A policy of general restriction aimed at solving the problem of poverty amidst plenty might simply abolish the plenty and leave the poverty. Australia, however, may be forced to follow this course, and, in formulating a policy to meet the changed circumstances, it may be necessary for the Commonwealth to co-operate with the State Governments and representatives of the industries concerned. The Government is faced with another important problem, that of arranging trade treaties with other countries. I am of opinion that it does not matter very much whether the trade between any two countries does or does not balance so long as there is a general balance as between total exports and imports. International trade is not bi-lateral, but multi-lateral. Practically every country today is demanding a quid pro quo from every country with which it trades, and consequently Australia will have to recognize, and, if possible, ameliorate the very onesided trade relations that exist today between her and such countries as Japan, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. The implementation of this policy need not necessarily bring about industrial dislocation and unemployment, and if it is carried out efficiently and effectively an increase of employment will be the inevitable result. In this connection, it is that the Ottawa agreement may cause some difficulty, but the Government is prepared to approach the British Government to secure some modification of the terms of that agreement. By wholeheartedly supporting the Government in this direction, Australia will be able to assist greatly in the re-establishment of international trade.. I feel certain that all honourable members will consider the problems confronting the House, not from a parochial angle, but in the interests of the nation as a whole. Those things which unite us are far greater than those which sometimes divide us. I appeal to the Opposition to come forward in a spirit of cooperation and assist the Government in the implementation of its policy to mitigate the distresses of the unemployed, and thereby make a practical contribution towards the solution of this most pressing problem. As the j'oungest member of this House, I look to older members for help and guidance. To-day we are passing through an era of absorbing interest, and, thanks to the electors of Martin, I am glad to have the opportunity to participate in the great work of reconstruction which lies ahead of us, and which I sincerely hope will shape the destiny of the Commonwealth on lines that will lead to the enrichment of our material and moral progress.",17
60,Mr FISKEN,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"Ballarat) [3.49] - I desire to second the motion so ably moved by the honourable member for Martin (Mr MCCall). I am very conscious of the honour which has been conferred upon me in being asked to second this motionpossibly, because I am one of the younger brigade to enter this House, but most likely for another reason. We on this side of the House claim to represent all sections of the community. The mover of the motion represents a metropolitan constituency, whereas I represent a country constituency, with a large provincial city as its centre, and today we both typify diverse interests, the welfare of which is inextricably bound up each with the other. The Government proposes to deal with three main questions-unemployment , relief and assistance to rural industries, clear and secondary industries and trade treaties. It appears to me that all three of these are inter-related. Anything which is done to rehabilitate our rural industries and to increase our trade must have an effect on the employment of our people. Now that our national finauces have been restored, the stage is set for a more direct attack upon the problem of unemployment. That problem must be attacked, for two reasons. The first is that we on this side, in oommon with honourable members opposite, sympathize with our fellow men who are out of employment. We realise the hardships and the privations through which they are passing. For humanitarian reasons alone, every decent citizen must wish to get the unemployed back to work. Should there be in the aommunity any who are devoid of sympathy, I would say to them that there is another reason for an immediate attack on this problem. Unless we want to see our civilization crumble; unless those things which were built up by our forefathers are to be pulled down about our ears by a disillusioned people, then we must attack this problem. The difficulties are worldwide, and the situation has become so involved that it is hard to distinguish between cause and effect. It is only since the war that unemployment has become an urgent international problem, and that we have seen developed to an unprecedented degree the spirit of economic nationalism which is the cause of all our troubles. Primary producing countries like Australia have a superabundance of food and raw material of which they cannot dispose, while manufacturing countries have idle factories, unemployed workmen, and manufactured goods which they cannot sell. Nearly every action taken internally by each country to improve its own position has disastrous repercussions on every other part of the world. The whole world has continued to suffer since the last abortive economic conference in London. Have we not suffered enough ? Can we not once again endeavour to do something from an international point of view to attack this problem ? It appears to me that we in Australia must direct our energies into the two channels that have been indicated by the honourable member for Martin (Mr MCCall). The first he described as the short-range policy of giving temporary relief by means of works of a reproductive nature; while the second was the long-range policy of permanently stimulating our industries. The proposal to treat coal and sbale for the production of oil might be included under both of those headings. At present much of our oil supplies comes from a country which shows little disposition to trade with us. I feel that if we can produce a proportion of what we need we should be able to utilize the money that at present is sent to that country in the purchase of goods from other countries that show a greater willingness to trade with us. A comprehensive plan of forestation, I consider, would absorb an enormous number of our people and at the same time create a very valuable asset in a world that is rapidly becoming denuded of timber. As the Mr Fis!:en. honourable member for Ballarat I shall naturally be expected to mention gold. I believe that the Government can help the unemployed very considerably by making money available to the States for the stimulation of the search for gold. I should like to be permitted to enlarge on that matter at some future time. I cannot help feeling that the long range policy must be implemented by means of the encouragement of our export trade, at the same time giving adequate protection to efficient industries which are suited to this country. It is only because of the loss of profitable markets for our primary products that we have found ourselves in the position that we occupy today. We have as many factories as were established in the days of prosperity. Our machinery is no less efficient than it was then, our workmen have not lost their skill, and raw materials are still available to"" us. Yet we have unemployment and depression. The only reason that I can see for that state of affairs is that we have been relying on our primary industries as the basis of our prosperity, and they are not prosperous. In my constituency there is a large industrial city, the manufacturers and business men of which have always realized that if the country districts around it are prosperous they have an excellent market for their goods. The farmers, on the other hand, have always known that a large industrial community in steady employment provides them with a wonderful market close to the source of production. For many years we must have a surplus of primary products, and it is only through their profitable disposal that we can meet our overseas commitments and bring new wealth into Australia. In the past I have been criticised by some persons for having voiced this view - It has been suggested that Australia has a greater destiny than that of a primary producing country, that we have permanently lost our markets, and that we'should endeavour to be entirely self-contained. I say that we have a greater destiny than that of taking in each other's washing, which is what that amounts to. Are not the poorest nations those that have no foreign trade? The Government, by its proposal to negotiate trade treaties, is attempting to hold-and , I hope, to increase-ou r foreign trade. During recent months we have been threatened with a further curtailment of that trade. Belgium has threatened to impose embargoes on our barley and our meat. Italy has decided to buy from us only half the quantity of wool that she purchased last year. Germany is practically entirely out of our wool market, - and Japan is threatening to obtain her requirements in South America and South Africa. The only reason , for that attitude is that those countries cannot induce us to buy what they regard as sufficient from them. I should like to quote some figures in relation to our trade with those countries and with France. Compared with the average of the previous nine years, our exports to Italy last year decreased by 32 per cent., while our imports from that country dropped by 42 per cent. Our exports to Germany decreased by 31 per cent., but our imports dropped by 41 per cent. To Belgium we exported 36 per cent, less, but our imports dropped by 51 per cent. To France we sold 52 per cent, less, but we bought 60 per cent. less. Whereas we exported 7 per cent, more to Japan, we imported 11 per cent. less. I feel sure that no one will suggest that we should attempt to balance our trade with those countries, for that would mean economic chaos so far as we are concerned. But if we wish to hold them as customers we must buy more from them. Wo must not endanger any of our great secondary industries; but possibly some exotic industries may have to be sacrificed. This will have to be brought about by some form of planned international trade. Considering the capital that is invested in, and the labour that is employed by, the great wheat, dairying, and wool industries, surely some small sacrifice is worthwhile in order to keep those industries solvent. I hope that, in addition to making trade treaties with foreign countries, we may be able to hold and perhaps to increase our export trade with the mother country. For some little time. I have been a member of the Victorian Meat Advisory Committee, and I know the enormous benefit that the Ottawa Agreement has been to us in relation to our lamb and mutton trade. I fear, however, that shortly we shall have restrictions on this trade imposed upon us by Great Britain. Seasonal conditions this year will make it impossible for us to export lamb and mutton up to the quota allotted to us. Apart from that, however, I am afraid that our young, undeveloped industry of chilled beef may be seriously affected, and I hope that the Government will even yet be able to take steps to keep this trade for us. If it should succeed in doing so it will do a service not only to the rural community who want markets ancl not makeshifts in the form of pools and subsidies, but also to every other section of the community, and additional employment will be provided by the prosperity that will come to Australia.",19
61,Mr SCITLLIN,CENSUS UNEMPLOYMENT,"Yarra) [4.3] - Whil e not joining with the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply in the congratulations that they have extended to the Government, I compliment them on the manner in which they have put their case in their maiden speeches in this House. If I may be permitted to say so, they have acquitted themselves with very great credit. In past years many of us have said that a maiden speech is the most difficult of all to make. It is certain th.**the most effective parts of our speeches are those of which we think when we sit down. If the honourable member for Martin (Mr MCCall) and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Fiskin) have that horrible feeling, I assure them that it has been shared by all who have preceded them in this Parliament. The Governor General's Speech has been truly described by the mover of the Address-in-Reply as an outline of the Government's policy for the present session. I presume that it also contains the major proposals of the Government for the life of this Parliament. If the proposals in the Governor General's Speech mean no more than similar promises made in the past, and oft repeated, the people of Australia are about to be further disappointed. Should the Government, however, display unusual vigour, and apply its energies to the problems referred to, there is some hope for the people of this country. If that is done, I can assure the mover of the motion, who made an appeal to the Opposition, that we shall willingly co-operate with any movement to promote prosperity and the employment of the people. A strong attempt must be made to remove unemployment-the subject which has been placed in the foremost position in the speech. If that is to be done the Opposition will not indulge in destructive criticism, but will render every assistance. We shall offer suggestions, and I shall submit some before I conclude my remarks. If required, we shall tender advice. We shall take our part as a responsible body of men in the National Parliament. We realise that the magnitude of the task that confronts governments in all parts of the world is so great that it demands strong action, and all the support which can be given, if that action be in the right, direction. In making that offer, I hope that Ministers and their supporters will receive the suggestions that come from this side of the House, and deal with them on their merits. Putting aside arguments of mere negation, let them examine our proposals, and not distort them. I - am constrained to put that plea forward early in the session because of our experience at the elections, when the propaganda of our opponents described Labour men as robbers of the people's savings. Those remarks were a disgrace to their sponsors, and an insult to democracy. Such tactics may win an election, but they do not even approach the subject of remedies for the people's ills. I hope that members of the Opposition will receive different treatment inside this Parliament from that experienced outside it. This Parliament is newly elected, and it must be constructive if we are to deal with the great problems confronting us. The matters that were prominently before the electors must be firmly grappled with. In the Speech of the Governor General, it is stated that Ministers are concerned at the heavy unemployment that still persists, and that this grave and pressing problem will receive priority over other matters. The Government suggests at the outset that Mr Kcvllin. there should be a survey to determine whether there are any root causes which can be dealt with effectively. Surely it is not necessary to have a general survey to ascertain that! If the Government proposes to search for root causes, which I doubt, there is ample evidence of them, for they are inherent in the whole system of private monopoly. But I do not hope or expect that the Government will get down to these root causes. Control by the few over the means of life makes the great masses of the people mere cogs in a machine who may be speeded up or discharged at will. The Government may have survey made, but what is required is immediate action. If a survey of a general character were necessary, why was it not undertaken over two years ago, when the Government had more power than it possesses at the present time? Immediate action, I repeat, is demanded. Tliere is plenty of work waiting to be done in Australia. That fact requires no stressing. It is not necessary, at this stage, even to enumerate the works thai could be put into operation. Some are mentioned in the Speech, and I endorse them. A much longer list has been put forward in this Parliament again and again by many honourable members, including myself. It is equally apparent that there is an army of willing workers in Australia who are anxious to start, at once, and we should make a start immediately to put them in employment. We have all the means at our hand for the production of wealth. We could make Australia the most prosperous country in the world. We have the man power, the natural resources and the requisite modern machinery. It requires no survey at all to find out that we have these things. Special mention was made by both the mover and seconder of the motion of the need for doing something to help the youth of this country, who provide the greatest problem of all. Tbeir predicament presents the greatest tragedy of the depression. Apart from humane considerations, which should be first in our thoughts, we, aa the representatives of the nation, must realise that useful and congenial employment is an essential part of the training required for good citizenship. This matter has been neglected. The practice of providing work for sustenance whicn has been followed by the Slates-probabl y the best that they could do with their limited financial resources - ha s not provided that training. Take my own State-Victoria-wher e a man ancl his wife are allowed to earn only £1 a week when working for sustenance. The conditions are intolerable. Such a couple have to pay at least 9s. a week for rent by sharing a house with another family. Can lionorable members imagine the sort of home that can be obtained for 18s. a week when it has to be shared by two families'? This allows the couple to have only Us. a week with which to provide food aud clothing! Take another case, which is typical of thousands. A man with a wife and three children is permitted to earn 27s. (id. a week. Another couple, with six children, are allowed 35s. a week, or the equivalent of the inadequate sum paid to a man and wife as an old age pension! I have merely mentioned these cases to indicate what I regard as the essential thing to consider. ""We have the man power, the machinery, and the natural resources; but the one thing we have tc concentrate upon is the financing of the undertakings necessary to provide employment. If we are simply to go on under rhe old method of trying to raise sufficient money by asking the public to subscribe to loans, leaving future generations to be saddled with a heavy interest burden, the job will be done in only a half-hearted and hopelessly inadequate manner. Finance is the governing factor, and those who control finance are the masters of the situation. The governments of Australia are called upon to deal with this grave problem. Private enterprise cannot solve it. It is not suffihad cient to say that private enterprise formerly employed 80 per cent, or more of the people. I believe it cannot employ them on the former basis until markets are found for our products, and a market cannot be found in Australia until those now unemployed have normal purchasing power by reason of full-time wages. So the Government must make a bold effort, and the scheme must be financed ""n a way that will not leave the country with a heavy burden of interest. Unless the Government asserts its authority in regard to finance, we shall continue to be governed by the oligarchies of finance in stead of by the people's representatives. The money masters have ruled for generations. We need but look around us to see I he result of their machinations. We are in an advanced position in Australia compared with most countries. We have the Commonwealth Bank, which is owned by the people of Australia, and I am not theorizing when I say that that bank's operations ancl functions should be extended, and that it should be empowered to utilize to the full the credit of the nation for the benefit of all. It could be used to finance a large number of the undertakings of the Government. I am not one of those who believe that everything could be done through this channel. I do not consider that money can be created from nothing, but we know that private banks issue credit based upon nothing more than the wealth-producing capacity of the people. Let the Commonwealth Bank use to the full , with proper safeguards, the national credit that goes to the building up of hanking profits, and use it for the carrying out of public undertakings to provide work for the unemployed, without creating intolerable interest burdens for future generations. The credits of private banks exceed many times the legal tender of Australia, and by this process large profits are made. A large percentage of these profits-full y one-third-goe s to overseas shareholders; but they should be retained in this country in different forms for the benefit of the people of Australia. The policy which I advocate, it may be said, was rejected by the people at the last elections. I say, however, they no chance to give that policy rpasona.ble consideration. What the people rejected was not the policy of the Labour party, but a caricature of it with all its features hideously distorted. I come back from the elections repeating those things which we believe can do much for the people in the direction of providing employment, leaving the responsibility on the members of this Parliament to consider our proposals. No party, I claim, has received a complete mandate as the result of the last elections. The intention of the Government is to launch more loans. Eor the want of anything better, I shall support loans; but I think we could do something much better, and certainly could augment them considerably by the course which I have suggested. After all, how are loans subscribed? They are often taken up by <ae private banks for which purpose they issue credit, a practice which is much denounced when it is suggested that the Commonwealth Bank should adopt it. If cash is provided by the public subscribing to the loans, of what does the cash consist? Cheques are drawn on the banks withdrawing from them certain deposits, «nd a large proportion of these deposits are the result of previous bank issues of credit. If those who subscribed to .the loans went to the banks and' demanded cash, there would be a rush to the Commonwealth Bank for notes, so it comes back to our own credit and our own currency. I do not say that credit could be issued ad lib, but it could be done to the extent of many millions of pounds, the governor upon the engine being the control of price levels. The Commonwealth Bank could issue directly a large amount of credit if we extended its power and functions, and, with proper safeguards, removed some of its limitations. My Government made an attempt, in a small and an inadequate way, and not in exactly the way we should have made it had we had a working majority in both Houses of the Parliament, to widen the scope of the Commonwealth Bank, and what we did was undoubtedly a step in the right direction. I do not think that honourable members can contemplate with equanimity the growing burden of interest that is being piled the shoulders of the people of Australia. We should pause to ask how long the people will be able to stagger under the burden, and how long we shall be able to meet our obligations if the burden continues to increase. These things will have to be considered sooner or later. The people's bank, which is the Commonwealth Bank, could perform the service of which I am speaking much more effectively than any private money lenders or private financial institutions, and could give greater security than is now enjoyed, while at the same time bringing Afr. Soullin. about the removal of the heavy burden placed upon us by private financial companies. I suggest most earnestly to the Government that this is the first important step that should be taken towards the solution of this problem. Unless the monetary situation is faced any attempt to cope with the unemployment problem will be inadequate. Dealing with the financial situation, I suggest that the Government should reconsider its former policy of remitting taxation to the wealthy people of Australia in the hope that the money represented by the remissions would be made available to provide additional employment for people who need it. The Government was told at the time it enunciated this policy, and also at various times while it was implementing it, that very little of the money remitted in taxation would go in the intended direction. I did not say then, nor do I say now, that none of the money went in that way, but experience has shown that the Government's policy has not had the results that many people predicted for it. What has actually happened to the bulk of the money represented by the remissions of taxation? Much of it has gone into the frozen reserves of wealthy people, and is today lying idle in the banks of Australia. It is not being employed in any way. If that money had been used directly or indirectly by the Government for the relief of unemployment, beneficial results would have followed. It could have been so used. Some of it could have been used to restore invalid, old age and soldier pensions. This would have increased the purchasing power of people who would spend every penny that upon they received because they would be forced to do so by their circumstances. There would have been no prospect of the money swelling the banking accounts of the poorer section of the community because they have no such accounts. We contend that the money should have been used to help the poorer, and not the wealthier sections of the people. Without imputing motives or accusing the Government of desiring to placate wealthy political supporters, I say that it was a fundamental error to remit millions of money to the wealthy people of this country and leave hundreds of thousands of people to starve or to remain on the verge starvation. This was an error of the first magnitude, and in consequence of we have not moved forward in any way towards a solution of the unemployment problem. I hope that the Government will reconsider the policy to which I referred. I mention the subject now merely in a general way, but honourable members may rest assured that further stress will be laid upon it wben vernment's financial proposals brought directly under our consideraoligarchy. tions. Another very serious aspect of the unemployment problem will still remain even when an increase of world prices has lifted, us out of the great depths the present depression. We all hope, of course, that there will be an increase of world. prices in other parts of the world and that we shall get back to some measure of prosperity. But when that time arrives, we shall still have to face the great problem of unemployment due to the increased productive power of modern machinery, and the use of speeding-up devices by large employers of labour. mention these subjects not because I do not believe in progress, but because I believe that we must face the effect of modern methods of production which have not proved beneficial to many toilers of this country to whom they should have proved a tremendous blessI ing. Modern methods of manufacture, and modern labour-saving devices, could be used to reduce the burden of arduous woman in Australia. toil that at present rests upon the shoulders of the workers of Australia. The great output of production conseshould quent upon the adoption of modern methods could be utilized to raise the standards of living for the masses of the people, and it is a dreadful reflection our whole system of society and upon those who control governments, that should be seeking to solve the problem of so-called over-production by reducing production or manipulating it in such way as ultimately to reduce it by the provision of quotas of output. We thatare really attempting in this way to get rid of the awful panic of plenty tion instead of trying to remedy the awful conditions of poverty. If we were in the industry. midst of a widespread drought, or if we of were suffering from pestilence of any kind, there might be some need for the it rationing of supplies or the lowering of the standards of living; but there is no such need in our present circumstances. I do not wish simply to attack this have or any other Government for. what has happened and is still happening; but I ask the Government to use the power it possesses to lift from the shoulders of the Go the nation the great burdens that are are being imposed by the financial The Government of which I was the head was forced, at times, by this oligarchy to do things that are the very opposite of those which I am now suggesting should be done. It was the victim of this great oligarchy of which is today ruling the destinies of people in this and every other part of the But the Government now in office has the power to do what should be done, and it will be weak-kneed if , having power in both Houses of the Parliament, it does not exercise it in the interests of the whole of the people of the community. We should meet the problem of increased production through I the use of machinery by a progressive reduction of the hours of labour commensurate with the powers of wealth production, and by the raising of the standards of our people so that they may use with greater freedom the gifts that have come from modern science and invention. f the problem is faced in the way I suggest the use of modern methods will prove providential to every man and I suggest that early consideration be given to an amendment of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act. I know that we are subject to constitutional limitations and cannot give definite direcupon tions to the Arbitration Court; but we can express our views to the court by an we amendment of the act. This was done by a previous government years ago. I recall that the Bruce-Page Government a caused section 25D to be inserted in the Arbitration Act. That section provided The court shall . . . take into considerathe probable economic effect of the award in relation to the community and' upon the The court did take into consideration the economic effects of its awards, with the result that in many eases it Teduced the wage standards of the workers of Australia. I suggest that the act should he further amended to provide that the court shall take cognisance, not only of economic effects, but also of humane considerations. Parliament should stress that the increased production due to the use of modern machinery and speeding up devices should be met by provision for increased consumption of goods and increased leisure for those who have hitherto been called upon to engage in back-breaking toil. Such a provision could ' be inserted in the Arbitration Act as an expression of the opinion of this Parliament, pending the making of appropriate amendments to the Consitution which would make possible some more practicable parliamentary action. An increase of the purchasing power of the workers would be a very important factor in stimulating industry. It is, in fact, the greatest means by which we can provide a larger market for our primary producers and manufacturers. We could definitely stimulate industry and increase the purchasing power of the people by at once restoring the pensions and social services that were previously provided in Australia. I trust that this will be done. I hope that the Government will repeal the sections of the Pensions Act that deal with property and the responsibilities of relatives of pensioners. If that be done, there will undoubtedly be an improvement in the unemployment position, for there will be a raising of the standards of people who, through economic circumstances, must spend every penny that they receive. By that means a better market would be provided for our primary producers than could be provided in any other part of the world. This would be a saner method to apply than that of looking to the people of foreign countries for special concessions. May I digress here for a moment to be say that I can see nothing derogatory in our aiming at making Australia more scheme; and we self-supporting than it is at present? 1 control prices andneed do not say that we can be absolutely selfbetween contained ; but there is nothing degrading in a nation doing its own work in preference to sending it overseas to be done by also foreigners. My suggestion cannot be disthe same means missed by merely describing it as taking ifr. Scullin. in one another's washing. In any case, it is better for us to take in one another's washing than to take in the washing of foreigners, and send our washing out for foreigners to do. Let us be a little more confident of our own country. We have in the past been too prone to regard things made by foreigners as superior to things made by Australians, and to pay higher prices for foreign goods than for goods made by our own people. It has been only by the stress of the financial position and the imposition of what might be regarded as extreme duties that some people, at least, have awakened to the fact that they can buy an article made by Australians in Australia that is equal to that made by people in any other part of the world. We must develop our home market by the means that I have suggested. Incidentally, may I say that I am justas curious as some honourable gentlemen who sit behind the Government to know what has become of the rural rehabilitation scheme which figured so prominently in the speeches delivered by members and supporters of the Government during the election campaign ? I thought the scheme was all arranged and waiting for the Premiers Conference or the Loan Council to adopt; but we find that we still have to wait for it. I hope that we shall not have to wait long. Some months ago this scheme was a very prominent subject of discussion. I do not suggest that the problem is easy of solution. I see that many difficulties will confront any government which attempts to carry through a comprehensive rehabilitation policy. T see. for instance, the great danger of reducing the debts of the farmers and lifting the burden from bankers and mortgagee companies by transferring the liability to the shoulders of the whole community. But I realise that one of the first problems that must faced is the provision of additional markets a nationwide for primary producers. We need and organized marketing greater power to the prices received bytheproducers to limit margin and those paid by consumers. We need to increase the power of consumption by reducing the cost of distribution. By we could increase prices to producers. I have not yet forgotteu, nor do 1 suppose have other honourable members, that when we had national control through a compulsory pool of the wheat of Australia, during the years L916, 1917 and 1918, the price of wheat was 4s. 9d. a bushel and the retail price of bread 4d. per 2-lb. loaf. We must not weaken the protectionist policy of Australia, but rather strengthen it, not only in the interests of the manufacturers, but also in the interests of the primary producers. We must realise that the best market for our producers is the home market. Already we can see the effects of the weakening of our protectionist policy. Our trade balance for the first two calendar months for the present financial year was unfavorable to the extent of £4,577,000, whereas the trade balance for the corresponding two months of the last financial year was favourable to the extent of £367,000. My time has almost expired, but in order that honourable members may have an opportunity to express their on the principles which I have outlined. I move the following amendment:That the following words be added to the address:"" and this House is of the opinion that to provide for relief of unemployment immediate action should be taken(1) To extend the functions and activities of the Commonwealth Bank, increascarrying ing its power to make bank credit available and utilizing such credit Hiss Hobart T to finance public works; (2) To amend the Arbitration Act to ento sure that full and favqrable conthe sideration be g.ivetn to progressive reductions in the working increases in living standards commensurate with increased powers of production, due to mechanization sp<!eding up of industry; (3) To restore in full pensions and social services and to repeal clauses imposing charges upon pensioners' property and relatives thus increasing purchasing power and stimulating industry; and (4) Tp establish a national scheme for organized marketing including the setting up of Australian-wide pools."" Those proposals are constructive and practical, and we must face the issue. I air. submit the amendment to the House for the earnest consideration of honourable members.
