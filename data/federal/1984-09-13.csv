12,Mr DAWKINS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I present for the information of the House a document entitled 'Program Presentation of Appropriations and OutlaysDepartmental Estimates 1984-85'. In doing so, I seek leave to make a statement regatc;ling the progress of the Government's budgetary reform measures. Leave granted.",86
13,Mr DAWKINS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I thank the House. This document presents appropriation and outlay information for each department in a program format. It is intended to assist Parliament in its examination of the 1984-85 Estimates, and the general public in its understanding of government activities. The document was published for the first time last year on a trial basis. Since that time, the Government published the document 'budget reform', in which we announced a pilot study to explore implementation of program budgeting. That study is to be presented to the Government within the next few weeks. Pending the Government's consideration of program budgeting,. we have decided to continue the program presentation of outlays contained in this document. The House might also be interested to learn of the progress of other aspects of reform canvassed in 'budget reform'. In the development of the 1984-85 Budget the Government, for the first time, considered simultaneously the staffing and financial resources implications of proposals which it was examining. In this way, the Government was aware of the total cost of proposals and managers were aware at a much earlier date than previously of the total staff resources which the Government was willing to commit to programs. 'Budget reforms' also foreshadowed the consolidation of departmental administrative votes to allow more effective funds and program management by departments. That reform has been implemented in the 1984-85 Budget. In an associated reform, the Government has imposed cash limits on the consolidated administrative and, where relevant, consolidated operational items of departments' votes. A modest supplementation has been included both in the Budget figuring and in the appropriation provisions so that further supplementation in these areas at Additional Estimates time would not be required for other than extraordinary reasons. The government has, for the first time, also included in the Budget figuring a provision for salary and wage rate increases of certain one line Budget dependent statutory bodies. This provision, which is not included in the estimates of appropriations, brings the treatment of these governmental type agencies, such as the National Library and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, into line with the treatment accorded to government departments since 1974-75. The provision allows such bodies to plan their annual programs and expenditures with the confidence that the Government will provide the necessary resources for future wage rate increases outside their control. Finally, the financial management improvement program to assist the efficiency and effectiveness with which departments manage the resources at their disposal is now being implemented. Departments are being encouraged to develop corporate decision-making mechanisms and processes which focus attention on their longer term goals and objectives and take greater account of resource constraints. The experience of the three departments currently implementing FMIP throughout the whole organisation, that is, Communications, Health and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, is assisting in the development of general guidelines on best practices for dissemination to all departments and authorities. The financial management improvement program is of course allied to the program budgeting study which I mentioned earlier. As I have indicated previously, the Government considers it is important that the Public Service maintains its vitality, its competence and its effectiveness. These reforms and the further studies in train attest to the seriousness of our commitment to quality in government and offer prospects for further improvement in Public Service management and accountability.",86
14,Mr MOORE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"by leave-The statement of the Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins) is welcomed by the Opposition. It reflects some improvement in government accounts. It is an area that has been in need of reform for a long time and goes only some way towards what I would regard as more responsible management by government departments. As a Minister, I never saw the reason for the degree of accounting and budgeting that took place in those days, and the moves here to give department heads more responsibility for which they must be accountable are welcome. I looked through the accounts of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the breakdowns there. I found that the set-out there enabled me to see at a glance what was taking place in terms of expenditure in that area-an area about which I knew something. It was certainly a much easier presentation than previously. However, the management of the Public Service is a huge area. I must express concern at the obvious attempt to make the Public Service a pol- itical arm-a matter about which everybody in the House will be concerned. The Public Service is the servant of the Government and, through the Government, of the nation. It is not the servant of a political party. That is a matter about which all of us in Australia should be concerned in regard to developments in that area in recent times. Although I welcome the developments in financial presentation, I. express concern at what appears to me to be a move towards a political Public Service. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",87
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINING AND EXPORT OF URANIUM,"Mr Drummond)Mr Speaker has received a letter from the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Hunt) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to implement a rational policy on the mining and export of uranium.

17,Mr MORRISON,INSTITUTIONS AND FRANCE,"The report covers the dele, 24 egation's participation in a number of the parlia,' mentary institutions in Europe, the first being the' Council of Europe, where the delegation issued a: statement outlining Australian criticisms of the European Community's common agricultural: policy and presented Australian views on the state, and future of the steel industry. 1 draw, the: House's attention to the statements contained in: Lindsay, E.

The delegation also participated in the Strasbourg conference, and 1 was honoured, on beha:lf of the Australian Parliament, to be appointed as a rapporteur for the conference. 1 think this is the first time that an Australian h-s been given such a' Wells, D. MCM. responsibility in the European parliamentary institutions. The paper which I prepared is contained at annexe E. The speeches of our delegates, the Deputy Speaker of the House, Mrs Child, the honourable member for Curtin, Mr Rocher, and the honourable member for Braddon, Mr Groom, are contained at annexe F. We also participated in the European Parliament. Our participation in the European Parlia-' ment is facilitated through the European Pafli:ament's own permanent delegation for relations with Australia and New Zealand. In these meetÂ· ings, the delegation was able to put forward again Australia's very significant and substantialcfiti-' cisms of the common agricultural policy 'of 1 Europe, During our visit a draft resolution was being considered by a group within the European Parliament which would have had the effector' banning the importation into Europe of kangaroo products. The delegation was invited' t6--(jte--.' that group. As a result, the group modified its approach. At the same time, the delegation indicated the support that the Australian Government would give to assisting in providing information on kangaroo management in Australia. The delegation had to be split for participation in the North Atlantic Assembly. This IS the second time that the Australian Parliament has beenÂ· represented at the North Atlantic Assembly but, because of the coincidence of timing of the Strasbourg conference and the North Atlantic Assembly, we split the delegation. I am indebted to the honourable member for Grayndler, Mr Leo MCLeay, and to Senator Peter Rae for their participation on the delegation's behalf at the meeting of the North Atlantic Assembly in The Hague. I was able to visit The Hague briefly during the time when the delegation had discussions with the Japanese delegation. I refer the House to the record of that meeting at annexe J. It covers the essential similarity of views of Japan and Australia in relation to strategic and security matters. Our contribution there is important in bringing a Pacific perspective to the consideration of West European security. Whilst We were at The Hague, the delegation was approached by the President and the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Assembly who extended an invitation to the Australian Parliament to become an accredited observer to the North Atlantic Assembly. In its report, the delegation has indicated that this invitation should be taken up. We have also made some recommendations relating to a more effective participation by Australia in the North Atlantic Assembly, and we trust that the Presiding Officers of this Parliament will consider those recommendations. I want to mention in particular the significance of our participation in these sorts of organisations. For instance, last Monday the Sydney Morning Herald contained a report headed, 'US would launch a first strike: Pentagon'. A Pentagon spokesman observed that: The current deterrence policy rests upon the doctrine of flexible response, which would include the use, as required, of conventional weapons, non-strategic nuclear weapons and strategic nuclear weapons. That is in terms of the flexible response. That would certainly not come as any surprise to this Parliament, because in the previous report of the delegation that visited the European parliaments, we had this to say: The Delegation noted that reservations about the feasibility of putting into effect of flexible response, relying heavily on early first use of nuclear weapons, are now so wide spread in both military and political circles that military planners in NATO are calling for upgrading of conventional forces. Traditionally NATO relies on the threat of the use of nuclear weapons early in conflict as a deterrent against the Soviet Union launching a conventional attack in Europe. The first step was to use theatre nuclear weapons with a. so-called graduated response to strategic nuclear attack on the Soviet Union heartland. The doctrine of first use of nuclear weapons was essential to the deterrent theory. It is essential to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation concept. In that previous report the delegation concluded: Increasingly, the whole strategy is being seen as a transparent bluff. In the report before the House the delegation notes that some representatives at the meeting argued that the deployment of the Pershing and cruise missiles was of doubtful military worth and had become, instead, a test of the fidelity of the NATO member nations. These are the sorts of perspectives that we get from being actually involved in these meetings. I had an opportunity of going to the Military Committee of the North Atlantic Assembly, and in one of the papers presented this observation was made about intermediate-range nuclear forces: The political significance of INF deployment-the coupling of Western Europe to the US strategic guarantee-has always outweighed the military utility of the INF systems as the targets against which Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles would be aimed can be adequately covered with other nuclear systems. We have had many debates on the Pershing and cruise missiles, but it is only through active participation in organisations such as the North Atlantic Assembly that we get the stated views of those participating governments that are much more directly involved than Australia. Ins because of this access to this type of information, access to the expert debates that take place in organisations such as the North Atlantic Assembly, that this Parliament should certainly respond to the invitation made on the basis of our previous participation in the North Atlantic Assembly by the Secretary-General and the President to participate more actively in the work of the Assembly. The delegation also paid an official visit to France. We appreciated the hospitality of the National Assembly and the Senate in the arrangements that they made for our visit. I direct the House's attention to those sections of the report which deal with the delegation's assessment of France's nuclear policy including nuclear tests in the South Pacific. Very briefly, the Force de Frappe, Fnince's independent nuclear force, is the traditional NATO strategy regarded as synonymous with French independence. This is right across the board, across the spectrum of FrenchÂ· political views, from the Communist Party right through to the right wing parties of the De Gaullists. There is a consensus that France has, should have and should continue to have an independent nuclear force, and that, as part of that force, the capacity to test nuclear weapons in the South Pacific is also synonymous with independence. We got very short shrift We argued our case up and down France and in Paris with the National, Assembly, with the Senate, and with the French Government. But they made 'it very clear that their independence is dependent upon the independent nuclear capacity and that, in order to maintain and enhance that nuclear capacity, testing is not only necessary but also desirable, and that that is the French attitude and view. We have also gone into some details ,of the French civil nuclear program. There are those who argue that the nuclear energy industry for power production is on the way down. That point of view is in stark contrast to the attitude taken by the French Government to the further development of nuclear energy in France. On behalf of the delegation, I should like to exmust press our thanks for the assistance and support given by the Australian Ambassador to France,  to Belgium, Mr David Anderson, and to their staff, who gave us considerable support, particularly during the Strasbourg meetings when we were we11 away from an Australian mission. I also acknowledge the contribution of the delegation's secretary, Mr Diamond. In conclusion, I place on record my personal appreciation to our Madam Deputy Speaker, to the honourable members for Braddon, Curtin and Grayndler and to Senator Peter Rae for their amiable co-operation in making the delegation's mission a success. I believe that the delegation an adornment to the international reputation of this Parliament.",88
18,Mr ROCHER,INSTITUTIONS AND FRANCE,"by leave-At the outset, on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleague the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom), I congratulate the leader of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to European Parliamentary Institutions and France, the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison), who led us with distinction and great ability. Mr Leo MCLeay-And style. ' Mr ROCHER-Yes, indeed. As the honourable member for St George pointed out"" many topics were covered and a wide range of views heard and expressed over, the three or four weeks we were members of the delegation and travelled, together. It is not unnatural that we should havlf' spent some time discussing <.:ommon agricultur<l:l"" policies within the European Coml11Unity. ,It probably came as no surprise at all, altho)Jgh it was I guess disappointing, that there are, no solutions in sight to the prol;>lem of access f()r Australian agricultural products to that European market. Of course, there is limited access., We were sympathetically heard' when we lllade' our points. We did not meet with any disagreement from the people in France or'others in Europe in regard to the position we wanted to put: Tl)ey, agreed that agriCulture insOlneEufopeari .countries is not cost efficient and in that res'pectcb'mpares very unfavourably with the situationJn' Australia. The reason for continuing with such a; policy is purely political. Represen'tatives in' the,' various parliaments of Europe havefoUlldthat,"" given their large rural communities-much liu'gei"" than our rural community in Australia-the political necessities of life involve them in' certillW' practices in relation to agricultural' pro'ducts' which, although not economically costefficierit, be maintained if the political representativeS ; are to retain their positions. For the same reasons Europe's trading polieie-' with the lesser developed couritries will not appreciably improve in the foreseeable future'.' This state of affairs will be exacerbated by the ultimate, if not imminent, admission of Spain and Portugal to the European Community and the European Economic Community. Therefore, in terms of prospective trade in agricultural goods in that part of the world there was not much, good news for uS as representatives of Australia. However, it was enlightening for us to have the opportunity to discuss and to try to understand the positions of the various European countries, in' was particular France. The Strasbourg conference dealt entirely with the promotion of democracy throughout the world. It might be said by a cyhic, that it involved motherhood motions right, left' and centre. I guess that would be one impression.l must say that I found it valuable to have reinforced and refreshed my ideas on democracy and the' part it plays in the free world. Being so close to parts of the world, in particular eastern Europe,' which are not blessed with the democratic insti.. tutions that we have in this country and which the rest of Europe has, it was useful to, remind our.:. selves of the privileges we enjoy as a member country of the democratic w o r l d . "" ;1;-' The European parliamentary sessidil'wM' broken up into many working sessions. It enabled us to exchange views with not just Europeans I;>ut also people such as ourselves, from .the ,Â£'11,\rl corners of the world. As guests of the Government of France and more specifically the French National Assembly and the French Senate, we were treated very kindly. We were given an itinerary 'which perhaps prevented some of us doing some of the thingS we would have liked to do. We operated very largely as a team. One ot the highlights of our stay in France was a visit-o Villeis-Bretonrieaux in the J>icardy region wh,ere there is, ,a memorial to the fallen of WoiI,d - War.

While perhaps in terms of trade relationships and some other relationships, we Cannot be as close as we might, we cannot be of the sanie mind, we certainly do have a place in the hearts of the people in that part of France. It was an extremely valuable experience. It added to my understanding and, I am sure, the understanding of my colleagues on the delegation. We came away with realistic ideas of what we can expect from,that part of the, world. I suggest that we should maintain as far as we possibly can some sort of contact along the lines of the delegation of parliamentary representatives. ,Overall the visit did, I suppose, reinforce the vieW that many of us have long held, which is that w'e must ,look to our own region for the development of trading opportunities and commerce gener-lly in which Australia can participate. I think that our approach must be directed to the countries of the Pacific rim, if not the Pacific basin countries. That is where our commercial and trading future lies. I congratulate the compilers of the report. I join the, honourable member for St George in expressingappreciation for the work that was done by the; several ambassadors and the embassy staff who helped us while we were away. I pay special tribute to the secretary to the delegation, Rob Diamond-I know my colleague the honourable - ember for Braddon will join me in that. . , Mr,Groom-,-Godfrey and Judy Santer.",90

20,Mr LINDSAY,PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE,"I present the ninth report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. I record thatÂ· the Chairman of the Committee, the honol,lrable member for, Burke, (Dr Theophanous), is in the Parliament building. Report-by leave-adopted. NA BILL 1984 Bill presented by Dr Blewett, and read a first time. Second Reading",91
21,Dr BLEWETT,HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. By this Bill the Government proposes to make certain amendments to the Epidemiological Studies (Confidentiality) Act 1981; the Health Insurance Act 1973; the National Health Act 1953, and the Tuberculosis Act 1948. The Epidemiological Studies (Confidentiality) Act 1981 provides for the confidentiality of information on personal affairs which is collected for those epidemiological studies prescribed under the Act. The amendments to that Act, proposed in clauseS 3, 4 and 5 of this Bill, are designed to . ensure that the Act provides for confidentiality in relation to information regarding the affairs of deceased persons as well as the living. The need for the amendment arose out of concerns that the references ,to 'population' and 'persons' in paragraph (a) of the definition of an 'epidemiological study' in sub-section 3 (1) of the Act might be <;:onstrued so as to exclude the affairs of deceased persons from the scope of the Act. The proposed amendment is intended to resolve any possible doubts for the future and is not seen to effect an alteration in the law. The medicare legislation which came into effect on 1 February this year removed the Commonwealth's power to approve public hospital beds. This reflected the Government's policy that such matters, relating to the administration of public hospitals, were the responsibility of the States . However the Commonwealth, through it health insurance responsibilities, retains an interest in ensuring that fund benefits are paid in the correct circumstances. The proposed amendments re .. move any doubt that fund benefits are payable to private patients in both private and public hospitals. Clause 8 of the Bill will allow certificates under section 3B of the Health Insurance' Act to be issued up to 14 days befotethey come into effect. At present they can be issued up to seven days before they come into effect. Section 3B certificates are issued by medical practitioners and state that a long stay in-patient of a' hospital is in need of acute care for a certain period. This certificate entitled the long stay patient to the full level of health fund benefit, and exempts him or her from the requirement to pay a patient contribution. The amendment allows more time, in cases where section 3B certificates ,are referred for review by an acute care advisory committee, for the determination of whether the certificate is to be varied or revoked before it cornes into effect. This will reduce the likelihood of such patients being faced with a retrospective payment to the hospital. I wish to e-phasise that this legislative amendment is only one facet of a comprehensive review of the operational aspects relating to the arrangements for long stay patients in hospitals. A number of other matters are being addressed administratively, with the aim of removing many of the concerns that have been expressed. These matters include the development of uniform national guidelines on what constitutes 'acute care' for use in the context of the section 3B arrangements. In the near future these guidelines will be distributed to all doctors and should assist in achieving a greater understanding of the whole assessment and decision-making process. It is emphasised that despite the formulation of these guidelines, it will continue to remain the responsibility of individual doctors, based on their professional judgment, to assess whether patients are in need of acute care. In addition, the form of the section 3B certificate is being redesigned and, amongst other things, the revised certificate will include a statement making clear that the penalties which apply for the provision of false information, and which have been of concern to the medical profession, will not apply to the bona fide expression of medical opinion.' A general streamlining of the section 3B processing procedures is also being undertaken in the interest of reduCing the possibility of patients"" incurring financial hardship when section 3B certificates are referred for review by an acute care advisory committee. The effect of clause 9 of the Bill is to enable Minister for Health to dete(mine that a health service and its associated fee, which are not listed in the medical benefits schedule, shall be treated for the purpose of the health legislation as if that health service and fee were included in the schedule. Currently there is a 'pay under' scheme which ensures that Medicare benefits are paid where a medical service not listed in the schedule but regarded as a legitimate service, is carried out. The praCtice for many years has been to pay benefits under the neare-t item in the schedule. New section 3C, which would be inserted into the principal Act by this clause, applies both to inc dividual health services and classes of services. Determinations made under section 3C would be subject to tabling in both Houses of Parliament and scrutiny by either House. Services specified in determinations would be subject to the same legal provisions which would apply if they were in the medical benefits schedule. Modifications were made to the 'pay under' scheme from 1 November 1983. This reduced, but did not entirely remove, the need to continue to use this practice for certain categories of service. The Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans) subsequently indicated that as the arrangements were not authorised by legislation, appropriate action should be taken to remedy the situation. I should point out that it takes some time to have new items introduced into the medical benefits schedule, and of course it is unacceptable to defer payment of Medicare benefits while this is taking place. In addition, it is undesirable to clutter up the schedule further by including services which are used only infrequently or are transient in nature. Taking all these factors into account, the mechanism which this clause contains is both appropriate and essential for the proper payment of Medicare benefits in those cases where a legitimate service is not covered by the medical benefits schedule. I now turn to the clauses in the Bill which provide for the nursing home benefits provisions in the National Health Act to be amended. These are clauses II and 12, 15 to 21'inclusive and 26. The proposed amendments will enable Commonwealth nursing home benefits to be paid for patients temporarily absent from nursing homes. It is anticipated that this will also facilitate the admission of respite care patients who will be able to take the place of patients temporarily absent. The proposed amendments will authorise one of a number of initiatives announced in the Budget to assist aged and disabled people. The ,Government has been concerned that these the people should be helped to maintain maximum independence. The present rigidities in the nursing home benefits arrangements have inhibited this, and have led to some nursing home patients incurring severe financial burdens. The arrangementshave deterred nursing home patients from leaving nursing homes for short periods, consequently restricting the beds available for respite care. I have received many representations on behalf of patients who have had to be temporarily hospitalised and who have experienced severe financial difficulties through having to pay the full nursing home fee during their absence to ensure that their bed is available upon their return to the nursing home. At present such a patient is often required to pay both the patient contribution and an amount equivalent to the Commonwealth nursing home benefit to ensure his or her bed is retained. Similar problems are experienced by patients who tempora,rily leave a nursing home, for example to stay with relatives. Clause '12 of the Bill provides for the proprietor and the patient, or a person acting on the patient's behalf, to enter into a common form of agreement covering the patient's temporary absence. The purpose of the agreement will be to record clearly but simply the essential obligations of the patient and the proprietor in relation to the patient's temporary absence. While clause 12 refers to some of the matters that may be covered in the agreements, it is my intention to consult with the nursing home industry and with organisations representing patients to ensure that the common form of agreement enables clear and equitable arrangements to be entered into. Where the temporary absence of a qualified nursing home patient is covered by an agreement, c,lause 12 also provides for Commonwealth nursing home benefits to be payable for a period or periods of temporary absence totalling up to 28 days in a year. Should the agreed periods of temporary absence exceed 28 days, the benefits will cover the first 28 days. So, during these periods of up to 28 days in each year, it is proposed that patients will be required to meet from their own resources a bed retention fee not exceeding the difference between the full fee and the Commonwealth nursing home benefit. Proprietors will be encouraged to use the beds of temporarily absent patients for the provision of short term respite care whenever practicable. Clauses 15 and 17 of the Bill provide for such respite care patients to be subject to admission procedures similar to those applying to other patients. Proprietors will only be able to admit patients, approved as needing respite care in a nursing home. Provision is made, in clause 26 of the Bill, for reconsideration by the Minister and, subsequently, review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of refusals to approve the admission of persons as respite care patients- Short term respite care patients will not be charged fees greater than the, difference between the full fee for the bed, less the CommQnwealth nursing home benefits. The new arrangements will ensure, therefore, that neither the temporarily absent patient nor any respite car- patient will suffer any disadvantagt: in respect of fees paid compared with other patients accommodated in the home. The discussions with the nursing home industry will include an exploration of the practical measures that canbe taken to maximise the use of temporarily vacant beds for short term respite care. The Government fully recognises the sacrifices that can be involved for relatives and others involved in caring for frail aged people in the community. It knows that there are occasions when short term respite care is of vital importance tQ the welfare of aged an disabled people and of those caring for them. I believe that this respite care initiative has the potential to assist significantly in meeting such needs. The proposed amendments will permit comparable arrangements to apply to repatriation patients as well as to other nursing home patients, and will enable a: separate common form of agreement to be developed to meet the special circumstances of those patients. It is also proposed to negotiate similar arrangements for patients accommodated in deficit financed nursing homes. This measure will not have any significant financial impact for the Government. Its full year cost to the Commonwealth in additional nursing home benefits is estimated to be less than $4m. It will, however, alleviate a source of financial hardship for a significant number 0,Â£ aged and disabled people and offers the promise of improving the quality of life of them and of those caring for them. The Bill provides for the. arrangements to come into effect from a date to be proclaimed, giving time for their proper negotiations and development. Clause 13 of the Bill proposes to amend the National Health Act to permit the Commonwealth' to fund the maintenance of privately purchased wireless hearing aids and associated equipment. Honourable members will no doubt know that the National Health Act empowers the Commonwealth to make arrangements for the supply of hearing aids, which it does through the agency of the National Acoustic Laboratories. Wireless hearing aids in particular are supplied for the teaching in educational institutions of children who are deaf'or have severe hearing defects. Unfortunately the Acoustic Laboratories have been unable to keep pace with the demand for aids in recent years, and some institutions and individuals have had to purchase wireless hearing aids privately. This situation is regrettable. The Government is anxious that these institutions and individuals should not be forced to pay the cost of batteries and maintenance for which the Commonwealth would otherwise have paid had the institutions or individuals not purchased their aids privately. The proposed amendment to the Act will authorise the Commonwealth to meet the battery and maintenance costs. I should note that even when the Commonwealth is meeting these costs, there will still be some saving to the Government over the capital outlay that would be required if the privately purchased aids which become faulty were to be replaced at Commonwealth expense. I am pleased to inform honourable members, however, that negotiations are underway with private sector suppliers of wireless hearing aids to ensure that the National Acoustic Laboratories will be able more adequately to meet community demands for these devices. Clause 14 of the Bill deals with the provision of aids to sick and disabled people. As honourable members will be aware, the Commonwealth provides funds for the supply of medical and surgical aids and for other assistance such as the modification of homes to help the sick and disabled in their daily lives. Clause 14 provides for the Commonwealth to enter into arrangements with the States, the Territories and certain bodies corporate, which will avoid undue complexity in the administration of such schemes. The proposed arrangements provide for the Commonwealth, while funding the schemes, to transfer ownership of certain medical and surgical aids to the State or other body concerned. This latter provision is seen as being desirable since some aids, wheelchairs for example, are recycleable in nature, and would be distributed only to persons in need on a loan basis. The transfer of ownership to the States of such aids will facilitate the accountability of those aids and assist considerably the administration of the schemes. I refer now to clauses 22, 23 and 24 of the Bill which relate to the Health Benefits Reinsurance Trust Fund. These proposed amendments, which are of a technical nature only, would have the effect of making the Trust fund a trust account for the purposes of the Audit Act. At the time of the establishment in 1977 of its predecessor, the Hospital Benefits Reinsurance Trust Fund, it was intended that the Trust, fund be incorpated within the Commonwealth public account and thus be subject to the Audit Act. However, the Attorney-General's Department recently advised that the existing provisions of the National Health Act have the effect that it is not part of the Commonwealth public account. Consequently the present Health Benefits Reinsurance Trust Fund also cannot legally form part of the Commonwealth public account. Notwithstanding the legal position, the transactions of the Trust Fund have qeen audited by the Auditor-General and the proposed amendments would enable that to continue. The proposed amendments would have no financial impact on registered health benefits organisations nor on the Commonwealth Government. I turn now to clause 25 of the Bill. This is a purely machinery change which takes account of the fact that the protection afforded to 'authorised persons' under the principal Act is adequately covered in the Crimes Act 1914, the clause removes the provisions prescribing offences for molesting, intimidating, bribing or influencing authorised officers. Bytbe clauses 27 and 28 of the Bill, the, Government proposes to amend the Tuberculosis Act 1948 to phase out the operation of tuberculosis allowances in the light of the almost total eradication of the disease in Australia. In,March 1950 the then Government approved the current scheme of allowances, which came into force on 13 July 1950. The scheme was one of several measures adopted at that time to implement the nation-wide campaign against tuberculosis. The purpose of the scheme was to help prevent the spread of tuberculosis by providing ' financial assistance to persons and their dependantI' who were required to refrain from working and to undergo treatment while they were infected. When the allowances were originally introduced, they were set at levels which were generally higher than those for social security beneficiaries. Over the years the difference in money terms, about $5 per week maximum, between tuberculosis allowances and other benefits, for example, invalid pension and sickness benefit, has not changed so that the added value of the tuberculosis allowance is now relatively small. At the peak of the scheme, at 30 June 1951, allowances were being paid to 6,605 sufferers. This compares with 299 sufferers receiving the allowance at 31 December 1976 and only 150 at 31 ' December 1983. The Government considers that the scheme of tuberculosis allowances has achieved its aim and that there is no longer any justification for continuing to pay higher benefits to the few simply because they suffer from a particular condition, which no longer represents a serious threat to the Australian community. Accordingly, the Government has decided to treat tuberculosis as it would any other disease for social welfare purposes. The amendment of the Tuberculosis Act 1948 will remove the necessity for special handling by the Department of Social Security of tuberculosis cases. The entitlement of people currently receiving tuberculosis allowances will continue. The Bill does not effect any change in the rights of existing ferers. I commend the Bill to the House.

22,Dr BLEWETT,REPATRIATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is an omnibus Bill to give effect in the main to those Budget measures for 1984-85 which require, firstly, amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954; secondly, amendments to the Delivered Meals Subsidy Act 1970; and, thirdly, legislation to make further provision for the ANZAC Hostel in Brighton, Victoria. Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 Under this Act, the Commonwealth currently pays a hostel care subsidy and a personal care subsidy to approved organisations providing hostel type accommodation and services forÂ· aged and disabled people. In the near future, a respite care bed subsidy will commence to be payable to approved organisations to assist those families and individuals who care for aged and disabled persons in their homes but who require a facility to allow short breaks from the demands of care at home. The rates of subsidy payable are $10 per week per eligible person provided with hostel care services; and $50 per week per eligible person provided with both hostel care and personal care services. The respite care bed subsidy will be $10 per week per eligible person provided with a respite care bed for a period of less than 15 days in a period of 28 days; and $50 per week per eligible person provided with a respite care bed for a period of 15 days or more in a period of 28 days. The Bill will increase these rates of subsidy from $10 to $11 per week, and from $50 to $55 per week, respectively, as from 15 January 1985, which is the first prescribed date for payment in January 1985. The new arrangements are estimated to add $2.9m to outlays in the remainder of 1984-85 and $6m in the full year 1985-86. Up to 38,000 people are estimated to benefit by receipt of services under the program. Delivered Meals Subsidy Act 1970 Under this Act, the Commonwealth currently pays a subsidy to approved organisations providing meals under the meals-on-wheels program. suf- The rates of subsidy payable are $0.55 for each meal which includes a vitamin C supplement; and $0.50 for each other meal. the Bill will increase the rate of subsidy for each meal which includes a vitamin C supplement to $0.65 per meal where the approved organisation meets new conditions of service delivery as from 1 January 1985. These conditions have not yet been finally determined, but will relate to the operation and management of approved organisations concerning service deSecond Reading livery. An example of such a condition is that service delivery would have to be made on at least 5 days in each week. The new conditions will be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. An approved organisation which decides not to meet these new conditions would remain eligible for the current rates of subsidy. The new arrangements are estimated to add $0.75m to outlays in the remainder of 1984-85 and $1.5m in the full year 1985-86. Up to 50,000 people are estimated to benefit by receipt of services under the program. ANZAC Hostel,Brighton, Victoria The ANZAC Hostel at Brighton, Victoria has been held by the Repatriation Commission since World War I on a trust created at that time and subsequently varied by the Repatriation Fund (Baillieu Gift) Act 1937. A term of the trust has been that the ANZAC Hostel should be used as a hostel for permanently and totally incapacitated Australian soldiers and sailors of World War I. Since the creation of the trust, the Repatriation Commission has assumed responsibility for providing medical treatment to many thousands of veterans of World War II and the later conflicts and to eligible dependants of deceased veterans. In view of the declining number of World War I veterans and the increasing number of frail aged veterans, especially of World War II, it has been decided to utilise the ANZAC Hostel more effectively by enabling the Repatriation Commission to provide an expanded range of residential and day care services at the hostel for those eligible to receive repatriation treatment. It is proposed to introduce a southern Melbourne aged care service centred on the ANZAC Hostel. The need to travel long distances for care is a very significant problemfor aged persons. This facility will reduce that burden for many veterans and war widows. In order to be able to so utilise the ANZAC Hostel, necessary to change the terms of the trust by varying the purposes for which the ANZAC Hostel may be used by the Repatriation Commission. The revised purposes of the trust are set out in Part VI of the Bill. Other changes The Bill will also amend the Social Security Act 1947 and the Repatriation Act 1920. First, both Acts will be amended to ensure that a dependent child who is in receipt of an income security payment under the Social Security Act 1947 or the Tuberculosis Act 1948 will be disregarded in calculating the entitlement of another person under the Social Security Act 1947 or the Repatriation Act 1920. It is already the case that a dependent child in receipt of invalid pension, a rehabilitation allowance in lieu of that pension, or a supporting parent's benefit under the Social Security Act 1947 is disregarded under those Acts. This measure will therefore provide a general rule in these situations which will remove some minor anomalies. There will be no savings in 1984-85, with savings of $0.15m in 1985-86. Secondly, the Social Security Act 1947 will be amended to remedy a minor anomaly which disadvantages some people receiving family allowance. Currently, the Act requires the Department of Social Security to be satisfied within three months of the child's sixteenth birthday that a dependent child who turns 16 years of age became a student child. While there are administrative procedures designed to enable the Department to be satisfied that such a dependent child becomes a student child, thereÂ· are some cases which fall through the net. The amendment will ensure that a person receiving family allowance will not lose entitlement merely because the administrative procedures do not work as intended. There are no savings in this measure, but the program will operate more effectively and efficiently. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Carlton) adjourned. PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) AMENDMENT BILL 1984 Bill presented by Mr BarryÂ· Jones, and read a first time. Second Reading",95
23,Mr BARRY JONES,REPATRIATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes a number of amendmentsto.the it is Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. - t establishes around the Bass Strait petroleum production facilities an area to be avoided by unauthori.sed Australian ships; it transfers from the designated authority to the joint authority the power to exercise control over rates of petroleum production; it authorises reference of proposals relating to licence work exemptions to the joint authority; and it removes a number of drafting inconsistencies. . A Bill to establish the area to be avoided in Bass Strait came before the Parliament in late 1982 but lapsed with the dissolution of the Parliament in early 1983. The amendments contained in the current Bill are similar to those of that earlier Bill, with the. addition of provisions to allow the declaration of a state of emergency in times of heightened terrorist threat, that, is, above the normal level. . Under the provisions of the Bill, entry into the area to be avoided in Bass Strait is prohibited to Australian vessels over 200 tonnes and, in times of heightened terrorist threat, to all Australian vessels. In regard to foreign vessels, the area to be avoided was approved by the International Maritime Organisation in 1981 and advisory measures were promulgated by the IMO in October 1982. General compliance with those measures has been acheived. The proposed area to be avoided covers an area extending 50 nautical miles from the Victorian coast and embraces all the off-shore platforms and associated submarine pipelines. Complementary legislation will be introduced in Victoria to cover the area between the coast and the outer limit of the territorial sea. The outer boundary of the area is approximately five nautical miles beyond the platforms. The Bill provides that, where an unauthorised vessel enters or remains in the area, the owner and the master may be liable to a fine of up to $50,000, or five years' imprisonment, or both. Provision. is made for possible defences against prosecution on the grounds of an unforeseen emergency or because of circumstances beyond the control of the person in charge. The powers of authorised pt:rsons to enforce these new provisions are set out in the Bill. They include the power to board a vessel, to order the removal of a vessel from the area and to order a disabled vessel to lI.ccept assistance. A person refusing to comply with the instructions of authorised persons acting within their po\Vers may be fined up to $5,000. Provision is made Â·fot \I the issue of warrants to authorised persons and for the exercise of their powers without a warrant in emergency circumstances. The Bill also provides for all unauthorised tralian ships to be excluded from the area when a state of emergency is declared because of a terrorist or extortion threat. The Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Walsh), acting on the advice of the Special Minister of State (Mr Young) and in consultation with Victoria's designated authority'--the relevant State Minister-will be able to declare a state of emergency for up to 14 days and to extend the declaration by further periods of 14 days if necessary. The introduction of the area to be avoided is necessary to ensure the protection of one of Australia's most important ,esource development projects. It is Â·also essential in order that the risk to the lives of those working on.-he production platforms and on ships passing through the area is minimised. The Bill also provides for the joint authoritythe. Commonwealth Minister and the relevant 'State or Northern Territory Minister-to issue directions to licensees as to the rate of recovery of petroleum from licence areas. This will remove an inGonsistency in the present legislation whereby the joint authority is. responsible for directing commencement of production, but the designated authority is empowered to direct licensees to increase or reduce that production. In addition, the amendments provide for the joint authority to direct the rates of recovery of petroleum from individual pools in a licence area, as well as the licence area as a whole, as provided for under the present legislation. In view of the importance to Commonwealth revenue of rates of production from off-shore petroleum fields, the amendments also specify Commonwealth revenue considerations as a reason for joint authority direction as to rates or recovery of petroleum. The Bill also provides that any proposals by the designated authority to vary work conditions in licences be made subject to examination by the joint authority at the direction of the Commonwealth Minister. This removes an inconsistency in the division of responsibilities between the joint authority and the designated authority. It is unacceptable that, while the joint authority must approve the original work conditions of a licence, and can approve or vary permit conditions, it cannot, under the Act as it stands at present, vary work i,.;, conditions of a licence. Finally, the Bill removes a number of drafting inconsistencies and ambiguities, many of which wel'Y identified during the preparation of comp-ementary State-Northern Territory legislation. A draft of this Bill was circulated to the States and the Northern Territory and to industry earlier this year. A number of comments received have been Aus- incorporated into the Bill now before the House. The provisions of the Bill have no direct financial impact. The amendments proposed in this Bill are essential to the continued effective administration of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. I commend the Bill to the House.

24,Mr HURFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Adelaide-Minister for Housing and Construction and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (5.50)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill implements measures announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget Speech to strengthen existing mechanisms for the collection of tax, to increase the levels of penalty for breaches of the taxation laws and to modernise provisions for the prosecution of such breaches. The measures in the Bill demonstrate in a tangible way the Government's determination not to let up on those members of the community who could cheat on their fellows, whether by outright tax evasion, participation in artificial avoidance schemes or the use of delaying tactics to postpone tax collections. The Bill arises from a comprehensive review of the penalty, offences and collection provisions of the various taxation laws, and it will be evident to honourable members that the reforms it contains have been painstakingly developed over a considerable period. Three broad kinds of improvements to the taxation laws are being implemented. The first relates to existing offence and prosecution provisions, the second to penalty taxes, and the third to the procedures for collection and recovery of taxes. Offence and Prosecution Provisions It goes without saying that while there is a high degree of voluntary compliance with the taxation laws, successful enforcement of those laws depends on adequate sanctions being available for any breaches. Most of the existing penalties are sadly out of date. The maximum penalty, for example, for failure to lodge an income tax return has stood at $200 since 1936. That deficiency is being rectified in this Bill. In most cases there is to be a lO-fold increase in the maximum monetary penalty for a taxation offence and, where offences carry a term of imprisonment, that term is also being increased. To deal more appropriately with habitual taxation offenders, a tiered penalty structure will operate for second and subsequent offences and will include a liability to imprisonment. The tiered penalty structure will apply to existing offences, such as failure to lodge a return or information or refusing to give evidence when attending before the Commissioner of Taxation, and also to a new group of offences to deal with tax evasion practices in a more complete and certain way than the existing law seeks to do. Under the new rules, it will be an offence to make false or misleading statements or to keep accounting and other business records that do not correctly record and explain the matters contained in the record. For such an offence, the maximum penalty for a first offence will be $2,000. Yet higher penalties will be imposed where a person recklessly or knowingly makes a false or misleading statement or keeps records incorrectly. For those kinds of offences, first offenders will face maximum penalties of $3,000 and second and subsequent offenders penalties of $5,000 or 12 months imprisonment, or both. It will be an express offence to keep records incorrectly or conceal them with the intention of deceiving or misleading the Commissioner of Taxation in the administration of the taxation laws. Falsifying or concealing the identity, address, place of residence or business of a person with the intention of deceiving, hindering, obstructing or defeating the purposes of a taxation law is also to be proscribed. These offences will be punishable by a fine of $5,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both for first offenders and a fine of $10,000 or two years for second and subsequent offenders. An important complementary measure to the new offences and penalties will empower courts to order persons convicted of tax evasion offences to pay to the Commissioner an amount up to double or treble-according to the nature of the offence-the amount of tax sought to be avoided through the act that constitutes the offence. Where a tax agent is convicted of an offence of knowingly making a false statement or failing to keep proper records or of falsifying or concealing the identity of a person with the intention of deceiving or misleading the Commissioner, the registration of the tax agent will be suspended for a minimum of three months. To give further impetus to the new penalties, and speed up the prosecution process, the Commissioner of Taxation will be able to institute prosecutions in courts of summary jurisdiction for taxation offences carrying terms of imprisonment not exceeding12 months and for all offences carrying only a pecuniary penalty. That will enable the majority of taxation offences to be instituted in courts of summary jurisdiction. I now turn to measures that will directly 'affect companies in breach of taxation laws. Existing provisions that specify a fine or term of imprisonment for breaches of a taxation law, apply unevenly as between individuals and corporations. To bring the deterrent effect of those pen-, alties closer together, the maximum monetary penalty to be imposed on companies is to be five times that applicable to an individual' for 'offences "" which also carry a term of imprisonment. So that ' ' persons responsible for breaches of the taxatiori' laws by companies are appropriately dealt with; 'a' director, officer or other person who is concerned in, or takes part in, the management of a company will be dealt with as having committed any taxation offence committed by the company, and be punishable accordingly. ' 'I' "" This measure is modelled closely on a similar< provision in the companies code, but a person able to show that he or she did not aid or abet in the act. or omission of the company that constituted the offence and was not, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in that act or omission will not face conviction. Some may baulk at this measure but it is important to bear in mind that, before any conviction may be recorded against a person, it will be necessary toprove to the satisfaction of the court that the offence was committed by the company concerned. The only way in which a company can commit an offence is through the actions of its officers or those who control it. In tax matters up to now, such in<;lividuals have been able to escape responsibility for their actions or omissions by shielding behind the corporate veil, ' with the result that prosecutions against corporations have often proven fruitless-usually because there are little or no funds left in the company. In many such cases, the persons Who would suffer if a fine was imposed on' the company are innocent creditors of the company. ' The new measure is directed against those who , are fully responsible for breaches of the taxation, ' laws by a company. Directors and company officers who act honestly and with reasonable competence in their management of a company's, ' affairs have nothing to fear from this measure. All taxation offences committed by companies will be capable of being instituted in a court of summary"" jurisdiction, but where the maximum penalty'for "" an offence exceeds $25,000, the company being prosecuted may elect to have the matter tried in a supreme court. A similar choice will be available' i to an individual who is prosecuted for an offence carrying a penalty of more than $5,000. The new offl':nce and prosecution provisions are being enacted, in the Taxation Administration Act 1953 so as to provide a uniform code for offences against the various taxation laws. Penalty Tax Provisions A major reform is implemented in the revised penalty tax provisions. Under the existing income tax law,ll taxpayer who fails to furnish a return or information when required to do so is liable to statutory additional tax equal to the tax assessable.On the other hand, a penalty of double the tax, sought to be avoided may be imposed where assessa-le in,come is omitted from a return, a deduction or rebate is falsely claimed, or where tax is s,OI.ight to be avoided by means of a tax avoidance scheme to which the general anti-tax avoidance provisions of the law apply. Also at present additional tax of only 10 per cent per annum is imposed on tax avoided through international transfer pricing arrangements. The penalty in each of those instances will, under the new measures, be standardised at double the tax sought to be avoided, with a minimum penalty of $20. .TQ remedy an anomaly, an equivalent penalty will be extended to cover attempted avoidance of income tax through participation in blatant tax avoidance schemes in respect of which there is specific anti-avoidance legislation. Where tax is avoided by means of international profit shifting, but it is clear that avoidance was not the sole or dominant purpose of the particular arrangement, the penalty will be 25 per cent per annum of the amount sought to be avoided. Apart from the standardisation of maximum statutory penalties, the new provisions will enable penalties to be imposed in relation to various acts or omissions that, while having an intended effect of avoiding tax, are not presently penalisable. Such activities include the misdescription of expenditure so as to maximisea tax deduction, the claiming of a share of a partnership loss computed on the basis of misleading information in a partnership return and the use of objection procedures to claim a deductionunder a tax avoidance scheme where the claim would have been subject to penalty if it had been made at the time of lodgement of the relevant tax return. Several other measures will streamline the penalty tax provisions. One will permit the Commission of Taxation to sue in a court of competent jurisdiction for the recovery of unpaid penalty taxes, including late payment penalty, imposed undc;:r the various taxation laws. A second will ensure that penalty tax continues to accrue in respect of unpaid tax, notwithstanding that judgment for payment of the unpaid tax has been given or entered in a court. Collection and Recovery Procedure Improvements The third major set of measures contained in the Bill is designed to bring about improvements to the procedures for collection and recovery of taxes. Provisions by which the Commissioner of Taxation can recover income tax due from persons who owe money to a tax debtor are being extended to apply to amounts payable to the Commissioner in respect of pay as you earn deductions or deductions made under the prescribed payments system. As well, a defect in those provisions, and equivalent provisions in the Australian Capital Territory payroll tax, sales tax, Australian Capital Territory stamp duty or tax, and wool tax laws is being remedied so that money held in a form of deposit in a building society that in strict legal terms represents share capital of the society may be called on to meet taxation debts. That will place such assets on the same footing as investments in financial institutions generally. In other words, this measure, is not discriminating against building societies in any way. It is, as I just said, putting those building societies on the same footing as investments in financial institutions generally. Measures are being enacted to counter a practice by which some companies have been able to prevent company tax instalment 'notices being sent to them by routinely and falsely estimating their incomes below $1,000. Such actions will attract statutory penalty of 20 per cent per annum. Under the existing provisions, statutory additiohal taxes are imposed for certain breaches of requirements under the prescribed payments system. Equivalent penalties are to be enacted for breaches of the P AYE system, and they will apply where an employer fails to make appropriate deductions of tax from salary or wage, fails to forward deducted amounts or fails to affix tax stamps. Further rationalisation of rates of penalty tax is being made in relation to provisional tax estimates and mining withholding tax deductions. The rate of additional tax for a significant underestimate of income for the purpose of reducing a provisional tax liability will increase from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. A corresponding increase will be made to the penalty for failure to deduct mining withholding tax from a payment for the use of Aboriginal land for mining or mineral prospecting purposes. The Commissioner of Taxation is to be authorised to prevent persons fleeing Australia to escape payment of tax in limited circumstances. The Commissioner will be able to serve a departure prohibition order on a person if he believes on reasonable grounds that there is a likelihood of that person departing Australia without discharging an outstanding tax liability or making satisfactory arrangements for it to be discharged. It will be an offence punishabJe'by a fine of up to $5,000 or 12 months imprisonment for a person on whom a notice has been served to ignore the notice unless departure is authorised by the Commissioner. A departure authorisation certificate will enable such a person to leave Australia temporarily, if the Commissioner is satisfied either that the son will return and the tax liability is likely discharged, or that temporary departure should be allowed on humanitarian or general policy grounds. A departure prohibition order is revocable when the person's tax liabilities are discharged and the Commissioner is satisfied that any liabilities arising out of completed transactions will also be discharged or would be irrecoverable. The aid of the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police and, in appropriate cases, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, will be invoked in detecting and preventing the unauthorised departure from Australia by a person subject to an order. An appeal wiIllie against the making of a departure prohibition order, and against a decision by the Commissioner not to revoke an order or to refuse to issue a departure authorisation. Other Amendments Some further measures are being implemented in tandem with the improvements to the penalties, offences and collection provisions. The Taxation (Interest on Overpayments) Act 1983 is being amended so that the Commissioner of Taxation will pay interest on certain refunds of sales tax, Australian Capital Territory stamp duty or tax, estate duty, gift duty, Australian Capital ritory payroll tax, tobacco charges and wool tax that are made following the resolution of a dispute in favour of the taxpayer. Interest is to be p,ayable in respect of those taxes which are, under other provisions of the Bill, exposed to penalty of 20 per cent per annum if they are not paid by the dute date for payment. The measures are consistent with those applicable in relation to income tax refunds. The opportunity is being taken also to enunciate in the income tax law the principle that any pecuniary penalty, additional tax or other amount imposed on a person for failure to comply with a law is not an allowable deduction. Finally, the Bill will enable applications for; tax clearance certificates required for the purposes of the revised tax screening arrangements announced on 19 June 1984 to be madeunJler and considered in accordance with the established legislative basis contained in the T-x,ation Administration Act 1953. Explanations designed to give a broad guide to the provisions of the Bill are contained in the memorandum being circulated to honourable members. A technical explanation of each'provision of the Bill will be made available to honout'able members shortly. A few days ago tile Treasurer announced those provisions in 'general'. They have received a great deal of interest from perthe community. They show the Government's'deto be sire to stamp out taxation avoidance by every means. I commend the Bill to the H0J.ise.. .

25,Mr HURFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Adelaide-NIiniste- .for Housing and Construction and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (6.06)-I move: ' That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will amend the income tax law in various respects, primarily to give effect to the Government's Budget proposals in the business and personal tax area. I will briefly address each. of the main provisions of the Bill. Transfer of Loss within Company Groups One of the important initiatives announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget Speech on 21 August 1984 to stimulate business activity concerns the taxation treatment of losses within a company group. To give effect to this measure, Terthe income tax law is to be amended to allow a resident company which incurs a loss in the 1984-85 income year, or a later income year, to transfer the right to an allowable deduction in respect of the loss to another resident company iit tax the same company group. The mechanism by which this will be achieved will be the giving Â·by the respective companies of a formal notice to the Commissioner of Taxation of the amount of the loss incurred in a year which is desired to be trans"" ferred between them. The system will be a straightforward one. A,loss available for transfer by a companywiIl be deter, mined in accordance with established income ta)(principles; that is, the available loss will be in excess of allowable deductions-other than carryforward losses-over the assessable income and any exempt income of the company. Subject to existing anti-avoidance rules in this area, the right to an allowable deduction for a loss incurred by one company in an income year may be transferred to another company for deduction in that year wher.e there is lOOper cent common ownership - etween the transferor and transferee companies in that ye;lr. Similarly the right to an allowable deduction for a company loss may be transferred in an income year after the year in which the loss Vias incurredÂ· if the 100 per cent common ownership test is met by the transferor and transferee cQmpaniesin the loss year, the transferer year and !iny intervening period, Subject to' these basic rules, a loss of one company in a group will be able to be transferred to other members of the company group in any of the seven years succeeding the year of loss. Losses incurred in carrying ori a business of primary production will be available for transfer without limit as to time. The amount of the loss which may be transferred to a company in any year will be limited to the total of the net exempt income and taxable income of the transferee company. I note that this change in the taxation treatment of company groups will not affect revenue collections in the current year. From an initial estimated revenue cost of up to $200m in the 1985-86Â· financial year, the cost is expected to decrease over time to an eventual ongoing full-year cost estimated at about $50m. Capital Expenditure on Non-Residential Income-Producing Building The annual deduction allowable in respect of non-residential income-producing buildings, including short term traveller accommodation, is to increase from 2.5 percent to 4 per cent of the cost of construction. Like other Budget initiatives in the area of business taxation, this measure will encourage greater investment by the business sector. This measure is very good. It particularly helps, of course, the construction industry, in which-with my other hat on-I am especially interested. In particular, it will provide a significant boost to the construction industry. The amendment will apply to buildings or extensions, alterations or improvements to buildings that commence to be constructed after 21 August 1984. It is estimated that the increase in the annual deduction will cost $5m in 1985-86, with the cost to revenue growing each year over a number of decades. Investment Allowance Under the existing law, the 18 per cent investment allowance would last apply to eligible capital expenditure incurred under a contract entered into before 1 July 1985, provided the subject property is' used or installed ready for use before 1 July 1986. That latter cut-off date is being extended by one year to 1 July 1987. While the extension will be of particular assistance to firms undertaking large projects with lengthy lead times it will not be restricted to such projects. This limited extension to the investment allowance concession will have no cost in the current financial year, but in total it is estimated to cost in the vicinity of $70m to $100m, of which about 40 per cent should occur in 1987-88. Mineral Exploration and Prospecting . Expenditure Expenditure incurred on exploration and prospecting on a mining tenement iri Australia for minerals other than gold or petroleum is presently deductible only from a taxpayer's mining income and associated income. This Bill changes that because it will give effect to the Government's decision that such expenditure, where incurred after 21 August 1984, is to be deductible from income derived from any source. This measure, which will be of considerable assistance to the mining industry, is estimated to cost $8m in 1985-86 and $10m in 1986087. Zone Rebates These changes are particularly attractive in northern Australia. Amendments proposed by this Bill will increase by 25 per cent the basic component of the rebates available to taxpayers in both zones A and B, and in the special areas of those zones. The rebate for zone A will be increased from $216 to $270, for zone B from $36 to $45 and for the special areas from $750 to $938. They are particularly pleased about this change in Weipa. The basic component of the rebates available to taxpayers serving outside Australia with a United Nations armed force or with an Australian defence force in a designated overseas areawhich since their inception have been set at levels corresponding with the prevailing zone A rebate-al-o will be increased by 25 per cent from $216 to $270. Because these increases are to apply from i November 1984, the basic rebate in 1984-85 for zone A and for overseas forces will be $252, for zone B it will be $42 and for the special areas of zones A and B, $875. A further measure announced in the Budget which this Bill will implement is the extension with effect from 1 July 1984 of eligibility for the special basic zone rebate to people in or near urban centres the populations of which have fallen belo\\, 2,500 since 1976. Those in or near urban centres where populations have increased marginally beyond 2,500 since 1976 will not lose their entitlement to rebate. The cost to the revenue of these changes will be $5m in 1984-85 and $llm in a full year. Dependent Spouse Rebate The Bill will also implement the Budget proposals that, with effect from 1 July 1984, entitlement to the income tax rebate for a dependent spouse will be extended to persons living in a de facto relationship. For these purposes a de facto relationship is to be defined as a man and a woman living together as husband and wife on a bona fide domestic basis although not legally married to each other. Recognition of a de facto relationship will benefit couples who, for some time, have been treated for social security purposes on the same basis as those legally married. Until now people in such circumstances have not been entitled to a rebate for a de facto spouse and have therefore been required to pay more tax than a legally married taxpayer in comparable circumstances. Under the proposedÂ· amendments a housekeeper rebate will not be available for a de facto spouse nor will a taxpayer with a de facto spouse be entitled to a bate for a daughter-housekeeper. Recognition of de facto relationships will flow through to the variable component of zone and overseas forces rebates that take account of dependants. A taxpayer who contributes to the maintenance of the parent of his or her de facto spouse will similarly become eligible for the dependent parent rebate. Finally, and subject to the threshold of $2,000 which applies, eligibility for the general concessional expenditure rebate will be extended to such expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in respect of his or her de facto spouse. These changes will involve a cost to revenue of $2m in 1984-85 and $7m in a full year. Rebate for Pensioners As announced in the Budget Speech, the taxable income level at which the $250 tax rebate for pensioners begins to shade-out is to be increased to reflect the effect of the new personal income tax rate scale to apply from 1 November 1984. The taxable income level at or below which the maximum rebate of $250 is available will be increased from $5,429 to $5,533 for the 1984-85 year and to $5,595 for subsequent years. The rebate will shade out above these. income levels, resulting in some rebate being available until taxable income exceeds $7,532 in 1984-85 and $7,594 in subsequent years. Social Security Beneficiary Rebates A measure implemented by this BillÂ· to assist low income earners is the introduction of special taxation rebates for unemployment, sickness and special benefit recipients. The rebates will ensure that persons wholly or mainly dependent on social secudty benefits do not have to pay tax. The maximum rebates of $50 for single beneficiaries and $75 for married beneficiaries will mean that in 1984-85 no tax will be payable on t!ixable incomes up to $4,783 for single beneficiaries and $7,989 for married beneficiaries. The rebate will shade out above these income levels, resulting in some rebate being available until the 1984-85 taxable income exceeds $5,182 for a single benefi-iÂ­ ary and $8,588 for a married beneficiary. Provisional Tax . As provisional tax complements the pay as you earn system and is designed to collect tax on income other than salary or wage income within the year in which the income is derived, it is generally accepted that the amount of provisional tax charged should appr.oximate as closely as practicable the amount of tax actually imposed for the year. Incomes for 1984-85 are expected to be rehigher than for 1983-84 and, due to the changes to the .personal income tax rate scale applying from 1 November 1984, effective rates of tax for 1984-85 will be lower than for last year. Accordingly, as in past years,it is proposed to vary the basis of calculating provisional tax for 1984-85 to be notified in assessment notices to issue this year. This Bill thus provides for 1984-85 provisional tax to be calculated on the basis of 1983-84 taxable income increased by 10 per cent and by applying the lower rates of tax to apply for 1984-85. Also reflected in the provisional tax calculation will be the full year Medicare levy rate of one per cent. The increased low income thresholds and ceiling to apply for levy purposes in 1984-85 will be taken into account. Generally, rebates will be allowed in the provisional tax calculation at the levels allowed in 1983-84 assessments. Taxpayers will continue to have the right to 'self-assess- and have the provisional tax for 1984-85 recalculated on the basis of their own estimates in appropriate circumstances. Deduction of Certain Expenditure on Fences The scheduled termination of the immediate deduction for expenditure incurred on fencing to help eradicate bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis in livestock will be extended by two years; to 30 June 1986. The proposed extension of this concession will further assist primary producers in those areas, particularly the remote regions of northern Australia, which have the most difficult and continuing eradication problems. The revenue cost of extending the concession is estimated to be $O.lm in 1984-85 and $0.5m in each of 1985-86 and 1986-87. The Bill will also extend the gift provisions of the income tax law to give effect to proposals announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the Budget Speech. One extension will authorise deductions for gifts made after 20 March 1984 to the Work Skill Australia Foundation. Another will authorise deductions for gifts made after 21 August 1984 to the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia. A further extension will ease, in two respects, the requirement that a donor of property must have purchased the property within the 12 months preceding the making of the gift. The first of these concerns gifts to National Trust bodies of property that is listed in the register of the National Estate. Because of the timing and manner of its acquisition property of this kind would generally be precluded from deduction. The Government recognises the great importance of the work of the National Trust in preserving properties of historical and heritage significance and this measure will assist the Trust in carrying out its valuable work. The second change concerns gifts of trading stock made to an authorised fund, authority or institution. Under the present law, gifts of trading stock that is not purchased within 12 months of the making of the gift are not deductible but the value of the trading stock is, under ordinary assessment rules, included in the assessable income of the donor. In contrast, had such a donor first sold the trading st()ck and then donated the proceeds, the proceeds would be taxable but the donor would be entitled to a deduction for the gifts. The amendment will ensure that the income tax law applies neutrally as between donors of trading stock and donors of the proceeds of a sale of trading stock. This further extension will apply to - ifts made after 21 August 1984. Australian Trading Ships As announced by my colleague the Minister for  Government has decided to amend the provisions of the income tax law that authorise special concessions for eligible Australian trading ships. Honourable members will recall that these concessions were introduced earlier this year in order to provide greater incentives for the Australian shipping industry. These concessions are intended to promote greater efficiency in the manning of Australian ships. The amendments will modify the requirements that are imposed upon the Secretary to the Department of Transport in determining the maximum complement of officers and Gifts crew which, in his opinion, is appropriate for the safe and efficient manning of ships eligible for the tax concessions. Primarily, the amendments are to remove any suggestion that industrial relations considerations are a dominant or overriding factor to be taken into account when determining manning levels. They will make dear that industrial relations considerations, where relevant, are but one of the factors to be considered. Substitution of Semi-Government Securities On 7 August 1984 the Treasurer announced the intention to amend the law to remove unwarranted tax effects where securities are issued by State central borrowing authorities in substitutions, on a matched term basis, for semi-government securities previously on issue. The Bill will do this. Since that time, it has come to the Government's attention that at least one State has in existence a central borrowing authority which is similarly empowered to consolidate the borrowings of local government bodies. Some other States are expected to follow this lead. Accordingly, the amendments will extend also to substitutions of local government securities. Under the present law such a substitution may be treated as a realisation of the original securities at their market price on the day of substitution and an acquisition of the replacement securities at the same price on that day. De.alers would stand to be taxed on any gains and could deduct any losses on the realisation of the securities being replaced although no effective change of investment occurs. The Bill will ensure that tax effects of this kind do not arise as an incidence of such substitutions. Any new securities received as a consequence of a substitution by a central borrowing authority, if on a matched term basis, will be treated for the purposes of the income tax law as if they were the original securities, and as having been purchased on the same day and at the same cost as the original securities. The amendments will apply to substitutions that occur on or after 8 August 1984. Det\liled explanations of the measures proposed in this Bill are contained in a memorandum that is to be circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House.

28,Mr HAWKE,SUPPRESSION OF THE PRESS,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am indebted to the honourable member for Higgins. During Question Time today  ron and a visit to the Age. The House will recall that I gave a very specific answer to that question. I want now to add to that answer by indicating that the Editor of the Age, as I understand, will be releasing this statement, and may already have done so, which I now read toÂ· the House in addition to the answer I gave. I ask particularly that members of the Opposition present, particularly the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), pay very clear attention to this statement by the Editor of the Age. It is in these terms:  ter, came to see me last Thursday at his request. He did not lobby me about anything. He did not mention a High Court Judge or Ms Junie Morosi or anything to do with a safe deposit box in a Swiss bank or any other bank. He did not ask me to suppress any story or to publish any story. In fact, he did not ask me to do anything and he certainly did not threaten me. I do not know Mr Steele Hall and to the best of my recollection I have never spoken to him, certainly not about any matter relating to a High Court Judge or Ms Morosi. One could not have a clearer or more unequivocal statement from the Editor of the Age in respect of a totally unfounded and scurrilous imputation by the honourable member for Boothby. I conclude my addition to my answer by asking the Opposition-and I am pleased to see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in his place-to take steps to ensure that these totally unfounded insinuations and allegations are brought to a halt. It is not merely that it does no credit to the Opposition because that is its concern. Opposition members have to deal with their stature and how they will be judged in the public mind. But what is clearly established now by this unequivocal statement from the Editor of the Age is that the scurrilous innuendo involved in the question by the honourable member for Boothby is totally without foundation. It does the honourable member for Boothby no credit. One must presume that he speaks for the Opposition when he raises these matters. Therefore, it does no credit to the Opposition. More than that, the question of the stature of the Opposition is a matter for honourable members opposite, but the stature of this Parliament is a matter of concern to all of us. It does this Parliament no credit at all that we should have a respo'nsible-or an 'allegedly' responsibleleading member of the Opposition gytting up in this place with these sorts of innuendos. It is in line with the behaviour that we have witnessed in this House this day out of the mouth of the Le-der  one have a more specific, unequivocal repudia-iqn, of the gutter tactics of the Opposition through the mouth of the honourable member for Boothby. "", I conclude by expressing the hope that .the' honourable member for Boothby, and ""through him the Leader of the Opposition, will now'havei the decency, having had that scurrilous, baseless, innuendo and implication completely destroyed by the statement of the Editor of the Age----'one expresses the hope that there may be a skerrick of decency left there-to take this opportunity, which I am sure I can provide now, to make a statement in response to what I have had to say.",104
29,Unknown,SUPPRESSION OF THE PRESS,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1984 Bill presented by Mr Dawkins, for Mr Hurford, and read a first time. Second Reading",104
30,Mr DAWKINS,SUPPRESSION OF THE PRESS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will amend the taxation law in relation tq Australia's in-ernational taxation agreements in. several respects. First, it will make clear Australia's right to tax distributions by Australian, business trusts to residents of countries with which Australia has concluded a comprehensive taxation agreement. The Government's intenti<)fl to clarify the operation of our taxation agreements in this area was announced on 19 August, 1984. Secondly, it will give the force of la,w.1n Australia to a protocol signed on 20 March 1984 to amend the existing taxation agreement with Belgium, and to a comprehensive taxation agreement with Malta that was signed on 9 May 1984. Details of the protocol and the agreement were announced when each was signed, and copies of both were made available to the public at that time. The Bill will also make minor technical changes to the law. I turn now to detailed comment on the main features of the Bill. Foreign Beneficiaries This measure is in response to a technical argument to the effect that Australia would be unable to tax distributions of business profits derived in Australia by a trust where those distributions are made to a beneficiary, or a unit holder in the case of a unit trust, being an enterprise resident in an agreement partner country. It is claimed that, since the trust does not represent a permanent establishment of the beneficiary in Australia, the business profits article in our taxation agreements would operate to shield the beneficiary from a liability to tax in this country. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised the proponents of that argument that he does not accept their view and would contest any such cases coming to his attention. However, if a court were to uphold the argument, Australia's taxation agreements would have a completely unintended effect that could lead to substantial revenue losses. Against this background the Government decided that, to guard against potential revenue losses, legislative action consistent with Australia's domestic tax policy and with what was clearly intended when our taxation agreements were negotiated was needed to put beyond doubt Australia's right to tax distributions of the business profits in question. To that end, the provisions of this Bill will amend the present Australian domestic law so that a beneficiary or unit holder resident in a taxation agreement partner country who is entitled to a share of trust income derived from business operations carried on in Australia, will be deemed to be carrying on the business of the trustee through a permanent establishment situated in Australia. This will ensure that, in accordance with the rules contained in the business profits article of our various taxation agreements, the non-resident will be subject to Australian income tax on that share of business income. This clarifying measure will apply to distributions of business profits to which a beneficiary overseas became entitled after 19 August 1984, the day on which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced-after all of QUf agreement partners had been informed-the Government's intention to legislate in the manner outlined. The Belgium Protocol The protocol with Belgium will amend the existing agreement with that country to take account of three developments in the taxation field in Australia since the agreement was signed in 1977. The first two amendments will fully preserve Australia's right to apply its revised transfer pricing provisions to our own resident enterprises, and specifically recognise the branch profits tax provided for in our domestic law. The third change is necessary to overcome certain technical deficiencies in the definition of the term 'royalties' contained in the existing agreement. That definition applies to payments for the right to use property, but does not cover amounts that, instead of being paid, are merely credited. A further deficiency in the definition occurs in relation to arrangements under which, instead of agreeing in the normal way to a formal grant of the exclusive right to use industrial property, the parties agree that the owner receive consideration for not granting the rights to anyone else. The new definition of the term 'royalties' to be inserted in the existing agreement by the amending protocol will rectify these shortcomings. These changes will bring the agreement with Belgium into line with Australia's other recently negotiated agreements and with Australia's current tax treaty practice. The Maltese Agreement I now turn to the comprehensive agreement that deals with all forms of income flowing between Australia and Malta. In general, comprehensive taxation agreements have two primary objects-the elimination of international double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion. The first of these objects is achieved by the - ontracting countries agreeing to allocate taxing rights between them. There are various ways by which this is done, depending upon the nature of the income. For example, some classes of income will be taxed only in the country or residence while others will be taxed only in the country of soOrce. A third category is comprised of income which may be taken in both countries, with the country of source generally agreeing to limit its tax, and the country of residence of the taxpayer agreeing to allow a credit against its tax on such income for the tax paid in the other country. The agreement with Malta accords in all essential respects with the position that Australian governments have taken over the years in relation to comprehensive taxation agreements. It provides for the country of source to limit its tax on dividends. For its part, Australia will reduce the rate of withholding tax on dividends flowing to Malta from the normal 30 per cent rate to the 15 per cent rate specified in the agreement. In the case of Malta, the agreement provides that the Maltese tax payable by Australian residents on the gross amount of the dividends received from a Maltese company is not to exceed the company tax chargeable on the profits out of which the dividends are paid. This reflects the Maltese system of taxing company profits and dividends whereby the income tax on company profits distributed as dividends is treated, in effect, as tax paid by shareholders on the dividends. The agreement also provides for the country of source to limit its tax on the gross amount of interest and royalties flowing to residents of the other countries. The limit is 15 per c('nt for interest and 10 per cent for royalties. As the rate of withholding tax on interest under Australia's domestic law is 10 per cent, this will not be affected by the limit on the source country tax provided for in the agreement. In Australia, royalties paid to non-residents are taxed by the ordinary assessment basis on the net amount after deduction of expenses and, accordingly, the limit specified by the agreement by reference to gross royalties will not affect the amount of Australian tax on royalties unless the tax which would otherwise be assessed on the net royalties is greater 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties paid to Maltese residents. Malta may, however, in some cases, in accordance with its industry incentive legislation, wholly or partially exempt from Maltese tax certaindividend, interest and royalty payments made to Australian residents. If nothing were done to avoid the situation, the tax so forgone by Malta would simply result in a corresponding reduction in the credit to be allowed by Australia against its tax on the relevant dividend, interest and royalty payments. In other words, the Australian revenue would pick up the tax forgone by Malta, thus nullifying the incentive. To avoid that result, provision is made in the agreement for Australia, as a 'tax sharing' measure, to allow a credit against its tax for tax forgone by Malta under agreed Maltese incentive legislation, as if notional tax equal to 15 per cent of the gross dividend income and 10 per cent of the gross interest and royalty income had been paid to Malta. The agreement contains measures for the formal relief of double taxation of income that may be taxed in both countries, with the country of residence of the taxpayer affording the necessary relief by the allowance of a credit against its tax for tax paid to the country of source. So far as Australian residents in receipt of income from sources in Malta are concerned, income in respect of which a limit is imposed by the agreement on Maltese tax-dividends, interest and royaltieswill generally be taxed here with credit being' allowed for the Maltese tax. However, because of the general rebate on inter-company distributions, there is effectively no tax on dividends received from foreign sources by Australian resident companies. The Bill does not disturb the position that other income that is taxed in the counhy of source is exempt from Australian tax. So far' as the object of preventing fiscal evasion'is'concerned, provision is made in the agreement for the exchange of information and for consultation between the tax administrations of the two - ounÂ­ tries. Apart from the provisions I have mentioned, the agreement also contains usual provisions of a kind common to taxation agreements relating to the taxation of business profits, professional services, employees, public entertainers"" ,students, pensioners and so on. The protocol and agreement contained int11is bill cannot enter into force until all necessary constitutional processes are completed both' by Australia and the other partner country. For Australia, this Bill will, when assented to, comthan plete the processes required o- us. Neither the Maltese agreement nor the Belgium protocol is expected to have any significant net effect on revenue. A memorandum containing more detailed explanations of technical aspects of the Bill and of the protocol and agreement is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Spender) adjourned. AIR NAVIGATION (CHARGES)' AMENDMENT BILL 1984  Morris, and read a first time. Second Reading",104
31,Mr BEAZLEY,SUPPRESSION OF THE PRESS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The three main purposes of the Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill 1984 are to improve the Commonwealth's ability to collect air navigation charges, to place payment and penalty provisions on a more commercial basis and to pave the way for the introduction of a separate airport and airway charging arrangement to replace the existing air navigation charges. The Bill, also makes some machinery amendments to the'! Air Navigation (Charges) Act. At presentthe Commonwealth's powers to recover debts for air navigation charges are limited to the imposition' Of penalty charges and norm,al debt recovery actitm through the courts. These powers have proved l!ufficient particularly with respect to certain eral aviation operators. Over the two years June 1984, air navigation charges from the gencreditor. eral aviation sector outstanding for more than 28 pursued. days increased from about $3.5m to about $5m. While .the majority of overdue payments cannot be classified as bad debts, they nevertheless represent ,a significant cost to Commonwealth revenue. , As well as depriving the Commonwealth of rev-' enue, operators with outstanding air navigation charges reflect poorly on the industry and verselyaffect its overall cost recovery results. 'Moreover, we cannot allow a situation to conin , tinlJe !in which often unscrupulous operators through such devices as straw companies, gaining an Â·unfair .commercial advantage over the great majority of operators who pay their air navigation ,-harges, promptly. While my Department has Â·-cti-t11ytried to assist operators facing short term financial difficulties by encouraging them to make arrangements to pay by instalment, many probto lems have been encountered in dealing with recalof citrant debtors and straw companies. It gives me no pleasure to introduce a Bill which provides for more stringent means to colfor lect air navigation charges and I do so only after considerable consultation with the aviation try through the Aviation Industry Advisory Council. Council recognises the seriousness of situation and the need for the Commonwealth take strong action. Indeed, some industry counaircraft sellors believe the Commonwealth has been too lenient in the past in its efforts to collect air gation charges. I endorse the tenor of this the fact is that the Commonwealth has not had the oecessary tools to take a firmer stance. In these circumstances the Government must be able to take effective steps to recover and secure moneys owed both under the present charging rangements and any future charging have given careful consideration to alternative courses of action to solve the problem, including a suggestion made by industry representatives operators should have their aircraft deregistered 'a- soonas charges become outstanding. I should like briefly to. refer to this proposal Â· wJ:!ichat first glance appears to be a simple and atÂ·traqtive solution akin to the approach adopted by ,motor vehicle registration authorities. On closer ,e-amination this is far from the case. In fact, I am :advised that the Government could pursue this j;;Qurseonly \Vhere there was a. question of safety involved,. In any event deregistration, of itself, :W91.11- not place the Commonwealth in any better ,position to recover overdue charges in particular inwhere aircraft are operated by straw companies genor where an operator goes into liquidation since to 30 the Commonwealth would not rank as a secured For these reasons this proposal was not As an alternative the Government has decided to put in place a debt recovery process based on the creation of a statutory lien over aircraft in respect of which charges are overdue. This process will be exercised on a discretionary basis consistent with the circumstances of the debt. Use of the process will provide the Commonwealth with seadcurity and will also enable a graduated approach to be taken. I would like to elaborate on the way which the lien arrangement will operate. When are, charges have been outstanding for more than 28 days there will be a power to impose on the aircraft a statutory lien which will vest a right over the aircraft in favour of the Commonwealth. Nothing more is involved at this stage. The Commonwealth will, of course, continue take such steps as it can to encourage payment outstanding amounts including payment by instalment. Where all efforts to make satisfactory arrangements to recover outstanding charges have been unsuccessful and the lien has been in force at least six months, the Bill establishes the right to deregister the aircraft by virtue of the indusclaim which the Commonwealth has established through the lien. This will have the effect of the prohibiting the aircraft from being flown and to using Commonwealth facilities and services. The could not then be reregistered until the charges have been paid in full. The Government naviintends that the decision to deregister be reviewview but able in accordance with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. Where the lien has been in force for at least nine months the Bill provides for the Commonwealth to seize and/or sell the aircraft concerned. The power to sell is clearly a last arresort and it is my hope that it will not prove regime. We necessary to use it. The Commonwealth has no wish to ground or that to sell aircraft and the measures that I have outlined will have no effect on the great majority of operators in the aviation industry who conscientiously pay their air navigation charges. However, the measures are aimed at those who choose not to meet their financial obligations yet still expect to use Commonwealth aviation facilities and services. I have no doubt as to how such a situation would be handled in the business world. I would like to emphasise that at each critical point in the graduated process which I have outlined, it is necessary for me or the Secretary to my Department or an officer authorised by the Secretary, to exercise a discretion having regard to the particular circumstances of individual debtors. No step in the process is automatic. As I have already mentioned, the decision to deregister an aircraft will be reviewable under the terms of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. As part of this process the Bill provides that in the first stance such decisions may be reviewed by the Secretary to my Department. I believe the Commonwealth has adopted a balanced approach which provides an effective debt recovery procedure and a capacity to accommodate genuine difficulties faced by individual operators. It will also continue to be an effective debt recovery measure when the Government moves to the system of separate airport and airway charges later in 1985. The statutory lien provisions of this Bill are to come into operation by proclamation and I do not expect this to be possible before the end of March 1985. There will therefore be ample opportunity for those with outstanding charges to meet their obligations before these provisions come into operation. Even then, the Bill provides that the age of outstanding debts prior to the date of proclamation will be disregarded for the purpose of applying the lien provisions which, I would repeat, is a discretionary process which will take into account all the relevant circumstances of the debt. It will of course be essential to have further detailed discussions with industry before the administrative arrangements are finalised and these provisions are proclaimed. In the coming months my Department will be conducting discussions in each State with industry groups and other interested parties-for example, representatives of the finance sector-to ensure the measures are given the widest possible coverage and to ensure that their views are taken into account. Turning to other aspects of the Bill, it increases the rate of penalty interest charged on unpaid amounts from one per cent to a more realistic 1.5 per cent per month compounded and also reduces the period of grace for payment before a penalty charge is imposed from 45 days to 28 days to bring the payment provision more into line with normal commercial practice. These measures will be effective from 1 January 1985. A further administrative matter is the introduction of new route and zone factors necessary to calculate charges for airline operations on routes on which services have recently been commenced. These measures will also apply from 1 January 1985. On top of this, it is proposed to allow the remission of penalty interest. The inability to do this as the Act currently stands has frequently added to administrative complexity. It is proposed that this apply from the date of royal assent to this Bill. On 26 August 1984, I announced that my Department would commence preparations for the in- introduction of separate charges for airport and airway facilities. The Government's in-principle decision to introduce separate charges was an,nounced previously. There is a series of interrelated administrative and policy changes in prospect which will, over the next 12 months or so, result in a complete review of cost recovery arrangements. In addition to the introduction of separate charges for airport and airway facilities and action to reduce late and non-payment of air navigation charges, cost recovery arrangements are currently being examined by the Independent Inquiry into Aviation Cost Recovery chaired by Mr Henry Bosch. Together these measures will result in a more effective and equitable cost recovery policy and will pave the way for the introduction of the National Airports Authority. The introduction of separate airport and airway charges, for which this Bill provides the machinery, will involve charges related to the use made by operators of broad categories of airport and airway facilities and services. These charges will replace the existing single charge for the use of airport and airway facilities. Their precise form will, of course, be subject to detailed discussion with the aviation industry and can only be finalised after the Government has considered the findings of the Bosch inquiry which is due to report by the end of October. Once determined, the schedules of charges will be detailed in regulations, rather than in the Act as at present, thus greatly simplifying the procedures for revising the charges in future. The principal purpose of introducing separate charges is to enable charges to more closely reflect the cost and use made of major airport and airway facilities in the various phases of a flight. Their introduction will, consequently, permit a more commercial approach to aviation investment decisions by enabling the identification of revenue associated with a particular facility or group of facilities and comparison with the capital and operating costs associated with such facilities. This action is of course a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of the National Airports Authority. The new charging arrangements are expected to be effective on a date to b.e proclaimed next financial year. Before this occurs there will of course be further extensive consultation with industry and other interested bodies .. The cost of administering the statutory lien arrangements will be absorbed within existing appropriations and it is estimated that there will be a once only increase in revenue of around $7.5m in 1984-85 arising from the introduction of the statutory lien and changes to the payment and penalty provisions. The new charging arrangements address the form rather than the level of changes and will not, of themselves, have any impact on Commonwealth revenues. It is estimated that the annual costs of administering the new separate airport and airway charging arrangements will be $1 m, some $400,000 more than the present arrangement. Computer hardware, software, and system development costs are estimated at $lm in 1984-85 and due to the ,need to operate both new and old charging systems for a three-month introductory period additional operating costs of approximately $300,000 will be incurred in 1984-85. I commend the Bill to the House. , Debate (on motion by Mr Spender) adjourned. NA  Morris, and read a first time.",106
32,Mr BEAZLEY,AIR NAVIGATION AMENDMENT BILL,"--,-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Air Navigation Act so as to broaden the Governmimt's power to cancel or suspend the international airline licences of foreign airlines operating to Australia. The proposed amendments have no financial impact. The Air Navigation Act currently limits the power to suspend or cancel a licence of a foreign operator to a situation where an airline has actually failed to comply' with a provision of the Act or the reguiations, or fails to conform to or comply with the terms or conditions of agreements or arrangements entered into with overseas countries. Firstly, this Bill will provide wider power to suspend or cancel international airline licences on safety grounds, which as I have indicated is currently limited to an actual breach of the Act or regulations. The Act does not presently provide for a situation where information to hand indicates that there is likely to be a breach of the Act or'regulations' which is going to affect safety. In the interest of preserving air safety in Australia the Government should have the power to act before the breach occurs. Another situation which can prejudice air safety is where an overseas aeronautical authority does riot make adequate provision to ensure that its airline or aircraft substantially comply with the standards, practices and procedures set out in the Chicago Convention and its annexes. This situation could arise as a result ,of a failure to set appropriate standards or a failure to carry out adequate surveillance to ensure that an airline is complying with appropriate standards. As members will appreciate Australia is dependent to a large degree on the role of relevant overseas authorities to ensure that their aircraft operate safely into and out of Australia. Secondly, the Bill provides for an amendment to the Air Navigation Act so as to enable the cancellation or suspensi-n of a licence of a foreign carrier where this is considered necessary or desirable to preserve or promote fair competition in international air transport services. At the moment the Government does not have the capability to cancel or, suspend a licence where an overseas government decides to withdraw the licence of or reduce the activity of an Australian carrier. If (No.2) 1984 these circumstances eventuated it would be im"" portant to be able to respond to this situation. I commend the Bill to the House.

33,Mr JOHN BROWN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Parramatta-Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce) (8.29)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1984 which is now before the House proposes amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1982. The Bill contains six schedules and is necessary to enact tariff changes which have been introduced into the Parliament in the 1984 autumn and Budget sittings by Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 5-10 (1984). The Bill also contains two amendments to sections of the Customs Tariff Act 1982 which have not previously been introduced into the Parliament. Some of the changes contained in the Bill relate to Budget decisions to alter the Customs tariff rates applying to certain beer, manufactured tobacco and aviation fuels. These changes are complementary to changes proposed to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. The relevant Customs tariff rates are varied by the same monetary amounts as the respective rates in the Excise Tariff Act. These changes were introduced by Customs Tariff Proposal No. 10 (1984) on Budget night. A number of amendments contained in the Bill arise from Government decisions on the following Industries Assistance Commission's reports: (1) Computer hardware and software; typewriters, calculating and other office machines; parts and accessories; recording media; and (2) Electric motors-interim report. Details of the tariff changes associated with these two reports are contained in the introduction speeches and summaries of alterations for Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 8 and 9 (l984)which were introduced into the House on 21 August 1984. Honourable members will also recall that details of other tariff changes contained in the Bill were outlined to the House at the time of introduction of Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 5 to 7 (1984), which were introduced on 5 April, 29 May and 21 August respectively. These changes relate, in the main, to implementation of government decisions in respect of: (1) The interim tariff arrangements for the period 30 May to 31 December 1984 decided upon by the Government in the context of' its motor vehicle industry assistance package; (2) The concessional and preferential tariff arrangements to apply to certain goods or to imports from certain countries and places; (3) The restoration of the level of assistance intended for certain locally manufactured goods following rulings handed down by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or a court; (4) A number of technical or administrative amendments to reflect correctly the intention, scope or wording of various provisions of the Customs Tariff Act, and (5) The further simplification of the Customs Tariff Act. The Bill also contains two changes to sections of the Customs Tariff Act which have not previously been introduced into the Parliament. The first of these changes relates to an amendment to sub-section 13 (4) to ensure that reference to phasing rates of duty in relation to paragraph (a) of that sub-section is made only in respect of tariff classifications in Schedule 3 to the Act. This change merely corrects a drafting oversight in the Act. Secondly, the Bill includes amendments to sub-sections 26A (2) and 26A (3) of the Customs Tariff Act. These amendments are technical in nature and are made in order to clarify, for the purposes of the indexation of certain amounts of Customs duty, that substitution of amounts of Customs duty shall occur on a particular day. The changes in the Bill which emanate from the . Government's Budget decisions are complementary to changes made in a budgetary context in respect of the Excise Tariff Act. The combined financial impact of these measures is contained in statement No.4 of Budget Paper No.1. In regard to the decision on the Industries Assistance Commission report. on computer hardware, et cetera, it is not possible to provide meaningful estimates of the Customs revenue forgone. Rapid changes in the nature of products; demand and sourcing for many of the goods covered by the decision create difficulties in predicting the composition and level of imports and thereby ca1culating duty collection changes. A particular complication with the computer decision involved the removal of duties on computer software. It is not possible to determine the proportion of imports that were previously attracting duties. It is also not possible to determine with any degree of accu"" racy the financial impact of the Customs .duty change in the decision on the lAC interim report on electric motors. Other amendments contained in the Bill are not expected to have a significant financial impact. There are no additional significant administrative costs associated with the Bill. A summary of amendments for each Schedule of the Bill has been prepared and copies are available from the Tables Office. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Spender) adjourned. CUSTOMS TARIFF (COAL EXPORT DUTY) AMENDMENT BILL 1984 BiIl presented by Mr John Brown, and read a first time. Second Reading",109
34,Mr JOHN BROWN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Parramatta-Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce) (8.33)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes to amend the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Act 1975 to provide'an exemption from the payment of the export duty under that Act on high quality coking coal produced from certain open-cut mines if speCified quantities of underground coal from those mines is included in production for export. The Government's decision t,o exempt this coal from the $3.50 per tonne export duty on and from 28 May 1984 was announced by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Walsh) on 29 May 1984. The Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Act was introduced in 1975 because the government of the day wished to channel to the community a proportion of the windfall profits then being made by the coal export producers. The duty arrangements have been varied on a number of occasions to the extent that the only coal now dutiable is high quality coking coal mined from depths no greater than 60 metres in open-cut mines in production before 1 July 1980. In practice duty is currently paid only on production from eight mines in Queensland. The Governmentconsiders that the most desirable course is to incorporate the coal export duty into a Commonwealth-State resource rent tax package. H9wyver, we recognise that this may not be practicable in the immediate future. In an international market characterised by a substantial over-supply of coking coal, the intense competition for available markets will continue for some time to come. Producers have been forced to accept price reductions and a substantial upturn is unlikely in the immediate future. Against this background, in 1983 the Government received representations from CSR Ltd and Thiess Dampier Mitsui for relief from the export duty on production from the Moura and South Blackwater mines located in the Bowen Basin in Queensland. Both mines must blend significant quantities of higher quality coal from their undergound operations with coal from their open-cuts in order to obtain product of a quality suitable to meet export contract specifications. The addition of higher cost underground product to their opencut coal increased costs to the point where the imposition of the export duty on the open-cut coal in the exported product was having a significant impact on the rate of return to the producers. In order to assist the viability of these operations, the Government has decided to exempt from duty open-cut production in the situation where mines are, and have been, dependent on significant underground operations to maintain coal quality. The Government considers that the maintenance of underground operations in the Bowen Basin will retain skills which will ultima-ely be of benefit to the industry as a whole in that region. It also demonstrates the Government's concern to assist employment security in the industry in the present difficult international mark-ting environment. Financial Impact Statement It is estimated that this exemption will mean an annual los8to the revenue of less than $ 10m. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Spender) adjourned.

35,Mr JOHN BROWN,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Parramatta-Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce) (8.37)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate into that Act the excise alterations introduced during the winter recess and tabled in the Parliament on 21 August 1984 and the excise alterations emanating ftom the 1984-85 Budget. On 18 April this year new taxation initiatives were announced to apply to the petroleum sector from 1 July 1984. One of the initiatives Was the introduction of an excise on crude oil produced from areas discovered after 17 September 1975, called 'new oil'. By way of background I should mention that the taxation arrangements on crude oil produced from areas discovered on or before 17 September 1975, called 'old oil', were modified from 1 July 1983 to correct a number of anomalies. The excise scale was restructured so that increased production from each prescribed production area, as defined in the excise by-laws, attracted progressively higher rates of excise. In formulating the policy on 'new oil' the Government had to find a reasonable balance between the interests of the community as a whole and those of the oil exploration companies who must be adequately rewarded if they are to continue in the high risk activity of oil exploration. Several generous concessions have therefore been made in the 'new oil' excise scale compared to the scale applicable to 'old oil'. There is an annual excise free allowance of 500 megalitres, approximately 3.1 million barrels, exempting the maJority of on-shore fields from any levy at all. Also, the 'new oil' excise scale imposes excise rates far below those imposed on 'old oil'. The rate on 'new oil' at the beginning of the 'new oil' scale is 10 per cent compared to 80 per cent for the same level of 'old oil' production, while the top rate is 35 per cent for 'new oil' compared to 87 per cent for 'old oil'. The excise payments for all prescribed production areas in relation to 'old' and 'new' oil are determined by applying the excise scale to the ruling government determined import parity price for Bass Strait crude oil. The modest rates for 'new oil', which are set out in clause 7 of the reflect the Government's desire to encourage and maintain exploration and development incentives in the oil industry. Clause 4 of the Bill proposes . clarify the procedure for imposition of duty on 'new' and 'old' oil. The practice. has been to back-allocate elements in a crude oil mixture through a mass balance procedure to the production areas from where they were derived. Excise duty is then determined for each production area by applying the excise scale accordingly. Legal advice has been given that the current legislation might not extend to the 'back allocation' of all elements in a crude oil mixture. This method of imposing duty on crud.e oil production accords with the GovernmenCs intention when the modified arrangements were introduced from 1 July 1983. For this reason the provisions of clause 4 are proposed to operate retrospectively from that date. The retrospective operation of this provision will not impose any additionalliabilities upon producers. In keeping with previous practice, on 27 June 1984 the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Walsh) announced a revision in the excise rate applying to naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas-LPG-from 1 July 1984. As in past determinations, the excise rate has been calculated using a weighted export and domestic LPG price over the preceding six months. The reduction in the excise rate by $12.27 per kilolitre to $36.96 per kilolitre as contained clause 9 of the Bill, reflects the current soft state of the world export market for LPG. The provisions in clause 8 of the Bill remove the excise on grape spirit for fortifying wine with effect from 8 p.m. standard time on 22 June 1984 as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on the same date. Re-introduction of the duty on this spirit at a rate of $2.61 per litre was announced in the 1983-84 Budget. The rate was subsequently reduced to $1.50 per litre with effect from 23 August 1983. The Treasurer, in his speech on the 1984-85 Budget, announced that, with the introduction of the general sales tax on wine and alcoholic.cider and to avoid double taxation on fortified wines, excise paid in 1983-84 on fortifying spirit will be refunded in full. Necessary amendments have been made to the Excise Regulations to allow the refunds to be paid and persons who believe they are entitled to a refund should submit their applications to the Collector of Customs in their State as soon as possible and no later than 30 June 1985. With effect from 18 july 1984 the number of decimal places in the excise rate for beer was Bill, increased from two to five. This change, whiCh is set out in clause 10 of the Bill, follows representations by the brewing industry that the excise to duty rate on beer had suffered repeated roundings upward as a result of the applicationÂ· of indexation. The Government believes that the increase in the number of decimal places will aJleviate this problem. The other provision in clause 10 of the Bill omits on and from 18 July 1984, the requirement that Australian gin must be made only from grape, grain or fruit spirit. A similar provision relating to imported gin was removed frorti 1 January 1983. The removal of this requirementÂ·is consequential upon a review of wines and spirits legislation, conducted by the National Health and Medical Research Council in conjunction with Commonwealth Government departments. That review identified that this imposition is outdated and results in unnecessary costs on the industry. I now turn to the excise alterations emanating from the 1984-85 Budget. The provisions of clause 11Â· of the Bill operate at 8 p.m. on Budget night and alter, as a consequence of the new taxing arrangements for beer, the definition of beer in the Excise Tariff Act and introduce new excise rates which vary according to the alcoholic strength of beer. The other changes in this clause increase the excise duties on tobacco, aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene. The increase in the tobacco excise represents a further step towards aligning in the excise on that product with that applying to cigarettes and cigars. Increases in the excise of the fuels are made as a cost recovery measure. Finally, the provisions of clause 5 of the Bill modify, as announced by the Treasurer on Budget night, the arrangements for six-monthly indexation of excise duty rates,except for crude oil and LPG, so that consumer price index decreases are taken into account in a similar manner to the treatment of pensions and benefits under the Social Security Act. ' . Financial Impact Statement In 1984-85 the introduction of the excise on 'new oil' is expected to yield about $317m in revenue and the lower LPG excise is expected to reduce Commonwealth revenue fromÂ· LPG excise by approximately $24m to about $70m. Refunds of excise on fortifying spirit between 21 AuguSt 1983 and 22 June 1984 are expected to amount to $5m- The reduction in the excise on low alcohol beers is expected to reduce Commonwealth revenue on beer by approximately $ 10m in 1984-85 and $12m in a full year. Increases in the excise on tobacco, aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene are expected to yield about $7m in revenue in 1984-85 and $8m in a full year. The modification of the indexation arrangements, in line with pensions and. benefits, is expected to result in a decrease in excise revenue of approximately $4m in 1984-85. However, it is important that 1 mention that the nature of the last measure is such that a reIiable estimate cannot be provided. I commend the Bill to the House.

'STATUTE LAW (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL (No.2) 1984 Bill presented by Mr Duffy, and read a first time; ,- Second Reading , Mr DUFFY '(Holt-Minister for Communications) (8.47)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill continues the practice of introducing an omnibus Bill into each sitting of the Parliament to make a large number of non-contentious amendments. Not every amendment being proposed by this Bill requires detailed reasons for the change; this will be self-evident from the provision itself, or the detailed explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. 1 propose to confine my comments to addressing the more substantial changes to some of the various Acts which are amended by this Bill. Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 Amendments to this Act permit the nonAboriginal spouse of an Aboriginal to become a full member of an Aboriginal corporation; remove from the Act all restriction on the capacity of an Aboriginal corporation to dispose of real or personal property; and permit the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations some discretion in the type of financial reports he may accept as satisfying the annual financial reporting responsibilities of Aboriginal Corporations. The proposed amendment to section 71 of the Act will enable the Australian Archives to levy charges for services provided in relation to records of.certain Commonwealth institutjons held by the Archives in accordance with established policy that such organisation should be provided services on a cost recovery basis. Commonwealth Teaching Service Act 1972 The amendments, consequential upon the Government's Public Service reforms, remove the involvement of the Public. Service Board in the creation, abolition, relocation or reclassification of offices in the Commonwealth Teaching Service which become the responsibility of the Commonwealth Teaching Service itself. Copyright Act 1968 The amendments of the Copyright Act 1968 make a number of minor adjustments to the provisions introduced by the Copyright Amendment Act 1980. The 1980 Act followed the recommendations of the Copyright Law Committee on Reprographic Reproduction-the 'Franki' Committee. Meetings convened by the Attorney General's Department with representatives of copyright owners organisations, educational institutions and libraries monitored the operation of the 1980 amendments and identified certain defects in the provisions dealing with photocopying by libraries and educational institutions. None of the proposed amendments makes a fundamental change to the scheme of the 1980 Act. Customs Act 1901 The amendment of this Act extends its regulation making power to include the amount of any remission, reb-te or refund of Customs duty. Excise Act 1901 The amendment of this Act extends the regulation making power to include the amount of any remission, rebate or refund ,of duty. Another amendment authorises goods to be moved, altered or interfered with, prior to entry for home consumption, if the goods are used in the manufacture of other excisable goods. Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 The proposed amendments require the Merit Protection and Review Agency to notify Parliament of certain extensions to its jurisdiction and to include in its annual report a list of all bodies over which it has jurisdiction. National Crime Authority Act 1984 The amendments to this Act fall into two main Archives Act 1983 categories: First, fine-tuning adjustments following the very large number of amendments to the Bill passed in the Senate, particularly the amendment removing the requirement for the InterGovernmental Committee's approval of the Commonwealth reference to the Authority. Secondly, the amendments complement the 'underpinning' State legislation. Amendments included in this latter group: Give limited jurisdiction to a State Supreme Court to hear appeals where the Authority is acting only under a reference from the State; prevent 'double jeopardy', that is, prevent person being punished twice for the same matter, under both Commonwealth and State Acts; and make it clear that a State law may confer powers, functions or duties on the Federal Court of Australia where these are also conferred by the Commonwealth Act. Overseas Telecommunication Act 1946 The Overseas Telecommunications Act 1946 is being amended irt order to provide for an increase in the number of Commissioners from five to seven and an increase in the term of appointment from three years to five years. The Commission is also being restructured to include as members of departmental officer, a Commissioner to represent officers and employees of the Commission, and the Managing Director. The Act has been redrafted in relation to the rights and obligations of the Commissioners; this brings the Commission into line with the precedents set by the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission. Patents Act 1952 The proposed amendments of the Patents Act 1952 provide for the preparation of abstracts of specifications and creates a simplified means of recognising amendments made to the text of the Patent Co-operation Treaty and Regulations. Further amendments provide for the Act to recognise certaiJ;l changes which may be made to international applications lodged under the provisions of the Patent Co-operation Treaty. Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 The Act provides that proceedings for the prosecution of a person may be instituted only with the consent in writing of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The proposed amendment enables the director of Public Prosecutions to delegate his power of consent. Public Service Act 1922 The various amendments proposed extend the period for which a person may act as a secretary to a department to 12 months; ensure the power to select officers for the temporary performance of the duties of another office; extend the penalties for the offence of personation at examinations and tests; repeal redundant section 95 of the Act; and amend the definition of 'Commonwealth authority' to reflect changes in the companies legislation. Public Service Reform Act 1984 Amendments proposed put beyond doubt a proa vision that part-time offices may not be implemented without the consent of the officer holding the office and amend a definition of 'promotion' to include certain movements between offices which have not been provided for., Trade Practices Act 1974 A new section65A is to be inserted in the Trade Practices Act 1974 to clarify the application of certain of the consumer protection provisions of that Act to the media and other persons who carry on business of providing information. Recent decisions of the Federal Court have suggested that a newspaper publisher may be taken to have engaged in conduct that is misleading o'r deceptive for the purposes of section 52 of the TritdePractices Act if the newspaper contains inaccurate information. :t '_i The Government recognises the need to maintain a vigorous, free Press, as well as an effective and enforceable Trade Practices Act. In doing so, the Government recognises that, whilst the problem may have been highlighted by a defamation action, similar considerations apply in respect of actions for negligent mis-statement and actions for injurious falsehood. The Government also recognises that the difficulties in this area are experienced not only by the main newspaper, magazine and television publishers, but also by a wide range of other people who provide information. New section 65A will operate to exempt the media and other persons who engage in businesses of providing information from the operation of those provisions of Division 1 of Part V of the Trade Practices Act which could inhibit activities relating to the provision of news and other information. The exemption is not available, however, in respect of publication of information relating to goods, services or land of a kind supplied by the information relating to goods, services or' land where the publication is made pursuant to acontract, arrangement or understanding with a person who supplies goods, services or land, of that kind or with a body corporate related to a body corporate that supplies such goods, services or land. These provisions ensure that information providers are not exempt from the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act in respect of the provision of information where they have what might be regarded as a commercial interest in the content of the information. In such cases, information providers must take the same responsibility for the accuracy of information as any other person who publishes information in trade or commerce. This can occur, for example, where a ,newspaper has agreed to publish a 'news' item about a product in exchange for the product supplier taking out paid advertising in that pUblication. The insertion of a new section 79A is to correct a major gap between the imposition and endorsement of a criminal sanctions of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Following the decision of the High Court of Australia in March 1984 in Thomas v Ducret, 1984 ATPR 40-445 the criminal provisions of the Act are, in certain circumstances, unenforceable against individuals because they depend upon the existence of applicable State and Territory legislation. The amendment will provide a uniform system of enforcement of fines imposed under the Act. Debate (on motion by Mr Moore) adjourned.

There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",115
37,Mr MOORE,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"1 notice the House is filling up for another robust debate on bounty and tariff affairs so I will rapidly come to the point. The Opposition will move an amendment to the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill 1984 and to the Bounty (Electric Motors) Bill at the Committee stage of the debate. The Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill brings into focus the Australian agricultural scene in which tractor manufacturers in Australia have been subject to very extensive import penetration in the last few years, so much so that the stock on hand held by the Australian manufacturer and those who are import orientated has reached very extensive levels. This matter has been referred to the Industries Assistance Commission which has come up with a recommendation. Clearly the Government has decided to extend the temporary bounty until such time as the lAC's final report is received at the end of the year. By doing this the Government h-s shown that it does not agree with the short term report of the lAC. However, the Govermnent has taken note of the market conditions and the electoral climate. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would recognise, of course, that the predominant manufacturer and assembler of tractors in Australia, Chamberlain John Deere Pty Ltd, is based in Western Australia. There are problems in the game insofar as fully made up tractors which come to Australia, because of the arrangements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are not subject to the overall 2 per cent tariff charge. 1984] However, the parts that are used in the manufacture or assembly in Australia are subject to the 2 Second Reading per cent charge. That charge can be picked up by the importers and is something to which, I think, we ought to address ourselves. I know other speakers here tonight, such as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) who claim special interest in this matter, have made representations. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) has a long history of agricultural association and knows which end of the tractor starts. These honourable members have drawn to my attention the problems of overstocking and the 2 per cent charge. I do not think there is anyone in the House tonight-the House is so well attended-who would not be aware of the problems of International Harvester Australia Ltd and MasseyFerguson (Australia) Ltd. There are also some problems with imports from Russia. This has caused an enormous amount of comment in the agricultural sector. There are lots of users of tors throughout Australia who have been concerned about the general product and the consistency of its supply. Because of that members of the Opposition have taken a special interest in this matter and will be moving an amendment to this Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would readily recognise a number of Bills are associated with this measure. The first one is the Bounty (Tractor Cabs) Amendment Bill. The honourable member for Wannon has a particular interest in this legislation because the principal Australian producer of cabs for tractors is located at Ararat which, at the moment, is part of his electorate. As a matter of history the tractors that were originally brought to Australia had none of the sophisticated comfort that is now associated with them. It was the innovation of the manufacturer in the honourable member's electorate which brought about cabs which were air conditioned and had the best communications systems in the world. Mr Hawker-The best in the world.",115
38,Mr MOORE,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"They are the best in Australia; the best in the world. Now the rest of the world has adopted the manufacturer's concern and most tractors which come to Australia these days come with a cab. Thus import penetration in the honourable member's electorate has been quite strong. No matter what the bounty paid here I strongly suspect that A. F. Gason Pty Ltd will have a substantial problem in a market which is heavily oversupplied with imports and meets intensive competition from that source. The Bounty (Computers) Bill is designed to replace the existing bounty with a newbounty. It repeals the existing situation and replaces it with a bounty which is more wide-ranging. The Opposition does not oppose that approach at all. However, the Bill gives a 25 per cent value added bounty to the computer industry in Australia. This bounty in the hardware area to which it did not apply before now applies particularly to the uSe of computers within equipment. That enables the development of microchips and microcircuits which are very important in relation to development in this area and adds to the software which is associated with the development of hardware in Australia. David Hartley Computer Australia Pty Ltd is situated in my electorate. It was one of the first computer groups in Australia to develop very successfully software and programming. In the last couple of years it has applied itself to the production of computer hardware. It is an enortracmously competitive area. I know it competes not only in Australia but also internationally. As a result the Opposition in no way opposes this proposition. I understand that industry regards it as a very useful addition. Finally, I turn to the Bounty (Electric Motors) Bill which is the result of an interim report from the lAC which has been released while we await its final report and from that a final determination from the Government. One of the developing trends had been that industries which had immediate problems were referred to the Temporary Assistance Authority. Now, increasingly, the Government is seeking reports from the lAC on a short term or interim basis while it awaits the outcome of a long term report. In this case the Government has brought up a package which gives $14 per unit and imposes a 5 per cent tariff. In Australia electric motor production is broken up between the integral motors and the fractional motors. There has been intensive competition in the two areas, particularly the integral motor area. I am sure that the Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr John Brown) would know that the integral motor has a power of one horse power or more whereas the fractional motor has a power of less than one horse power. Competition has not been as great with the fractional motor. The manufacturers of integral motors-principally ASEA, which is based in Melbourne but is a wholly owned Swedish company-have drawn particular assistance. They have'made a pretty substantial contribution to the electric motor industry in Australia. There are a number of other producers, including Betts, Brooks, Campbell and Johnson, CMG, Websters and Simpsons. Simpsons would, of course, be recogn:ised as a company that uses those motors in its domestic products within Australia. The position of the fractional motors is unchanged. The principal Australian producer of those motors is Betts. The.fractional motor industry has not suffered the degree of competition experienced by the integral motor industry. Those types of electrical motors are alternating current motors, three-phase and, as the honourable member for Wannon would know, they have a squirrel cage. I know of the interest people have in this matter. The Opposition will not oppose that Bill. The outcome of my review is that I shall now move an amendment with respect to the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill. The Opposition will later move in Committee an amendment to the Bounty (Tractor Cabs) Amendment Bill. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that, in the interests of equity and of economic efficiency(I) existing anomalies in relation to duties on diesel - engines for tractors and to the application of the bounty for Australian manufactured, or substantially manufactured, agricultural wheeled tractors should .be resolved by the removal of the 2% duty on diesel engines imported for incorporation in Australian manufactured, or substantially manufactured, tractors, until such time as Australia's commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade no longer require the imposition of duty on the .importation into Australia of diesel engines already installed in completely built up tractors, and that thereafter the matter should be re-considered, and (2) until such time as the Government makes a final decision on the long term future arrangements for the agricultural wheeled tractor industry in Australia, the existing bounty should be extended to all agricultural wheeled tractors manufactured, or substantially manufactured, in Australia '. Mr Hawker-I secondlhe amendment.",116
39,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"Newcastle) (9.12)Tonight we are dealing in a cognate debate with five separate pieces of legislation. The Bills have been linked because they are generally involved in bounty procedures and other forms of industry assistance. Some aspects about tonight's legislation are quite pioneering. It is important that the House recognises the significance of the legislation before us. I think the legislation warrants much more comment than has been given to it so far. The fact is that, since the 1950s, when we established our import replacement policy inÂ· a world consisting of a large number of closed economies, import replacement was perhaps a viable option for Australia. Certainly it did not last very long as a viable option and, for the past 15 or so years, we have not shown the capacity to adapt and adjust to the rest of the world. That means that we have a system of industry encouragement iUiddevelopment incentives which do not relate because they apply to a very srriall market and volume andÂ· automatically induce high costs of production. As a part of that high-cost production, because of the imposition of tariffs, particularly on components, we have also high-cost exports. That means that not only are we not efficient in terms of internal costs but also we find it difficult to sell outside Australia the products that we manufacture. Tonight we are seeing perhaps one more nail in the coffin of import replacements. The sooner this country moves away from that concept - nto a concept of industry development and product development the better. It is important that we understand that aspect a bit more because during the past 18 months there has been.a number of acti-iÂ­ ties in that area. On coming to government .in March 1983 we discovered that Australian industry was experiencing a major decline with no - ign of any .change. The clear conclusion was that, unless there were significant changes of policy and direction, our manufacturing industries would disappear almost completely. Since then, there has been a number of actions which are important and relevant. Perhaps the first was the steel plan which introduced bounties for that industry. That plan is now seen to Â·be working effectively, sustaining the industry so that the prospects for its recovery, and perhaps even growth; are the healthiest they have been for some years. There has alsoÂ· been Ii significant improvement in the quality of steel in Australia. 1 suggest that the auto industry has done something similar in the sense of trying to encourage a more efficient, effective industry, which may be able, once again, to look towards exporting products made by Australians. At the same time, find almost in parallel, we,: arworking in another area with the Australian Industry Development Corporation, which has had a fairly massive increase in its borrowing capacity and its funding, in an attempt to encourage - nd direct the Corpdration to work with Australian industry in product development and establishing and re-establishing industries that were previously either dormant or not very effective. Last year the venture capital decisions, and the subsequent legislation to encourage the creation of a venture capital market in Australia, formed an important part of the industrial background. There has, in fact, been a number of different inc itiatives, all aimed at a similar objective; that is, to bring Australia back into the world manufacturing scene, a scene from which we have increasingly been missing in recent years. Two key. Bjlls in this package of Bills-the Bounty (Computers) Bill and the Automatic Data Processing Equipment Bounty Amendment Bill (No. 2)-impose a bounty on computers, as was indicated by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). However, these Bills do something remarkably different as welL Because of the import replacement mentality, we saw the bounty as a thing only for Australia. In other words, if a thing is made and sold in Australia, the bounty is applicable, if it is sold overseas, it is not, thereby making a lower cost product for Australia and, automatically', a higher cost product to sell on the overseas market. For the first time there has been a . massive breakthrough in that thinking. The bounty we are speaking of now is applicable overseas as well. The bounty is applicable also to components and assemblies. At the same time, by Australia not applying tariffs to imported components the hardware side of the Australian computer industry can import some key components, design and manufacture others, assemble the components and export the finished product, receiving the bounty on all of the Australian costs. That measure will start to put Australia back into competition in an industry that has an enormous future. To think of it another way, the bounty must be seen as a production incentive. We are trying to get people to generate production in areas where growth is possible. The hardware industry is certainly one in which there is a capacity for enormous growth. However, the possibilities for growth do not lie solely in the Australian market. Therefore, if we are serious about the industry we must give it the capacity to reflect that growth on the world markets. I do not doubt that within the next two or three years-certainly within five years-we shall start to see many more Australian computer hardware components sold and used overseas. That could happen with the personal computeI' of IBM, control equipment for hydraulics and a whole range of other areas. The fact is that this legislation will, for the first time, give our companies a chance to be involved in exporting high-skilled Australian labour, highskilled Australian production and high-skilled Australian design. The historical separation of hard and soft computer products is now being broken. Computer hardware production was always seen as something we should support; computer software production, which is much more labour intensive, was not seen to be something that we should support. This legislation makes both hardware and software products to which a bounty applies. I think the bounty also applies to exports. The computer software industry now has a major challenge before it. It has now been given thepotential, the incentives and the assistance to get out into the world market and show that Australians can do those things. I have no doubt about that capacity. In recent days there has been a great deal of conjecture about the level of funding from this Government for research and technology. It has been suggested-and it is a remarkably obscure argument-that somehow research is a thing in isolation, something separate. The fact is that in Australia the research industry is inadequate, not because there are insufficient funds but because there is an insufficient base to research into. We design products which we cannot manufacture, produce, use or export. The last oqe and a half years have seen from this Government the greatest injection of incentives into design, research and development in Australia's history. I have mentioned already the AIDC report ,and I mention the report of the Espie High Technology and Financing Committee. In this legislation we are looking at expected expenditure of $7mÂ· in that . area alone in the next couple of years. If successful, that figure will get much greater, because that investment by the Australian Government and the Australian people is investment in design and research in the real world, in real products and in a real industrial marketplace and will generate private investment. That is what it should be about. This quarantining of research into some obscure, separate exercise has been.a disaster for this country. Certainly our Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Barry Jones) and our Minister for Industry and Commerce (Senator Button), by their linkage on the communications inquiry, . on the AIDC and on the Espie venture capital area, have shown that we understand that to get Australia's brainpower i- research working'we have to have a market for it to work into. What we are doing here is saying that we inust,cr.eate that market. This legislation will go an enormous distance"" towardsÂ· generating a homegrown, strong and competitive computer hardware and, software market at a variety of levels. That market capacity will then be the object and the generator of AustralianÂ· research and design. When we talk about our commitment, we should ensure that We are not committed to pie in the sky, to fantasies or to fairyland stuff but are committed to getting Australians making things and doing things. We want research that produces results. I suggest that this one piece of legislation will do more than Was done by the previous Government in its last two or three years. In three or four years time. I might ask honourable members opposite, who will still be opposite, to recall those words and to see what has flowed from this piece of legislation. I commend the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Cabinet. The export bounty on hardware and software is a major breakthrough of enormous importance. I recognise that. The computer industry recognises it. I do not think the Opposition has yet, but I am sure that it will and in the months and years ahead will see this piece of legislation as a major departure point. I would like to make sure that that is marked and noted because it will be referred to again in the months and years ahead. I commend the legislation to the House. I had great pride in taking part in the debateon it.",117
40,Mr HAWKER,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"1 second the amendment moved by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) to the motion for the second reading of the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill. I begin by saying how much I support the concept of a bounty. One of the great problems in Australia over the past few decades has been the excessive use of tariffs. Tariffs unfortunately are a hidden tax borne mostly by exporters. If the real cost of tariffs was made more public and the general population became more aware of it, I think there would be a lot closer scrutiny of the way tariffs have been handed out fairly indiscriminately in the past few decades. A bounty has the advantage that it is scrutinised very closely. It has to come each year through the Budget Papers, which gives everyone a chance to see how much assistance an industry is getting. Having said that, I am not denying that these industries are deserving of the bounties. I think it important that, when an industry deserves a bounty, a government is prepared to give it one. I also acknowledge that the importance of giving a bounty is that it is not a right but something that is in place hopefully for a relatively short but known period and, if it is going to be taken off, it will be phased out over an amount of time sufficient for those involved not to be harmed by its removal. The Bills in this package that I want to mention are the Bounty (Tractor Cabs) Amendment Bill and the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill. As the honourable member for Ryan has already mentioned, the only manufacturer of tractor cabs in Australia is in my electorate at Ararat, namely, A. F. Gason Pty Ltd. As I stated' in this chamber on 12 October last year, this manufacturer has built a very enviable record. It . has set about building quality cabs which will stand up anywhere in the world as excellent value for money and excellent quality. Gasons also have excellent backup. It is an example of a decenc tralised industry that has succeeded; or has done so until recently. Unfortunately the drought made life fairly difficult for the firm and, partly as a result of that and partly as a result of problems I will come to in a minute, it has become more diversified and has moved into other areas of agricultural equipment manufacture and assembly. The real problem Gasons is facing is that most tractors imported into Australia now come in with a cab. There is an import duty on cabs but not on cabs that come in on tractors. The problem' that Gasons is now facing is that most tractors coming in have these cabs and are being imported not because they are better or necessarily cheaper but in many cases because the manufacturers ' overseas have felt the downturn in manufacture and sales and have set about employing their staff, . quite understandably, on manufacturing cabs. The market is shrinking, and that is not because of Gasons quality or competitiveness .. In passing I might just mention some of the cost disadvantages that Gasons face compared with, say, its United States of America counterpart in the manufacture of tractor cabs. These figures are quite interesting. Gasons found that glass in Australia is 94 per cent more expensive than in the United States. It found that steel in Australia is nearly 40 per cent more expensive than steel in the United States. It found that paint is a massive 137 per cent more expensive. One can see that some of the basic'materials used in the manufacture of a tractor cab in Australia are considerably more expensive than in the United States. One of the difficulties facing the Australian manufacturer is the high cost of materials. A further difficulty is the very limited opportunities for export. One of the few potential markets is New Zealand, but I understand from the manufacturer that there are import restrictioris. This is one point that I hope the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr John Brown), who is sitting opposite, might look into, because if there is a chance for export there I think we should try to capitalise on it. Getting back to the Bill, I support the extension of the bounty to tractor cabs and point out again to the House that this is a clear case of an efficient manufacturer which can produce a competitive product but which unfortunately has found that it is not a question of price of quality but the question of a shrinking market. Furthermore, I think that if the industry is to survive in any form this assistance will have to be continued for some ' time. The Industries Assistance Commission hasÂ· recognised this in its report dated 18 June 1984 on agricultural wheeled tractors and certain parts. The Government has introduced this bounty amendment Bill for tractor cabs as an interim measure, pending its final decision on the lAC. hearing. It might also be noted in passing that at the lAC hearing Gasons submitted that it supports a manufacturing staff of 195 people and that the flow-on would create a further 350 jobs, which in a town like Ararat is extremely importc ant. I support the Bill on tractor cab bounties and urge the Government to reach a decision to accept the lAC report as soon as it reasonably can. I turn to the amendment to the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill. In supporting the amendment-I am sure the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is about to do the same-I would like to touch briefly on the problems of manufacturers of large tractors. In my electorate, at Hamilton we have Waltanna, which has built up an enviable record in the building of large tractors, virtually a custom job each time. That company has been reasonably successful but, in common with other smaUmanufacturers of large tractors, it is at a. twofold qisadvantage and has trouble in remaining viable. Firstly, it faces imports of tractors such as Steiger and Versatile-I am referring to the large tractors of 200 kilowatt and. upwards-that attract no duty, except in regard to tyres,radios and air-conditioning. The second problem that faces manufacturers of large tractors and not so large tractors is a 2 per cent import duty, on engines, transmissions and axle housings. Furthermore, there are higher duties of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on other fabricated parts such as steel plates. I remind the House that this compares with imported large tractors which bear no duty whatever. Ariother problem faced by the tractor manufacturers in this country is that, although. the bounty is on a sliding scale up to 150 kilowatts, after that there is a flat rate per unit. In other words, the dollar amount for a bounty for a tractor of 150 kilowatts. is the same as that for a 300-kilowatt tractor. Manufacturers of larger tractors are not given full consideration for the additional cost of building the tractor. As a result a large part of the bounty goes to counter the tariff on the higher value of the components used in these tractors, such as engines. It is simply a case of taking it out of one pocket and putting it into the other. If I may return to Waltanna, thai company at present employs 15 people but, given the right climate and the right encouragement, it haspotential toÂ· expand. I support the extension of 'the bounty, but go further and support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Ryan. The amendment mainly seeks to remove existing anomalies relating to duties on diesel engines on traCtors and to the application of the bounty to substantially Australian manufactured agricul-: tural, wheeled tractors. The problem that must b,e resolved relates to the 2 per cent duty on these engines and the amendment seeks to examine this whole area to see what can be resolved. I call on, the Government to take all necessary steps to compensate these manufacturers fully. for the duty on imported parts or, failing that, the Government should consider removing the duty bec\luse as I have said, it is taking nlOney out of one pocket and putting it in the. other. Accordr ingly call on the Government to accyp- this reasonable amendment and to examine ways of assisting these industries which are employing people in Australia. These industries Which started off in the last couple of decades llave proved they, can succeed and, be competitive. I. commend the amendment.",119
41,Mr BRUMBY,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"1 support the five Bills now before the House, and I particularly address my comments in the first instance to the Automatic Data Processing Equipment Bounty Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Bounty (Computers) Bill. Before I address any specific remarks to those Bills, I would like to provide a little relevant background material to the development of the computer industry in Australia. Thehidustry was developed here shOrtly Â·after the Second World War and its evolution has beencharacterised by a rapid technological change and the development of new products. In slightly more than 30 years the industry has progressed through four computer generations, and large scale research and development is now being carried out on fifth generation systems. The industry was initially established to service' the demands of government and other public sector institutions; However, advances in technology and new developmentsin hardware and software have led to the increasing use of computers in the private-sector. More recently advances in microelectronicS have been led to products being developed for the personal computer market. . . , , In a global sense the influence of governments' on the development of the computerindustry has, been significant. This influence has been exercised, both through acquisition policies inv,Olyingmassive purchases of equipment and through tp.e ildministrative and legal framework genera-ly. Fo).' "" example,in the United States of Amenc\,\,the Federal Government is by far the largest buyer of ' computers' and the only customer.possessillg sufficient' market power to force substantial changes in contract terms or conduct patterns. Governments also usually provide research and development funds in the computer field as well as generally serving as the primary market for the largest class of computers and those embodying the most advanced concepts. Fundamental to the role of the computer industry is the crucial part played by microelectronic componentry. Over the last three. decades the world electronics industry has been revolutionised by these advances in componentry. The most important of these has been in the field of microelectronics. Although the first microelectronic components were not developed until the late 1950s, the foundations of these developments were laid in 1947 when the first solid state electronic device, the transistor, was developed as a replacement for the vacuum tube valve. The fragile construction of valves, their considerable power consumption and heat radiation, as well as their overall unreliability, had until then constrained the types of applications to which electronics could be appli-d. For example, .the development of the newly eme,rging computer industry was particuhuly constrained by the inadequacies of valve technology. Transistors, of course, were, much smaller than valves,they worked faster, had fewer failures and emitted so little. heat that they could be packed closely together. They also required little power and, most importantly, they cQuld be produced relatively cheaply .. Transistor technology thus facilitated the application of electronics to a much wider. range of products .as Â·well as improving existing products, for instance, transistor radios and portable television receivers. The disadvantage of transistors in complex. applications, especially compllters, was that many thousands of.discrete devices had to be interconnected with wires. The development of printed circuit boards alleviated this problem to some degree, but the multitude of necessary interconnections redll-ed the reliability of the end product. This problem was overcome in the late 1950s with the introdl!ction of integrated circuits printed on small chips of silicon. It became possible to etch and interconnect a number of transistors on a single mult/wafer chip. With improvements to miniaturisatioo. techniques, low. cost, highly reliable integrated circuits were produced containing the)Jsands o,ftransistors and capable of performihgexceedingl- complex functions. However, these Were generally task specific so that their applicatiQri tended to be limited to areas where large production runs could be achieved; a good exafuple, being calculators. In the early 1970s, the versatility of these chips was improved dramatically by the production of the entire central processing unit of a computer on a single chip. Unlike earlier microelectronic' components, these microprocessor chips could be programmed by the user to perform a variety of information processing, communication and process control tasks. This development facilitated the exploitation of economies of scale associated with integrated circuit technology and thereby dramatically reduced unit production costs. The recent Industries Assistance Commission report on this industry noted that successive component developments have been used to categorise computer development into a number of generations. The report describes the first generation as vacuum tubes, the second as transistors, the third as integrated circuits and the fourth as large scale integration. However, as the report notes, it is somewhat misleading to talk of discrete generations because cost to performance ratios have steadily declined over time and there have been no distinct points between those four stages. The advent of the modern computer and its attendant innovations in the field of electronics have meant that an increasingly broad range of functions involving the processing, storage and retrieval of information can be carried out automatically. As a result, computers, often in the form of microprocessors, are being incorporated into an even greater range of office and mimufacturing equipment. It is in that sense that I refer particularly to the Bills relating to computers. It was on 7 February this year that the Industries Assistance Commission reported on the computer hardware, software and related goods industries. The basic thrust of a very lengthy lAC report was that it recommended bounty on a fairly narrow range of computer hardware. It was the view of the Government, however, that it should introduce bounty on a wide range of computer hardware sub-assemblies and electronic microcircuits. The Bills before the House give effect to that decision. In terms of the Australian context specifically and the consequences of this Bill, there were a large number-approximately 50-of small and innovative companies producing computer hardware in Australia. There are, of course, some larger Australian companies as well. To name just a few, some of those are Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd, Hartley David Computer Australasia Pty Ltd, Applied Technology Pty Ltd and Time Office Computers Pty Ltd. In addition, a number of multinational companies, such as IBM Australia Ltd with its personal computers at Wangaratta, Wang Computer Pty Ltd and Raytheon International Data Systems, produce computer hardware. There is also a rapidly growing number of companies producing computer based equipment to control other equipment or for inclusion in other equipment. Very pertinent examples in that area are the Johns Perry organisation, which produces computers to control lifts, and Australian N.C. Automation Pty Ltd, which produces computers for controlling machine and numerical control tools. All of those firms that I have described will benefit from the Bills before the House. Other areas which willÂ·benefit from the new arrangements include producers of electronic microcircuits such as AWA and the Philips company, producers of hybrid circuits such as Hybrid Electronics Australia Pty Ltd, Plessy and Philips; and producers of computer subassemblies, of which there are many. I think it is fair to say that the new arrangements incorporated in these Bills, including some tariff reductions in some areas, have been well received by the industry. I certainly commend the two computer Bills to the House. I wish to make some very brief comments on the other legislation befon: the House. The Bounty (Electronic Motors) Bill 1984 gives effect to the Government's decision which. we announced on 17 July 1984, to provide bounty assistance to the industry in Australia which produces a range of integral electric motors. The lAC is inquiring at the moment into the question of long term assistance for the industry which produces electric motors. Its final report, I understand, is due by April 1985. The lAC, in its interim report of 16 April 1984, recommended that no additional assistance be provided to the industry pending receipt of that longer term report. The Government agreed that no interim assistance was necessary for some of the smaller fractional motors but was of the view that without in.terim assistance, the major producers of integral motors-those with a power rating of 0.746 kilowatts and above-might Cease production altogether before completion of the lAC long term inquiry. That would clearly be an unsatisfactory state of affairs and, accordingly, Cabinet decided on an assistance package of a short term bounty and tariff increase on a range of integral electric motors. The tariff duty on those motors, particularly that falling within tariff item 85.01.2, has been increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent. That increase has applied from 18 July 1984. In terms of bounty, a specific bounty of $14 per motor will be payable on the production in Australia of those electric motors, subject to a number of provIsIons. Those bounty arrangements will remain in effect until the Government's decision in respect of the lAC report on longer term assistance is Â·announced: It should be said by way of general comment that the package in terms of electric motors should enable local production levels of integral motors to be maintained until the final lAC report is considered. The package that we have announced is primarily aimed at assisting the local industry but certainly recognises the requirement for fiscal restraint by the Government and the desirability of minimising any resultant cost pressures on users of electric motors. I must say that I found the contributions of the two previous speakers relating to the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill and the Bounty (Tractor Cabs) Amendment Bill of some interest. I was interested in the comments of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) in respect of A.F. Gason Pty Ltd, manufacturers of tractor cabs in Ararat. The lAC submitted its interim report on this industry on 16 February 1984 and recommended that temporary assistance should not be extended. However, the Government, after taking all circumstances into account, decided in June of this year to extend temporary assistance, accorded to the local production of tractors and cabs, until December of this year or until the Government's decision on the lAC report on long term assistance is announced. The temporary assistance that we have announced, combined with the current long term assistance, gives tractor production an effective rate of assistance of around 20 to 25 per cent. Removal of temporary assistance would reduce that effective rate to about 10 per cent, which is a very low rate of assistance compared with the average for manufacturing industry of about 25 per cent. The lAC's final report on long term assistance arrangements was submitted on 18 June 1984 and the Government is in the process of considering that report. The Bills before the House are eminently sensible Bills. I believe that they are well supported. They are certainly eminently reasonable and very responsible Bills in terms of the commitment of the Australian Government to the development of Australian industry. These Bills give effect to that commitment in a wide range of industries including the higher technology industries of computing and data processing and our other industries of electric motors and tractors and tractor cabs. I commend the Bills to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Tuckey) adjourned. SlJPPRESSION OF THE PRESS",120
42,Mr STEELE HALL,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"by leave-I note the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about the non-publication of a story in the Age. I also note the statement of the Prime Minister that Mr Burns had informed him that Mr Barron, Mr Hawke's principal adviser, did not on his visit ask Mr Burns to do anything. I accept the statement that Mr Barron did not visit the Age to influence its attitude on the matter to which I referred. However, the information put to the Opposition in regard to the story was corroborated from separate sources a.nd for that reason the Government was tested on the issue at Question Time. The matter of the Swi-s bank account is still of very great interest to the Opposition.

BOUNTY (ACRICULTURAL TRACTORS) AMENDMENT BILL. 1984 [COGNATE BILLS: BOUNTY (TRACTOR CABS) NA BOUNTY (COMPUTERS) BILL 1984 NA NA BILL (No.2) 1984 BOUNTY (ELECTRIC MOTORS) BILL Second Reading Debate resumed.",123
43,Mr TUCKEY,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"ln this cognate debate the Bill to which I am most interested in referring is the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill 1984. I wish to como. ment, .firstly, on the circumstances that apply. The original Act giving a bounty for tractors is dated 1966. For many years the bounty paid to tractor manufacturers was fairly static. In: recent times the Act was extended. At that time the bquntY,assistance was doubled. From my reading of the original Act, as amended, that meant thiJ.t a tiactorqf 150 kilowatts or over which previously attracte<i $3,480 would now attract $6,960. In this day and age that is not a very large sum when one con-i<iers that a. tractor of that power rating would cost about $70,000. My great concern is that within the Australian manufacturing sector there are manufactured a number of tractors that are much mqre powerful than tractors of 150 kilowatts. In fact, that is a veritable toy in this age of dry land farming. We hear daily of the cost pressures that have been applied to the farming industry. Of course, these are cost pressures and downwards price pressures as well. Consequently; farmers have had to look to bigger and bigger equipment so that they are able to operate their farms practically as individuals. Thereby hangs another tale. I think of my early years in the 1950s and 'some of the farming areas that are now parts of my electorate. The amount of farm labour that visited my hotel at night time was substantial. Today those people are missing. They have been replaced by big machinery. Of course, the union people who created that situation still do not seem to know why. Nevertheless, the difficulty that I have confronted is that within my electorate, as the honourable member for Wannon(Mr Hawker) in his electorate, are manufactured these very large tractors. They are tractors which range in horsepower, using the old terminology, from 200 to 525 horsepower. These are the type that are very much in demand. I am speaking of tractors whose prices range from $100,000 to $250,000. Many of these tractors, firstly, are not receiving the benefit of this legislation or the amendment which proposes to extend the bounty until the end of the year. The reason they are not is that section 6 (4) of the Act states: Where the factory cost of the materials and parts of a tractor that were wholly produced or manufactured in Australia is less than fifty-five per centum of the factory cost of the tractors, no bounty is payable. 1984] That means that one has to have a 55 per cent Australian content. However, under section 6 (7) one finds that pneumatic tyres or tubes, air conditioning equipment, radio equipment, sound reproducing equipment or sound recording equipment or winches are to be excluded-irrespective, I presume, of where they are manufactured. Most of the tyres that are fitted now to our large tractors are manufactured in Australia. So one can see the great difficulty of a manufacturer in achieving a 55 per cent Australian content if he has to exclude those factors. The companies of which I am aware were never in the first place able to attract a bounty because they could not achieve a 55 per cent local content; but, secondly, they were grossly disadvantaged in terms of their competitors. Under the trade arrangements that Australia has made from - ime to time all fully built up tractors entering Australia do so incurring no duty whatsoever, I emphasise that, because often it is said of things coming into Australia that they attract no tariff. Nor do they attract a tariff; but they attract what was originally introduced, the 2 per cent tariff, which was introduced more as a revenue measure than as a protection measure. But fully built up tractors entering Australia do not attract that 2 per cent tariff. The particular tractors about which I am talking are manufactured in Merredin, within my eJectorate. They are manufactured, stnlngely enough, by two. manufacturers. One is known as Farmers Tractors Australia Pty Ltd, which produces the Phoenix tra-tor, and the other is a firm called Don Zanetic and Company, which used to manufactu.re a tractor known as the Acre-Master but today, as I understand it, sub-contracts and manufactures these large tractors for International Harvester. The problem is that these firms, as I say, attract no bounty whatsoever because at this stage they are unable to meet the 55 per cent local input. But they are obliged to pay the 2 per cent revenue duty on all the components that they import to put in that tractor. The type of compon-nts that, naturally come to mind are the engines,. transmissions, gearboxes an-, drive axles. Therefore, their competitors, for instance, Steiger tractors, are coming into the country from America with no duty whatsoe-er. The local manufactur-r has a 2 per cent duty applied to his imported components irrespective of the fact that by comparison he is putting a substantial Australian content into his product. In the type of tractor that I have mentioned the cost burden is between $800 and $1,000 per tractor, depending on its size. That seems to be the. height of the ridiculous. It is not something that has just appeared on the scene. One of my many files is about three-quarters of an inch thick and contains letters that I wrote to Ministers of the previous Government begging them to do something about it. The previous Minister responsible for Customs and excise and such matters, the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Andrew Peacock, was eventually getting something done. He had seen these tractors manufactured and was doing something about it. But he was confronted with considerable difficulties, particularly with his Department which, to my mind, always saw the problem as too hard.' Maybe it is too hard to create a situation in which one has to say, 'That engine can come in free because it is going into a tractor, and that cannot do so'. Then, of course, does the engine come 'in for a tractor and end up in a truck, or something like that? I can see those difficulties. However, under the bounty arrangements and \yith these amendments to the legislation, clearly, by an increase in the size of the bounty, it would bea simple matter to overcome these difficulties. In other words, one takes the money on the engines as they come in and gives it back to the tractor manufacturer at the time of the completion of hir product. People may ask why we should worry about this sector of the tractor market. Strangely enough, it is probably that sector of manufacturing industry most likely to succeed. The simple evidence for that is that it is succeeding already. It is managing to meet foreign competition, in both price and quality. In regard to quality, the four Australian tractor manufacturers are all companies which are generally very close to the Australian agricultural industry. They know what is wanted and they have a great deal of experience. The company that makes the Phoenix tractor-I have here a photograph of one on a brochure-is called Farmers Tractors Australia Pty Ltd. There is a very good reason for that. Fifty per cent of it is owned by Farmtrac Pty Ltd. That company happens to comprise 70 farmer shareholders, previous clients of the ge-tJeman Mr Laurie Phillips who manufactures these tractors. Quite clearly those gentlemen, who also participate in the board of directors, have a very good knowledge of the type of equipment that is needed. So, firstly, we have an industry in the local scene that meets all the requirements of local farmers. I add that at one stage the Merredin tractor industry was selling more tractors in Queensland than in Western Australia. We have an industry that can survive in the tough international market. Surely that industry does not want to carry the burden of a government tax of $1,000 when its overseas competitors do not have to pay such a tax. Generally, however, that company has managed to compete. One of the reasons for this is that Steiger Tractor company, well known for tractor exports to Australia, has an international throughput of only about 2,000 tractors a year. These very large tractors are not mass-produced, unlike the tractors we are setting out to protect most here; that is, the tractors made by Chamberlain John Deere Pty Ltd in Western Australia. It is subject to intense competition from overseas companies because it produces high volume demand tractors, in an international one sense. Of course, there are huge companies around the world able to mass produce such tractors and to be very competitive.' . We are looking at an industry that warrants support. In fact, it is clear from the report of the Industries Assistance Commission that the lAC agrees with that.. I am hopeful that by the time this amendment to the Act expires in December the Government will have taken the advice of the lAC. To my mind the lAC put forward a very sensible proposition when it stated: It is proposed, therefore, that assistance should continue to be provided by a bounty. Several problems with the present bounty scheme were identified, however, and a bounty based on 20 per cent of domestic value added is proposed to overcome most of these. This would provide assistance at the level of 15 terms . . . I hope that the Minister will read that to mean, as I do, that a manufacturer would get a 20 per cent bounty on the local content of its tractor-there would be no minimum. I think that is sensible. None of these manufacturers are interested in buying from overseas what they can get locally. I am well aware that the fern extractor, for instance, is soon to have an Australian-made radiator. Currently it uses an imported radiator, but local manufacturers are now coming into the market. That company has talked with the Chamberlain company to see whether it can make axle components. It understands that Chamberlains  an axle made to his own design it will be a substantially better one because it will better meet the actual specifications needed for that tractor. These companies are anxious to improve their local content component. Of course, as they do, under the proposition put by the lAC, they will attract a larger bounty. That is so much better than the relative lump sum arrangement existing in the present Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Act, which entirely ignores the progressive value of tractors that exceed 150 kilowatts. As I said, those tractors are veritable toys in the market today. To me it is most important that the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Senator Button) and the Government firstly consider the amendment moved by the Opposition which suggests a mechanism to do something about the disadvantage that these tractor manufacturers suffer now. However, that would be only in the short term. Clearly, if the Government accepts the excellent recommendation of the lAC that problem will be overcome. I am, extremely hopeful that that will be so. The .honourable member for Wan non when talking about tractor cabs indicated some of the problems for local manufacturers. I think that is something we have to recognise when we talk about the ,cost of inputs for local manufacturers. At the Dowerin Field Day-one of the biggest field days in Australia-the other day a manufacturer informed me of his situation. Australia design capacity and technology had produced excellent, equipment in the ploughing area, in particular blade ploughs. So good were these ploughs that a Canadian manufacturer came over and sought licence to manufacture this equipment in Canada. That was given and at one stage the Western Australia manufacturer had to turn to that Canadian manufacturer for stock because he had more orders than he could fill. The Canadian to 20 per cent in effective rate fellow sent him out a couple of his ploughs, built under licence in Canada. When the Australian manufacturer got the bill they were 30 per cent cheaper than he could make them himself. Honourable members can imagine the temptation to that man to sack all his Australian workers, sit down and import Canadian duty free equipment and take the 30 per cent. However, he is not that type of bloke. He had no intention of doing that. Nevertheless, he was smart enough to ask the Canadians to send out one of their senior people to find out why they could make them so much cheaper, and they did. They went through the manufacturing process here bit by bit. It is interesting to note that labour was not the problem. His labour costs were competitive. When they had gone through it all they found that the entire extra cost was tied up in steel-the input. Of course, we are well a ware of what is going on in the steel industry at the moment and how the Government is trying to save the industry with taxpayers' money. The reality of the situation is that we had a tractor industry built up to a point where overseas people had come knocking on our door for our technology. Yet that industry is being destroyed by the cost of steel. Clearly, companies such as Broken Hill Proprietory Co. Ltd have to get their act into gear if this is what they are doing to our manufacturers. There are thousands of opportunities such as that one around the world. I put it to honourable members again that this very large equipment, be it ploughs or tractors, are things Australia can use its well paid work force on because, although the manufacturing process is labour-intensive, there will never be mass production. We should encourage such manufacturers. However, it is no good going along and saying: 'BHP steel is too dear and this is too dear, here is some taxpayers' money'. We have to put pressure on the producers of the raw materials, if you like, to enable our manufacturers to be on the ball. I put to honourable members that it is not just a case of international competition. If and when we open wide the steel markets of Australia BHP, producing the amount of steel it does, would be the price-setter. Not one company that imported Korean steel or any other raw material would have the price of BHP steel. Nobody is that silly. If a manufacturer can buy the steel for one-third of BHP's price it will sell it for 95 per cent of BHP's price because that is all that is needed to. get the sales. That is the Qther issue we have to. consider in terms Qf Australian manufacturers. The matter is seriQus. I am sure the Minister is aware of this small problem which is attacking the tractQr manufacturers in VictQria, at Waltanna, Baldwins in New South Wales, Farmers Tractors in Merredin and Mr Don Zanetic's products tQO. In fact the Farmers Tractor cQmpany emplQys 18 men in the wQrkshQP and five in administratiQn. That is Qnly 23 people at this stage, but Mr Zanetic across the rQad frolll that cQmpanywQuld,emplQy a similar number. The industry in Merredin has alwaysemplQyed abQut 50 people. That is nQt a lQt Qf people but it invQlves a lQt Qf families and it is a lQt Qf people in a small tQwn like Merredin. These are people in wQrk and people minding their Qwn business. They are dQing all the right sorts Qfthings fQr Australia. I tell the Minister that if he WQuid like to go. back thrQugh the files he will see some Qf the letters I wrote to. previous Ministers. I was highly critical Qf them fQr nQt, being able to. resQlve this simple prQblem. The Minister daily presents himself to. us as a man Qf great ability. He has certainly proved that in his private business interests. I hQpe he can demonstrate to. us within a week Qr so. that he has tackled this little problem and, ,in fact, there is a m(!chanism-be it a special refund Qf bQunty or a, by-law arrangement-that allows these Australian manufacturers to. cQmpete internatiQnally Qn an equal fQQting with their cQmpetitQrs. These tractQr manufacturers are nQt even asking for special help, althQugh they WQuid like to. have it. They are just asking nQt to. have to pay $1,000 in duty which the importers to. Aust,ralia do nQthave tQpay. This is thesituatiQn we have to. 10Qk at. I add in my last few moments that Farmers TractQrS have suggested that the Steiger tractQr arriving here is being dumped. In fact, Farmers suggest that at the mQment tractQr dealers are getting an extra discount of $29,500 a tractQr. It is pretty hard fQr the lQcal boys to cQmpete with that type QfdiscOlmting. HQwever, there might be a '?laming ther- fQr potential tractQr purchasers. I have ,been tQld that the reason fQr that dumping is that in Canada Steiger's have prQduced it' bQmb, that thl,lt cQmpany has put an unsuitable mQtor in the tractQr and it is giving the farmers QVer there lot of trouble. The farmers Qver there will nQt buy 'the tractQrs and they are, being sent Qut to. Australia a't a massive discQunt. As anybody who. has had anything to do. with engines and machinery WQuid knQw, $29,000 is no discQunt fQr amachine that will give a lQt of trouble. ApersQn CQuid spend that in a year, partiCUlarly in down time. TQday's farming technique is all about getting the crop in ill the shQrtest possible tiine., A brQken dQwn tractoris no. good when a farmer has to. put a crQP in. So. there is a gQod reasOn to. buy Australian. We have very gQQd equipment and all Australian cQmpanies need is a little bit of help; I am hQping that that will Qccur in the short term and in the lQng term with the acceptance Qf the Industries Assistance CQmmissiQn reCQmmendations to. gQvernment. M .. CHYNOWETH (Flinders) <lO.l1)-I wish to. speak to. the Bounty (CQmputers), Bill 1984 during this cQgnate debate, but befQre I do. I ,mentiQn to. ,the honourable member fQr O'CQnnQr (Mr Tuckey) that within the electorate ,Qf Flinders we have, the steelwQrks Qf JQhn Lx-aght. I ,am quite certain that it does Qot charge too. much fQr its ste,el. It is very cQnscious Qf its prices and it does an excellent jQb. The people there wQrk very hard to. keep the CQsts dQwn fQr all Australians. The bQunty Qffered to. Australian manufacturers Qf cQmputer equipment has been welcQmed overwhelmingly by the cQmputer industry"" It' is what it has been wanting fQrmanyyears. Praise Qf the GQvernment's PQlicy fills all the, industry magazines. Having wQrked in the illdllstry !iin,ce its cQmmercial inceptiQn in Australia, and having designed and manufactl.!red cQmputer rQQm equipment, I am extremely aware Qf the great new QPportunities and the potential which this bQunty will Qffer to all Australian manufacturers. The bQunty Qf 25 per cent will certainly stimulate the cQmputer manUfacturing industry' and' the peripheral industries. This will undQubtedly lead to. mQre cQmpetitiveness within the industry, mQre 'emplQyment QPportunities and, therefQre, a genuine stimulus to'. the community and the eCQnQmy. ;"" The bQuntywill be paid .on all computÂ«rprQduction fQr dQmestic and eXPQrt sale. l believe that the number ofcQmputers and related equipment produced in Australia at this very p1Qment runs into. thousands. We have within Australia a large number Qf scientists and engineers with skills which CQuid enable our cQuntry to. lead the WQrld in many areas of computing. The bounty will expandtheQPportunity fQrthem to puttheit cQna siderable skills to. .wQrk. We shouldnQt only be lQoking at Qur Qwn market but also. follQWing' the example Qf a few Australian companies and moving out to. the huge marketQHhe rest Qf the,wQrld. The bounty will assist those companies prepared to do so. The bounty is directed to private industry and will undoubtedly go to many small businesses. I am sure that the bounty will please that area of the industry which employs a major part of the work force. Small businesses are able to adapt to change very rapidly. They are usually the most innovative and the most progressive. I urge those who have had thoughts of moving into the computer industry to do so now. In the electorate of Flinders we have many high technology firms. I know that they willÂ· be extremely pleased. I have had representations from many for assistance. I am proud to belong to a government that is committed to assisting them. In and around the Frankston and Mornington area high technology firms are being established very rapidly. IÂ· have been advocating for many .months now that this area is the correct part of Victoria in which to establish a high technology industry. I am sure that it will happen in the very near future. The rate of advance within the computet industry is still increasing exponentially and will continue. to do so. Unless our Australian industry is involved in this explosion of growth we will be rapidly left behind. Therefore, the nation will be reliant on imported technology. I have stated before that, if we do not develop our own high technologyindustries, we will be a technological backwater. The bounty provides an opportunity for the Australian computer industry to participate in this growth. . A provision in the Bill is that the bounty is not payable .to equipment which is not of good merchantable quality. This is a most important clause. What it does. is prevent inferior manufactured goods from obtaining the bounty. It creates a standard of excellence which must be obtained. Australia already has a good name in manufactured products and this must be protected. It will also prevent the scheme from being abused by manufacturers who sell equipment not up to accepted standards. It is a provision which will enhance the reputation of Australian goods and provide the world with quality goods. The .Hawke Labor Government has moved quickly to ensure that government bodies are aware that they should purchase Australiandesigned and manufactured computer equipment where it is compatible with overseas equipment. We have given the off-set program cl,ose scrutiny. I am certain .that those who have off-set obli-gat ions under their schemes will be instructed to fulfil them. In my years as an electronic technician I serviced much office equipment in many large American firms that established their offices inÂ· Australia. They all insisted on installing American-made office equipment. Urust that private industry will also make a conscious effort to buy quality Australian-made computer equipment and, therefore, provide the initial stimulus and assistance a new industry requires. All these actions will, in the future, increase the market for our own computer industry. The Labor Government is creating the opportunities; we are supplying the incentives. It is now up to the industry to act quickly to use these. excellent conditions which we have created to build for this nation an industry whose expansion is limited only by our imagination. I commend the Bills to the House.",123
44,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"Berowra) (10.17)Like the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) and the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Chynoweth) I wish to direct my remarks to the Bounty (Computers) Bill 1984 and to state that the Opposition welcomes this Bill, subject to the amendments as to search and entry warrant provisions to be moved by my colleague the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). After all, the computer industry, in all its parts and associated activities, will be the world's largest and most pervasive industry. So it is important that we really get into it; that Australia makes the fullest use of modern, high, new-call it what you will-teChnology. But at the same time, Australia should have some production facilities in the industry on the ground affording a measure of independence in the control of information technology and providing jobs in manufacture in Australia. To make full use of it it is essential, first, that Australia have access to modern technology at or near world prices while, as I said, we encourage, in appropriate areas, actual production facilities in Australia. These objectives are met by this Bill and associated measures. The tariffs in this area which applied up until 6 July last, ranging from 5 to 24 per cent, have been taken off, apart from the on.e on visual display units which will be phased down more gradually. Only the basic 2 per cent revenue duty remains. So users have access to world-wide high technology products at world prices to encourage the most sophisticated use of modern technology, while at the same time domestic Australian producers and manufacturers competing against these lower priced end products will thems<;lves be assisted, firstly, by being able to import components at tariff free prices and, secondly, by receiving the bounty assistance under the Bill now before the House, at a level of 25 per cent of the value added in Australia. So the abolition of the tariffs on these products and the substitution of this bounty represent a substantial and felicitous freeing-up of this market I' might add that the bounty applies to the design and development of computer systems and software; it is payable in respect of such expenditure. That is very much as it should be because really you are only in an industry to the ext-nt of 'tin-bending' unless you are actually involved at least to some extent in the development of the technology. I would like to assert, as the honourable members to whom I have referred have asserted, the conviction of the Opposition that indigenous Australian companies can find a place in this industry, notwithstanding the league of very large overseas manufacturers based on very large research and development programs th;;tt the Australian companies are up against. The technological potential is certainly there.It involves access at world prices to basic building blocks and the genuity, the design capacity to develop from them a superior product. Marketing, in competition with the overseas majors, is the really difficult thing. There can be no doubt that the sorts of measures we are discussing ,tonight can be supplemented by government purchasing procedures. I am not referring just to preference, but to information and access, forward knowledge of requirements and measures like that. As I said, the Opposition supports these measures. We learned in the Budget Papers that the additional cost in 1984-85 is some $7.7m compared with last year. I will not give the percentage because it is a rather different procedure. It strictly comparable. I notice on the saine list that there is a lift in the subsidy to the steel industry from $10.9m to $52m which I think in this grand year of detnonstrating what 'initiative, hard work and consensus can achieve' is perhaps somewhat questionable. I can support the $7.7m-1I have some doubts about the extra $40m to the steel industry, notwithstanding the comments of my colleague. What I want to contrast is this increase of expenditure, this $7.7m before us-d!lre Iclassify the extra $40m to, the steel industry in this way; am not sure-to foster technology development and new high technology industry, which as I say I support, with the deplorable miserliness in respect of science and scientific research. As the House is by now well aware, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial, Research Organisation, Australia's premier scientific research organisation, is bleeding because of a shortfall in its allocation of the order of $9m. We have just been talking about an increase in these subsidies of nearly $50m. The Australian research grants-Mr Brumby- What has this to do with the Bills?",127
45,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"It is very relevant to the Bills, as the honourable member will see in a moment. The Australian research grants scheme, Australia's key research funding prograln-especially in regard, to the universities-received an increase in its funds of a lousy $1.5m which results in only two out of ten worthy, world standard, new proposals on research being funded. Some 140 of the 1,037 projects previously approved have to be axed and some 732 worthy projects by world,standards cannot be funded at all. So we have a situation where the careers of many dedicated scientific researchers have been set back in a way that really hurts. I strongly support measures-the mimagement in- and investment companies legislation last year and the freeing-up of the computer market associated with the, Bills now, bvfore the House-to encourage actual advanced technology industry growth. I support measures to encourage technology development which is the next stage on from scientific research to the translation ,of sc;ientific research and innovative ideas into new technology, new factories and jobs for Australians. The two interact--,---the market induced technology based industry growth drives the technology development, and that nourishes the growth of industry. The point I want,to make is this: So far as stimulation of technology is not development and advanced technology industry growth involves government funding-this is preeminently a matter for the private sector-but so far as it does involve Government funding, that funding must be additional to, not at the cost of, mainstream basic scientific research which, as is universally recognised, is predominantly a government responsibility. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Barry Jones) has many times commented-he did so again yesterday in a vain attempt to excuse the I Government's outrageous treatment of scientific research in this Budget-that the balance between government and private sector funding of science and technology is all wrong in this country. The ratio is 80:20; government 80 and the-private sector 20. It is more like 50:50 in ,other leading Organisation for Economic Co""operation and Development countries such as Germany, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. In Sweden it is 40 government and private 60. I would agree that the ratio is wrong. However the point at issue is not the government funding of basic research and long term high risk applied research; what we spend in the government sector in that regard, which has been unhappily cut this year, is broadly comparable as a percentage of gross domestic product to what the other countries I have referred to spend; that is, the spending on basic research and long term applied research is broadly comparable. There is no question of reducing that. The short sighted, unacceptable and positively outrageous treatment of science in the Budget is to be totally condemned. But we do still then have the problem of getting the private sector research and development up to speed, to something like it is overseas. No one suggests that will be easy. It is a question of direct incentives such as Australian industrial research and development incentives scheme-AIRDIS-grants; the attempt to seed the development of a venture capital market through the management and investment companies scheme, and arrangements such as this freeing-up of the computer market that we are talking about here tonight. Additionally the Opposition has proposed an incentive in the form of a 50 per cent write-off premium for tax purposes in respect of private sector research and development expenditure. I commend that proposal to the Government. What I would then'emphasise most strongly-I will conclude on this-is that these more direct measures in themselves are not enough; rather what is even more important is the fostering of the right attitudes and a' favourable overall 'climate for innovation, risk taking and investment. The fundamental thing is getting the macro-economic settings of the economy right-cost levels contained, productivity and profitability up, and inflation and interest rates down. We must get that macro-economic setting right and address other rigidities in the Australian economy, especially in the wages and industrial relations area. Recently I did, address the House briefly suggesting that it is very instructive in this context to reflect on the long view contained in a study in a recent issue of the journal The Economist which looked at the last 10 years in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the United States over that period there was an increase of some 16 per cent in employment; ,along with that went an 11 per cent reduction in real hourly earnings. The economy was flexible enough to take that 11 per cent reduction in real hourly earnings on board in a context where rising oil prices and other factors affect the situation. In the United Kingdom where real hourly earnings were up by 10 per cent ,over that period, employment-the total of jobsactually decreased by 7 per cent. With some growth in the working population that leads to the horrendous unemployment figures in that country; whereas in the United States, with that growth of jobs fostered by technology and the flexibility of the economy, the unemployment rate is relatively low. In conclusion, I stress that these other measures we have talked about are important but, basically, we must get this overall climate right.",128
46,Mr JOHN BROWN,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"Parramatta-Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce) (1O.30)-in reply-In closing the debate on the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill 1984, the Bounty (Tractor Cabs) Amendment Bill 1984, the Automatic Data Processing Equipment Bounty Amendment Bill 1984 and; the Bounty (Electric MotorS) Bill 1984-the Bounty (Computers) Bill 1984 is apparently to be considered in Committee-I make a few observations. It seems to me to be a pity that a debate of this type takes place at 10.30 on Thursday night and obviously is not attracting much of a listening audience. The thoughtful contributions that came from both sides of the House on these Bills lead me to believe that there is a capacity in this House for a bipartisan approach to some matters, particularly, the restructuring of Australian industry. It was interesting to note the number of laudatory comments that came from the Opposition with regard to some of the moves that will be made with regard to industry and particularly high tech industry by the Bills that are before the House. I noted with interest some of the challenging comments made by the last speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), and also the honourable member for, O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I will certainly pass those on to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Senator Button) seeking a very quick response. The comments from the Government side, from the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr ' Allan Morris), the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) and the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Chynoweth) who always seem to speak on these types of Bills, 1 found quite encouraging. They indicated their interest in the restructuring of industry in Australia, the move to lessen protection to make our international competitiveness greater' and at least to make an effort to see that Australia's capacity in many of these areas, particularly the high tech area, is taken to its full advantage. I commend everybody who took part in the debate for their thoughtful contributions. With regard to the first amendment moved with respect to the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill 1984, I think the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), knew when he moved it that it does not contain a great deal of substance. In fact he recognises that the assistance, the bounties that are being applied to the agricultural tractor industry, is only a continuation of the temporary assistance. That assistance will expire at the end of December. By then the Government should have made a full response to the Industries Assistance Commission report on this industry which is now in the Minister's hands. I presume he will accept that this is only a continuation of temporary assistance and will phase it out when the Government makes its decision on long term assistance to this industry. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.

'Dr HARRY EDWARDS (Berowra) (1O.35)-by leave-On behalf of the honourable member for Ryan (MrMoore),I move: (I) Clause 24, page 19, line 21, after 'reasonable times' insert"" with the consent of the occupier or in pursuance of a warrant issued under sub-section (1 B) '. (2) Clause 24, Â·page 19, after sub-clause (1) insert the following sub-clauses: '(I A) An au thorized officer may make application to a Justice for a warrant authorizing the authorized officer to enter the premises to which the application relates. '(IB) If, on an application under sub-section (IA), the Justice is satisfied, by information on oath or affirmation, that it is reasonably necessary that the authorized officer should have access to the premises to which the application relates, the Justice may grant a warrant authorizing the authorized officer to enter the premises for the purpose of exercising the functions of Third Reading an authorized officer under this section. '(Ie) A warrant granted under sub-section (IB) shall include(a) a statement of the purpose for which the warrant is issued; (b) a description of the kind of things authorized to be inspected or copied or from which extracts may be taken; and (c) a date; not being later than one month after the Second Reading date of issue of the warrant, upon which the warrant ceases to have effect'. These amendments reflect the view of the Opposition that in this context the capacity of officers to enter premises should be only with the consent of the occupier or pursuant to a warrant issued as proposed in these amendments. I think the honourable member for Ryan spoke to these recomamendments in his opening address.",129
47,Mr JOHN BROWN,EQUIPMENT BOUNTY AMENDMENT,"Parramatta-Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism; Minister for Third Reading Administrative Services and Minister Assisting moved the Minister for Industry and Commerce) (10.17)- These amendments are not unusual. They usually appear every time there is a bounty a . Bill. The provisions to which the amendments refer are not new to bounty legislation. They are consistent with the powers that have been provided by governments of all political persuasion to make sure that taxpayers are fully protected by appropriate compliance audits. These powers have, in fact, been considered on a number of occasions by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. They have always acknowledged the view that where taxpayers' money is expended on a bounty, it is reasonable to expect that the government or the department has the right to enter premises without a warrant to make sure that the bounty funds are, in fact, being expended properly. It is held by some people to be an imposition on civil liberties but, as I said earlier, it has been accepted by governments of all persuasions that it is a reasonable power for the bounty Bills to have embedded within them.

48,Mr LINDSAY,REPATRIATION LEGISLATION,"The Repatriation Legislation Amendment Bill 1984 provides that delegates of the Repatriation Commission will have the same powers as the present repatriation boards. Claimants for disability pensions will be entitled to written reasons for all determinations made in respect of disability pension entitlements or assessments. At present primary decisions concerning such pension claims are made by three-member repatriation boards. In the view of the Administrative Review Council the involvement of multi-member independent Third Reading boards at the primary stage is an unnecessary expenditure of resources. Single decision makers can - eal with more cases more quickly. This will accord with modern administrative practice whereby initial decisions are made by a single person under delegation. To ensure that delegates have all the available Second Reading relevant evidence before them, they are empowered to seek additional information by in. formal interview with the claimantor applicant. Claimants may also request a member to discuss any aspect of the pension claim. Veterans or dependants living in remote areas will be able to make telephone calls at the cost of a local call to Third Reading discuss the claim with the delegate. Clause 10 of the Bill provides that claims for pensions be made on an approved form and provides administration procedures for dealing with a claim that may not have been made in the approved manner. Subsection (3) of the new section 25 enables the Commission to determine that where a disability is accepted, but no pension is granted because the degree of incapacity is negligible, the disability . Second Reading without pension can be accepted to enable only medical treatment, for example, ointment, to be provided. New section 29A is designed to have claims determined at first instance wherever possible. This new section is not designed to place an onus on the claimant to seek evidence to substantiate a claim. It allows the Commission to defer consideration of the claim where the delegate is of the opinion that relevant evidence has not been put before him. A claim will lapse if the information is not made available within six months of the notice of deferral. New section 298 contains provisions in respect of informal interviews between the delegate and the claimant. It is noted that there is nothing in the legislation to prevent a spouse or a friend attending an interview with the claimant. This matter has been raised in discussions with ex-service organisations. Claimants will now be encouraged to bring a spouse or friend with them when they attend for an interview. New section 31 provides that the Commission may of its own volition review its own delegates' decisions. Repatriation boards are required to give written reasons to justify a decision on a claim or application for a disability pension. New section 47 A will require a delegate also to give written reaSons. A new provision enables the delegate when giving written reasons to omit reference to sensitive material. This is not intended as a device to withhold information generally. It is designed to protect the veteran or widow where sensitive details about a veteran have not been disclosed previously. For example, a wiQoW may not be aWare that her husband contracted venereal disease on service, or a veteran may not have been told of the exact nature or extent of a medical condition, such as terminal disease. In essence the provision is an attempt to handle the requirements of the administrative law with compassion in special cases. Service pensions are payable to veterans who served in a theatre of war and who have reached the age of 60 years for males and 55 years for females or who are permanently unemployable. Service pensions are subject to similar. income tests to age and invalid pensions. Disability pensions are not regarded as income for the purpose of the income test in respect of service pensions. New section 90 requires the secretary to investigate all matters to which a claim sion relates. For example, obtaining service records for theatre of war particulars, where there are claims by allied veterans the Department of Veterans' Affairs would seek to confirm theatre of war service from reputable overseas sources. Difficulties have been experiehced by claimants from Iron Curtain countries in obtaining service records for theatre of war particulars to enable their claims to be accepted. At present the commission delegate does' not give formal written reasons on claims for service pension. New section 90D provides for written reasons for decision to be given to service pension reviews but not initial claims. Requiring a delegate to give a formal set of reasons will' slow down the process of decision making in the first instance. The Administrative Review Council recommended that a statutory intermediate review body to be known as the Veterans' Review Board be established to review, on the merits of the case, primary decisions made by delegates of the Repatriation Commission on claims for disability pensions. Proceedings before the Veterans Review Board will be a hearing de novo, that is, a complete rehearing of the claim. The Veterans' Review Board will consist of a principal member, senior members and members appointed on either a full time or part time basis. In special circumstances and subject to prior approval of the Minister, the principal member of the Board will be empowered to constitute the Veterans Review Board by a senior member or member sitting alone. This will be particularly useful if workloads cause unnecessary delays in the disposal of cases. Where the Repatriation Commission has rejected a claim for a disability pension, a claimant will have 12 months in which to lodge an application for review of that decision. Where an application for an increase in the rate of disability pension has been refused, the time limit in which to lodge an application for a review of that decision will be three months, the same period as in the present legislation. These time limits are designed to assist the speedy disposition of claims and are usual in most other jurisdictions established in respect of appeal processes. Although many cases will be resolved at the Veterans' Review Board by a relatively expeditious, economical and informal means of review, it is considered necessary to provide a final review tribunal on the merits which will provide an opportunity, not only for individual cases to be considered in greater depth but also for consideration to be given for development, and enunciation of prin"" ciples of general application, for the future guidance of primary decision makers, and the Vetfor a service pen- erans Review Board. This Bin therefore confers full jurisdiction for repatriation pension matters on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, there are special factors in the repatriation system which have prompted the Government to propose that a special repatriation division be established within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Accordingly the Government will seek to appoint to this division members with special expertise and .experience relevant to veteran service conditions and post-service situations. The Hawke Government, an authentic Aus"" tralian Government, has undertaken to consult with veterans organisations in making these appointments. The right of appeal to the Federal Court of Australia on questions oflaw remains on a similar basis to that provided for in the present legislation. Ex-service organisations have indicated that they strongly favour the retention of this right of appeal to the Federal Court of Australia. With respect to service pension determinations, primary decisions will now be subject to review by a senior delegate of the Repatriation Commission upon request from a dissatisfied claimant. At present, there is not any right to external review on service pension claims except in respect of a question of whether a claimant for service pension is permanently unemployable. Exservice organisations will welcome the provision in the Bill which provides a right of review from a primary decision of the Repatriation Commission to the Veterans Review Board and a further right of review from the Veterans Review Board to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The estimated cost of disability service pensions for 1983-84 is $2,0 17m. Once the determining system is fully operational, it is expected that savings in administrative expenditure will be achieved. Improved decision making at the primary level, based on better investigative processes and precederits flowing from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, should result in a reduction in the number of appeals. This legislation represents further evidence of the attempt by the Hawke Government to deal with the delays and other problems in the present systems in a practical and methodical way. The Hawke Government has reacted positively and expeditiously to implement the reforms to the determining system suggested by expert bodies. The Bill sets the operative date as 1 January 1985. There is a host of administrative and staffing matters to be put in train before that date. The legislation should be passed in the shortest possible time to allow the successful implementation of the new system from the beginning of next year. The honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher) has drawn my attention to a number - f concerns about various provisions of this Bill expressed by the honorary secretary of the Australian Veterans  Alexander, and by Dr Ian Duncan, a former prisoner of war. I have given these matters consideration, and a letter dated 6 September 1984 from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Gietzelt) satisfactorily answers these concerns. I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on h.is efforts to assist the veteran community. This legislation is aimed at just that. It introduces a revised processing system for pension claims. It replaces the present system which has proved too slow and cumbersome to deal effectively with the needs of veterans in the mid-1980s. I understand that there is very wide-ranging support in the veteran community to dd the repatriation system of unnecessary delays in deciding pension claims. This legislation will go a long way towards achieving this aim.",131
49,Mr BLUNT,REPATRIATION LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak in support of the Repatriation Legislation Amendment Bill. This Bill incorporates changes to the determining provisions of the repatriation benefits as paid to returned servicemen and women. I believe that Australia owes those brave men arid women a great debt. Unfortunately, their contribution to this country is underestimated by many members of the Government. There is a backlog of some 25,000 to 30,000 claims, which is an embarrassment to all those people who have anything to do with the circumstances of many of the returned servicemen living in our community. I believe that many people do not realise the significance of repatriation in the Australian community. Some 600,000 people are directly affected by this legislation and, if one counts their families, the number is increased to some three million. Apparently, there are some 200,000 war widows. Those war widows will be of continuing importance in the Australian community until the year 2000. I am told that the number of war widows will still be at the level of 200,000 in the year 2000. The provisions of this Bill are based on the recommendations of the report of the Administrative Review Council and Mr Justice Toose's report of the IQdependent Inquiry into the Repatriation System, conducted in 1975. I am pleased that the Government has continued the initiative of the previous coalition Government i- this area. The Bill aims at achieving a more effective and efficient system of claim determination and has the general support of the Returned Services League's national executive, Legacy, the War Widows Guild and many other returned servicemen and women's organisations. The Bill represents an attempt to find a solution to a very difficult and important administrative problem. I believe that it has been received in both this House and another place with a spirit of co-operation and good will. I sincerely hope that the provisions incorporated in this Bill will lead to an alleviation of the problems faced by many returned servicemen and women. If, however, the proposals incorporated in the Bill are not successful, I hope that the Government will act speedily to review the system again. I should like briefly to review the provisions of this legislation and to examine its intent and mechanics. As I have indicated, the legislation obviously seeks to implement Government decisions on the repatriation determination system. It is important to remember in the first place that we are talking about the determining system and not entitlements legislation which is not yet available. When the entitlements legislation is available it will cover a much wider spectrum of circumstances and will be much more complex. As I have said, this Repatriation Legislation Amendment Bill very significantly follows the decisions of report No. 20 of the Administrative Review Council which has been overviewed by the Advisory Committee on Repatriation Legislation Review, created by Senator Messner for the specific purpose of looking across the whole spectrum of repatriation legislation with a view to bringing it together, consolidating it, simplifying it and matching it with 1984, since its birth was in 1920, almost 70 years ago. The legislation seeks to introduce a more logical process of applications and reviews aimed at overcoming the enormous backlog to which I have already referred. One of the most significant requirements, expressed clearly in this legislation, is that there should be much information as possible at the initial determining stage. This will enable the initial determination to be arrived at with full knowledge of the full facts. That alone should significantly reduce the number of appeals and reviews of recent times. Unacceptable delay might indeed be removed completely. The legislation before us amends a number of Acts: The Repatriation Act 1920, the Interim Forces Benefits Act 1947, the Repatriation (Far East Strategic Reserve) Act 1956, the Repatriation (Special Overseas Services) Act 1962 and the Seamen's War Pension and Allowances Act 1940. The Council identified as a significant deficiency the fact that primary decisions were being made on incomplete evidence. This legislation seeks to overcome that problem. Primary investigation will take the place of the maximum possible evidence available. The other matter to which I wish to refer concerns the inadequacy of reasons for decisions. That too is an enormously important matter with which we have to come to grips. Indeed, if proper explanations are made available in written form, quite a few of the reviews that have been made and the claims that have followed and which have helped to delay and clutter up the system will be avoided. That is the purpose of that reference. Briefly, the purpose of the Bill is to abolish the three-member repatriation boards which are the first level of inquiry at the moment. They will be replaced ultimately by some 75 single delegate inquiries. Quite clearly, if this can work on a proper and full evidence basis it will speed up the whole process very significantly. These single member inquiries will be looking at both disability and service pension areas and claims for increases in disability pensions. The Veterans' Review Board will be established as the area of intermediate review for disability pensions at this stage and whilst in the past there has not been an intermediate review for service pensions they will be reviewed by single delegates, senior delegates as individuals, in the future. It is hoped that that too will be a step in the right direction. The Repatriation Review Tribunal will be abolished and in its place a special repatriation division of the Administrative Appeals Tribun-l will be established, in the formation of which there will be consultation in considerable depth with ex-service organisations. Of course, a service member will be present on the Tribunal. That is the structural change. Very briefly, it envisages 75 single member primary investigatory boards. It envisages a veterans' review board at the second as level and a repatriation division of the AA T at the third and final level on the merits with the existing capacity to extend on matters of law to the Federal Court of Australia and, if necessary, beyond. The repatriation system in Australia is over 70 years old. It has been reviewed on only a number of occasions but there has been virtually no overall legislation in all the years that have transpired since it grew out of the War Pensions Act of 1914 and the Repatriation Act of 1917 into the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act of 1920. In 1943, there was a joint parliamentary committee related to certain aspects of the legislation. In 1973 the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare was established and in June 1975 there was an independent inquiry into repatriation by Mr Justice Toose. But as I have said, there has been no overall legislation following these inquiries, although a number of Mr Justice Toose's recommendations are incorporated in the proposed legislation which is before us today. It is important to remember that it seeks to establish a new and quicker system of determining disability pensions and service pensions. It is an area in which it is necessary for speed to be estab. lished because of the massive backlog to which I have previously referred. I sincerely hope that this Bill will implement changes which will be of benefit to all the returned service men and women in Australia today. Question resolved in the affirmative.

50,Mr HOLDING,PAPERS,"The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, in consultation with the Minister for Defence in relation to part (1), has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: , (I) Reports of chemical warfare tests and experiments carried out in the period 1943-1945, under the direction of the Commanding Officer of the Australian Chemical Warfare Research and Experimental Section, show that a total of 387 volunteers were exposed to gas or liquid contaminants; 341 of the volunteers were members of the Army and the remainder, 46, were RAAF personnel. The personnel data were compiled from individual trial reports. In some reports, surnames only were recorded. As a result, in some instances, it has not been possible to establish whether several persons of the same name were involved once each or whether a lesser number participated on more than one occasion. For this reason, the accuracy of the total cannot be guaranteed. A number of these volunteers used ointments or wore impregnated clothing intended to protect against the effects of gas and liquid contaminants. Other volunteers were not exposed to hazardous chemicl;lls, but were used as controls or in tests of respirator endurance. (2) The Department of Veteran's Affairs has been able to identify 137 claims for Repatriation disability pension which have been lodged on the basis of involvement in gas experiments on service. Of this number, 24 claims were accepted by determining authorities as related to mustard gas exposure. Of these, 10 claims .were accepted in which veterans' incapacities correlated with known effects of mustard gas exposure: Burns to scrotum ...... Bronchial asthma with chronic obstructive airways disease . . . . . . Chronic bronchitis . . . . . . . Bronchitis, carcinoma of larynx, death Carcinoma of lung . . . . . . . In 14 cases the determining authorities appear to have accepted claims on the basis that, while the relationship between the incapacity and exposure to contaminants was not apparent, the beneficial standard of proof provisions NA of the Repatriation Act required that the claims be accepted.
