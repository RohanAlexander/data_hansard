2,Mr BRADFORD,DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Speaker, I am sorry that I have inform the House that the delegation has yet completed its report, despite having given some detailed consideration to it. We are ready to present it today, but we will be seeking such an opportunity later in period. NA Procedure Committee",13
3,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"Wakefield) (12.32 p.m.)On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the In committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Report on the conduct of divisions, together with the minutes of ceedings and evidence received by the mittee. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
4,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"This Procedure Committee report deals with the mechanisms the House uses to record members' votes on the quesproposals tions put before it-an issue about which many members have quite strong opinions. I intend to speak for only four of the 10 minutes allotted by the Selection Committee for discussion of this report today, although the issues it Covers really need more time than that. I will be brief because the chairman, honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), wishes to extend to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) the to courtesy of the opportunity to speak on behalf of the minority report signatories focusing the question of electronic voting. Secondly, one of the report's unanimous recommendations has implications for the House's Independent members in particular. Therefore, the chairman believed that at least one of them should also have the opportunity to comment today. The committee supports course of action. The honourable member for Cunningham has indicated that he, too, will limit his speaking time to four minutes for this latter reason. Both the average number of divisions per day and the time required to conduct and tally each division have been much greater this than at any time since 1975, the average to for 1996 being approximately 40 minutes per not day in divisions. The committee's recommendations aim to streamline division procedures, not but without diminishing any member's right to both call for a vote and place his or her the sitting vote on the public record. It is a matter for regret that the issue of electronic voting has resulted in a minority report. I emphasise that the majority view is not one of rejection of electronic voting. However, the reality is that present budgetary Report constraints make it unlikely that funding for its installation-estimated in 1993 as $2 million over three years-would be available. any event, selection and commissioning of an electronic voting system would take considerable time, which would not assist the proHouse and those of its members who believe comthat quick action should be taken now to reform the present somewhat cumbersome procedures. The committee has recommended two main changes to our division procedures. Both already operate effectively in other Australian parliaments. Their implementation by sessional order would allow the House to trial them. Under the first proposal, members' votes would be recorded while division bells are still ringing, the tellers having been appointed the immediately a division is called. The tellers for the ayes and the noes would stand on opposite sides of the Members' Hall entrance the chamber. After registering their vote with the appropriate tellers, members would on sit on the side of the House which corresponds to their vote. Most members' votes could be recorded before the doors are locked. The committee has also recommended that the bells be rung for five minutes instead of four as at present. Under the above procedure, that is unlikely to add to the total division time. For consecutive divisions-that is, those for which the bells are rung for one minuteonly those members who either did not vote in the immediately preceding division or wish to votc differently in the new division would need to report to the tellcrs. Our second proposal expands the provisions for recording dissent by allowing a division to be cancelled after the bells have been rung if there are eight or fewer members in the minority. The number and names of members in the minority would be automatically recorded but not the details of the members in the majority. The right of any two members to call a division and to have their vote on the public record would not be diminished. However, this procedure would save at least some of the excessive time presently required to conduct the count in those divisions in which nearly all members wish to vote on one side. The Procedure Committee is confident that these recommendations, if adopted, will improve the efficiency of the division process. I hope that before the House adjourns for the summer recess more time will be available for members to properly debate this report, which I present on behalf of the chairman, Mrs Sullivan.",13
5,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and my good friend the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) for the opportunity to make some comments today on the dissenting report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. I simply draw the attention of members to the report of a parliamentary delegation which I led in October and November 1993 to a number of countries to examine the issue of electronic voting. I took with me one of the great sceptics of this process, the Clerk House of Representatives. By the time we came back, he too was convinced that electronic voting was the way to go. I remind members that if they can do it in the US Congress, the European parliament, the parliaments of Scandinavia, Russia, Lebanon, Yemen, the Czech Republic, Nicaragua, the United Nations and many other states and territories around the world, why can we not do it here? The wiring is in place. It was always part of the design process that electronic voting should be part of the operation of the House of Representatives and I believe the time is right to do so. Much has been made of the cost associated with this proposal. Let me make some suggestions, particularly to you Mr Speaker, about cost. As you know, I brought down a private member's bill earlier this year which reflected views I, when Speaker in the last parliament, had formed as to how this parliamentary precinct should be run. I am prepared to accept modifications to my proposals. Mr Speaker, you will recall that I said we should reduce the number of departments on the hill from five to three. I believe some modifications are being discussed which give the chamber departments particularly a much greater say. I think that is now worth looking at very seriously. Again I appeal to you, Mr Speaker, and to Madam President, to perhaps have another close look at this proposal and to take it up with the government. If the five departments running this parliamentary precinct can be reduced to perhaps two, 2112 or three, then surely we can save some money for the government. On this side of the parliament we would be quite happy to look at that. The money thus saved could go towards the installation of electronic voting. I remind all honourable members that, by not having to come in here to answer division bells, perhaps for a division that takes on average 11 minutes, we can get on with the more important tasks that we as members of parliament are required to perform. I again refer all members to the report I brought down in this place in 1993. I refer members to the dissenting report contained in of the the Procedure Committee report which has been tabled today for consideration. There is no doubt I have a great deal of respect for the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) who put forward a very reasonable proposition for the consideration of the Procedure Committee as to how we might deal with this on a temporary basis. Perhaps that is right, and perhaps we could give it trial. But I see no reason why funding cannot be found by looking again at the way in which the parliamentary departments in this place are run so that electronic voting can be installed. With all the smart card technology that is around today, people do not necessarily have to sit in their seats to record their votes-although they must be in the parliacould ment. So I think there is a real way in which this could be utilised to the greater benefit all members in this place. I conclude by saying that the reason it is so connection important that we effect modifications to our voting patterns in this place is so that we can be freed up for the more important issues we have to deal with. That is a very real reason why the dissenting report is worth consideration. We have not dissented from the main report simply because we are trying to be narks or to simply be an opposition; we did so because, on the basis of previous evidence and due to the fact that modem technology means the cost associated with the installation of electronic voting would be a lot the $2 million or $3 million talked about before, we think electronic voting is worthy of consideration and should be brought to the attention of the government, and particularly to you, Mr Speaker, and Madam President.",14
6,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"I Standing wish to speak briefly to the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. As the person who put up the submission which basically been recommended by the Committee, I will say one or two things. My proposal was perceived as the short-term solution to the problem we all recognise that excessive time is presently taken to conduct divisions. In my view, divisions must be conducted in the chamber and during the period a bill is being dealt with. I do not support the concept of five or six taking place in a given period; I think it takes part of the atmosphere away from it. It is enough now when one finds oneself here saying, 'What am I voting on?' That situation could get worse. The reality is that this proposal should be perceived as the alternative to electronic a voting. I think electronic voting should stay on the agenda. Mr Speaker, you will have to struggle with the budget that will fund it, but I gather from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), that there may be means within the budget to achieve that over time. But please do not take our remaining newspaper from us to do it. The reality is that no doubt over time we address the more serious issue of",15
7,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted of for statements on this report has expired. Does the member wish to move a motion in with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,15
8,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.,15
9,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting, and the member will have leave to continue speaking less than when the debate is resumed. Treaties Committee Report",15
10,Mr BARTLETT,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Two international agreements on tuna-3rd report, together with has the minutes of proceedings and evidence Procedure received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",15
11,Mr BARTLETT,COMMITTEES,"Today's tabling is the in culmination of several months of public hearings and inspections in Canberra, Hobart, Perth, Adelaide and Port Lincoln. It has been a complicated task in respect of what appears on the surface to be a fairly simple bilateral divisions fishery agreement with Japan. In 1979 a 'Bilateral Agreement on Fisheries bad between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan, Head Agreement' was signed to facilitate close cooperation in the conservation and optimum utilisation of the not living resources within Australia's exclusive economic zone, EEZ. Under this agreement, annual subsidiary agreements permit Japanese long-line vessels to catch about 7,000 tonnes of fish within the EEZ. The Japanese vessels target a number of tuna species including yellowfin, bigeye and southern bluefin tuna. Concerns over the depletion in the southern bluefin tuna, SBT, stock resulted in the establishment of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. Australia, New Zealand and Japan are parties to this convention which ensures, through appropriate management, the conservation and optimum utilisation of SBT. The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna meets annually to determine the global total allowable catch and national quota allocations for the SBT fishery. The delays in setting recent quotas resulted from differences in opinion as to whether SBT stocks are recovering after a period of significant decline. Australia and New Zealand have opposed increasing the quotas, preferring the precautionary approach to managing stocks as required by the United Nations Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. Japan has excess capacity in its fishing fleet which could be utilised to catch additional SBT quotas. However, the committee supports the continuation of the cautious approach. Last year the commission determined that the total allowable global catch of SBT was 11,750 tonnes. Since the introduction of national quotas Australia, New Zealand and Japan have been required to reduce their annual catch. However, when the Japanese quota was decreased, the catches of other nations then increased through reflagging or by way of Japanese-Korean company interactions. It was estimated that the catch by Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan, which are not party to the convention, was of the order of 3,200 tonnes. The committee believes that the capacity to manage tuna stocks could be enhanced by the introduction of a certificate system which requires that all fish entering the market be identified to prevent fish caught by nonparties to the commission being accepted in t-- .mar-et.. - hile there may be significant dIffIcultIes In Introducing a certificate system, such a system could significantly improve the management capacity for the conservation of migratory species such as tunas. The subsidiary agreements provide Japanese fishing vessels with access to Australian ports as well as fishing rights within the AFZ. This is linked to the commission in that it is Australia's policy that the subsidiary agreements cannot be finalised until the SBT quotas are set. The committee recommends the separation of port access and the subsidiary agreements as this arrangement is not commercially satisfactory. Although the committee appreciates that an open port access policy is unacceptable, it believes that the Commonwealth government should investigate other mechanisms for linking port access with Australia's fisheries resource management objectives. The committee suggests linking this with Japan's participation in the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin TunaCCSBT. Under this arrangement, other countries cannot have access to Australian ports to facilitate their fishing activities. While this could be used to encourage countries such as Korea and Indonesia to join the convention, the wider implications will need to be addressed by the government. It is imperative that Australia does not assist the capacity of other nations to fish in a manner which is detrimental to the long term sustainability of some species. Japan has already cooperated in implementing a number of environmental measures requested by the Australian government and it would not be in the Australian fishing industry's long term interest to assist countries that have not given the same undertakings. There are substantial mutual benefits to Australia and Japan in the subsidiary agreements. The subsidiary agreements provide the framework within which difficult decisions in relation to fisheries can be contained and managed without impacting adversely on the broader bilateral relationship. The considerable cooperation between Australian and Japanese fishermen has assisted both countries. Australian fishermen have learnt from Japanese long-liners, and also derive considerable benefit from the presence of Japanese vessels because of the data provided on location and catch. Cooperation has extended to joint ventures, assistance in the establishment of the tuna farm experiment, joint financing of external scientists, joint efforts in addressing the seabird bycatch problem, and reducing the catch of small tuna. However, the committee is not convinced that the subsidiary agreements need to be renewed on an annual basis. There are a number of benefits outlined in this report that would support a biennial or even a five-year agreement. To prevent the urgency provisions for tabling treaties from being invoked each year, the committee recommends that the agreements run for at least two years. The committee also believes that the current process may need to be revised to ensure that the delays experienced in signing last year's agreement do not become an annual event. Strong evidence to the inquiry supported the concept of the subsidiary agreement, with a number of submissions and witnesses requesting amendments or a gradual phasing out of Japanese access with progressive Australianisation. A number of witnesses requested additional fishing exclusion zones to facilitate local industry development. The committee supports this principle and believes that these changes should be implemented where Australian fishermen can demonstrate they have the capacity to utilise the resources in that area. In particular, the committee now supports the extension of the exclusion zone around Tasmania to 50 nautical miles. While the committee accepts that the Tasmanian fishing fleet may not yet have the capacity to fully utilise the tuna stocks in that region, the Australian fishing fleet does have that capaciyellowfin, ty. The committee is also concerned that a number of prime pelagic species are not included in subsidiary agreements. In some cases there is inadequate knowledge on the sustainability of tuna, billfish and swordfish species. The committee commends the research already in progress and supports a cautious approach in managing these stocks. In relation to environmental measures, the committee heard a number of concerns in relation to the bycatch of sharks, marlin and swordfish in SBT long-line operations. There is also a number of issues in relation to the administrative and legislative aspects of implementing conservation measures that need to be addressed. Of particular concern was the bycatch of seabirds, about which the committee has made a number of recommendations. The honourable member for Dickson e Mr Tony Smith) will deal with this in more detail. The committee received a number of submissions from the recreational and game fishing sector requesting the release of all marlin bycatch by long-line vessels-a request which the committee supports. Further work is needed into the relative economic values of these two sectors. The committee was provided with a number of conflicting views on the benefits and disadvantages of the bilateral arrangements. The committee believes that a full cost-benefit analysis should be undertaken to determine the true benefit of these agreements to both countries. SBT is a global fishery and requires continued cooperation to enhance its commercial benefits in a sustainable way and to protect endangered species. The second agreement to be considered in this report is the agreement for the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the IOTC. The formation of this commission continues the trend to form international management regimes for highly migratory tuna species in light of their vulnerability to fishing on the high seas. The IOTC will act as a regional fisheries management organisation for major international tuna fisheries for skipjack, bigeye, albacore and SBT. Membership is available to Indian Ocean rim countries and countries that fish in the Indian Ocean. While Australia will request that the IOTC recognise the competence of the CCSBT, there will be continuing pressure for the IOTC to playa role in the management of activities which will impact on SBT and other tuna stocks. Further, countries which do not currently belong to the CCSBT but have significant SBT catches may become members of the IOTC. The committee believes that Australia should become a party to the IOTC and that an instrument of acceptance be deposited on or before 2 December 1996. The committee also notes Western Australia's particular interest in the activities of the IOTC. It believes there is the capacity to have greater participation by the states and territories in the treaty process where the issues involved will significantly impact on the economy of those states. The committee therefore recommends that representatives from Western Australia be given the opportunity to participate in the delegation to, and consultations relevant to, the activities of the IOTC. On behalf of the committee chairman, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), I thank my colleagues on both sides of this place for their contribution, cooperation and counsel. I also acknowledge the great contribution of the secretariat and, in particular, Cheryl Scarlett. I commend the report to the House.",15
12,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Before calling the honourable member for Lyons I advise members and those in the gallery that the Russian spacecraft that has been threatening land forms in the Southern Hemisphere crashed into the southern Pacific Ocean at about 12.35 p.m. today. I thank the ABC for their timely advice.,18
13,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"I have been most interested in the discussions and the public consultations that have taken place concerning these two international treaties on tuna fishing. As the report says, the increasing complexity in global interactions may have implications far wider than the capacity of any single state to resolve. It is through the use of the treaty-making process that these interactions can be managed. Thus, the Treaties Committee's task is to develop arguments for bilateral negotiations between nations on issues that are of mutual interest and to make recommendations. In the process, I have learnt much about the Australian fishing industry. We were told, for instance, that the capacity of the Australian fishing industry has exceeded the abundance of local fish resources in some areas and that the industry has become increasingly dependent on migratory species which are found further offshore. We are beginning to come into conflict with the Japanese whose fishing vessels have for some time used the fish resources not usually exploited by the Australian fleet. But the resource has been dwindling and there needs to be a review to look at issues such as the sustainability of the stock and the importance of port access to port communities and the possibility of catching other species, and the bycatch of fish and birds. However, some fishermen believe that only a few boats are working the tuna and there is not the capacity to push the Japanese further out. Others have difficulties with getting quota or need funds to buy a quota. Then there are the difficulties with the gear conflict and the fact that there was little communication between the two countries' boats because of the language problems. The discussion resulted in recommendations that the exclusive zone be extended and that this would be further reviewed. It was also decided there should be discussions about the communications problem. The Tasmanian government believes that a 50 nautical mile extension would be beneficial to the local fishing industry as long as it does not have an impact on the number of Japanese fishing boats visiting the port. The proximity of fish to the Tasmanian coast depends on the presence of bait inshore and other climatic conditions. There are a number of conflicting views on the benefits and disadvantages of the bilateral agreements. It was thought that a full cost benefit analysis could be undertaken to determine the true benefit of these agreements to both countries. A number of issues may be resolved if this information is available. A gradual approach may be necessary until a cost benefit analysis is done on the impact of the bilateral agreement on the local commercial and recreational fishing industries. Our fishing industry is very important to us and this inquiry only highlighted the many problems of an industry that is reliant on the migratory habits of its resource coupled with what happens when other nations wish to share this resource. Fish do not know boundaries and planning to ensure there is a fair share for all is beset with difficulties. However, the committee believed it addressed some of the pressing points and I look forward to hearing the outcomes and recommendations from the government on our report. The difficulties of having a bycatch of birds, including the large albatross, is a great problem and the committee spent some time on the issue and took very good evidence in that regard. The accreditation system for fish which we have touched on in the report is one way that we should try to go in talks with other nations. An accreditation system, structured throughout the world, would start to eliminate those in the fishing industry who would be taking fish and bycatches that are unsustainable in the long term. I recommend the report to all members and look forward to the government's reply to the work undertaken for this report.",18
14,Mr TONY SMITH,COMMITTEES,"The albatross is not just a seabird. It is a colossus. It can live for 60 years and haps for longer. The wandering albatross can have a wingspan of more than 11 feet. It mates for life. It is warm, friendly, and a comfort to seafarers. My first trip at sea as a fourth engineer officer on the MV Kaituna presented me with that marvellous sight of the giant birds following the vessel-gliding, tipping the crests of the waves and never appearing to flap their enormous wings. These animals are the conscience of the sea; the sailors' friend. Their spirit is immortalised in Coleridge's famous work, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. And what happened when the miscreant sailor shot the albatross? Misery, starvation then death. We have not learnt from this. Most of the wandering albatross killed by long-line fishing vessels are young birds. The estimate of by kill of wanderers is about the same as the number of chicks reaching fledgling stage. This means there is no recruitment. Wanderers do not breed until they are 11 years old and they need to live to 30 years on average to replace themselves in their breeding population. My concern is that there appears to be a philosophy of minimisation, rather than an elimination of seabird bycatch. The committee has recommended that the commonwealth government expedites research into eliminating seabird bycatch as a matter of priority. These words were very carefully chosen. Long-line fishing intensified in the early 1960s but the effects on albatross were not detected until the mid-1980s. Eleven years later little progress has been made. The incidental catch of seabirds by long-line vessels was declared a key, threatening, process on 24 July 1995 under the Endangered Species Protection Act and 14 species of seabirds are potentially considered at risk. It is the only activity added to the ESP Act since it was enacted and it is the first key and threatening process to be listed that relates to the marine areas. To my horror, evidence given to the committee indicated that, globally, 44,000 albatrosses were killed annually through long-line fishing, more than 7,000 in Australian waters. This carnage must be stopped. Ongoing studies funded by the Commonwealth governper- ment have recorded only 16 to 20 pairs of wanderers breeding at Macquarie Island over the last two years. Under the ESPA another great three albatross species have been nominated for listing. Changes in long-line procedures, quotas or methods should always be evaluated for effect on effort. More hooks set translate to more bykills. So until mitigation measures are available that eliminate bycatch of seabirds the quota increases should not be granted. They should not be granted unless there is a demonstrated decrease in effort. Evidence to the committee indicates that none of the existing technologies can prevent seabird bykill and that a number of techniques may need to be applied simultaneously to reduce the level of bycatch. Australia is actively working on seabird bycatch through the Commission on the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna but this relies on Japan's agreement. Fishermen are also given publications such as Japanese cartoons 'Catch Fish not Birds' and the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service has been active in changing the overall culture towards seabird catches. The CCSBT has established an ecologically related species working group to enable consultation on technical details of bird mitigation measures in the high seas environment. Such consultation provides the opportunity to change behaviour on the high seas by consensus as it is appreciated that the EEZ is only a small part of the territory which is inhabited by the albatrosses. The Japanese and Taiwanese now use seabird mitigation measures on the high seas because it makes good economic sense. Any bycatch of seabirds has an economic impact. Obviously, if there is a bird on the line there should be a fish worth thousands dollars, it does not make sense to catch the bird. One of the main problems is getting adequate statistics on bird bycatch. The observer program cost $800,000 in 1995. It was suggested that observers undertake additional research, such as the use effectiveness of mitigation measures, while board. The use of specialist seabird observers could also accelerate technological and educaparticularly tional solutions. The committee recommended that a special observer training program be introduced with traditional emphasis on seabird research. The committee also recommended that the mendation Commonwealth government produce an easy to use guide for the identification of seabirds, to be issued to Japanese vessels-including joint venture vessels-at the time of preport fishing inspection. It was suggested to the committee that many of the subsidiary agreedevelopment ments should contain mandatory measures. However, it was argued that conservation organisations, including those that had signed the tori poles and the bait throwers, had resisted making these compulsory as believed making them voluntary would foolish promote their use on the high seas. The committee has been told that the Japanese have not been reluctant to put in place bird mitigation measures but I am disappointed to deliberations. read of the Japanese government's view at the world conversation congress in Montreal recently that they were not prepared to adopt the policy to 'reduce incidental seabird tality to insignificant levels'. There is also some doubt as to the effectiveness of mitigation devices presently available. (Time expired)",19
15,Mr MCCLELLAND,COMMITTEES,"Barton) (1.03 p.m.)I am also pleased to endorse this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I congratulate the commercial organisations and the voluntary organisations which presented some very detailed and usually very thoughtful submissions to the committee. While the committee members spent a number of hours on the report, the report clearly would not have eventuated in the expeditious fashion in which it has without the really first-class where research and preparation work done by the of secretariat. On the whole, I was also very impressed by the quality of evidence presented by the public servants involved in this area. Clearly they know their topic and they discharged their duties with professionalism. The committee made a number of recomand mendations which were perhaps taking a on different tack and had a different emphasis from that which previously had been taken, in three areas. The first was in respect of the recommendation to expand the fishing exclusion zone around Tasmania to 50 nautical miles and make it uniform with the rest of Australia. The second was the recomto extend the period of the head agreement to remove this ongoing pressure of annual negotiations and the third was to recommend the separation of the question of access from that of fishing quota access. The committee saw great potential in the of infrastructure in ports, particularly in Fremantle and Hobart. It is really a case of the state governments becoming deinvolved-and there may be an avenue for the Commonwealth government. But there is a they real risk of being penny wise and pound in not developing the infrastructure of those ports to encourage access by the maritime industry generally. That is something that could also constructively come from our I would like to congratulate in particular the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) for his efforts on the issue of bycatch. His speech morindicated the extent of the bycatch. It is clearly unacceptable. As the member for Dickson mentioned in his speech, the view of the committee was not to reduce the bycatch of albatross to an acceptable level but, rather, to eliminate that catch. In that context I also note with some concerns the mention by the member for Dickson of the apparent unwillingness of the Japanese government at a recent conference that occurred in Montreal to acknowledge that elimination of that bycatch was a goal that had to be worked towards. I read in the Sydney Morning Herald on the weekend that the issue of bycatch, unfortunately, is used as an argument by the Japanese government as justifying hunting dolphins. I read with distress that 75 bottle-nosed dolphins were: ... herded into nets, dragged from the water by crane and beheaded with a chainsaw. The carcasses were then gutted and packed in ice for the local sashimi bars, where raw fish is eaten. Witnesses said the trapped dolphins fought ferociously in nets trying to get free. In the gle, many were lacerated on synthetic lines. The Japanese government, in answer to complaints voiced by the international community, was inclined to say, 'Well, dolphins are caught anyway in the fishing industry,' and hence it was justifiable to go and hunt them. That is not justification at all. The issue of bycatch is very serious and unacceptable. The committee regarded that issue in its report with the great importance it deserved. I have pleasure in endorsing and commending the report.",20
16,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"O'Connor) (1.08 p.m.)Fish are a major international food resource and the Australian ocean environment is not conducive to an abundance of fish stocks. Unlike other resources, the surveillance of fish stocks is extremely difficult, particularly in regard to the important breeding stock. The collapse of the North Sea cod industry, which is as old as history, is an example of what has happened with the growth in technology in the fishing industry which now allows so much ease in identifying the availability of fish and their location. Some larger equipment is used today to fish all-weather when in the old days it would have heen impossihle to catch fish. I have often argued that possibly one of the greater conservation measures applicahle to the fishing industry would be to go hack to the old handline and one hook, hecause that method clearly sustained the fish stocks over the years. The exploitation of fish resources has been greatly expanded by that modern technology. Consequently, it is now incumbent on the governments of the world to jointly control this exploitation by agreements such as the treaty referred to in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties before the parliament today. The benefits of the initiative of the parliament taking an interest in our treaty making processes are highlighted by our being here today and this report which has opened this issue up significantly and very profitably for the Australian industry. Issues identified in this report should become the subject of further inquiry at the national level through strug- the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs. The issue of how the Australian fishing industry can better directly utilise the quota available to Australia under the system is beyond the responsibility of the treaties committee but is of great seriousness to Australia. Under these agreements, we have some 5,000tonnes of catchable entitlement, yet we are neither equipped nor able to exploit that. Consequently, we find these various joint venture arrangements and. others which return very little to Australia and raise other difficulties as identified in the report. I wanted to use a moment of my five minutes to mention the reference in recommendation 4 to the certificate system, which is an issue I raised on a number of occasions during the inquiry. When you get down to tintacks, the only effective form of control is at the point of consumption. This was recognised many years ago with the conservation of the Australian kangaroo. Professional shooters are issued with X number of tags and no kangaroo is marketable without a tag attached. Clearly, we have a major market to convince where tuna is either cannable at several cents a kilo or consumable as sashimi at hundreds of dollars a kilo-a fish worth tens of thousands of dollars on some occasions. That market is so attractive that, were the Japanese to cooperate with us on controlling it in a certificate or tagging system, we would see very clear international control of the exploitation of the southern bluefin and some of the other attractive sashimi tunas. The Japanese have a slightly different approach and the report identifies the problems associated with the certificate system. Were we to concede to the Japanese fishing industry a slightly larger catch as part of that certificate system, we could probably still achieve a lower international catch because we would not have those outside the agreement being able to profitably market this fish. The overall result might be that, by that system and arrangement, we achieve the cooperation of the Japanese and their market and see significant reduction in the catch and the conservation of the southern bluefin tuna, which would eventually benefit everybody in hopefully a growth and re-establishment of the breeding stock and the further availability of fish in the future. This is very important. I would like to endorse all those comments that have been made on the seabird and the marlin bycatch. All those recommendations are well worthwhile and need to be considered by other committees, including the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. (Time expired)",21
17,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"There is a great degree of commonality among the various speakers on this report from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. If there is a broad slant to the recommendations as opposed to the suggestion itself of the treaty, it is very much in the area of reduction of bycatch, the monitoring of boats, the ability of the Japanese to understand what is intended, observer training, specific written clearance from the Environment Protection Agency-if there are significant potential environmental impacts-and another recommendation in that broad policy area. If anything, an emphasis of the committee has been concern about bycatch and the impact on recreational fishing. Marlin is cited. The albatross has great difficulty replacing itself because of the impact of 44,000 deaths through this and other related fishing industries. I join with the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) in reiterating concern about reports in the Sydney media on the weekend about the Japanese attitude towards dolphins. In the context of the Japanese utilisation of arguments about science to justify a variety of measures that are essentially decreasing the international fish resource, there is a fair argument that Australia does have to be a bit more forthright in its representations to the Japanese. I do not think it is an argument about not understanding the rules, not understanding language, et cetera.",22

21,Mr NEHL,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House expresses its concern for the future of the timber industry and rural communities dependent on it. I commence by referring to a very significant ministerial statement given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 30 November 1995 relating to the future of our forests, which said among other things: ... as a nation we have a duty to preserve our high conservation old-growth forests and wilderness areasnobody would argue with thatEqually, we cannot as a nation undermine the confidence of an industry which is worth nearly $6 billion a year, which employs 70,000 Australians, mainly in rural and regional areas, and which has enormous potential for sustainable growth in the future. What the Prime Minister said on 30 November last year was absolutely correct then and is still correct now. It is interesting that the International Union for the Conservation of Nature agreed, at its conference at Caracas in 1992, to the protection of 10 per cent of our current forests. For some unknown reason the previous Labor government, under the leadership of the then minister Senator Faulkner, decided that we would preserve 15 per cent of the forests that we had in 1750 and not 10 per cent of our current reserves. That is not very sensible. I would now like to refer to the coalition's policy put forward during the election this year and which is now the policy of this government. We referred to the worthwhile objective of preserving 15 per cent of the distribution of each forest type which existed prior to European settlement. What we said about Senator Faulkner's proposition was that if we can do it we will do it, but there has to be flexibility. We went on to say in that policy: This target will be achieved easily in some areas. Indeed, in some it has already been exceeded or is likely to be exceeded with little or no disruption industry, employment and communities. However, in other areas, such as Northern NSW and parts of Queensland, the 15% target will be extremely difficult or impossible to achieve. In these stances, a Liberal-National Government will give full and proper consideration to the potential on people's lives, as well as the economic impact on the wider community. That part of our policy is a direct quote from the Prime Minister's statement on 30 November last year. Regrettably, the forest industry in Australia, and in particular in northern New South Wales, faces absolute decimation due to the lack of supply and the lack of resource security. The federal government has provided the last opportunity for sustainable forestry to continue in New South Wales. The recent RACAC report commissioned by the New South Wales state government, which was supposed to be an interim report, was seized upon by the New South Wales government. It unilaterally declared 12 new wilderness areas, totalling 153,430 hectares, and 10 new national parks, totalling 168,078 hectares. They have also reserved an additional 671,000 hectares of state forests from logging for future assessment. I think it is very appropriate that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, has made it clear that the Commonwealth was particularly concerned about those new wilderness area and national park declarations and the further reductions in resource supply to industry during the comprehensi ve original assessment process and the so-called five by five quota guarantees. He is quite right to be concerned about that. The reality is that state forest groups did not know of many of the new national parks before they were declared, but some of the environmental groups not only knew the details of them but also had the maps of them. What concerns me is the lack of credible scientific research into the new national parks. I ask the New South Wales state government: who did the assessments? A lot of people in my area believe that those assessments of wilderness areas were carried out by unqualified university students. I would like to know whether that is true. I would not be surprised to because I recall that a major assessment funded by Senator Faulkner when he was the minister was done by people without stated qualifications and with thanks to Natalie. circum- Honourable members might remember this impact because I highlighted it at the time. Mr Cansley-One of them was a mine with a homestead in the middle.",22
22,Mr NEHL,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Exactly. We need to know who did those assessments. If those RACAC proposals are adopted by the New South Wales government, as much as 80 per cent of our forests will be lost. We have had a forest industry in this country for decades. In northern New South Wales, which I know extremeIy well, the state forest organisations have managed the forests marvellously. It has been sustainable forestry with jobs with the environment preserved as well. We need to make sure that the flexibility that the honourable minister has already spoken about is observed so that we do not lock our forest areas into a situation where jobs are totally lost. The extent of the areas set aside for further assessment means early cutting of regrowth. We are not allowed to take any decent size trees, so we have to go into plantation areas 15 or 20 years too early and cut down timber that is not big enough to do the job, that is not appropriate. Not only are we not able to satisfy the need for timber right now, but we are also creating an enormous problem down the track because we are cutting stuff that should not be cut for 20 or 25 years. What are we going to do when what is supposed to be cut has already been taken? The early regrowth cut that is taking place now will take at least 15 to 20 years to recover from. Quota mills have had their quotas cut by 50 per cent for the next five years, yet they are expected to expand and invest in value adding. It is not on. Unless there is some resource security, how can they spend the vast amounts of money that are required? Salvage mills-the mills that take the smaller timber that is used for pallets and palings-have no guarantee of supply. Previously they operated under an annual licence. Now they do not even have an annual licence to go by. Five North Coast salvage mills in the Dorrigo area pay $1.4 million in royalties to State Forests, but are unsure whether they are going to be able to keep operating. Has the state government done anything to consider how they are going to replace the royalties which they are losing? The annual Dorrigo quota has been reduced from 58,000 cubic metres to 15,000 cubic metres-almost a 75 per cent reduction. The quota price per cubic metre varies between $30 and $55-an average price of $42.50. In the Dorrigo area, the average royalties paid to State Forests will be reduced from $2,465,000 to $637,000-an enormous drop, just in one little area. I am referring to Dorrigo because it is a prime example, but the same situation applies right across the forest areas. Wages for Dorrigo district forest operations in 1995-96 were $25 million. At a 50 per cent reserve option, those wages will drop to $5 million. Another area to which the New South Wales government has given no consideration is the number of cattle that are grazed in state forests. Of course, people who are not aware of this would not know about it. This is the only land that these cattle have to graze on, and the farmers are operating under leases. There is no consideration of the 10,700 cattle in the Grafton rural lands area and another 8,000 in the Glen Innes area. What we have to do is make sure that the forest industries of Australia are sustainable, that they have flexibility, and that we do not continue down this mad path-advanced by Senator Faulkner and followed up by the New South Wales Labor government-of shutting up the forests, killing the towns that depend on them and putting people out of work. People and jobs are just as important as the environment and forests.",23
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded? Mr Nairn-Yes, and I reserve my right to speak.",24
24,Mr ADAMS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The motion moved by the member for Cowper is: That this House expresses its concern for the future of the timber industry and rural communities dependent on it. This issue of forestry and the importance of the industry to our economy will not go away. Since I was elected in 1993 I have been working with forestry groups to come up with some solutions for a sustainable forest industry. Sustainability is not just allowing large amounts of woodchips to be shipped overseas. It means that we must look at all levels of the industry, from the work in the forests selecting areas for harvesting to the preparation of the ground for replanting, the protection of the soil against erosion, the care and maintenance for growing young trees, the harvesting, the training that we need and the training in the new ways that we are doing things, the sorting of the timber, and the downstream processing and value adding. That is when a lot of our rural and regional communities will gain the most-when we add more to our forestry process. I am from Tasmania, which has 3.2 million hectares covered by native forests-about half of the total land area of the state. We have been particularly diligent in ensuring that our forests are properly harvested and maintained. Thirty per cent of this area is available for wood production. The national forest policy statement and the regional forestry agreements are ideal tools for fostering investment in value adding in the forest industries. I have been very disappointed in the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for not so far being able to deliver investment in forest based industries. There is a real disappointment that the statements that have been delivered have not gone to the heart of adding value. To every industry and every raw resource we have, we must add value. Rural Australia needs to have investment in value adding to ensure that we get the most value for one of our prime resources and not just make it an easy path for the export of unprocessed forest products. We have done that in the past with commodities, and still do. We are a great exporter of commodities. But the time has come to add value wherever we can. Hardwood based forest industries are substantially more significant to Tasmania's economy than they are to other states' economies. In 1994-95, according to the summary report of the Tasmania-Commonwealth regional forestry agreement, the hardwood based industries contributed just over eight per cent of the state's gross state product. The direct and indirect contribution was estimated at about 17 per cent of GSP in 1989. Since then, there has been a steady growth of our forest based industries. As well, the industry directly employs 6,580 people, and if you add the downstream processing and related sectors the potential of this industry is great. For a state that has such high consistent unemployment-IO.7 per cent this year-we cannot afford to throwaway opportunities. Investment in the forest industry can also mean assistance to revitalising our country and our regional communities. The summary report also states: Residents living in communities which are highly dependent on the forest industry were concerned about employment for themselves and their children. We know that those who live in timber communities-and you would know this in your own seat, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl-go on to work in the industry for generations, but we have to get into the new training and the new ways as there are a lot of new things to do in the timber and forest industries. Such communities were afraid that many further reductions in key industry sectors would act to affect the physical and social infrastructure of their area. But to encourage companies, big and small, to invest or to expand in Tasmania requires the federal government's commitment to ensure that some incentive is put into Tasmania or, indeed, anywhere else in Australia. Tasmania has heard endless discussions on the proposed pulp mill to be built, and a feasibility study is being done at the present moment, but the incentives for investment look pretty bleak. Take as an example the budget cutbacks that have caused many industries to look to invest not only in other states but also in other countries. The $600 million cut from national road funding can also have an effect on an operation like that. There has been a $1.8 million cut from labour market programs. Much of this money was spent in rural and regional areas where the market is not providing the opportunities for people to gain jobs. Those labour market programs were used in Tasmania to get some retraining and the new ways of training people in the forest based industries. We used some of that money in those areas. The abolition of bounties will really hurt the newly emerging industries in Tasmania, the very ones we need to get job growth in the state. There is also the impact of cuts to the financial assistance grants that help to support and maintain our infrastructure-some $30 million over three years. This leads to apprentices not being taken on, expansion of companies not being encouraged and research and development being lost to Australia. Many overseas countries are offering R&D opportunities at 100 per cent, ISO per cent and, I also understand, at 200 per cent, and other tax breaks. So, by cutting our R&D opportunities to 125 per cent, we are really no longer in the market. By merely extending the woodchip licences for three years instead of one is not going to solve the problem. The regional forest agreements must be pursued with great vigour around the states and finalised. Those areas that must be reserved for one reason or another to ensure sustainability of the quality of the forest and its health should also be completed. Areas that were identified as being in the eastern coastal zone and the peppermint country need to be finally assessed and compensation organised. Many are still waiting to know whether they can use their land, whether they can clear their land or whether they will receive compensation if the government wants the land for a reserve. Those areas need to be finalised and finalised reasonably quickly. A quick turnaround process is needed for compensation so that it does not last for years and years. Many farmers have been waiting to finalise their farm plans and many may even have to relocate their farms if too much of their land is cut or taken away. There are many issues that need to be pulled together until we are out of the woods, so to speak. There is no other industry that can be brought into play to replace this one and the role it plays; nor would we want to replace it. As Tasmania is the cleanest, disease free grower of the best salmon in the world, and I hope that will not change, so can we be the cleanest, disease free timber producer to the world-and not only in timber but also in downstreaming the waste wood to develop a whole range of goods. Already, Tasmania exports in printing and writing paper more than half the nation's total export earnings in this category. Now we need to include fine timbers, furniture and kraft paper, plus develop the skills of craftspeople to go with them. I am concerned about the industry, but it will survive with the right policies. I am concerned about what this government wilI do to ensure that it is sustainable, that people are compensated properly where reserves are taken out, that we have incentives to ensure investment in the industry is kept up, that the downstream processing for the industry-the modernisation of the industry-wilI take place and that the government wilI give incentive to that happening and wilI give the opportunities for our companies that are presently in it to continue in it. (Time expired)",24
25,Mr NAIRN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am very pleased to speak in favour of this motion moved by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). Like the member for Cowper, I too represent an electorate that has-or, should I say, had-a significant hardwood industry. The impact on those towns that have relied heavily on that industry has been devastating. The great tragedy in all of this is it did not have to be. There is no good scientific reason for what has gone on over the past decade or, more particularly, for what has gone on over the past five years. History wilI eventually judge the governments who are responsible very harshly, I am sureand so it should. We have seen the greatest con. We have seen the emotions of urban dwelIers whipped up into a frenzy such that the perception was created that forestry was a bad industry. As a result, we have seen the spectacle of the so called conservationists leaving their comfortable city houses-houses which probably have plenty of hardwood in them-to travel to the country for the adventure of protesting against the forestry industry and, of course, resuming those comfortable urban jobs upon their return, for those who had jobs. These people have little knowledge of just how forest management works and they are not really interested either. Although their organisers claim they support a sustainable industry, their actions are otherwise. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said recently: They have one objective: the cessation of all logging in native forests. Governments should not kid themselves otherwise. It is a fact. It is there in black and white, for example in the Australian Conservation Foundation's forest policy adopted by its council in May 1995. What this means of course, is that governments ought to treat with healthy scepticism any statements by groups such as the ACF that imply they support native forest industry or even the objectives of the national forest policy statement. Through the actions of such groups, a generation of myths and misinformation about the management of our forests has been built up, with the end result being the former labour government making political decision after political decision in an attempt to win the votes of the so-called conservationists, who are predominantly in urban seats-all at the expense of our rural communities. It is so frustrating to visit towns like Eden and Bombala and witness the impact that those decisions have had on the peoplehardworking, honest people thrown out of work. But the former Labor government, in their usual socialist way, said, 'Don't worry. We will look after you.' 'Look after you' means, 'Pay you some money and make you dependent on the government.' No wonder the previous government was going out the back door financially. Here was an industry that had the capacity to be sustainable, an industry in which we were already importing more timber products than we were exporting and they went all out to close it right down so that our trade deficit got worse-plus the fact that more money had to be made available to pay the people not to work. No wonder there were such large swings against Labor in March. People did not want handouts; they wanted jobs. At least we have started to tum this around. But the Labor Party still does not understand. When we brought in new export woodchip regulations, they were based on science rather than politics. The Labor Party opposed them. And what did the union, the CFMEU, say about such a move by Labor? To quote Trevor Smith of that union in a press release: The ALP's lack of understanding of the importance of the forest and forest products industry to region-l Australia coupled with its willingness to use the mdustry as a political football will ensure that voters, especially those in regional Australia, will continue to keep the ALP in opposition. At least the union understands the impact on the communities, as much as we also understand that the battle from here on is with the Carr Labor government in New South Wales-Carr, who thinks that NSW stands for Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong. Be assured: we will battle to protect our towns. As we complete the regional forest agreement process, the Commonwealth will be ensuring that the social impact on communities will go to the top of the priority list, not the bottom. As Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace, recently stated: There was not one proven instance of an animal species becoming extinct due to commercial forestry. The real species in danger of extinction are rural communities. (Time expired)",26
26,Mr MOSSFIELD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am speaking on this motion to add my support for efforts to maintain high levels of employment in the timber industry. Timber communities in New South Wales range from the Victorian border to the Queensland border. Major timber centres include Eden in the south-east and Grafton in the north. Large towns like these are usually surrounded by smaller hamlets which subsist almost entirely on timber. In New South Wales, a report on the social impact of the logging debate was undertaken by the Resource and Conservation Assessment Council for the state's interim assessment process. This study revealed that timber communities were suffering enormous levels of internal stress which related directly to potential job losses. The report also confirmed something which the CFMEU said-and I am pleased to see that the role of the CFMEU has been recognised by speakers on the other side-whose research had also previously found that many workers who lost their jobs following the 1982 decision not to log in certain areas are still out of work some 14 years later. It is in the smaller rural hamlets that the effects are most noticeable. When mills close in these hamlets, long periods of unemployment follow. The reason for this prolonged period of unemployment is that, in some sections of the industry, relatively low levels of numeracy and literacy exist which impact severely on the potential of retrenched workers to access alternative employment. When a mill closes, there are major secondary effects in local husinesses due to the withdrawal of a significant level of the local economy's disposable interest. This leads to further job losses through an imposed and localised recession. which means that local employment opportunities in other industries such as retail hecome much more scarce. The Labor movement, I must emphasise, supports a halanced environmental policy which protects the forests and the environment but also recognises the needs of the workers in the industry. I now refer to the New South Wales government's Resource and Conservation Assessment Council's social impact study. This study clearly details the vulnerahility of New South Wales country towns and the effect that logging restrictions have on local communities. This interim forestry assessment process is to identify forests that may be set aside from the logging so that they remain options for inclusion in a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. All the five timher towns included in the study have been experiencing economic stagnation for a number of years. In some cases, this is directly related to the timber industry, such as in Wauchope and Bulahdelah. In other cases. the timber industry is just one factor, such as in Narooma and Kempsey. However, the experience of a stagnating economy is something they all have in common. While it could turn out that actual job losses in several of these towns will be gradual and may affect a relatively small proportion of the work force, continuing uncertainty and lack of information have outcomes of their own, including helplessness and fear, lack of confidence and lack of hope. In gencral, unemployment in timber towns is higher than the New South Wales average. Among the unemployed group arc a considerahle gfllup of long-term unemployed people. In many cases, t()wnspeople arc apt to say that they have given up. As these are the skilled amongst the work force, they are regarded as having left the work force forever. The Aboriginal community, in particular, suffers in periods of high unemployment. The study showed that, when things are bad for the non-indigenous community, they are significantly worse for the Aboriginal community. The brain drain from these communities has been hastened",27

NA His All Holiness The Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church: Visit",28
28,Mr LEO MCLEAY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week we welcomed into this parliament the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox faith, His All Holiness Bartholomeos I, who is visiting Australia. He is the spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. There are about 700,000 adherents to that faith here in Australia. This was the first visit by an ecumenical patriarch to Australia since Orthodox Christians arrived here in this country about 176 years ago. His All Holiness will be visiting all states as a guest of the government. Next week he will be in my electorate visiting two Greek Orthodox communities there: St Basil's Homes at Lakemba and All Saints College at Belmore. St Basil's Homes is an undertaking of the Greek archdiocese in Sydney and is very ably administered by Father Kapetas. All Saints College is an undertaking of the Belmore parish of the Greek Orthodox church in Sydney. It is very well run by the community there and is a credit to the community. The Ecumenical Patriarch is well known around the world. He was born in 1940. He attended the Halki Theological School in Istanbul, entered the priesthood in 1961 and continued his studies in Rome, where he least completed a PhD in canon law. He was named Metropolitan of Philadelphia in the US in 1973. Since 1974 he has been a member of the Holy Synod. He has also served as Chairman of the World Council of Churches' Commission on Faith and Order. His visit to Australia has been very welcomed by the Greek Orthodox community.

It gives me a great deal of pleasure to inform the members present that a business in my electorate of Bowman is one of the finalists. Lumascape Lighting Industries manufactures outdoor lighting and accessories for both the domestic and foreign markets. The company began exporting in 1991 and has built up its export earnings to almost three quarters of a million dollars a year. At present, 30 to 35 per cent of Lumascape's production is going offshore. It is winning market share in five countries from New Zealand to Indonesia and is continuing to probe further markets overseas and in Australia. The company is currently embarking on further research and recently invested in its first industrial robot which has been installed in its Capalaba factory. I had the pleasure of being present when Lumascape received the Premier's award, which is the State Export Award. Winning the Premier's award has given Lumascape automatic entry into the national finals which will be held tomorrow night in the Great Hall. These awards are highly prized. Over the years they have identified many of our country's best companies and have highlighted their drive for international best practice. The Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) will be presenting the awards in six categories: new exporter, Telstra services, small to medium manufacturers, large manufacturer, Austrade agricultural products and mineral products. (Time expired) Western Australian Election",29
30,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The spectre of crime is a blight on all of our communities around the country-in particular, drug trafficking. The effective fight against crime depends on two fundamental principles: the fear of being caught and the fear of the likely punishment. The Economist magazine recently pointed out that you are more likely to be the victim of a number of serious criminal offences in Australia than you are in the United States. I might point out that, in a number of key criminal areas, Western Australia has a much higher crime rate than other parts of Australia. In 1993 the then Western Australian Liberal Party government promised 800 extra police officers in Western Australia. The West Australian newspaper recently did an audit which showed that in 1993 there were 4,211 sworn police officers and that in 1996 there were 4,561, which is an increase of only 350. That leaves a deficit of 450 from those promised in 1993. This is why we need more quality Independent Liberals like Phil Pendal, Liz Constable and Reg Davies in the Western Australian parliament. I can only urge voters to vote for Penny Hearne in Alfred Cove, Peter Kyle in Carine and Leslie Parker in Roe to keep the Western Australian Court government, which is likely to re-elected, to its promises.

It was a very beneficial seminar. I take this opportunity to publicly congratulate those who were involved in the organisation of it: in particular, Admiral David Leach, who is the President of the Australia-Papua Crime New Guinea Friendship Association; my colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair); and a number of others including Tom Critchley, a retired long serving diplomat with particular interest and experience in Papua New Guinea.

34,Mr MILES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister)-A letter was published in the Australian on Friday, 15 November which drew attention to the futility of the recent speech by former Prime Minister Paul Keating lecturing the country about his big picture. The letter rightly points out that Australians have been affronted by the pace of the forced social changes of the 1980s with their built-in insults about who and what we are and assumptions of guilt about our history. Australians are not impressed with the array of self-styled experts clustered around the former Prime Minister, who insistently tells us what is good for us or what we should be as a society. Even after his resounding defeat, the former Prime Minister cannot resist the temptation to do this. Australia's culture and identity are purely and simply the product of the collective everyday experiences of all Australians, not what the former Prime Minister Keating wants to dictate to us. Australians do not need an identity especially manufactured by the 'Bankstown Bonaparte', as the letter states. The task of government is to create the conditions of stability and prosperity so that Australians can create their own future with a sense of security and optimism. In regard to that which the former speaker, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), was talking about, that involves creating jobs and maintaining jobs. In regard to Howe Leather, it was the previous government that created the problem Howe Leather now has. I suggest the member goes back to the previous Prime Minister and talks to him.

The member  cleansing rate of unexploded munitions, expressed as a percentage, can be achieved on firing ranges? The Minister for Defence-this is recorded in the Hansard from last Thursday-replied: No definite rate of detection or clearance costs timings can be provided ... This makes me wonder. If the government cannot guarantee the complete clearance of unexploded bombs from the Holsworthy Firing Range in south-west Sydney, what is the point of conducting a $12 million environmental impact statement into the site of Sydney's second international airport? From day one this was a crazy plan. It has been made crazier by the news that the government cannot guarantee the clearance of the unexploded bombs on the firing range. The EIS is now a farce. Now the government's folly is hurting people throughout the Campbelltown local government area. The northern Holsworthy option points two 4,000-metre runways at Glenfield and Macquarie Fields, causing uncertainty and anguish among thousands of families in my electorate. The southern Holsworthy option points the same two 4,000metre runways at the southern suburbs of Campbelltown, primarily in the electorate of Macarthur. I call on the member for Macarthur, Mr Fahey, to join with me and his Liberal colleague Danna Vale in opposing Holsworthy outright, opposing the deceit of the government for not telling people about this option before the election and opposing the hurt it is now visiting on thousands of families in the south-west of Sydney.

I am very keen to see that we return the good coalition government in Western Australia, because we know that their record is excellent compared with that of the previous incumbent. We know that, in the coalition government's term, unemployment is the lowest in Australia, they have balanced the bUdget-unlike the bankcard mentality of the previous government-they now have triple A rating, which was taken off them before, and they have committed themselves and come good in terms of delivering the number of police in the law and order issue. When it comes to law and order, the Labor Party in and Western Australia have no credibility because it was under them that law and order blew out. It is nice to see the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, in the House. I wonder why he is trying to get involved in a state election, using federal issues to try to have something to say. This is the same person who helped the Labor Party in Western Australia be reduced to three seats. The joke was: 'How do you turn a safe Labor seat into a marginal seat? You ask Kim Beazley to stand for it.' Let us see Western Australian return a good government with the good management which the coalition has offered that state in its last few years. (Time expired). Immigration: Ms Angela Lea",31
37,Mr KERR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"After the Senate disallowed a number of migration regulations, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) put out a provocative press release saying: ... for the first time in history, an elected Government will not be allowed to do its job of managing the Migration Program. That was false. There is nothing in the disallowance that prevents the government from meeting its target of overall immigration. The press release also said that the measures would 'help to restore public confidence in the program'. That was very good rhetoric Election and was accepted on face value by some media. But the human face of this is very different. The human face of this is baby Samuel, a seven-month-old child, son of Angela Lea, a young woman who came to Australia at age five as a British immigrant, who has lived in Australia as a permanent resident and whose child was born in the United Kingdom while she was away briefly on a working holiday. She has been told that, because of the new regulations brought in by this government, she should come back to Australia and leave her seven-month child in the United Kingdom for 18 months so that she can apply for sponsorship after she takes out Australian citizenship. These measures were unconscionable. They were recognised as being unconscionable by the now minister when he spoke in opposition. These are measures that are unnecessary, and the minister's actions in this way would have left thousands of families and the half million permanent residents of Australia of British background and the million Australian permanent residents overall in a position which is completely unconscionable. No wonder the Sunday Herald-Sun said, 'The concept is astonishing, even inhuman.'",31
38,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being approximately 2 p.m., in accordance with sessional order 106A the time for members' statements has concluded. NA",32
39,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, the following ministers will be absent from question time: the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer), the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran). The Minister for Trade will be represented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government will be represented by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr lull), the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) will answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) will answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Science and Technology. NA",32
40,Mr HOWARD,RUSSIAN SPACE PROBE," Mr Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House simply to confirm something that I think would now be known to honourable members in that there does appear to have been what we all hope is a happy ending to the saga of the Russian space probe. As the House will know, this morning I was telephoned by President Clinton, who briefed me to the effect that, according to the best calculations of the American space authorities, this particular probe would come to earth in north-central Australia. There were varying interpretations of exactly where and the location of the possible landing shifted from a north-central Australia to other parts of Australia. At one stage the most likely touchdown point was going to be somewhere near Tibooburra. A number of emergency arrangements were set in train. I want to thank the defence authorities and also the atomic energy authorities for the advice that was given. As things turned out, it having seemed likely for some time that it would touch down in Australia and that some of the debris may have exposed Australian citizens to risk-a matter the government had to take contingency arrangements against, and I did take the opportunity of briefing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and also the Premier of Queensland and the Premier of New South Wales on the circumstances of the matter-in the final analysis, we were advised by the American authorities that the debris had impacted in the south-west Pacific, some 1,300 miles west of Santiago, at 12.34 p.m. eastern summer time. I am also delighted to report the publican at Tibooburra provided free beers for all his customers on hearing that news.",32
41,Mr BEAZLEY,RUSSIAN SPACE PROBE," Mr Speaker, could I associate myself with those remarks. I appreciate the fact very much that we were kept in touch with that, but grateful not to have been kept in touch with the various peregrinations that the predictions went through-from somewhere between the Timor Sea and south of New Zealand. If we had been kept up-to-date on that on an hourly basis, we could have opened a book on it at the end of the day. However, I particularly associate myself with the remarks made on the defence personnel that were put on alert for it. I am sure they would have handled it well had the need arose. NA Wage Increases",32
42,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to his comments on 25 June 1995 in which he claimed that low paid workers would be worse off after receiving $14 per week which was proposed by the previous Labor government. How can the minister now claim that the same worker will not be worse off after receiving a mere $8 per week wage increase each year? In fact, after three years won't the same worker be receiving about $1,000 less per year under the Howard government's proposal?",32
43,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased that the government, as the Prime Minister made very clear yesterday, will make a submission to the Industrial Relations Commission supporting a pay increase for the low paid in the context of the living wage application made by the ACTU to the Industrial Relations Commission. It is unequivocally a complete fulfilment of the promises that we made in the last election in our support for people who are low paid and, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, completely rebuts the scare campaign constantly run by the Labor Party that the coalition government would not support pay increases. We support this pay increase because it is fair and reasonable. The Leader of the Opposition refers to statements I made back in June 1995, which I do not resile from. In fact, I have a copy of the press release which I issued at that time. The point I made at that very point in time was that Labor's accord deals had constantly produced for low income people reductions in their real wages-because that was your system in operation. What incredible gall for the Labor Party to talk to us about the wages of the low paid when their system for years and years not only delivered reductions in real wages for ordinary workers but, in fact, left a lot of them unemployed as a result. The point I made at that time was that also other aspects of the accord bore careful scrutiny. The government then announced a 'strong - ommitment' to workplace bargaining but lmmediately broke the commitment by providing for across-the-board increases in various sectors. The point needs to be made that not only are we supporting the jurisdiction of the commission to grant safety net wage increases, not only are we putting up a fair and reasonable figure for the low paid, but on top of that we are making the big structural changes in the system which, genuinely, will give people the opportunity at work to sit down and come to a deal which can underpin real wage increases in the future, instead of the fraudulent claims you made year in year out, offering illusory dollars soon lost and wiped away by tax increases and through the CPI as it operated under Labor. Mr Speaker, if you look at C 14, which was the lowest of the metal industry award numbers under that arrangement, the figure actually represents about 2.3 per cent. That is a figure very much commensurate with the CPI, now running at about 2.1 per cent; so in fact it maintains real living wages for those particular employees. But, with the big system changes that we have in place, it really provides people with the prospect of real wage gains across the economy as we pick up the productivity benefits of the package which the government has in place. Lastly, let me say that that is, of course, without reference to the other benefits of the government's program also being put in place, which will provide significant improvements in conditions for the low paid. You only have to look at the tremendous benefits for the low paid who are purchasing their own homes with the reduction in interest rates since 2 March-something you were never able to deliver. On the figures which the Treasurer has, you are looking at about 140 bucks a month for the average family. Mr Costello-It is $145 after tax.",33
44,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is after tax dollars-140 bucks a month. What is that per week-35 bucks a week-a massive benefit. On top of that, and I am sure we will hear more from others, look at the benefits of the family tax initiative which will come in on 1 Januaryreal dollars in people's pockets of particular assistance to the low paid. For years and years you people have claimed that you represent the ordinary, low paid working Australian, but the fact is for years and years you betrayed the trust of those people and they are worse off as a result. It is no wonder that on 2 March they left you in droves.",33
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. You have just put our reputation back. You refer in your answer to ordinary workers being better off as a result of recent interest rate reductions. Isn't it a fact that, according to the ABS household expenditure data, only 16.5 per cent-or one in seven-of households earning average weekly earnings or below are in fact paying off mortgages and cannot hope to benefit directly from the interest rate cuts at all?",34
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister's response to the first question was complete, and I do not think that your attempt to put a supplementary question enhances that matter. Zaire: Rwanda",34
47,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given the fact that some countries have been considering sending troops to help restore stability in Zaire, what is the position of the Australian government, and are we likely to contribute to any international efforts?",34
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, in answer to the honourable member for Groom, it is true that last week, as a result of the initiative a number of countries, proposals were set in train for the establishment of a multinational force to be commanded by Canada and agreed initially to include detachments from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and a number of other countries. Subsequently that force received what is known as a chapter 7 mandate from the United Nations Security Council. Since then, however, there has, by all of the news reports and all of the intelligence guidance, been a very dramatic change in the situation on the ground in Zaire and Rwanda. Last Thursday the situation changed very dramatically. The Hutu militia were separated from the refugees they had controlled by other Tutsi forces in Zaire, and they appear to have moved or fled westward. That has allowed the movement of unarmed refugees back into Rwanda. The best estimates so far are that more than 400,000 people have gone through the checkpoint at Goma and re-entered Rwanda. There are still some 600,000 refugees at various locations in Zaire. The initial indications are that the refugees returning to Rwanda will be welcomed back by the government of that country, although it has to be said at this early stage that the situation which itself changed so dramatically a few days ago could, in tum, change very dramatically again. There are mixed views in the world community about what should now be the appropriate response. Some will argue that the original purpose of the multinational force was to create a corridor so that relief could be got through to the refugees. Now that their tormentors have been driven away and the refugees have been able to return to Rwanda, many-including some people in the Rwandan government-are arguing that the presence of foreign troops, a multinational force, is no longer needed. Australia for her part has continued to follow the situation very closely. We have been in regular consultation with the Canadians, the United Nations and the United States. At this moment it is a situation which is too fluid and too unpredictable for Australia to make a definite decision as to what kind of of commitment, if any, ought to be made, particularly when the circumstances of the force to which we might be committing is itself a matter of very significant doubt. Australia has a very proud record, I might say, under governments of both political persuasions, of making very fine contributions to peacekeeping and other activities of that kind, and the disposition would, of course, be on the part of the government to look at the merits of any proposal that may be before us according to the circumstances as we assess them at the time. I can merely report to the House that we continue to have a very active watching brief on the situation. I hope from a humanitarian point of view the early signs that the refugees are being received back into their former homeland in a peaceful, welcoming fashion turns out to be the lasting situation. It had all the dimensions of one of the great human tragedies of this century. The people of that area have already suffered immensely-more than a million died in the genocide of 1994-and anything that people can do to relieve the suffering of this fragment of humanity is very welcome. Australia has already provided about $2.6 million in aid. Most of that money-in fact, I think all of it-will go to non-government organisations which are doing a remarkably effective job in the area. Australia stands ready to consider further contributions of that kind according to the circumstances as they arise. The Australian defence forces have been instructed to take precautionary measures to shorten the deployment time if that were to become necessary. I have in mind there that a number of defence personnel will be undergoing inoculations against the diseases that are present in that area so that, if a decision to commit Australian units in different capacities is taken in the future, because of those precautionary measures, the deployment time can thereby be shortened. Wage Increases",34
49,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to the case of a principal technibehind cal officer under the metal trades industry award whose award rate of pay is $691.50 per week. Isn't it the case that under the government's industrial relations regime any such worker who is unable to win a wage increase under enterprise bargaining will receive no wage increase at all over the next three years? Doesn't this mean that these workers' real wages will fall by approximately $50 per week over the next three years?,35
50,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The simple schema which the government has been advocating is that what we should have in place is a safety net for the low paid. What we are saying to the Industrial Relations Commission is that, in their maintena?ce of a genuine safety net for the low prud, there ought to be a cut-off point at which, and below which, the low paid receive the benefit of that award increase. Clearly, for those who are above the safety net, over time their wages position ought to be the subject of agreement making with their employer. That is the system we are trying to construct. In fact, that is the system that Paul Keating said was a good idea back in 1993. And what happened after he said that? The ACTO, and basically three-quarters of the front bench who came out of the union movement, did him over, because the last thing you wanted was a system where you had agreement making as being the key, if you like, to higher productivity and therefore the underpinning of better wages growth. Why don't you wake up to the reality that the centralised system, which you ran for years and years and which the ACTO prevented you from walking away from, failed to provide people with the real increases in wages which you claim that you have been supporting for years? That is the fact of the matter. One of the big changes that Australia needs to undertake if people are going to have higher wages in the future is that we get away from this idea that the Industrial Relations Commission can have a hearing in Sydney or Melbourne, wave a magic wand and say that everybody gets a pay increase regardless of their circumstances. Rhetorically, in principle, your former Prime Minister supported that proposition. Clearly, from the assumption your question, you have now regressed from the position which he publicly advanced back in 1993. We make no apology for saying that what we ought to have in the wages system is a fair set of minimum conditions under the jurisdiction and the responsibility of the Industrial Relations Commission, but beyond that people ought to be responsible for their own terms and conditions and thus be given an incentive to sit down and directly negotiate their terms and conditions with their employer. That is the way ahead. You publicly in the past supported that and, if we are now seeing a regression in your policy position, it is about time you came clear with it.",35
51,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask a supplementary question. Given that the minister did not refer to my question, could you take the facts which I have quoted on notice and see whether you can in any way refute any of the facts in that question.",35
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister for Industrial Relations has been invited to take the question on notice and I am sure he is prepared to do so.,35
53,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, in response to your invitation, let me say that I have given the shadow minister a complete and full answer. If he wants a further answer, I suggest he put out another one of his press releases. President of the United States of America",36
54,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the parliament of the details of the visit to Australia by President Clinton? What is the significance of this visit to the close relationship that we have with the United States of America?,36
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that all members of the House will welcome the visit to Australia, only the third such visit by a serving United States President. The President and his wife will arrive at 7.15 p.m. tomorrow night and will be accorded a ceremonial welcome at Sydney airport. On Wednesday, 20 November, President and Mrs Clinton will visit the Australian War Memorial to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. They will then call on the Governor General and Lady Deane before arriving at Parliament House at 10.30 a.m. The President and I will then hold discussions and then there will be discussions between himself and members of my cabinet. Following a joint press conference there will be a state lunch in the Great Hall which will briefly be addressed by me, the Leader of the Opposition and the President. He will then meet separately with the Leader of the Opposition and address a joint sitting at 4.00 p.m. Mr and Mrs Clinton will then return to Sydney and attend a small dinner cruise hosted by my wife and me on Sydney Harbour. On Thursday, 21 November, it is expected that the President and I will speak in the afternoon at a public function, the details of which are currently being finalised. Mrs Clinton will separately address a group at the Sydney Opera House on Thursday afternoon. The President and Mrs Clinton will depart for Cairns and Port Douglas on the evening of 21 November. They will have some private time at Port Douglas prior to their departure for Manila on Saturday. I think all Australians have great regard for the relationship between Australia and the United States. The President of the United States, no matter who he or she may be, no matter what party he or she may belong to, is always welcome in Australia. I know that Australians will give Mr and Mrs Clinton a very warm welcome to this country. Wage Increases",36
56,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Does he agree that the $8 a week safety net wage increase that the government is supporting will protect those workers earning $20,000 a year only if inflation is two per cent or less, and protect those at the cut-off point of just over $35,000 a year only if inflation comes down to 1.2 per cent? Does he also agree that if inflation actually meets the government's own budget CPI projections of 2% per cent next year and three per cent thereafter the real wages of every low paid worker relying on this increase will in fact go backwards over the next three years?",36
57,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition generally engages in contortions and combinations in order to try to demonstrate non-existent points, but he should have no worry. As the Minister for Industrial Relations has just explained to the House, this government's position is for an $8 a week safety net wage increase for those workers on less than average weekly ordinary time earnings. The government is going into the Industrial Relations Commission arguing for an increase-I do not know why you object to that-and at the same time arguing for a new system of industrial relations, a system of industrial relations where wages will be based on productivity. You can sit around here and say, 'Well, what if they don't enter into wage agreements? What if there is no enterprise bargaining?' The object is to get enterprise bargaining, to get increases in real wages based on productivity. That is the object of the new system: to get a system of increased productivity in Australia's industrial relations, something that Labor could never achieve. What does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say? He says, 'What if inflation is low?' If inflation is low, workers will be even better off because they will not be chasing increased prices. In relation to that, they will have, as a result of this government's economic policy, the assurance that their wages will be protected. They will have not only the assurance that their wages will be protected by lower inflation but also the benefit of interest rate reductions, something that the Labor Party could never accomplish-$145 a month after tax. Let me tell you something else that those employees can be sure of. They can be sure that, having saved themselves from another episode of Labor government, they will not find their wages eaten up by increased taxes, because this is a government that is protecting those wage earners in relation to taxes as well. We all know that Labor loves higher taxes. Nothing would give you more pleasure than to set off wage increases and pick up the revenue with increased taxes. That is not the way of the coalition government. We will protect after-tax earnings, we will protect them against price increases and we will deliver through interest rates. Those employees who showed faith in the coalition on 2 March will see that they will get the benefits and dividends in relation to that. Wage Increases",36
58,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What actions is the government taking to fulfil its election pledge to ensure that the low paid, battling Australian workers receive a fair go?",37
59,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do thank the member for Dunkley for asking me that question. One thing that is very obvious is that the Labor Party really hates good news for battling Australian workers; they really do. They have been grumbling about lower inflation, they are grumbling about the falls in interest rates, and now they are grumbling about the fact that we have delivered on our promise to have a safety net wage increase. When they were in government, they liked to be able to say all the time that we were against anybody getting a wage increase. That was proved wrong on so many occasions. What they really cannot stand, what really galls them-and it was no more effectively demonstrated",37
60,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,37
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The more you interrupt, the more you demonstrate your sensitivity on this subject. Noise is no substitute for being a representative of the working people of this country. You tried all that noise out in Lindsay and you got Jackie Kelly back with a 5.6 per cent increase. You went on with all that business before the by-election. You were going out there, appealing over the heads of the press to the people of Lindsay. You were trying to refurbish your credentials as the representative of the working men and women of Australia, but nothing beats cold, hard fact. Nothing beats reductions in interest rates-$145 a month. There is a benefit of $145 a month after tax for an average mortgage. That is the measure of the interest rate reductions that have occurred under this government. This is to your annoyance, to your chagrin. I can just imagine the Leader of the Opposition saying to the deputy leader, 'Damn it, they've got a safety net wage increase.' He really would have been so upset. I thought at least they would have helped us out, but no. The reality is that we promised a safety net wage increase, and we have delivered on that promise. We promised to follow a sensible fiscal policy, and we have delivered $145 a month reduction in mortgage payments as a result of the reduction in interest rates. I have news for the Leader of the Opposition and all those doomsayers: your agony is not over, because on 1 January we are going to deliver $1 billion of family tax reductions. I suppose you will criticise that as well, will you? You will say, 'It is not enough.' The fact is that, on every score, we entered into a pact with the working men and women of Australia before 2 March. I thank them with immense gratitude for the support they gave us. We have kept our promises, we have kept faith with them and we are going to go on representing them in a way that they have not been represented for years. Families",37
62,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and, in fact, follows his answer to the previous question-and you are right, Prime Minister, we would love the Australian battling family to be a thousand dollars better off a year, which they would have been under our proposition; and we would love you to keep up your promises when you guarantee that no worker will be worse off.",38
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will ask the question.,38
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, you referred to ordinary workers being better off as a result of recent interest rate reductions. Is it not a fact that, according to recent ABS household expenditure data, only one in seven households earning up to average weekly earnings are paying off mortgages and the others cannot hope to benefit directly from any interest rate cuts? As far as after tax earnings are concerned, isn't it also the case that under your budget ordinary families are going to be paying more for prescriptions, more for doctors' fees as they move out of bulk billing, more for child care, more for nursing homes and home care support for the elderly, much more for higher education fees and more for private health insurance?",38
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am absolutely fascinated that the Leader of the Opposition has brought higher education fees into the argument. higher education system that you are defendindicators? ing is a system that duds the low income earners of Australia. You are, at heart, for elite system which sort of says that the taxes of the working men and women of Australia can be used to subsidise free education high income earners. I hope you repeat dogma at the next election in 2Y2 years because it is a long way out of touch. You ran that one in Lindsay, too, and they didn't take too much notice of it. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that of course it is a fact that not everybody has a housing mortgage-but a lot of people do. It is also a fact that most people have housing mortgages at a time when they have peak demand on their household income so far as expenses are concerned. At a time when they are raising children they have a mortgage on the house and that is the time they really need relief. I might also remind you that the tax relief contained in the budget extends to a number of groups that you systematically kicked in the shins before the last election, including the self-funded retirees of Australia. What have we done? We have delivered on our promises-and we will be delivering further on our promises. They are amongst very low income people, too. We are delivering on our promises in relation to the tax threshold and in relation to the health insurance rebate. We are delivering general taxation reductions to two million Australian families. You cannot get away from the fact that on 1 January next year, despite all your best efforts to obscure the fact, there will be a tax break for the families of Australia to the tune of $1 billion. That is going to people who are paying off homes and to people who are in rented accommodation-and nothing can alter the fact that under this government the promises made to the working men and women of Australia have been delivered in spades. Economy",38
66,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. I ask the Treasurer whether he can inform the House of economic prospects nationally and in my electorate of Wannon in the light of recent indicators. Can he also The inform us of the public response to those How do these recent indicators and the public response to them sit with the the attempts of some to talk down the economy?,38
67,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can report to the House that the public has thoroughly endorsed for this government's economic strategy and that thoroughly welcomed the second cut in time official interest rates under the Howard Liberal-National government. As a result of that, not only have we seen two cuts in official interest rates but a three-quarter per cent cut in the standard variable mortgage as a result of increased competitive pressures. I can report to the House that in response to those cuts in interest rates, delivering to families and delivering to mortgage buyers in Australia, there has been a sharp rise in consumer confidence which was noted by Westpac in its release of 13 November 1996, saying that the increase in November of the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment of 8.4 points or 8.3 per cent was the strongest immediate response to a rate cut recorded since March 1991. That is the response of consumers and home buyers. We have also seen attempts by the Labor Party to talk down consumer confidence. Shortly before that largest jump since 1991 the shadow Treasurer was saying there was no consumer confidence in the Australian economy. We see in relation to all these indicators that, whilst the bulk of the Australian public recognises the benefit of good economic policy, there is a small, marginalised, increasingly bitter and disaffected group that is opposed to them. That bitter and disaffected, marginal, small group is known by the name 'the Australian Labor Party'. One has never seen longer faces than the faces of members of the Australian Labor Party when there is an interest rate cut. The Australian public will welcome this with glee and the Australian Labor Party will go into periods of mourning. They will predict consumer confidence downturns when there are consumer confidence uplifts. I think it is about the fourth question in question time and normally we have a question about credit card interest rates by this time. On 4 November the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the government had a feather duster in relation to credit cards. He said that informal monitoring was not working. Three days later, on 7 November 1996, St George became the first to cut personal loan rates, credit card rates and overdraftssome feather duster. You predict a downturn in consumer confidence and you have the biggest increase since 1991. You say nothing is happening on credit cards and three days later credit card rates start falling. This Basil Fawlty of economic commentary. Mr Crean-But you are Manuel.",38
68,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, he is not the Manuel of economic commentary. To call him the Manuel of economic commentary would be far too derogatory of Barcelona. I will stand up here and defend the Spanish against any claims that he would be a Manuel in relation to economic policy. It is not only credit cards, not only consumer confidence, but we have seen it in relation to interest rates for buildings and to growth prospects. All we can say is that, as the faces of the Australian Labor Party get longer, the prospects for the Australian public get brighter. The great thing about this opposition-the one thing that can be said in their defence-is that at least nobody takes any notice of them. If somebody were taking some notice of them, they could be doing some damage in trying to talk down the Australian economy. But the opposition's great strength is their irrelevance. I would hope for you, the sufferers of the relevance deprivation syndrome, that it continues because, if you should ever have any effect, the prospects for the Australian public would be worse, not better. This is a low interest rate, low inflation, growth economy where prospects are bright, where consumer confidence is rising. Mr O'Connor-Sit down, you imbecile.",39
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Corio!,39

71,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. I refer to the recent Federal Court decision granting undisclosed compensation to 38 Chinese boat people. Can the minister tell the Australian taxpayers the amount of compensation granted to these Chinese boat people? If not, can the minister explain to the Australian taxpayers why details of the is the amount of compensation granted will not be made public?

77,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I can confirmMr O'Connor-That she is a member of the Liberal Party.,40
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Corio.,40
79,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that a claim was brought on behalf of a number of Chinese boat people-as they have become - nown-wh.o we;e detained at Port Hedland after they arnved III Australia. Because of the vagaries of the Immigration Act at that time, as passed by the parliament at the instigation of the f-rmer government, a situation arose that techmcallpeople were held in detention illegally-as It was found by a court. A judgment was given by Mr Justice Neaves here in the Australian Capital Territory establishing that .f-ct. So a claim arose that needed to be quantified. That claim has been settled by the Commonwealth, on the best available terms for the Commonwealth, and the agreement that was reached with the parties provided that the actual would not be disclosed. I can confIrm, however, that an agent acting on behalf of the parties did say that the amounts involved were certainly not millions of dollars and not hundreds of thousands of dollars. It can be deduced from those observations, made on behalf of the applicants' representative, that the amounts so far as the Commonwealth was concerned were not considerable. Wage Increases",40
80,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Mr Martin Ferguson-Have you got your tool kit with you?,40
81,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It's all right: my hands are clean. Will the minister confirm that the government will make submissions in - he forthcoming proceedings in the AustralIan Industrial Relations Commission to support a safety net adjustment for the low pai-? Can the minister inform the House of the Impact on the economy and the jobs market of an application by the AC- .for an 8.75 - er ce-t increase in all award millimum rates III addItion to a $20 safety net increase?,40
82,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. As I have already - nformed t?e House, we will certainly be maklllg a SU?mISsion to the commission for an increase III the safety net. In making our decision,. we t-ok into account all the relevant factors, Illcludlllg what was a fair thing for the low paid in terms of remuneration, the changed nature of the system, reflecting that we now see this as a genuine safety net. We also were very concerned to make sure that it was a responsible decision economically because we want to do all that we can to preserve the jobs people have toda- and preferably give people the opportumty of work in the future. Fixing that safety net at a responsible level, which ul-imately is - d-ci­ sion for the Industrial RelatIOns CommIssIOn, is very important because Australia does have a significant unemployment rate. This government is determined to do all that it can to reduce unemployment and to create jobs. That attitude that we take is in very stark t-rms contrast to the application lodged by the ACTU, which really is disappointing in .that it is just a return to the same old centralIsed approach to industrial relat.i-ns whi-- undermined Australia's competitive pOSItIOn and led over the years to a decline in real wages, particularly for the low paid, and generally meant for the Australian economy that we were not able to achieve the better economic growth that most Australians would like to see. In short, the implications of the ACTU's claim-which I would have to say is a bit of an ambit claim-if granted, would be a big jump in the rate of inflation, je-pardise a lot of jobs and see people over time lose the prospects of employment. We have gone to some lengths to look at these issues in detail. We have had the Treasury do some preliminary work on the ACTU claim. Allowing for the necessary monetary response to keep the underlying inflation rate within its target range of two to three per cent on average over the business cycle, the impact of that claim in terms of the first stage of it would increase the unemployment rate by a quarter of a percentage point in 1997-98 and half a percentage point in 1998-99 and in 1999-2000. It would cause a cumulative loss of GDP growth of 21,4 percentage points over these three financial years. The preliminary advice we have shows that the effect of all three stages of the ACTU's claim would be even bigger. It would mean a rise in the unemployment rate of a quarter of a percentage point in 1997-98, a rise of one percentage point in 1998-99 and a rise of 1% percentage points in 1999-2000. It would mean overall for the economy a cumulative loss of GDP growth of five percentage points from 1997-98 to 1999-2000. What that shows you, on reasonable assumptions, is that if the ACTU's claim got up it would be, in a word, a disaster for the low paid and a disaster for the Australian economy. It is interesting that behind the sole question I have had from the shadow minister on this issue is an assumption which is dictated by the ACTU-that is, your policy is now back to across-the-board centralised wage making for the Australian economy. That does not surprise me because that is basically the ACTU's claim. The assumption behind the question from the shadow minister reveals publicly for one and all the extent to which your policy is the ACTU policy. Mr MCMullan-That's a lie.",40
83,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow minister says that that is a lie, but if you listen to the Senate debate on the workplace relations bill you know that is right. I can tell you what the ACTU amendments were because the ACTU amendments have been given to me. When you look at the ALP's Senate amendments you can see that they are exactly the same as the ACTU amendments. It is not just that you are subject to the influence of the ACTU but that they are literally drafting your amendments and your policies.",41
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Remember they announced the bill three years ago. Mr Reith-The ACTU announced the bill three years ago. In one sense nothing has changed on their side, but in another sense everything has changed because more than ever these people are subject to the control of the ACTU on industrial relations policy. They are now opposed to award simplification which they used to be in favour of rhetorically. They now want caps on damages for claims against unions-special immunity for their mates. That was something you never advanced in 13 years in government, but now that you are in opposition you think you have a licence for irresponsibility. You are totally opposed to 45D and 45E relating to the effective secondary boycott provisions. Even though you introduced non-union agreements, the EFAs, ineffective as they were, you are now publicly opposed to the idea of agreement making for the non-unionised sector of the Australian economy, which is three-quarters of the private sector. To cap it off, we have their wages policy again being dictated by the ACTU. Sadly, it is just a return to the past for the ALP and it is yet another reason why you were so soundly trounced on 2 March. Health Insurance",41
85,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, when you took personal control of approvals for increased health insurance premiums, do you recall saying: 'I would be disappointed if there were any further applications during the time the inquiry is going on'? Is it not the case that the government's own health fund has totally ignored your plea and applied for a 15 per cent increase which will swallow up most of the tax rebate for more than one million Australians? Was the Minister for Health and Family Services correct when he said that your involvement was as much about perceptions as reality? If your intervention was not just about perceptions, how do you explain that the latest applications are more than double those that were being approved by your government before your personal intervention?",41
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question comes from a man who was a minister in a government that allowed 146 increases to occur without let or hindrance. You also belong to a government that allowed circumstances to arise where the financial position of health funds was made all the more vulnerable. The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is: I am not at this stage prepared to comment on the individual financial circumstances of particular funds. Industrial Relations,42
87,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Following the announcement last week by the Victorian government of its decision to refer its industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth, I ask the minister to inform the House of the advantages to employers and employees in Victoria arising from this historic decision.",42
88,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Murray for her question. There is no doubt that there are significant benefits for both employers and employees as a result of the historic announcement by the Victorian government for the referral of industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth. For employers it means that we will have a much more simplified and settled system. That means that they will no longer have to waste resources on contesting jurisdictional issues using two systems for their workplace relations. That is good for employees as well. It does mean that all employers and employees have immediate access to the federal system to make federal agreements-noting of course that for the transitional arrangements existing state agreements, whether individual or collective, will continue to operate until replaced by federal awards or agreements. It also means that Victorian employees will have immediate access to the new federal unfair dismissal scheme, which is a good and fair scheme based on the principle of a fair go all round. Those employees will also have access to the freedom of association provisions of our bill, which means the abolition of compulsory unionism in Australia-one of the many benefits of the federal system. Not surprisingly, the announcement by the Prime Minister and the Premier of Victoria has been very well received in the Australian community. Terry MCCrann in the Herald-Sun said: The desirability of eliminating our complex twotier federaVstate IR system transcends party politics, and should have been achieved years ago. The Democrats very sensibly welcomed the decision; they said they would support it. The Australian had some comments from people like John Prescott, who was quoted as saying that it was: ... an important step towards a simpler and more flexible industrial relations system. Mr Greg John from the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, VECCI, was quoted as saying: (Yesterday's) announcement appears to provide the basis for a sensible transition to a complementary framework in which the interests of both employers and employees are protected. The MTIA said that it: ... congratulates the Victorian and Federal Governments on their progressive and far-sighted industrial relations agreement, which will hopefully be the beginnings of a unitary system of IR in Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald said: The argument .that employers who locate their businesses in Victoria will only have to deal with one industrial relations system will be an attractive or one particularly to foreign employers who understandably find the present constitutional system bewildering. The Daily Telegraph picked up the message as well. They said in their editorial: Yesterday'S first steps towards a single industrial relations system across the nation should be whipped into a gallop. The in principle deal for Victoria to refer its industrial relations powers to the Federal Government opens the way for big savings. Then, Prime Minister, you will be interested in a very measured tone from the Melbourne Herald-Sun. They said in their editorial: This economic reform signals a major step forward in the Howard government's determination to change forever the relationship between employees and management. Employers and workers will be able to make wage deals once federal awards are stripped back to a safety net of employment entitlements. Then, in a very understated expression, they said: The new federal legislation, coupled with the Kennett government handover, will begin an era of structural change that neither the Hawke nor Keating governments could ever have achieved, irrespective of their alliances with unions. The changes will bring productivity increases where individual workers will achieve workplace efficiencies as a result of wage productivity deals. Big gains will also flow to workers presently employed under state based agreements. Lastly: Merged as a uniform workplace package, the new federal legislation, coupled with the changes agreed to by Prime Minister Howard and Premier Kennett, provide a fine Christmas present to this state and the nation. What sensible words they were. Together with the interest rate benefits produced as a result of the budget the Prime Minister drove for Australian families, the family tax initiative, and the other big changes we have in place, I think people can look forward to a very good Christmas and a great 1997. Howe Leather",42
89,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs representing the Minister for Trade. Is the minister aware of a report in today's Financial Review that the government rebuffed a United States approach to discuss its position on Australia's export facilitation for Howe Leather? Why did the government rebuff the United States approach? Is it not the case that that rebuff has now escalated the dispute from Howe Leather to the car and textile industries generally, thus threatening thousands of Australian jobs? What action is the government proposing to take to protect those Australian jobs?",43
90,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, the premise of !he question is incorrect in one respect, that IS, that, as a result of an action that the United States administration took following a complaint from United States leather companies, the Australian government has gone out of its way to do everything it can to defend Australian industry interests. We have gone absolutely out of our way. The suggestion that somehow we are not out there standing up not just for Howe Leather but for the export facilitation scheme is utterly and totally wrong. This government has been working for several weeks with the United States administration in order to ensure we are able to preserve the export facilitation scheme. The premise of the Labor Party's question-that somehow we are prepared to abandon the scheme and throw our hands up in the air-is utterly false. What is interesting about the Labor Party is that you set up the export facilitation scheme, but you never registered it with the World Trade Organisation. Opposition members-Oh!",43
91,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed 'Oh!' Well may you moan. But the trouble is that, not having been registered, it is clearly a scheme that has vulnerability to WTO action. It is your scheme and it has vulnerability to WTO action, and we are working day in and day out with the Americans to try to ensure that that scheme will survive. We will have more to say about that later. Mr Crean-When?",43
92,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it suits us. We will demonstrate quite clearly the efforts that this government has gone to to ensure the survival of a scheme that you put in place and which it is quite true is vulnerable to being overthrown in the WTO. It is your scheme and it is vulnerable, and we are left with trying to keep it going. So no more cheek from you on it! Zaire: Rwanda",43
93,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire. Given that the Australian government is contributing $2.6 million in special aid to this troubled area, how is this aid being used?",43
94,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member for Boothby shows an enduring interest not just in international relations but also in issues of development assistance, which I particularly appreciate. This is a very serious matter. Obviously the Australian government felt under obligation to respond in a humanitarian way to the crisis that has erupted in Zaire and Rwanda. I announced last Thursday that the government would, as an initial contribution, spend $2.6 million of development assistance money on assistance to Australian non-government organisations which have experience in dealing with the general Great Lakes regionZaire and Rwanda in particular. We have decided to provide $300,000 each to Community Aid Abroad, to World Vision, to Medecins Sans Frontieres and to Care Australia and $200,000 to the Adventist Development Relief Agency, to CaritasAustralian Catholic Relief-to Austcare and to UNICEF Australia. These contributions are being made by the government in response to a visit by the Director-General of AusAID, Mr Trevor Kanaley, to Nairobi, which was the best place from which an assessment could be made of the needs in Zaire. Mr Kanaley visited Nairobi at my request. He then provided me with a report on what we could do from our development assistance program. His assessment-and I accepted his recommendations-was that the best we could do was not to provide food and other supplies because food and other supplies are already available at an adequate level, but to provide logistic support to NGOs to distribute those food and other supplies. So that is why, as an initial contribution, we have decided to provide the $2.6 million. I emphasise that this is an initial contribution. Depending on circumstances, the government will be prepared to provide additional funds later on. The situation has changed somewhat in Zaire since the weekend, as the Prime Minister mentioned. Something like 400,000-perhaps up to 500,000-refugees have now returned from Zaire to Rwanda. As a consequence of that, Au sAID is now liaising again with non-government organisations to see whether some of the development assistance that we are proposing for this particular situation could be redirected to resettlement programs. So we are obviously keeping a fairly flexible approach to how we respond to this humanitarian disaster. Suffice to say that the Australian government is determined to do all that it can in a practical way to assist. We are doing that through the development assistance program by providing the $2.6 million. We may well provide more, depending on circumstances. I hope that the flow of the refugees back into Rwanda is going to continue and, if that is the case, I do not think there is any doubt that some, if not all, of this money would be used to assist with the process of resettlement. Shipbuilding",43
95,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Is the minister aware of a report of comments made by the Chief Executive Officer of the Oceanfast Marine Group in Western Australia, Mr John Farrell, who said: ... he was a lifelong Liberal supporter and the federal government's lack of interest in the shipbuilding industry was most disappointing . . . He said Industry minister, John Moore, had promised to visit WA shipbuilding yards. But he had been to Perth twice and not found the time to keep his promise. He said further: Under the previous Labor government ministers were in and out of the yard all the time ... Under Labor we did not win our arguments all the timeGovernment members-Oh!",44
96,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, you do find it humorous, don't you, knocking over an industry like this. He said: Under Labor we did not win our arguments all the time, but at least they gave us the access and the chance to put our case. Further: We have built an industry from nothing to more than $600 million in less than 10 years, and I think we are entitled to have access to the government of the day to put our views. Why would the minister not meet with Mr Farrell? Is the minister too busy to listen to this $600 million industry which employs 12,000 people? Why will the minister not face the people whose livelihoods have been threatened by the federal government?",44
97,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question raised by the Leader of the Opposition clearly points to the fact that they have no regard at all for the economy. They do not understand the problems confronting the economy. On top of that, when the government came to power it set about a financial consolidation to prepare the economy for growth in the future. By doing that, interest rates have been reduced and, as a consequence of that, you will find increased employment. As it relates to the Western Australian shipbuilding industry, I have spoken to the gentleman concerned. I think I am right in saying that. I have been open to him. My door is open to any member of the industry to come and call on me. A deputation did call on me some months ago. Mr O'Keefe-Are you sure?",45
98,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Quite sure. On top of that, I expressed the concerns of future growth to them and that I wanted to see Australian industry develop, but the taxpayers of Australia are not going to go on forever subsidising industry. Therefore, they must stand up and compete. This is a very good industry which has some natural advantages. I want to see them develop further those natural advantages and expand the way they can. If any member of the industry wants to see me at any time, just ring. Labour Market Programs",45
99,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of surveys of employers' attitudes to Working Nation programs conducted by the previous government? How will the current government overcome the many concerns identified by employers?",45
100,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wide Bay for his question. A report has come into the hands of the government detailing once again the failure and ineffectiveness of the previous government's Working Nation programs. This report is a damning indictment of the Working Nation program. It is based on a survey of employers in six regions in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. It is a report that the previous government may well have decided to act upon but decided to do nothing. Members of the House will be very interested to know the weaknesses of the previous program which have made it necessary for the present government to introduce the vital and important reforms which it has now put forward. First of all, employers said that the programs of Working Nation were ineffective. The report states: The initiatives are perceived as being short-term measures when long-term strategies are required. How true that was-a short-term measure in the run-up to the federal election this year. Employers felt that the programs were inefficient and wasteful. The report said: Employers felt that the government was uninterested in putting resources into new skill areas because of the longer time required to impart the required knowledge and skills. Employers were also highly critical of the quality of training being offered in the many short-term schemes so favoured by the previous government. The report says: Employers are never sure of the exact skill levels of someone completing different training courses. The employer still needed to test or substantiate the skills of these graduates. It will be no surprise to members of this House that a consistent complaint throughout this report was that many of the long-term unemployed were functionally illiterate. This is a damning indictment of the failed education policies of the previous government. Many of those young people who went through under those policies are now unemployed and long-term unemployed. Finally, the employers slammed the irrelevance of many of these training programs to meet the individual needs of the people involved. The report continues: Unemployed people appear to be able to take training courses that are inconsistent with their career goals, simply for something to do. Employers talked about interviewing people who had completed multiple training courses in completely unrelated areas. One employer talked about a woman who had completed a clown training course as well as an office skills course but she wanted to work in child care. I have got nothing against clowns, and this course was probably put up to train members of the Labor Party front-bench-and probably many of them have been through that course and are showing the consequences of it. But this woman wanted to be in child care, yet she was not allowed to be in child care; she was forced into another course because the $2 billion man had to get the numbers up to make sure he could hide these unemployed people from the statistics in the run-up to the election campaign. It is because of these complete failures and the ineffectiveness of the Working Nation programs that the government is putting in place programs such as the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system which will lead young people on to real jobs and is bringing about major reforms in the labour market programs next year, which will give major incentives for the placement of unemployed people in real jobs and give them a start on the careers that they really want to take. Immigration: Ms Angela Lea",45
101,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. It concerns the well publicised Angela Lea case. Is it a fact that Ms Lea grew up in Victoria after emigrating from the United Kingdom when she was five? Is it a fact that Ms Lea, whose baby, Samuel, was born overseas when she was on a working holiday, was told by immigration officials that because of new immigration regulations she would have to consider leaving her baby in Britain and return to Australia for 18 months so she could qualify as an Australian citizen to sponsor her child? What action is the government taking to end the nightmare being experienced by Ms Lea and hundreds of other innocent people caused by its regulations which existed for only a few weeks before their disallowance? Or will the minister persist with trying to keep seven-month-old baby Samuel out?",46
102,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am getting some advice from my department in relation to what is happening with that case. In relation to dependent children, there was a specific provision made that a dependent child born offshore to a permanent resident would be able to return to Australia with its parent. The complications that",46
103,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Without the partner.,46
104,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point is made in those situations that, where permanent residents enter into a relationship offshore in the form of either a marriage or a de facto relationship, the question does arise. I have had no difficulty in defending the general proposition",46
105,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Keeping families apart.,46
106,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. In relation to questions,46
107,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,46
108,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you don't want to hear an answer, I will resume my seat. The fact is that, in the way in which the migration program had been operating under the former government, we had seen a very rapid increase in the number of people who were seeking to enter Australia through the preferential family reunion program. And we saw a very rapid increase in the number of people-and some of the statistics ought to be understood by members opposite-in relation to the way in which you managed the program. In relation to testing bona fides, you gave the task away. Decisions taken by the former minister under the guise of facilitation showed that he was quite prepared to see a situation in which the number of rejections on the basis that relationships were found to be non bona fide fell by 50 per cent. That occurred under your minister, under your government. We saw a situation where you were prepared to deal with the question of bona fides properly",46
109,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We're talking about the child.,46
110,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are talking about situations in which people are prepared to manipulate the provisions by which we have facilitated family reunion for this country over a period of time. Last year we saw the number of spouse applications go up by something in the order of one-third. The government is determined to ensure that the program is effectively and properly administered. In relation to the program, what we have seen with the decisions that the government announced in July is that up until October there had been an 18 per cent reduction in the number of applicants in the preferential family category. We are determined to bring that part of the program back under control, and we will do so. We will do so with compassion and concern in relation to those situations where there are legitimate issues that ought to be taken into account. If the Lea case is not covered by the exemption which I mentioned in relation to dependent children, I will have a look at the situation to see the way in which it was likely to be impacted by these particular measures. Aboriginal Health",46
111,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Could the minister please outline to the House the health status of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people? Could the minister also explain the role that inadequate access to clean, safe drinking water plays in contributing to poor health and detail the benefits to Aboriginal people of having the Australian army provide safe drinking water to remote indigenous communities?",47
112,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Aboriginal Australians have the worse health status of any identifiable group of people in the country. Their life expectancy is somewhere between 15 and 20 years less than that for average Australians. A few months ago, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare released a report entitled Australia's Health 1996 that looked at the changes in the health of the Australian population over the years 1992 to 1994. While the health of Australians generally had improved over that period, the health of Aboriginal people had stayed the same. So in fact the gap in health between the - boriginal population and the broader population actually widened over the period 1992 to 1994. The worse was for men, particularly in the 25 to 54 age group, where their death rate was five to seven times that of the rest of the population. Part of any answer to this is access to reasonable, professional health care. We have had improvements in childhood health, although Aboriginal children still have a death rate of three times that of the broader population. The other part of health is a very substantial effort in environmental health. It is estimated that perhaps more than 300 communities of 50 people or more do not have access to basic safe, clean water that would meet standards of the National Health and Medical Research Council. This leads to a particular range of infections of the skin, intestine, urinary tract, kidneys and trachoma. It can lead to kidney disease through repeated infections and possibly through the high mineral content of the water. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs announced last week that we will be using the army to assist Aboriginal communities in providing skilled labour for interventions to help supply clean water. It does not replace the need for good health care but it does supplement it. We are aware that the provision of clean water needs adequate planning as well as adequate followup training of the people. This is where the states and territories will be involved. The army's involvement will allow the acceleration of the environmental health work already being done by ATSIC. The faster we can get clean water into all Aboriginal communities, the better value that we will get for the health dollar and the faster improvement of the health of Aboriginal Australians. Telephone Charges",47
113,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of a plan promoted by the member for Warringah to impose a levy on local telephone call charges to pay for the cost of burying pay TV cable? Will the Prime Minister give an assurance that telephone users in regional Australia, including Tasmania, who are not getting cable TV will not have to pay this new tax on telephone calls?",47
114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am happy to take the opportunity of saying that the policy of my government is to reduce and not to increase the cost of telephone calls. Economy,47
115,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the government's fiscal and financial stance brought any benefits for consumers; if so, what are these benefits?",47
116,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is also the policy of this government to set in place low interest rates to give relief to home buyers, businesses and those who hold credit cards from the high interest regime which was the hallmark of the economic management of previous Labor administrations. I can report that the St George Bank on 7 November 1996 announced a cut of 0.5 per cent in relation to its credit cards. I can announce that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia on 18 November 1996 cut credit card rates by 0.6 per cent. The National Australia Bank cut the free period card by 0.6 per cent and the no interest free period card by one per cent. This is great news for credit card holders, bad news only for the Labor Party which just hates to see interest rates falling. It hates to see consumers paying less in relation to interest. Westpac cut its rates by 0.5 per cent in relation to the free period and by 0.95 per cent in relation to the interest free period. Mr Tanner-Get the hands working.",48
117,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the volume goes up, you can tell how upset the Labor Party is. The member for Melbourne is totally upset that credit card rates are falling. It is wonderful news for credit card holders. No wonder there has been no interest from the Labor Party in asking about credit card rates today. Mr O'Connor-1 asked about it the other day.",48
118,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You asked about it the other day because you thought they would not fall. That is why you asked about it. Since credit card interest rates have fallen, the Labor Party has lost all interest in credit cards. Their only interest in them was when they thought they could make a cheap political point. Thi- government has a policy of delivering benefits to consumers through increased co.mpetition. We welcome the moves by the orIgmators to now come into credit cards to increase competition and to bring down credit card - ates. All we can say is that falling credit card mterest rates will be more gloom for the Australian Labor Party. We look forward to more gloom as we look forward to more benefits for consumers, such as competition and responsible fiscal policy-all of the things that the Labor Party wants to put at risk because they want to try to undo this. I think I can say to this House that there is only one thing that stands between the opportunity for Australia to get back into savings and to permanently lock in low interest rates. It is the policy of sabotage from the Australian Labor Party. That is the only thing that can stand between it. The Australian Labor Party not only delighted in 13 years of failure but now in opposition wants to sabotage attempts to fix it. If they persist with their moves in the Senate, all it can do is add to the deficit and debt which are the legacy of the Keating failed Labor years. We now have an opportunity to tum away from that. We now have an opportunity to right things in Australia. Consumers are seeing the benefits in relation to interest rates, home buyers are seeing the benefits in relation to interest rates and consumer confidence is seeing the benefits in relation to lower interest rates. That is the policy of this government and that is the way we intend to benefit Australian consumers.",48

120,Mr SPEAKER,OF AMERICA,"The resolution adopted by the House on 17 October invited Mr William Clinton, President of the United States of America, to address members and senators in the House on Wednesday, 20 November 1996 at a time notified by the Speaker. I now formally advise the House that the time has been fixed at 4 p.m. that day. My letter to all members of II November also covers major aspects of the visit. NA President of the United States of America",48
121,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, my question relates to the address by US President Clinton in this chamber on Wednesday. What consideration have you, Mr Speaker, given to the position in the chamber from which the guest should speak? Will you ensure a welcoming address by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition? Would you accept that a standing ovation, subject to members' and senators' inclination, is appropriate? Will you consider proceedings and practices adopted on Wednesday as a precedent for similar invitations to other distinguished visitors to Australia as well as distinguished Australians who are not themselves members or senators?",48
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. Many issues have been considered in relation to forthcoming visit of President Clinton. President Clinton will enter the chamber and my right on a podium that is raised six or seven inches from the ground. I will be joined by the President of the Senate on my left on a podium of similar dimensions. They will both sit on plain Commonwealth of Australia chairs, which you are very familiar with in the hallways and byways of the parliament. The President will be received by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, who will welcome him very briefly. Consideration was given to exactly where the President would address the joint sitting from. Those who were here historically would remember that President Bush rose from his chair and addressed the joint sitting on my right. We have looked at this very carefully and have decided that the President will address us from a position directly in front me, between the Clerk of the House of Representatives on my right and the Clerk of the Senate on my left. I think standing ovations are the subject atmospherics and sometimes whimsy and a whole host of other competing emotions. If the address that we are to receive is sufficiently significant, the members' spontaneous response would be the better one.",49
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,It is unparliamentary to clap.,49
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The Prime Minister has just reminded me that it is unparliamentary for members to clap. I take that opportunity to remind all members that not only is it unparliamentary to clap but the conventional way of supporting those initiatives that we hear in the chamber is by the traditional 'Hear, hear'. What I am sure many of us find offensive is the beating which has become common practice. Opposition members-Over there.",49
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I am well aware of the direction of the noise, even with my impaired hearing. I ask members to desist forthwith from what is traditionally becoming a very poor practice of beating their desks. The issue of whether we would invite other illustrious guests to this country to address a joint sitting from the floor of the chamber would be reviewed in the light of the visit of the that person at the time. Members would be advised constantly in the updated information sit on that flows from that sort of visit.",49
126,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I rise with your indulgence to speak to that matter, Mr Speaker. If you find it difficult to accept clapping, will you accept 30 seconds of blind eye to whatever transpires at the conclusion of this before you do your quince?",49
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,The Leader of the Opposition is sorely testing my indulgence. Theft of Computer Equipment,49
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"On 6 November I received a question from the Chief Government Whip concerning the theft of computing equipment for the Internet facilities in the House of Representatives wing. I am pleased to advise honourable members that the of Internet facilities have been restored, and members with an account have been advised by staff of the Information Systems and Planning office in the Department of the of House of Representatives. I am writing to members today to inform them of new access arrangements in suite R-I-84, where some of the facilities are located, to make it more secure. My letter will also advise members of several new products and initiatives in computing services. Investigations into the theft continue. NA",49
129,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Child Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in parliament assembled, the families and friends of Kurri Early Childhood Centre Inc. and Woy Woy Peninsular Community Childcare Centre, NSW and Margaret Druitt Day Care Centre, NSW respectfully bring to your attention the adverse effects to the quality, availability and equity of child care should changes proposed in the recently tabled budget go ahead. Namely that: removal of operational subsidies to community based (not for profit) long day care centres will increase fees, adding a greater financial burden to working parents. removal of operational subsidy to community based (not for profit) long day care centres in order to place them in competition with privately owned centres (operating for profit) is unfair, iniquitous and may result in a lesser quality of care for our children. We request the House support the retention of operational subsidies to community based (not for profit) long day care centres and that community based (not for profit) child care continue to be valued and supported as a lower cost, high quality child care alternative for working parents. by Mr Fitzgibbon (from 66 citizens), Mr Lloyd (from 71 citizens) and  Provider Numbers To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of NSW draws to the attention of the House that we the undersigned are totally opposed to the restriction of issuing of provider numbers to registered doctors unless they have entered a recognised training program, are vocationally registered or are a qualified specialist. We consider that such an action would cause serious suffering, including a severe disadvantage to women and rural communities and medical research. We believe that it is the essential right of all Australian registered doctors to have access to provider numbers that allow them to provide services which can attract Medicare rebates. We believe that such restrictions are an attack on the most defenceless and vulnerable strata of the medical profession and will not achieve the projected savings which it purports to do. We consider it to be a denial of natural justice, an attack on Medicare and un-Australian. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: Call upon the Federal Minister for Health the Hon. Michael Wooldridge MP, to enter into meaningful discussions with representatives of those groups most affected by the harsh and unconscionable decisions of his government. by Mr Fitzgibbon (from 180 citizens), Mr Allan Morris (from 1,424 citizens) and Mr Ruddock (from 10 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain readers of Australia points out to the House that the Honourable the Minister for Communications has foreshadowed presenting to the House, Appropriation Bills which will substantially reduce the funding appropriated by the Parliament to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This reduction will greatly damage the nature of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Your petitioners therefore request that the House resolves to maintain the funding appropriated to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation at the current real level. by Mr Lee (from 20 citizens) and Mr Lee (from 14 citizens). Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of Citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House our strong opposition to proposed changes to the Commonwealth States Housing Agreement. These changes will in effect force public tenants out by rising rents, create ghettoes, increase homelessness and will disadvantage those with physical and intellectual disabilities, Aborigines, migrants and the aged. These people will have less access to public housing and are discriminated against in the private market. Your petitioners therefore request the House to intercede on our behalf to strongly oppose these changes and to defend ""safety-net"" public housing policy which has had 50 years of bipartisan support.  Sudan To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: (a) the Sudanese Government's policies of genocide against Sudanese groups are repugnant, and . (b) the sustained and systematic attempt to enforce Sharia law on non-Islamic citizens is condemned. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives will persuade the Government and the international community, including the UN Security Council to: (i) impose an arms embargo on the Government of Sudan (ii) establish air exclusion zones in Sudan (iii) support the peace initiatives of the InterGovernmental Authority for Drought and Desertification (iv) engage in discussion with all officially banned democratic opposition groups (v) ensure the immediate access by the United Nations Operation, Life-Line Sudan and other aid agencies into all areas; and (vi) Provide teams to monitor human rights in the north, south and the Nuba Mountains of Sudan. by Mr Cadman (from 56 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We the citizens and business proprietors of the Northern Rivers draw to the attention of the House our objection, under the Commonwealth Copyright Act 1968, in being required to hold a Copyright Music Licence pertaining to the playing of background music by way of radio, cassette or CD at our business premises. Your petitioners therefore request the House to amend the relevant legislation in respect to the above. by Mr Causley (from 2,202 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the Northern Rivers Region of the State of New South Wales, draws the attention of the House to our opposition !o the Budgetary cuts to the Australian Broadcastmg Corporation. We, the undersigned, believe that the announced $65 Million cut to the funding of the ABC and the Government Inquiry into our national public broa-caster will irreparably damage the basic services that we, as rural Australian citizens, rely upon. . As international experiences have shown, the mtroduction of advertising can compromise the impartiality and independence of a public broadcaster and lead to a decline in its charter. Therefore, we request the House not decrease the funding to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and do not introduce advertising. by Mr Causley (from 15 citizens). Fuel Excise To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia draws to the attention of the House of Representatives the extremely high Road Funding and Petrol Products Excise Tax imposed by the Commonwealth Government, which rose from 6.1 cents per litre in 1982 to 35.6 cents per litre, for leaded fuel, in 1995. In addition, the attention of the House of Representatives is drawn to the current tax of 34. 18 cents per litre on diesel and that the percentage of excise tax utilised for road funding is now less than 10 per cent of that collected as compared to a maximum of 70 per cent in 1981-82. Your petitioners therefore request the House urge the Government to reduce the tax on fuel in order Copyright that: 1. The cost of living of ordinary Australians is improved; and 2. Australia's overall international competitiveness is enhanced. by Mr Dondas (from 228 citizens). Child Care To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We the citizens of Australia and residents of the Northern Territory draw to the attention of the House that we are completely opposed to the abolition of the operational subsidy to communitybased child care centres. Your petitioners therefore humbly request that the House support the maintenance of the operational subsidy to community-based child care centres. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Dondas (from 183 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents in the State of Victoria, draws to the attention of the House that: the funding cuts to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) will mean a significant reduction of Australian content on ABC TV, in drama, documentaries and education program; the funding cuts will threaten the ABC's Statebased productions; the funding cuts can radically cut the number of hours the ABC broadcast each day; the funding cuts can mean the closure of at least one of the three national radio networks, ABC-FM, Radio National or Triple J; and the funding cuts is a breach of the Coalition's election promise to maintain funding in real terms over the term of the present Government. Your petitioners therefore request the House that these funding cuts be immediately reversed and assurances given to the ABC that their funding will be restored. by Mr Holding (from 97 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House that: I. The Coalition's decision to means test the Childcare Cash Rebate discriminates against working parents and is a breach of a pre-election promise, where the Coalition's policy clearly stated 'We are committed to maintaining a non means tested Childcare Cash Rebate'; 2. The Coalition's decision to abolish operational subsidies for community based long day care centres will result in these centres having to charge higher fees, which will again discriminate against working parents; and 3. The Coalition's changes to the income test for Childcare Assistance will mean that the majority of parents pay far more in increased child care costs than provided through the Family Tax Initiative. Your Petitioners request that the House: I. exert pressure on Members of the Coalition to reverse the outcomes of the 1996 Federal Budget in relation to child care; 2. hold Members of the Coalition to their pre-election commitments to retain the former system of child care; and 3. vote against legislation given effect to these changes which are to the detriment of Australian families. by Mr Barry Jones (from 41 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia being; Parents/Guardians Children Staff Management Service Providers and members of the general community concerned for children. Draws to the attention of the House: the threat to childcare places; the risk to children from unmonitored care; the increased cost to parents; the abolition of operational subsidy and its impact on community based service providers; the impacts on female participation in the workforce. Child Care Your petitioners therefore urge that the House: Will not endorse the proposed removal of Operational Assistance from children's services; Will recommend that consultation take place with interested parties on any changes to childcare funding; Will make any decision on changes to child care funding based on the best interests of the child not on economic rationalism. by Mr Lee (from 86 citizens). Child Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain ... citizens of Australia, being Parents, Guardians, Family Day Carers, Staff and members of the general community concerned for children draws to the attention of the House: the threat to childcare places, the risk to children from unsupervised care; the increased cost to parents; the loss of independance and income for numerous women currently engaged in the provision of Family Day Care, the impact upon the 19,300 Family Day Care Carers, the 96,500 children using the service and the 2000 staff co-ordinating the schemes resulting from the abolition of operational subsidy to Family Day Care schemes. Child Care Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: will not endorse the proposed removal of Operational Assistance from Family Day Care and will recommend the consultation take place with interested parties on any changes to childcare funding; by Mr Lee (from 18 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the mounting public concern as to t-e future of - h.e Australian Broadcasting CorporatIon. Your petItIoners therefore ask the House to ensure that no cuts be made to the funding of the ABC and that triennial funding arrangements be retained. Furthermore, we call on the House to ensure that ABC services be free of commercial sponsorship and advertising. by Mr Lee (from 21 citizens). Consumer Price Index To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, Canberra: We the undersigned petitioners do show that: 1. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), of necessity, covers all prices including luxuries and; 2. Pensioners spend their income on the necessities of life, which rise by greater amounts and more frequently than other items, and the pension, adjusted twice yearly according to the CPI, is losing its value and has become inadequate to our needs. We therefore call on Parliament to grant an immediate $10 (Ten Dollar) increase in the weekly pension over and above the CPI, and this we humbly pray. by Mr Marek (from 38 citizens). Book Bounty To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of residents of the State of Victoria draws to the attention of the House the plans of the Howard Government to summarily terminate the Book Bounty on 20/8/96 the consequent loss of printing for Australian printers, and subsequent related job losses the serious implications of job losses for areas such as Maryborough, Victoria the lack of consultation by the Howard Government before making this decision. Your undersigned petitioners therefore ask the House of Representatives to: censure the Government for its lack of consultation in planning bounty cuts call on the Government to reverse its decision to terminate book bounty. by Mr Ronaldson (from 1,085 citizens). Gun Laws To the Honourable Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled: The Petition of the undersigned showsthat the overwhelming majority of Australians support uniform, national gun laws and the associated compensation measures as agreed between the Prime Minister, State Premiers and the Chief Ministers of the ACT and NT. Your petitioners ask that the Housecontinue to demonstrate its firm support for these measures; take all possible action to expedite their implementation; and resist all calls for the control measures to be watered down or abandoned. by Mr Williams (from 5,190 citizens). Gun Laws To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens draws to the attention of the House the need for tighter gun laws. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to support moves by the Prime Minister to tighten gun laws through the following measures: the banning of fully automatic and semi-automatic weapons; the introduction of a nation-wide shooters licence system; and the introduction of a nation-wide gun registration system. by Mr Williams (from 495 citizens).

131,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,53
132,Mr LATHAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Grievously so.,53
133,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,53
134,Mr LATHAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On 10 November in the  a long piece on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge issue and the debate this House conducted on legislation. He concluded as follows: New South Wales Labor MP for Werriwa, Mark Latham, was asked last week whether he wished to meet Dorothy Wilson, Dulcie Wilson and Jenny Grace when they visited Canberra. ""It's not our to speak to Aboriginal people"", was his response recorded in Hansard. Mr Speaker, in truth, I have never been asked to meet any of the three people mentioned by Mr Akerman last sitting week or any other week. Further, I asked Hansard to check the tape on my recorded interjection to the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). They have now written to me confirming that: The correct interjection was, 'It's not your role speak for Aboriginal people.' I was, of course, referring to the member for Barker. I understand that Hansard has now corrected its records. I look forward to Mr Akerman doing the same. SYDNEY AIRPORT (REGULATION OF MOVEMENTS) BILL 1996 Consideration resumed from 4 November. Second Reading",53
135,Mr ALBANESE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Grayndler) (3.34 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. I am very pleased to be giving this second reading speech today. Since this bill was introduced, I have received support from a very broad cross-section of the community for the measures it proposes. That support has been bipartisan and includes the Sydney Airport Community Forum, which met last week and passed a motion calling for support for this bill or similar legislation. I am pleased to report that the motion was carried with only one dissenting vote cast by the aviation industry representative. I have also received letters and telephone - alls of support from many residents not just In my electorate but throughout Sydney and a - um-er of councils affected by Sydney (KIngsford Smith) Airport, including Botany, North Sydney, Leichhardt, Marrickville and South Sydney. There is very hroad support for thiS measure. Today I received endorsement for this measure from none other than the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). This is a perfect example of the minister playing the politics of catch-up. He role put out two press releases today. The first is headed 'Sydney airport aircraft movements cap to be legislated', in which he said he would introduce government legislation to impose a cap of 80 aircraft movements per hour at Sydney airport. He said he would introduce his own legislation because ' Mr Albanese's private member's bill has a number of technical flaws'. You would have expected the minister, with a whole department at his disposal, to have then gone on to to outline those flaws. But he did not. Not one mention of a problem with this legislation. What did the minister then do? He put out another press release deleting that sentence. So now, in the minister's press release mark 2 headed 'Legislation introduced for Sydney airport' we have the minister foreshadowing government legislation in opposition to mine but without stating one single reason why, given that my bill covers all necessary technical legislation. There are no details in either of his press releases and, most importantly, no timetable for the introduction of that legislation. Despite this, I can give a commitment on behalf of the opposition that we will support a government bill as long as it achieves the following objective: like my private member's bill, it is a tight bill and not just a watered down version of the legislation which I have put before this House today-no maybes, no broad discretions, but a tight bill. No exemptions for VIPs and air force jets going in and out, no exemptions for the Olympics or special sporting events, but tight legislation. If the government is fair dinkum and introduces legislation which I know and I acknowledge has the support of members on both sides of this chamber who represent electorates around Sydney airport, then we will in fact prove we are fair dinkum. We will not worry about who is moving the bill but prove that we are concerned with results. If this bill were passed into law, it would draw a line in the sand for those who wish Sydney airport to grow to unsustainable limits. The aviation industry and some elements of the tourism lobby who say there should be no limit to the size of KSA are not in touch with reality. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is growing at a rate which far exceeds all previous expectations. Forecasts from the discredited draft EIS into the third runway predicted that movements would increase from 206,000 in 1988 to 340,000 in the year 201O-a growth rate of 2.3 per cent. In reality this growth has been much higher. From 1985 to 1994, the actual average growth in aircraft movements was 5.59 per cent. The most recent figures are even more concerning. In the six-month period from November 1995 to April 1996 aircraft movements grew by 9.6 per cent compared with the previous year average. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics working paper entitled Adequacy of transport infrastructure shared this view. The bureau suggested that KSA's ultimate capacity of 353,000 movements per year could be reached as early as the year 2003. It is clear that Sydney airport does have a limit and that that limit is fast approaching. Despite policies of sharing the noise, there is no doubt that thousands of residents in my electorate are still subjected to excessive aircraft noise. In fact, many hundreds of people in my electorate who sold their homes under the old flight path, at a massive loss, and moved to unaffected neighbouring areas are now being plagued with the noise that they paid dearly to escape. These people were presumably encouraged by the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that there will no new flights over the seat of Lowe, and many moved in that direction. John Howard was very clear about this commitment prior to the election. His press release dated 8 February 1996 stated that 'there will be no new flight paths over Ashfield, Strathfield, Rhodes' et cetera and that 'Lowe will not be affected in the future'. In light of the Prime Minister's commitments, it was interesting to receive at last week's SACF meeting the maps of the 10 new modes of proposed operations for Sydney airport. There will be not one new flight path over Lowe but seven new flight paths over Lowe-four going out, three coming in. No wonder we are not prepared to take the press release of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development at face value. We want to see the legislation introduced in this House. The only problem with the SACF meeting was that no usage capacity figures were provided with the maps. In other words, members were told where the planes would go but not how often they would go there. We were told that the preferred mode was mode 4-over the waters of Botany Bay. I think Airservices Australia thought that would make us happy-'Trust us; we're honest!' But there is not a lot of faith in government or in governmental organisations regarding Sydney airport. When we were finally given the figures, we were told that this so-called preferred mode would operate only five to 10 per cent of the time. In fact, a conservative tally of the modes that would see movements over the north, east or west totalled 74 per cent. The modes that revert to the noisy parallel operations will be used 45 to 50 per cent of the time, and they deliver a capacity of over 87 movements per hour. Noise levels may have dropped in some areas, but they are destined to become significantly worse if nothing is done to restrain capacity and there is no second airport. Time does not allow me to elaborate on the many other impacts that Sydney airport has on our area, including ground noise, air pollution and traffic congestion-not to mention the danger of a plane crash in Australia's most densely populated area. These all lead to the same conclusion: in human and economic terms, we cannot afford Sydney airport to grow. As I stated in my first reading speech, the commitment of the coalition to this measure is clear. Page 8 of Putting people first-the coalition's policy on Sydney airport of 29 January states: The coalition will cap aircraft movements at 80 unequivocal movements per hour. .. That commitment is clear and cannot be denied. This bill cannot succeed without the construction of a second airport. I am totally committed, as is the opposition, to the construction of a second airport at Badgerys Creek. This is not a 'nimby' attitude. I am tired of those who say this debate is about inner city people wanting to dump their problems somewhere else. I challenge these people to go to Sydenham or Tempe or Marrickville and find me houses full of yuppies. They simply do not exist. My seat has a higher percentage of families with incomes below $16,000 and a lower average family income than either Prospect or Greenway. In the Lindsay by-election there was a highprofile candidate called Kaye Vella, who ran a campaign against Badgerys Creek airport. Her campaign did not get off the ground. She could not gamer any support, ran about seventh and could not get one per cent of the vote. It is clear that the longer we prevaricate on the actual construction of a second airport, the more desperate the situation will become. We need to build it, and we need to build it now. I have outlined the reasons why this bill must be supported: a vote for this bill is a vote for a limit to noise at KSA; a vote for this bill is a vote for airline safety; a vote this bill is a vote for better planning of our airport needs; a vote for this bill is a vote to ensure the government keeps its promises; a vote for this bill is a vote for certainty and security for the residents of Sydney. We await with anticipation the introduction of the government bill. We will not be withdrawing my legislation until such time as we have a chance to analyse that bill and to see how fair dinkum the minister is. Until that time, I urge all members to support my bill. (Time expired)",54
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Mr Nehl}-Is the motion seconded? Mr Leo MCLeay-1 second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,56
137,Mr ZAMMIT,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It is true that I not only seconded the motion put forward by the honourable member for Gray-dler (Mr Albanese) at last Monday's meetlllg of the Sydney Airport Community Forum but even moved an urgency motion for the matter to be brought forward so it could be discussed. However, what the honourable member for Grayndler did not state in his speech today was that I supported his motion at the SACF meeting but in principle only, as it is very similar to government policy. What I did say at the SACF meeting and what I repeat in the parliament today is that the so called Albanese bill-the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill-as it is currently drafted has, in my view, a number of technical and legal difficulties. Mr Albanese-What are they? Mr ZAMMITI will be very glad to elaborate on the technical and legal difficulties later in my speech. As a result, the government will reject the passage of this bill in its present form for these specific reasons. Having said that, it is nonetheless heartening to see the now opposition adopting coalition policy, however belatedly. It is, I believe, incumbent on me to point out to the House that the opposition's posturing on the issue of a cap is in stark contrast to their stance on the issue prior to the election, which was a policy of not having a policy on the cap at KSA. It is interesting to note how the ALP is for gradually adopting all the coalition policies regarding aircraft movements at KSA-firstly, in regard to the curfew and, secondly, in regard to support for the coalition's rejection of the privatisation of KSA until the aircraft noise issues are adequately addressed. I pause at this moment to reflect on and remember how, prior to the 2 March election, the then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who is now in the chamber, attacked the coalition for our stance on this issue. Now we see a total about-face. In fact, I am sure that honourable members who have an interest in the issue of aircraft noise will remember the vehemence of the attack from the ALP towards the coalition for supposedly wrecking the airport sale process. We now see another turnaround from the ALP in attempting to again copy coalition policy in regard to the cap on movements at KSA to not more than 80 movements per hour. However, the answer to the cap is not comprehensively and adequately addressed by a hurried and poorly drafted private member's bill from the honourable member for Grayndler, which comes after 13 years of scandalous mismanagement of KSA by the ALP. I take up the challenge by the honourable member for Grayndler in regard to the specifics and the inadequacies of the bill. Whilst time is running out for me to mention the other matters I want to raise, I will go into some detail on the problems in his bill. Part 2, clause 4, relates to the limitation on the number of aircraft movements. No mention is made of who has the responsibility for ensuring that the limits are not breached-a very important and crucial omission. I notice that the honourable member for Grayndler has a copy of the bill in front of him. Part 3 of the bill relates to the provision of information. The policy intention behind that provision is singularly unclear. Further, does the minister table reports on airport operations only if the cap has been exceeded? What if the cap is not exceeded? Does he then have to lodge a report, no matter what happens? The bill is silent on this matter. I am also concerned about aspects of the bill contained in part 4 relating to injunctions. I refer in particular to clauses 8 and 9 which will override the Federal Court's own rules on standing. Also of concern is subclause 9(2), which will do absolutely nothing to discourage vexatious litigants. We all know what a cost will be imposed on the government by people who will do everything they can to take the government to court by way of vexatious acts. Mr Albanese-You are worried about residents using it?",56
138,Mr ZAMMIT,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"You have issued a challenge and I am responding to your challenge. Further, I refer to schedule I-amendments to the Airports Act 1996. This will have the highly undesired effect of bypassing the public comment processes and submissions from the airport and aircraft operators, ASA and CASA-which, incidentally, was not supported by the opposition in the Senate in this parliamentary session. The rush and haste to produce this private member's bill is further evidenced by a number of drafting errors. For instance, the reference to section 3 in subclause 5(1) should refer to section 4; the reference to section 7 in subclause 7(1) should refer to section 6; the reference to section 7 in subclause 9(1) should refer to section 8; and the reference to section 7 in subclause 9(2) should refer to section 8. Conversely, I was pleased this morning to note that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has confirmed that the coalition will soon present a government bill, comprehensive and thoroughly researched, to cap aircraft movements at KSA to no more than 80 per hour. This will occurMr Albanese-When?",57
139,Mr ZAMMIT,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,It will occur early in 1997. Mr Albanese-Next year? Soon?,57
140,Mr ZAMMIT,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Early next year; we are just about at the end of the year-following the completion of reports to the minister by two separate working groups that are established and are now well advanced in their examination of the scope for the use of economic instruments and committee based slot allocation processes. Specific reference will be made to ensure that the nature of the slot system developed for Sydney will be best suited to its particular requirements, including the need to accommodate regional airline services. I conclude by applauding the minister for transport for honouring the coalition's commitment. In so doing I quote from the minister's press release issued today: This decision to enshrine the movements cap in legislation puts beyond doubt the government's commitment to honour its election promises in relation to Sydney Airport. All who are aircraft noise affected residents of Sydney will no doubt now feel secure in the knowledge that guarantees in the form of legislation will ensure that a cap will remain in force as long as the coalition remains in government, and that will be for a long, long time.",57
141,Mr LEO MCLEAY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Watson) (3.52 p.m.)I have great pleasure in seconding the motion for the second reading of the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill. After hearing the contribution of the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), one wonders why the government is not going to support it. He put forward nitpicking proposals about how this clause ought to be a subclause. As he should know, those things can easily be fixed up when get to the consideration in detail stage bill. If the member for Lowe thinks everything should come in here as pristine as he is now suggesting, then he ought to have a talk to Leader of the House (Mr Reith). If the ber for Lowe recalls, when the introduced the workplace relations bill recently it had to come back with some hundreds amendments. Pages and pages of amendments were brought forward by the government. If the only nitpicking opposition to this bill the government can come up with is that we should make these small amendments, then the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and I would be more than happy to accommodate any of those types of amendments that member for Lowe or anyone else on the movements government side might want to move. But the problem is that the government does not really want this piece of legislation passed. The member for Lowe talks about how this is coalition policy. The member for Lowe, who often has a short memory about these pudding. things-seeing that the government has rolled him on the issue of flight paths-might recall that when we went to the election it was the Labor Party's policy that we have 80 movethat ments an hour. It was what we decided we were going to do. The member for Grayndler and I are not really interested in this nitpickNorth ing argument. If the government is willing to bring complementary legislation which does what we have proposed in the bill, we than happy to go along with it once we see it. But the trouble with this government is that, when they get down to the fine print of bill that the minister brings in, there will lots of let-outs. VIP aircraft will be let that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his mates can Ily into the airport at any time like. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) will want them to let defence aircraft out. Mr Bruce Scott-It's not my responsibiliwhen ty; you ought to know that. Mr LEO MCLEA Y - He says it is not his portfolio, and that is right, but he spends a lot of his time in them. We all know that. What we the member for Grayndler and I are saying is of this that the people who live around Sydney airport have put up with the problems of noise there for long enough. What we want is for the number of movements there to be limited the to 80 an hour. That is what the EIS on the memairport was about, and we should enshrine government that in legislation. The government has received advice-and of we know about this-that the airport can operate at about 120 movements an hour. The people in the finance area of the government are very keen that this piece of legislation not be passed, because they know that if they can get this legislation knocked off they can go out on the quiet and say to the people who want to buy Sydney airport, 'Wink, wink; the nudge, nudge. The operational cap is 80 an hour, but if you buy the airport and give us a better price we will let you run it up to 120 movements an hour.' That is the go. The government knows that that is the go. Their people are putting around that story right now, so the proof of this is in the By putting this bill forward, we have caused the government to come to the party. If we had not put this bill forward, there is no way the government was ever going to come in here suggesting that they would do anything. The member for Lowe, the member for Sydney (Mr Hockey) and the member for Cook (Mr Mutch) have all gone along to in these community meetings and said, 'We support this now.' They never supported it are more until we put it forward. We have had an effect on the government. What I would say to the government is: the the member for Grayndler and I are more than be happy to support some honest legislation from out so the government which will implement what this bill says. They can go on with all the they nitpicking they like. We are happy; we will cop it. But the undertakings we want from the government-and I would like to hear from the future speakers on this bill now-relate to the minister will be bringing in his bill, how quickly the government wants to pass it and when the people around Sydney airport will get some relief by the government getting off this stupid idea about building an airport at Holsworthy and getting on with the construction at Badgerys Creek. Those of us who live around the airport know that that is the only way to resolve the pressure on Sydney airport so that we will not have people trying to do away with the curfew and trying to exceed the number of movements per hour currently permitted. Results for our constituents are what we want. If the government is willing to accommodate that, we are willing to accommodate them, but we want to do it honestly. (Time expired)",57
142,Mr HOCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have had the pleasure over the last seven days of chairing six public meetings around the Sydney basin in relation to aircraft noise. They were held at Willoughby, Marrickville, Randwick, Drummoyne, South Hurstville and Cronulla. There was one overwhelming message that came out of those public meetings; that is, that the community is very cynical about anything that the Labor Party is proposing in relation to aircraft noise. They are extremely cynical because it was the Labor Party that burnt the bridges between the community and the government on this issue. It was the Labor Party that razed a town called Good Faith. They razed that town by setting up the third runway, by trying to concentrate the noise over a limited number of people. The net result is that the community has had enough of the Labor Party and they are extremely cynical about every proposal coming out of the Labor Party in relation to aircraft noise. Two significant things have occurred in relation to this matter since 2 March. I can understand the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) trying to rebuild the credibility of the Labor Party on this issue. He has done that in two particular ways. It must have given him a great sense of satisfaction as a member of the Left to be able to initiate in ca-cus a proposal that the ALP dump privatis.atlon at Kingsford Smith airport until such time as the noise problems were fixed. That s-unds a lot to me like the policy that the Llberal Party took to the 2 March election. It was the Labor Party that wanted to sell the airport, it was the Labor Party that wanted to sell the airport straight away with no cap and it was the Labor Party that built the third runway that enabled the airport to get up to the so-called 120 movements an hour. It is the Liberal Party that has taken the right action here. We have set the cap on movements at Sydney airport: 80 movements an hour. Then the Labor Party said, 'We'll go for 85.' They were not even out-bidding us. Yet they are now introducing legislation to provide for 80 movements an hour. We have no problem with that whatsoever. It is our policy. You are trying to come over to our side of the field. Secondly, as I pointed out in relation to privatisation, it was the Labor Party that wanted to sell Kingsford Smith airport straight away to get it out of the way and get rid of the problem. We said that we would try to fix it. We have gone to the people and we have spoken with the community. I cannot remember the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton)-unfortunately he chose to step out of the chamber just before I spoke-chairing any public meetings. Yet I am going into his electorate to chair public meetings with his community which is expressing concerns about aircraft noise. I say to the member: I do not have to do your job; I encourage you to speak to your own constituents about the problems. We have pointed out that there are some technical flaws in this bill and we are doing exactly the same thing as the Labor Party did when they were in government. We are saying that as a government we think we can have a better bill. As my colleague the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) pointed out, the technical problems are identified in parts 2, 3 and 4-that is, clause 4 of part 2-schedule 1 in relation to the amendment to section 210 of the Airports Act 1996. Even drafting errors are in place in relation to subclauses 5(1), 7(1),9(1) and 9(2). As was pointed out by the member for Grayndler and a number of other speakers, the Sydney Airport Community Forum which I chair passed a resolution supporting the concept of putting into place legislation which would tum the cap into law. Bad legislation In my view leads to bad law. At this stage, this is had legislation. We have seen enough of the ALP's rhetoric ahout what they want to do at Kingsford Smith airport; they have had enough of a chance to screw up the airport. Leave it to the government; it is doing a good job. We are getting there. We are rebuilding the bridges that you burnt and we are rebuilding the town of Good Faith in relation to aircraft noise in Sydney.",59
143,Mr MCCLELLAND,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Barton) (4.02 p.m.)I point out to the House that a number of the drafting errors referred to by the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) and the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) appeared in an earlier draft. It is quite evident that they have not studied the final text that has been prepared. I will address some of the issues raised by the memher for Lowe. He said that part 3 of the document was unclear on policy. No act that I have ever read, aside from the objects clause, ever states policy. The policy is set out in the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech. He said it was silent as to whether a report was required if a cap was not exceeded. The simple answer to that is: who cares? If the report is required it is obviously required for a prosecution. Clearly no prosecution is contemplated if the cap is not exceeded. The other complaints were in respect of part 4, clauses 8 and 9, saying that it overrode Federal Court right of intervention provisions. He is saying that he wants to make it too tough for residents who have been affected to get involved in the court proceedings and have their say. The next point was criticism of the removal of potential cost penalties against litigants. That protection would have facilitated ordinary people who are affected hy aircraft noise having their say in court. As I say, the fact of the matter is that, fundamentally, an earlier draft has been referred to in terms of several drafting errors which occurred in the earlier draft but which have heen remedied. The fact is that 1997 is too far away. It seems quite ridiculous that legislation is proposed only after two separate working groups give a report to the government. What happens if the working groups give contradictory reports') Who knows? Presumably there will have to be a third report. Time is of the essence. The member for North Sydney, with respect, said that Labor's policy on opposing the privatisation of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport was akin to the Liberal-National coalition policy last year when they opposed the privatisation. I strongly disagree with that; it is not so. The Liberal-National opposition to the privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport last year prevented Badgerys Creek going ahead. If that had been privati sed-the provisions were there for funding of Badgerys Creek and $156 million has already been spent-we would have Badgerys Creek up and running by the Olympics. Instead, we are looking right down the track, well and truly into the next century, possibly beyond the first decade of the next century. On 2 October a senior adviser to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) wrote to a resident who would be affected by Holsworthy and said that it would not be necessary to relocate a hospital constructed at Holsworthy for about 10 years until Holsworthy was up and running-if the government went ahead with Holsworthy. We all know that Holsworthy has problems. It is a farce. Badgerys Creek was a done deal-$156 million had been spent. The money allocated in the forward estimates in last year's budget has been removed by this government. They have spent it on a fundamentally flawed EIS for Holsworthy, which is just putting this back and delaying it longer. That is what this government is about: delay is to the benefit of the big airline companies and the Federal Airports Corporation. The government is backing that delay at a cost to the residents that we all represent. I would have thought members opposite would have backed this bill to get it up and running now, to put the cap in place to end some of the suffering that all our constituents are affected by.",60
144,Mr MUTCH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I support in principle the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996. The bill seeks to limit the number of aircraft movements at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I support the principle of the bill because it attempts to enshrine coalition policy announced at the last election after careful consideration by then aviation spokesman Senator Warwick Parer. Our precise commitment was that 'the coalition will cap movements at 80 movesal ments per hour by implementing a slot system'. This commitment is already being honoured. The development of the slot system is already well advanced and, in his directions to Airservices Australia in the setting up of the task force to look at the long-term opernightmare ations of KSA, the Minister for Transport Regional Development (Mr Sharp) stipulated the non-negotiable basis of the cap. It is interesting to note that a group of ALP senators proposed a less stringent cap of movements in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney operations entitled Falling on deaf ears. What a pertinent metaphor for 13 years of Labor governmentfalling on deaf ears. It is pleasing to see that the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr cal Albanese) seeks to identify himself with our policy and dissociate himself from the ALP, which has no credibility whatsoever on the aircraft noise issue. The honourable member endorses our policy. His bill is a political stunt-a good stunt, but a stunt nevertheless. I was one of three federal who supported a motion moved last week at the Sydney Airport Community Forum which bility says: That the Sydney Airport Community Forum supports the ""Sydney Airport (Regulation of ments) Bill 1996"" in principle, or similar legislation which would enshrine a restricted capacity of up to 80 movements in anyone hour at KSA. We believe a second Sydney Airport would enable this capacity to be reduced in the future. That motion was moved by the honourable member for Grayndler and seconded by the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit).! ment. emphasise the last paragraph because it is at the heart of this issue. With a growth rate at KSA of four to five per cent it is obvious we. need a second airport to service Sydney. If It were not for the prevarication of the previous government we would be well on way to having a second airport to service Sydney. Now, of course, the scene has changed and the choice of a second airport is fraught with difficulties. If we do not have a second airport, pressure will continue to increase on KSA and madcap schemes such as the propoto build a fourth runway in the middle of Botany Bay will gain more credence. God forbid that the ALP should ever be re-elected. The Freddy Krueger of Australian politics, although dead, is still kicking. The to contemplate is the honourable and member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) officiating one day at the opening of the fourth runway. Although it is a long-term aim, when the second airport is operational it is my view 85 that all curfew operations from KSA should be transferred and the number of non-curfew reduced to a more tolerable level. Because this bill is a political stunt it has not been properly thought out. We have been given a brief by the minister of all the technidifficulties apparent in the present bill. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that our policy is implemented effectively and the minister has been doing this in a responsible manner. I support the principle of the bill. I will vote to support the legislation to be introduced by the minister at the Liberal members appropriate time. It must be said that the ALP has no crediwhatsoever on this issue. That should be evidenced by the fact that the long-suffering people of Kurnell gave me a 20 per cent Moveswing to win the booth. That is historic support from those people. I have been offering them truth and honesty. They are not 100 per cent pleased by what has been proposed so far, and neither am I-but neither is anybody. At least they are getting truth and honesty from this government-something they did not get from the previous governThe ALP have put up two cleanskins to speak to this bill. I might term the honourable that member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) a cleanskin, but I do not know what I would term the honourable member for Grayndler. I know the that he has been in there, very much an activist for the Left. The problem he has got is that he cannot get his way against the massive Right in the New South Wales Labor Party. They have buried him under concrete before and they will bury him under concrete and asphalt again. He has got very little say within the Labor Party. I know that the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. The Labor Party have not achieved anything over the last 13 years on this issue, except a tape is going around-it was put out before the last election, I believe, though I have not yet got a copy-which says 'Vote for anybody but the ALP'. (Time expired)",60
145,Mr ALBANESE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"by leave-I rise to indicate my disappointment at the comments of the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). I am disappointed that he says there are so many problems with my bill, the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996. The member for Lowe could not even speak for 10 minutes on it. He got to seven minutes and ran out of puff. The reality is that there are no criticisms of substance to my bill. I and the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) will accept any reasonable amendments based upon any drafting considerations which you are concerned about. We will do that and accommodate any requirements which you have. You knew that because I wrote to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) about 12 days ago--on the Wednesday of the last sitting-and indicated that I would happy to have another meeting with him to make sure that there was a consensus position before this parliament on my bill. To be fair, this morning I received a courtesy call from the minister's office-but no meeting, no discussion about drafting problems. The seconder of this bill and I do not have a whole department at our disposal. But what we have managed to do is put this issue on the agenda-something that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, with a whole department with thousands of advisers, could not do; something that the government, with an overwhelming majority, could not do; and something that the Sydney Airport Community Forum had not done before I moved the motion last Monday.",62
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Burma-Thailand Railway,62
147,Mr TRUSS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges the great heroism and sacrifice of Australia's prisoners of war, in particular those who worked on the Burma-Thailand railway; (2) commends the Government on its initiative to construct a museum and memorial to prisoners of war near Hellfire Pass in Thailand;. (3) commends Mr Rod Beattie and his associates for their work in clearing a 4km walking trail along the Burma-Thailand railway at Hellfire Pass; and (4) calls on Australian companies, ex-service organisations and other countries whose service personnel also worked on the railway to support the Prisoner of War Memorial project. War evokes many stories of horror and sacrifice and among its great tragedies are the experiences of the prisoners taken in war. Never in history have so many Australians been held captive by our enemies than in southern Asia in 1942. An estimated 13,000 Australian prisoners of war, along with 30,000 British, 18,000 Dutch and 700 Americans, were put to work by their Japanese captors to build the infamous Thai-Burma railway. Many of the Australians were surrendered at the fall of Singapore. Some had never fired a shot in battle but were destined to spend the war as slave labour for the enemy. The Japanese were concerned that their communications depended upon long and exposed sea routes and so decided to complete a railway connecting Burma with Thailand and Singapore. Work on a railway had commenced prior to the war but was abandoned, leaving the most difficult 403 kilometres still to build. The route was through mountainous jungle country, home of almost every known tropical disease and with one of the most inhospitable climates in the world. The men worked in appalling conditions, food supplies were irregular and inadequate, and they were sent to work on the line before any accommodation was completed. Disease, malaria, dysentery and cholera were rife and medical supplies severely limited. The J apanese masters were cruel and when the work was delayed by the wettest monsoon in history they demanded even more from their prisoners. Perhaps the most remarkable and tragic story of the line was the construction of Hellfire Pass. Ironically, construction of Hellfire Pass commenced with a work force of 400 Australian prisoners on ANZAC Day ers. 1943. The required excavation of soil rock to a depth of 20 metres soon fell behind schedule and additional Australian and British prisoners brought the work force to 1,000 men. A vast amount of material had to removed from the cutting by hand using cane baskets and sacks slung between poles. The men worked around the clock, using oil pot lamps, and such was the brutality of the Japanese and Korean engineers and guards that 69 men were beaten to death. An estimatdeeply ed 400 prisoners of war lost their lives ing Hellfire Pass. It is appropriate, therefore, that this area, Konyu Cutting at Hellfire should be chosen as the site for a memorial for prisoners of war. After the war, the railway line was tom up and the line was quickly reclaimed by the jungle. In 1983, a former prisoner of war, Tom Morris, returned to Hellfire Pass and resolved to convince the Australian govern the ment that the area should be preserved and presented as an historic site. Jim Appleby, engineer with the Snowy Mountains Engineerbuilding ing Corporation who was working on a dam on the Upper Kwai, used much of his spare time to investigate accessible parts of the old abandoned railway. The Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce started to take an interest in the proposal. Tim buried Fischer spoke about the project in this House on 27 February 1987. Former foreign minister there. Bill Hayden was among visitors to Hellfire Pass. When former Prime Minister Keating visited the site in 1994 he provided encourfamous agement for the Australian government's eventual commitment to a memorial and museum. Plans are close to completion for the construction of a $1.6 million building. Working enthusiastically has been Mr Rod Beattie, a former constituent of mine, who works with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission at Kanchanaburi. Rod has shown extraordinary enthusiasm and dedication and has personally reclaimed and cleared a fourkilometre walking track along the old railway route. The lines and bridges have long since gone, but the ballast, each stone broken by the hammers of prisoners of war, is still in place, along with occasional decaying sleepStaircases have been built into the ravines and once crossed by trestle bridges. In September, I visited the Hellfire Pass project. I walked with Rod Beattie along the line in the steamy jungle, paused at Hintock be Station, walked where the pack of cards bridge stood and on to Compressor Cutting and finally to Hellfire Pass. I saw the magnificently stone pitched embankments, the narrow twisting cuttings and the remnants of the old bridges. It is impossible not to be moved just by being there. This place buildsaw so much suffering, so much inhumanity and so many losses. In Hellfire Pass there is Pass, a major plaque remembering those who died and another recognising the work of Sir Edward 'Weary' Dunlop, whose ashes were interred in the pass on ANZAC Day 1994, exactly 51 years after construction began. To visit the Thai-Burma railway meant a great deal to me. My wife's father was one of prisoners of war. Warrant Officer Arch Caswell was a radar technician and received an a British Empire Medal for his work in radios in the POW camps. Constructed from an array of pilfered parts and hidden in the leg of a stool, the radio kept prisoners informed of the progress of the war. As the war drew to an end and the presence of the radio became too dangerous, it was beneath the kitchen at his final camp at Tamarkan-and who knows, it still may be Some of the 13,000 Australians who worked on the Burma-Thai railway were like Weary Dunlop, one of whose wartime hospitals stood under two large trees which now shade the Chungkai Cemetery where 1,740 of his colleagues are buried. Most were unknown. Frank Huxham, who on the day he died was referred to in my fatherin-law's diary as 'our special mate', now rests among 6,982 other prisoners of war in the beautifully tended graves at the Kanchanaburi war cemetery. Cyril Scriven, who only a couple of months ago when he learned he had just a few more weeks to live, returned to Thailand for one last visit to the railway and to bid farewell to his mates. One in five of the prisoners of war who worked on the railway perished, including 2,710 Australians. The death toll among the conscripted 200,000 Asian labourers was even worse. At least 80,000 were thought to have perished. Some 1,000 Japanese also died. In all, one life was lost for every five metres of track. Even most of those who returned were irrevocably changed. Is it any wonder that this project, though engineeringly significant, was named the Death Railway? The Hellfire Pass memorial project will help record some of the history and memorabilia of that era. In addition to the memorial, museum and walking track, Rod Beattie hopes to rebuild part of one of the bridges and bring back one of the original wartime engines. While the Australian government, to its credit, has taken the lead on this project, and the Thai government have been active partners, this is not intended to be a memorial only for Australians. There were more British and Dutch POWs working and lost on the railway than there were Australians. I encourage the British, Dutch, American, Malaysian and other governments, along with POW associations and other ex-service groups, to support the project and to bring it to fruition. The Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce has played a major role, and I hope that Australian and other overseas companies working in Thailand will also lend the project their active support. I have noted the tremendous support for this project by the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), and I welcome his presence at the table. I have suggested to him that perhaps there needs to be some kind of trust established to assist in the management of the memorial and to receive donations. Overseas war museums and families of expaws can assist with much of the research which needs to be done to present the Hellfire Pass project as a living centre of study. No memorial, no matter how impressive, can ever adequately depict the horror of those times and that place. The best memorial is in the hearts of Australians who remember. But if we are to adequately value our peace, we need to always remember the sufferings of war. This project provides a tangible recognition and will surely entrench in our hearts that such a thing must never happen again.",62
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded?,64
149,Mr MARTIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Cunningham) (4.24 p.m.)Yes. It is with pleasure that I come to this place today to second the motion moved by our colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and, in doing so, to demonstrate once again that on specific matters in this place there is a tremendous amount of bipartisanship, particularly when it comes to matters that affect our service personnel and people from the veterans community generally. Like the honourable member for Wide Bay, I am appreciative of the fact that the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is in the chamber this afternoon to hear the comments made by his colleague from the National Party and to hear the comments from the opposition, which are totally in support of the motion. There is no doubt that the four parts of the motion which has been moved go to some very real elements of this matter. The first part of the motion acknowledges the heroism and sacrifice of Australia's prisoners of war, in particular those who worked on the BurmaThailand railway. I refer members to the 1995-96 annual report of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There is a section in that report, at page 69, which talks about the Hellfire Pass memorial project. I will quote some excerpts from that part of the report: The Burma-Thailand Railway from Moulamein in Burma to Ban Pong in Thailand was built by the Japanese during World War II to resupply their army in Burma. Construction began in June 1942 and was completed in December 1943. The railway was built using prisoners of war and impressed Asian labourers. Of the 60 000 Allied prisoners employed during construction, some 12000 including more than 2 700 Australians, died of disease, sickness, ill treatment, malnutrition and exhaustion. It is estimated that between 80 000 and 100 000 Asian labourers died. Conditions for the prisoners and labourers were deplorable and the treatment they received from their Japanese and Korean guards was barbaric. As the honourable member for Wide Bay has pointed out, Hellfire Pass was the name given to Konyu Cutting because, during a campaign in 1943 to speed completion of the railway, open fires were used to light the scene for the night shift. This cutting was selected as a memorial site in 1984 and the memorial was dedicated on 26 April 1987. Site works in 1988 were the main bicentennial project of the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce and were funded by the Australian government to the tune of some $31,000. Since then further works and the relaying of a single section of rail in the cutting have been carried out by Australian Defence Force units on temporary duty in Thailand. The second part of the motion commends the government on its initiative to construct a museum and memorial to prisoners of war near Hellfire Pass in Thailand. Again, I think that is appropriate. I think it is also appropriate that the former government be similarly commended, because it was during the tenure of our former colleague who is regrettably departed, Con Sciacca, and during a visit by the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, that in fact this war memorial concept was put in place. It is interesting to tum back to comments which the former Prime Minister Paul Keating made at an address in a POW ceremony at the Australian War Memorial. He talks not only about the concept of Hellfire Pass and commitments that were made by the government at the time to that memorial which we are diScussing today but also generally about What prisoners of war had to endure. The speech which he delivered on 14 February -995 contained some very interesting statistICS. In all, as I have said, more than 27,000 Australians died in the Second World War. Their sacrifice, like that of those who have died in every war, will never be forgotten. In Thailand last year at Kanchanaburi, the Prime Minister attended a service for the Australians who died as prisoners of war on the BurmaThailand railway. He said: Their story is legendary. Thirty thousand Australians were POWs in various parts of the world. It is they who we are honouring today: the Australians who died in captivity. It is interesting to take from the then Prime Minister's speech a couple of further points: To remember the sacrifice of our POWs today, we need to imagine not just the physical suffering they endured, but the psychological suffering-the terrible loneliness and the sense of loss, the homesickness and the helplessness they had to live with. And we need to ask ourselves what gave them the faith and courage they needed to live with the adversity and fight off the despair? How did they keep hope alive? We know from accounts like those of Barney Roberts and Weary Dunlop ... that paramount among the sustaining values of Australian POWs were those indefinable bonds between them which we call mateship. That is absolutely true. It is something which we as serving members of parliament should under all circumstances remember. As a duty, we should pass on our knowledge and our information about the suffering that men and women who fought for Australia in fact endured, and those at Hellfire Pass are a classic example of the sort of teaching we should be giving to people. As Paul Keating in that speech again remarked: The outrage we feel about what was done on the Burma-Thailand Railway or on the Sandakan Death March should never fade. Our children should know about these things. We must not forget. And that is dead right. He continued: Yet, as the life of Weary Dunlop tells us, we must allow the wounds to heal. If Australians sacrificed their lives and freedom so that we could be free, we owe it both to their memory and our children to see that Australia is kept free of old hatreds and bitterness. That speech, delivered by former Prime Minister Keating on 14 February 1995 at the POW ceremony at the Australian War Memorial, encapsulates in my view the very concerns and the very thrust of the motion which the honourable member for Wide Bay brings before us today. Like him, I would congratulate and commend Mr Beattie and his associates for their work in clearing a fourkilometre walking trail along the BurmaThailand railway at Hellfire Pass. Similarly, I would call on Australian companies, ex-service organisations and other countries whose service personnel also worked on the railway to support the prisoner of war memorial project because that project itself is commendable indeed. As the member for Wide Bay pointed out, following a visit by the then Prime Minister in February 1994 and an exchange of correspondence between the Australian and Thai governments in August 1994, the Commonwealth government committed $1.6 million to the development of a museum complex centred on Hellfire Pass which will comprise a museum, a 4.5-kilometre walkway with rest stations and information panels along the alignment of the railway and a locomotive and rolling stock exhibit. The first stage of the project was completed with the commissioning of the walking trail on ANZAC Day this year and the project is expected to be completed by September 1997. As has been reported, this memorial does provide an awareness for people who visit Hellfire Pass of the sacrifice that was made by Australians and, equally, by representatives and members of serving personnel of other countries who, like the Australians, were captured, were prisoners of war and had to endure the sorts of conditions that some of us could only dream about in terms of their severity, in terms of the way in which humankind can subject other members of humankind to such things. The Australia Remembers program last year did a number of things. It brought a dimension to public education, an awareness, about the sacrifices and the way in which Australian men and women have given for this country that we should not forget. It should not simply be a one year's remembrance activity; it should be something which is ongoing. It is through motions such as this which the honourable member for Wide Bay has brought before this House for discussion that the awareness and public education program continues. I want to commend him for bringing it to the House today. My only regret is that we did not have more time because I think there were many members of this place on both sides of the chamber who would have liked to have commented on it. I am sure even the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who has been with us during this debate, would like to have made some comments about his views on this matter, which are very similar to those of all of us. Let me conclude by again congratulating the member for Wide Bay for bringing forward this motion.",64
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Filipino-Australian Development Association Senior Citizens Rooty Hill Rotary Club Second Sydney Airport  thought I would start today's grievance debate on a positive note and say how pleased I was to attend the second anniversary of the Filipino-Australian Development Association. They are a group in my electorate who undertake a very worthwhile cause of raising money. It was their second anniversary dinner at the Granville Bowling Club, in the electorate of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), that I attended. This year they are donatipg to the Life Education Centre in Colyton in my electorate, and the Mary MACKillop Foundation. They are also providing some money to needy students in the Philippines. It was a very well-attended function. I must offer my sincere congratulations to the president, George Flowers, and the vice-president, Cynthia Macabenta, who really worked very hard to make the night an outstanding cess. I am very pleased that the Blacktown City Council was a diamond donor for function. As I pointed out, this is a reflection of the esteem in which the Filipino communithat ty are held in Blacktown as well as a recognihad tion of the significant contribution they are making to the city. I also attended a couple of senior citizens meetings, in particular a meeting of Combined Pensioners Association at Rooty Hill. When you attend these functions you really do not act in a very political way But, in being pleased to attend their luncheon, I must say I was, if you like, a little political. I pointed out that, whilst the pension had not been reduced, everything else for senior citizens had been attacked by the Liberal government following the 2 March election. I was very disappointed that this was so because I believe you judge a society by the way a society cares for its children and elderly people. I pointed out, for example, that the coresidents. payment for prescriptions had been increased without increasing the pension. The dental health program-600,000 of our fellow Ausback tralians being assisted this year-will be abolished next year. Legal aid has been heavily restricted and curtailed. Pensioners benefit from legal aid and will now severely restricted. In relation to public housing, will be no new pensioner flats constructed. I have spoken before in the House about the issue of the up-front payment for nursing homes. Indeed, I was asked by one of the pensioners whether, if you are already in hostel, you would still be up for the up-front payment if you needed to go into a nursing home. Sadly, I said yes. I quoted the figure the Our Lady of Consolation Home, a large and particularly well-run operation by Good Sisters at Rooty Hill. They estimate 90 per cent of people who are resident in nursing homes would be financially disadvanthe taged. All these things that go to assist penknow sioners in the twilight years of their lives been attacked or abolished by the incoming government. . I also went to a function put on by the .R.ooty Hill Rotary Club. They suc300 pensioners to the Good Shepherd. I was very pleased to see Father Pat and Damien the Colbourne there in the thick of things. I congratulate Rotary for the excellent luncheon they put on. My only regret was that I to leave before lunch was served, and I rather think that there was a better lunch there than at the function that I ended up going to. The last issue that I want to raise in this the grievance debate concerns Badgerys Creek airport. I know that the House has heard a lot about Kingsford Smith airport. I am one of at all. those members who have been really concerned-and a lot of my constituents have been as well-about the adverse impact that a lot of residents in and around Mascot airport have been suffering because of changes made by the former and the present governments. In relation to Badgerys Creek itself, I think the overwhelming support really started to its change-or the first discernible signs of change-with the opening of the third runway and the impact that that had on inner city I have already confessed that I was a very early supporter of the Badgerys Creek airport. As with lots of things, you can look in hindsight and say, 'Well, if it had been built as it was originally proposed'-not as a general airport but as a fully-fledged international airport- 'back in the midto late-1980s, then a lot of the debate that we there are having these days about Sydney's second airport would not exist.' I have to also report to the House that, in a small way at the moment but increasingly, concerns are being expressed about Badgerys a Creek. I happen to believe that it was a real disappointment that the agreement did not go ahead that we had with the then Minister for of Transport. It had been agreed that the three additional studies to supplement the 1980s the EIS would go ahead, that the flight paths that would be developed and that there would be a full consultation process with everyone in western suburbs of Sydney so they would before the last election precisely whethhave er or not they were affected and, if so, how. I have some sympathy with Senator John Faulkner who, towards the end of our term of government, scrambled-valiantly, I thinkinvited over with a further EIS. The John Howard government did make some undertakings about Badgerys Creek. They said that there would be a much better, full, public, accountable and transparent EIS process. I do not really believe that anything that has been published to date suggests that that really is the case. There is not one indication in anything that has been published to date about the degree and manner of the consultation. Whilst I accept that the EIS is considering whether there will be a curfew, I do not believe a 24-hour operation for a new airport is any more acceptable, particularly if the basis of the EIS shows a differential in the treatment of night flights between Australian practice and world best practice. That is certainly the case and has been commented on by a Senate report. The other thing that I remain disappointed about with the government is that, prior to the election, there was talk of a go/no-go clause in the EIS, that is, when all the factors were added up-whether it was air quality or noise or whatever aspect the EIS was examiningthere would have to be a recommendation by the officials that on balance the airport should proceed or that on balance it should not. Certainly, there is no provision in the current eral environmental act, but it is a feature of the relevant New South Wales act. I feel that a lot of my constituents are going to be disappointed that this is not a feature in this Perhaps the two most alarming things now about the EIS are the provision of a crossrunway that heads straight for my electorate and that of the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) as well as an option C which turns the runway from the original around 90 degrees and heads straight over St Clair and Erskine Park. One can only wonder whether the people who voted Liberal in St Clair are now being punished for having done so. Clearly, this will change a lot of people's attitude towards Badgerys Creek. I can only say that I think all people are going to be benefited by full consultation, a full amount of information being made available and everyone being able to assess for themselves what the impact of this airport will be. Last but not least, I note that Blacktown City Council has now come out opposed to Badgerys Creek airport. I just pose the question: I wonder what the Liberal controlled Penrith City Council are going to do and whether WESROC will take another opportunity to revisit the issue of Badgerys Creek airport. Member for Oxley Western Australian Election",66
151,Mr EOIN CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am loath to mention the H word-as in Hanson-because it has already been done to death in the media. However, so many people in my electorate have asked for my opinion and, given that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has come in for some unnecessary criticism by members of both sides of this House, I thought I might just as well give my tuppence worth. Having spent 23 years in the media, I have a rough idea of how the media operates: a story is a story. Very often they do not let the truth get in the way of a good story. The member for Oxley has been built up, just as surely as attempts are now being made to cut her down. Before anyone judges this fedwoman, I would suggest that they read her maiden speech, then re-read it and decide for themselves. Sure enough, she spoke of Aboriginal funding and multiculturalism, which EIS. we have all heard about. But she also spoke about issues which affect the lives of a great many Australians, notably the Family Law Act and the Child Support Agency. The member for Oxley has four children, is a single parent and runs a fish and chip shop. The shop has made her the butt of many jokes, particularly from some members opposite. Why, I ask? Surely we should be encouraging someone who has set up a small business, as small business is still the greatest employer in Australia. Some members opposite are snide about the member for Oxley being a fish and chips lady, but how many members opposite have ever run a small business? Only one of them has been involved in small business; so if they are going to sledge the member for Oxley for being a small business person they are more stupid than I imagined. Small business is our nation's backbone and ought to be encouraged, not condemned. The member for Oxley asked why we should have separate development for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. For example, we have Austudy and Abstudy, we have legal aid, and then there is the Aboriginal Legal Service. The Afrikaans word for separate development is 'apartheid'. Isn't apartheid something that Australia lectured South Africa for years over? Basically, she was talking about the dissemination of taxpayers' money. I think it is high time we got back to basics and ensured that there is adequate funding for health, education and community safety before anything else. It is ridiculous that we have waiting lists growing while we provide funding to trade unions, for example. That is what happened under Labor. Let us start to fix these problems first before we spend money elsewhere. I am all for spending money on health-getting rid of waiting lists-education and the essentials before giving money to trade unions, arts groups or the like. The member for Oxley said the Family Law Act had: ... brought death, misery and heartache to countless thousands of Australians, with children like pawns in some crazy game of chess. I see the evidence of this every day in my job as a member of parliament. Equally, every day I see a parade of broken men and women who are victims of the Child Support Agency. Many non-custodial parents, as the member for Oxley pointed out, simply give up their job to escape the often impossible financial demands placed on them. I do not recall being asked what my view was, and here I totally agree with the member for Oxley. We are, I should remind the House, representatives of the people. We are here to act and speak on their behalf. How many of us really do ask the people what they want? It is their country, yet the only say that they have is every three years by placing a f-w numbers in a few boxes. How many times have Australians been asked what mig-ation levels they want? They do not, in reahty, have a proper say. Just because one questions the rate of immigration does not make one a racist, and that is an unfair tag that I believe has been placed on the member for Oxley. I suggest to honourable members, as an exercise, to check out for themselves how difficult it is-if not impossible-to migrate to some of the countries who are loudly criticising our policies. The member for Oxley has also been criticised for her comments on foreign aid. Having recently led a delegation to our Pacific neighbours, I recognise the need for targeted aid, but let us not just throw dollars into a bottomless pit. Given that, how can we shout down the member for Oxley's view? I can only ask from the bottom of my heart: listen to this lady's view in the same way that you would listen to any fellow Australian's view. After the member for Oxley made her maiden speech in the federal parliament, I made a point of walking around the chamber to tell her that, while I might not agree with everything she said, I would defend to the death her right to say it. The Labor Party have used the comments of the member for Oxley to condemn the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for not responding to what she said. This is the same Labor Party who have as a candidate in the forthtreated coming Western Australian election a man whose actions in parliament led to the subject of those actions committing suicide. The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) knows who I am talking about-it is John Halden. She did nothing about him. Kim Beazley did nothing about him. Geoff Gallop has done nothing about him. Labor did absolutely nothing about John Halden, who got up in parliament and tabled a petition, the contents of which were totally inaccurate and, as a result, an innocent young woman took her life. Labor did nothing, not even apologise. Yet they have the hide to have a go at the Prime Minister for not responding to a backbench MP who is not even of his own party and who simply spoke her mind. She exercised her right to free speech. John Halden deliberately and dishonestly took actions which resulted in an innocent woman taking her life. The Labor Party did nothing about John Halden but are crying blue murder for the Prime Minister doing nothing, quite rightly, about a member of the House of Representatives representing her electorate as she sees fit. Until the Labor Party get rid of John Halden, they have no right to lecture anyone-and the Prime Minister in particular-about taking action against members for actions they have taken. As all members would be aware, Western Australia goes to the polls on 14 December. Geoff Gallop released Labor's first policy recently, on financial management. His policy is to produce surpluses every year, reduce public sector debt and restore the state's credit rating to triple A. Dr Gallop is a policy thief. This is Liberal policy; it has been for four years. Labor created the debt; Labor lost the triple A rating. It is the Liberal Party that has brought financial responsibility to Western Australia by paying the debt off and taking us back onto the road to triple A. What Dr Gallop is advocating is a vote for Liberal policies. When the first policy the Labor Party releases is the Liberal policy for the previous four years, you know that Labor have no ideas of their own. Today, the Western Australian Treasury, for the first time in the history of politics in Australia, will release a full statement of Western Australia's financial position. It will show forward estimates showing revenue and expenditure for four years. Members will recall that the federal Labor Party refused to detail the state of the nation's finances during the last election. It was not until we took office that the truth was revealed, that we were $8 billion worse off than the Labor government said we were. Today, the Western Australian Liberal government is honestly detailing the state of the books before the election. The federal government will be doing the same prior to the next election. That is the difference between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party: we will be responsible for taxpayers' money whereas Labor throws it away like confetti. The wise people of Western Australia will reject Geoff Gallop on 14 December. He is a financial fraud. He was in the Labor Party room when millions were wasted on their big business mates. He did absolutely nothing about it. He did nothing when Labor sent our state into record indebtedness. He did nothing when Labor lost our triple A credit rating. He will only ruin the responsible financial management of the Court government, which has cut debt, thereby reducing debt servicing and allowing more money to be spent on the priorities. If Western Australia is to enter the next century in a sound financial position, able to spend money on the priorities of health, education and law and order, it needs a financially responsible government. Only one party offers that: the Liberal-National coalition led by Richard Court. Western Australian Election Health Funding New South Wales Central Coast: Suicide Summit Men's Health",68
152,Mr LEE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Before I start on the comments which I came into the House to speak to this afternoon, I would like to respond to a few remarks made by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), who preceded me. We in the Labor Party always find it a badge of courage when Liberal Party people feel it necessary to come into the House and attack Labor leaders of whatever state. I make the point to the honourable member that Geoff Gallop, whom the member has been attacking personally this afternoon, is a leader of the highest quality. Certainly, in my dealings with him as the former shadow minister for health in Western Australia, he is a person who has worked very hard to try to raise the issues that affect the quality of health care in that state. Geoff Gallop, now the leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia and former spokesman on health and deputy leader, is one of those people who have put a lot of effort into trying to expose the Court government's cutbacks for public hospitals in Western Australia. It has been quite interesting to watch. When you look at how much state governments are spending on health around the country, it can be seen that New South Wales is the only state where they have actually increased the state effort for funding for public hospitals over the last two years. It is up by $600 million. There certainly has not been a $600 million increase in the Court government's funding for public hospitals in that state. In fact, they have cut state funding for public hospitals in Western Australia. When you add to that the Howard government's cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals, it results in a second level of cuts for public hospital services in Western Australia. On the occasions that I have been to Western Australia, people whose working lives are dedicated to providing quality health care to Western Australians tell me that they have enormous difficulty in trying to provide the most basic health services to people in that state, given the cutbacks that have been made. It is common knowledge that a casualty ward in one of the major hospitals in Western Australia is known as the 'Richard Court Wing' because of the number of people who have to wait on trolleys before they get admitted and get proper treatment. I am quite sure that Geoff Gallop is prepared to be judged by the stand he has made in trying to encourage greater spending by the Court Liberal government on public hospital funding. We totally oppose the decision of that government to privatise some of the public hospitals in that state. We have enormous concerns about the impact these cutbacks are having on ordinary Western Australians, such as the increase in waiting times and reductions in the number of staff at these hospitals. It is these sorts of issues that Geoff Gallop will take to the electors of Western Australia over the next few weeks. I would like to make a few remarks about a very important event that took place last Friday on the central coast of New South Wales. The central coast is represented in this parliament by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd), by me and by my colleague the honourable member for Short northern portion of the central coast. The Central Coast Suicide Committee, headed by Mr Eric Trezise, organised our region'S first suicide summit last Friday. I acknowledge the fact that the member for Robertson attended and spoke on behalf of the Minister for Family Services, Judi Moylan, at that suicide summit. It is of great concern to everyone who lives on the central coast that, over the last 43 weeks, 43 people have taken their lives-37 men and six women. In many cases, they were young men. It is an enormous loss to local communities and, in particular, a tragedy for the individual families and friends who know the people who have taken their lives. Many speakers at the summit spoke about the tendency amongst people who decide to take their lives to have difficulty with alcohol abuse, difficulty with the pressures caused by family breakdowns and difficulties caused by the isolation of living on the central cost with often inadequate public transport and high levels of unemployment in our local area. Stewart Heyward, a local parent, outlined in tragic detail the situation that his family faced before his son committed suicide. In particular, he outlined the difficulties that his family faced in trying to obtain adequate support from private and public hospitals. He also went on to make some observations about his distress about some of the material that is around for young people these days, whether it is words that are used in certain songs played regularly on the radio or that are available on CDs, images that are available on certain videos or some of the unhealthy obsessions with rock stars who have taken their own lives in days gone by. I certainly commend Mr Heyward for his bravery in sharing that tragic story with everyone who was at the suicide summit. It was quite surprising that 300 people attended this summit on the central coast. We can only hope that all those 300 people will take back what they have learnt from the summit and will try to make sure that we are able to provide better services for people who are in need of counselling. We can only hope that the local area hospital service will get extra funding to try to make sure that they can provide better counselling services and that we can help educate doctors, educators and people who work in schools to make them better able to try to identify the people who are at risk. I mention in passing that, of the 43 people who have committed suicide on the central coast in the past 43 weeks, the overwhelming majority were men and many were young men. There are a number of areas of health care in Australia where men have greater difficulties than women. This often surprises many people and I know the parliamentary secretary at the table would agree with some of my comments on this. The former government drew up a draft national men's health policy which, in particular, highlighted that: men have a lower life expectancy of 75 years compared with 81 for women; young men 15 to 24 are three times as likely to die as young women and more than six times as likely to commit suicide; and men aged 25 to 64 die at twice the rate of women of the same age. This draft policy also highlighted the fact that not only are men sicker but they are less likely to see their doctor. For whatever reasons, the social mores of our particular community tend to discourage men from consulting their doctor if they have a concern. The former government's draft national men's health policy drew up an action plan, suggesting that we needed to develop some targeted education programs and commission additional research addressing some of these specific issues that affect men's health. I admit that, at the time of the election, the former government had not had a chance to provide extra money for those action plans. But of course we were hopeful that, with the draft policy having been released late last year, a re-elected Labor government would have found the resources to implement those measures. Certainly, I believe that the draft national health policy came up with a whole series of proposals that were worthy of funding. Unfortunately, the current minister and the current government have not only decided not to fund the proposals but also, as was quite clear in Senate estimates, sought to suppress the report. It was admitted on 18 September, when one of the departmental officials was asked about this, that: The minister has asked that it not be systematically distributed and that, as a consequence, we have had to put on hold the distribution. It is bad enough that the government is not prepared to fund an implementation of proposals that improve men's health. But it is even worse when the government tries to suppress informed debate about these issues. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) addresses Liberal Party meetings in Queensland and claims that some form of political censorship has been lifted with the election of the Howard government, it is pretty hard to reconcile those claims with the decision by the minister for health to suppress the draft national men's health policy, the document that his department prepared and has been sitting on. These are the sorts of issues that, I would have hoped, all members would have been willing to debate and support. For all of these reasons, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in this debate on grievances this afternoon. Could I end by saying that, with Geoff Gallop working hard in Western Australia, we are very sure that an elected Gallop government will increase funding for public hospitals. (Time expired) Small Business",70
153,Mr NUGENT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On the comments by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), I am not an expert on Western Australian politics, but I am quite confident that his side of politics will get the same result there on the appropriate day as the Australian Labor Party got on 2 March and as was repeated in the Lindsay by-election. The matter which the honourable member was generally addressing-not his political points about social suppression and so onthat of suicide, is a matter of concern. One of the issues that the previous government did not come to grips with was that there are many things on which you would want to spend money and there are many things which deserve to have resources spent on them, but you actually have to generate the money to deal with that. That means you have to generate the wealth in the country. So what I want to talk about this afternoon perhaps goes some way to how we address generating profit and wealth in this country, how we become a richer and more successful society so that we can do all of those good things that are necessary in a social sense. I want to talk about the importance of business and industry in this country, particularly exporting businesses. I am not talking about big companies as such, the BHPs and various other large companies because they are obviously well able to look after themselves. I want to talk about small to medium sized enterprises. I want to talk about the need for a national cultural change, for a change in the climate of the way we approach doing business, particularly at the small end of the market, and the way we look at where we sell our product. Of course, many small and medium sized businesses in my electorate, which is Aston in the eastern suburbs of Melboume-and in the neighbouring electorates-produce some 46 per cent of Victoria's manufactured products and also a lot of services. In my electorate and in Australia generally, small businesses have had a fairly rough deal in the last few years. Briefly, perhaps, I remind the House that on the industrial relations front, if and talk to any small businessman-and there are some 8,000 in my electorate-they will tell you that probably the single biggest inhibitor to the success of their business and their prospects of employing people have been the previous government's unfair dismissal regulations. The industrial relations legislation which we are about to introduce into this country will be a big improvement in that area. Another major bugbear that small business has had to bear over the last few years is interest rates. I well recall when I won my seat six years ago, one of the major reasons, quite franklyMr Ronaldson-You've increased your margin every time since then.",72
154,Mr NUGENT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"And increased my margin. I thank the parliamentary secretary at the table for reminding me of that. The point I wanted to make was that interest rates, when I got elected, were well over 20 per cent for small business. That was a penalty which businesses in other countries that competed with us did not have inflicted upon them. And in the last few years we have seen record bankruptcies. There has been a structural change in Australia's business. We have come out of doing most of our business with the UK since it went into Europe. We have seen the rise of many other countries selling similar products in the mining and farming sectors in South America. We have seen more competition from Asia. The challenges that now present to small business are much greater than they were a few years ago when we had comfortable markets and often a protected environment. It seems to me that the previous government really did not understand those issues and often compounded the problem. The new government, the Howard government, now has the opportunity to try to fix some of those issues. As I mentioned, we have already started to do so in the industrial relations area. We introduced in the budget, provided we can get them through the Senate, a number of tax changes, particularly in the capital gains area. The Small Business Task Force to reduce the you go load of government paperwork on small business has reported, and the government is committed to a firm deadline for responding. Interest rates are at a 12-year low. I think we need to do more in terms of the banking sector, because it seems to me that a common tenet with the banks these days is that if you have money you can borrow some, but if you actually need it you do not have much chance at all. We as a government probably need to do more to encourage investment in small business. A lot has been said about industry programs and R&D. I think those are important, but the general business climate is really what it is all about. In some ways I would like to see government-business relationships draw closer. It is interesting that the government and industry work very closely together in many countries in oupregion that have had the most spectacular industry and business growth over recent years. Senior ministers of those governments have given major leads often to the business community. Places like Singapore and Malaysia have made massive steps. One of the things I have found in my electorate is that many of the small businesses that are doing well are those that are not into local domestic markets; they are those that are into exporting. The local market is pretty flat, quite frankly, in many respects. But those who are exporting-whether it be chocolates, machinery or whatever-are doing very well. It seems to me that we need to encourage many more of our small businesses in this country to get into export markets. I am pleased to see that the government is currently spending some $6 million in its New Horizons promotional activity in India-a country which I was fortunate enough to visit on a delegation fairly recently, a country of 900 million people where you need only a small proportion of the market to be fairly affluent to have a huge market potential. Other countries in that part of the world also have tremendous opportunities. Pakistan, where perhaps things are less stable but a country of 130 million-the 10th largest country in the world-is crying out for business links with this country. The government has declared next year, 1997, the Year of South Asia. For a long time we have been trying to get the culture going. The previous government, to its credit, was also going down this track of trying to increase our business with South East Asia. We had here recently, in the last month, a series of ministers from Malaysia and Singapore. From Malaysia we had the Minister for Entrepreneurial Development-a special portfolio specifically set up in Malaysia to encourage small business generation and development in that country . We had, amongst others, the Minister for Trade and Industry from Singapore-again, a country that we have had long links and good trading ties with but a country where we can grow our business. He came here to look at further ways in which we can develop business. It seems to me that in the Asian area there are many other opportunities for more Australian companies to get out there and sell their product. The message that I increasingly got whilst travelling around a number of those countries was that we are viewed as a country with good innovation, good technology, good techniques, good education and good skills, and those countries in Asia could do with all of those. Of course, China is the big one that presents us with many opportunities. We have the opportunity to use the networks of the many migrants in this country and to use their contacts in the countries from which they have come to help us establish some of those businesses. Austrade is there to encourage a lot of that assistance, but it seems to me that what many of our small businesses need to be prepared to do is get out there and look for themselves. I would certainly encourage all of those who work in a number of particular industries to get out there and have a look at the prospects in many of the countries that I have mentioned-for example, in the education field, where a number of our universities are setting up twinning arrangements, in the technology area and in the areas of health, environmental and waste management, mining, food technology and services. There is a whole range of areas where Australian companies can do very well overseas. Whilst small and medium sized businesses in this country have been doing it tough over the last decade, we have now started to create a new climate in this country. But more needs to be done. It seems to me that many small and medium sized companies need to grasp the many opportunities that are out there. We need this cultural change. We need to look further afield. We need to grab the opportunities-not only for the profit of those small companies now but to fix the debt problems in this nation and to make sure that we leave our children the opportunity to provide those services that the previous speaker spoke about and are so eagerly sought. Jim Comerford Memorial Wall Coal Mining Industry Howard Government: Ministers Australia Post: Closure of Offices Road Funding",73
155,Mr FITZGIBBON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Hunter) (5.13 p.m.)In February this year the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, travelled to my own home town, Cessnock, to commission the Jim Comerford Memorial Wall. Jim Comerford is a well-known former miners federation official who entered the coal mines at the tender age of 14. I am happy to report to the House that Jim Comerford is alive and well and is still active in the northern coalfields. The wall was erected in the grounds of the united mineworkers' northern district office. It contains the name of 1,532 mineworkers fatally injured while attempting to win coal from the mines in the northern district. The oldest person to appear on the wall was 76 when he was killed. The youngest was just 11. The sheer number of names on the wall serves as a poignant reminder of the dangers our mineworkers face every day. On 26 May this year, the first annual memorial service was held adjacent to the wall. The mineworkers' special guest on that day was the Hon. Jeff Shaw, the New South Wales Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations in that state. The attorney's presence was an appropriate reminder of the important role ministers for industrial relations in all Australian legislaalso tures play in the area of mine safety. Unfortunately, last week we received another reminder of the dangerous nature of the coal mining industry. At the Gretley COlliery, just outside my electorate, four coalminers tragically lost their lives. At around 5.30 a.m. last Thursday, 19-year-old Damon Murray, 36-year-old John Hunter, 30year-old Mark Kaiser and 48-year-old Eddie Batterham were operating a continuous miner in a development section of the mine when they broke through to abandoned workings which did not appear on the mine's maps. The old workings were holding vast quantities of water which inundated the development section in which the four men were working. Only minutes earlier, four workmates of those who were killed who were also working in that area had just left to take a meal break. The tragedy could easily have been of greater proportions. Those of us who have not worked in an Underground mine, or had a father, a son, a brother or a spouse who worked in an underground mine, could not possibly entirely grasp what the families and friends of those four men are feeling this week, nor can we adequately appreciate the conditions in which underground coalminers work or the dangers they face every day. Often, you hear people comment on the amount of money our coalminers earn. What I say, particularly with respect to underground miners, is that they deserve every cent. The four miners who lost their lives last Thursday will now join their 1,532 comrades on the Jim Comerford Memorial Wall. We all hope they will be the last to have their names added, but the very nature of the industry dictates that they will not be. As legislators, we can playa role in ensuring that our coal mines are as safe as they possibly can be. We are dealing here with a unique industry which has special needs. One of those needs is the need to ensure that safety issues remain at the forefront of any policy debate with respect to the industry. We need to be forever mindful of the role that the trade union movement has played in improving safety standards in the coal mining industry. Let us be forever mindful of the fact that human nature has not changed and that even the most conscientious managers, under pressure from their masters to improve financial results, will take short cuts at the cost of safety in order to meet the demands being placed upon them. I do not make any reflection on the Gredey incident when I make that point. Last Tuesday the federal cabinet agreed to a Productivity Commission inquiry into what it describes as restrictive work practices in the industry. No industry should fear a detailed assessment of its performance. I am sure all the players in the coal mining industry will always welcome scrutiny of their performance. My concern is that the Productivity Commission's real brief is to provide for the government the justification for an all-out attack on the long hard fought conditions which protect the safety of Australian coalminers. In the time remaining to me, I want to highlight for the House two very good examples of the arrogance of ministers in this government. The first one relates to Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Some months ago, I was informed by Australia Post of its intention to move the operations of the Weston Post Office to the local video outlet. As you can imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, I was pretty distressed about that and I made a fairly lengthy statement about it during an adjournment debate in this House. As a result, I made urgent representations to Minister Alston, imploring him to investigate the matter and even intervene to block the transfer. Subsequently, a public meeting was held in Weston on the issue. A large gathering attended, as did senior representatives of Australia Post. At that meeting, I proposed a resolution that called upon Australia Post to halt any further plans to transfer the operations of the post office to the local video store until Senator Alston had had an opportunity to respond to my representations. I made the representations on 14 October this year and I am still awaiting his response. I was pleased that some days after the public meeting, while Australia Post was not prepared to give a commitment on the day of the meeting that they would delay the transfer, I did receive, on 11 November, a letter from them saying they would agree to halt the transfer until I had had that response from the minister. You can understand that I was rather distressed today to receive a phone call from a constituent in Weston to tell me that the signs are now up on the post office building, informing all and sundry that the closure of the post office will take place this Friday and from Monday next week all operations of Australia Post in the town of Weston will be provided from the local video outlet. I immediately had my staff ring Australia Post to ascertain their explanation for their breach of commitment on this issue. I was told that Minister Alston has now advised Australia Post that his response to me is in the system, that indeed I should have it any time now and that they should proceed with the transfer. I say: what absolute arrogance and what a breach of promise and trust on the part of Australia Post. How arrogant is it for the minister, before even responding to my personal correspondence, to communicate his response to Australia Post? I still have not got his response. I have double checked with my office this afternoon. I have received no response whatsoever from Minister Alston on this issue and I say it is an absolute disgrace. The second issue I want to raise relates to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). It is an issue I have raised in this House on a number of occasions-that is, a section of road on the national highway in my electorate known as the Belford Bends. I was delighted in August last year when former Minister Brereton visited that site and announced that the government would spend some $33 million rectifying a very dangerous situation. I was delighted again when the now Minister Sharp also visited the Bends just prior to the election to announce that a coalition government would match that funding. But I was distressed when the budget was announced and there was no funding for the Belford Bends. Since then, delight has come again. On Tuesday of the last sitting week, the minister invited the Mayor of Singleton, Neil MCN amara, and the general manager of the council, at two days notice to give them the good news that he had decided, in the face of all the controversy-and the pressure mounted by me and the community-that he would fund the project. What concerns me is the lack of invitat.ion extended to me to take part in those talks and the attempt of the government to totally exclude me from the announcement in some weak attempt to ensure that I did not get any kudos from the announcement, because they know so well what an active role I have played in gaining those funds. (Time expired) ATSIC-Army Community Assistance Project Land Rights",74
156,Mr DONDAS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I welcome the statement made by Senator the Hon. John Herron last week at the ninth annual Joe and Enid Lyons Lecture at the ANU. That particular statement covered a very wide range of issues. I preface my comments about his statement on the use of the army in agreement with ATSIC by quoting him. He stated: What I am announcing today is a new coordinated project between ATSIC and the Army, that will be trialed on a pilot basis. This new project, the ATSIC/ Army Community Assistance Project, will have benefits for all concerned. The communities will benefit from improved environmental health conditions and from an increased skill base gained through the provision of community training by the Army. Since the statement was made by the honourable senator, some Aboriginal leaders have stated that the state governments have failed in providing essential services and that now it is up to the army to bail them out, to bail the Commonwealth out. I would like to quote from an interview by AM's Suzanne Smith from Wednesday, 13 November, prior to the announcement. Peter Yu, the former director of the Kimberley Land Council of Western Australia, who is a proponent of greater regional autonomy for Aboriginal people, was asked for his reaction to the proposal. He answered: Well, I think it's obviously an indictment, in terms of the knowledge of the current terrible existing situations that people live in, but it also raises very serious questions about the capacity of the governments, particularly the State Government and the Commonwealth's ability to pull them into line in terms of filling their responsibility. After all, I mean, these are normal entitlements that most Australians would expect without question. The minister has since made the statement at the annual Joe and Enid Lyons Lecture on 15 November. I welcome the involvement by the army in the provision of essential services in remote areas. In fact there is a provision for this in the Defence Act. Defence aid to the civil community does have several categories. Categories 4 and 5 provide: ... for non-emergency assistance to State, Territory or Local Government authorities or organisations, - o--ercial enterprises, charity organisations or indiViduals or bodies in the general community, of a nOJ?--specific nature but where only the ADF can proVide such assistance as and when required ... So there are provisions for the army to be able to get in and help communities. It also has a capacity during flood, fire or any other natural disaster. I am reminded of the tremendous role that the army, navy and other services played in the provision of emergency services after Cyclone Tracy in December 1974. In terms of where we are going today in the army, I think we have to look overall at ATSIC's operation. It has often been said to me that there seemed to be a higher level of productivity and outcomes when those funds were coming through the department of Aboriginal affairs. There seems to be some concern today about ATSIC' s operation and the extensive funding that they receive from the Commonwealth government and that quite a bit of their money on an annual basis is being put into investment-buying properties and shopping centres, taking partnerships in car dealerships and the like. There is a general feeling that some of the funds are not getting out into the communities. That is the concern that the communities have. In terms of the army playing a role in providing essential services, I think we must be cautious. I think there needs to be a lot of consultation with and a lot of discussion between community based organisations throughout Australia. I will speak about the some Northern Territory because I am aware of its organisations. We have a community government organisation, we have a local government organisation and we have a territory government, which has in its control those functional areas that provide services to remote areas. I am aware that, unless a consultation process is undertaken, we could be travelling into an area where we could come unstuck. I say that in a very reserved sense because what we perceive to be a priority for a community from the outside may not be the priority that they themselves want. It does take an awfully long time for them to work out amongst themselves what they see as being most important in their community, whether it be water supply, electricity supply, education, road system or recreational facilities. They have their own ideas. That is why I say that I am very cautious in my optimism about how the army is going to provide services to those remote communities. Maningrida, a remote community in the Northern Territory, can at any particular time have a population of up to about 1,500 people. But that population base could fall away at any time to about 300 or 400 people. What basically happens is that there is an outstation movement. People move out from the outstations. There could be 20 outstations for Maningrida. In Maningrida you have all the facilities. You have health facilities, schools and administration all happening, then people move 20 or 30 kilometres away. It is very difficult in some cases to provide all those essential services to the remote communities. Another thing we have to take into consideration is that on many occasions in some of these remote areas when outstations are set up they might be useful for a short time and then, maybe three or four months later, there may be a reason why the area is no longer any good and those people go off to another area. So it is going to be very difficult to have the army moving around to provide essential services to outstation movements. I understand that in some of these outstations the resources are quite extreme. Some of them have four-wheel drives, some have aircraft to fly in and out of their outstation. I wonder why we need to have those particular facilities for outstations. It was a decision of those outstation communities to move out from the main community. It is very hard. We talk about a partnership. There is going to have to be a partnership between the federal government, ATSIC, state, territory and local government, community development and the army in the provision of essential services. The army could find it is chasing its own tail if it does not sit down and work out what its program is going to be in the delivery of those services. The other important factor is land rights. We have been living with land rights in the Northern Territory for some 20 years. In 1980 a review was carried out by Barry Rowlands QC and in 1983 a most comprehensive review was done by Justice Toohey. That report was called Seven years on. I understand that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has asked the minister responsible to have another review of the Northern Territory land rights act because the land that is being controlled by Aboriginals in remote communities in some instances is no use to them. They have the land but they cannot really use it for tourism development or commercial development. It is very important to ensure before the army starts moving around and providing essential services that a review of at least the land rights act should be carried out. Each of the state governments and the territory government have the provision of being able to provide essential services to those communities, provided the Commonwealth is fair dinkum in its approach to providing additional funding resources to those government authorities which can put those essential services into place where they are required by the community. We speak about roads and we speak about water but nobody is speaking about recreational facilities. Maybe those should be made available to some of these communities if the army is able to provide that kind of facility. (Time expired) Suppression Orders",76
157,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I speak on the grievance debate to make some comments in respect of openness and accountability, and the need for the conduct and activities of members of parliament and those in the courts and other public agencies to be the subject of scrutiny by the media, the parliament and the community generally. There are important questions which this topic raises and important matters which go to the public interest in finding the balance of the public interest. I start by referring to a report in the West Australian of Saturday, 16 November of the story arising out of the City of Wanneroo royal commission, which is chaired by the royal commissioner, Mr Roger Davis. That matter relates to the lifting of a suppression order in respect of evidence given by Mr Peter Kyle who was the previous commissioner for the Wanneroo City Council royal commission prior to a Supreme Court decision effectively removing him from that position. In respect of Mr Kyle's evidence-I note that Mr Kyle is now an independent candidate for the state election in Western Australia which is on foot-we have an example of evidence given to the commission by Mr Kyle being suppressed, then subsequently the commission determining to lift that suppression order when it made a judgment that on balance it was in the public interest for that suppression order to be lifted. In the royal commission a couple of days beforehand there was another example of where a suppression order had been made by the royal commission and where an application was made to lift the suppression orderwhich the commission declined to lift. The suppression order which was the subject of consideration on that occasion was, in a sense, a double banger. The royal commissioner made a suppression order in respect of evidence to be given by a Mr Fowler and then suppressed the fact that that suppression order had been made. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I am concerned if there are matters that do involve suppression orders where matters that ought not to be canvassed in the public arena might be adduced from the parliamentary privilege used. It is an issue of some substance and I would not like it being addressed without the chair being conscious of its responsibilities in relation to such matters.",78
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I thank the minister for his point of order. I am listening very carefully to the comments that the member for Perth is making with regard to sub judice rules.,79
159,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On the point of order, I have refreshed my memory on the sub judice rule. The comments that I propose to make go to the legal argument and the importance or otherwise of suppression orders and suppressing suppression orders. I am not proposing to canvass the evidence that was given by the person whose evidence was suppressed. I am making my points on the legal application, the points made by counsel, t-e legal points responded to by the commisSIon and the general nature of that going to the public interest-not the sorts of things we would have to find ourselves proceeding with very cautiously under the sub judice rule as you find in Browning. If I deviate from that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I rely on you to caution me. In the course of legal argument, Mr Groves, counsel acting for an interested party, had the following comments to make which go to this matter: Of course the matter which brings me before you on this occasion of course is in respect of the direction which you gave of Tuesday, 12 November, where you directed that there be no publication of the fact that the closure of the hearing or that it be referred to in any other manner or form and that was in the context of the evidence which Mr Laurie Fowler gave on that day. What I should say at the outset so far as that form of direction is concerned is that it is with respect the ultimate censorship. When you cannot say or publish the fact that you have been censored, then it is the ultimate in censorship and, with respect, it goes against all the principles of open proceedings and it goes against the principles of free speech in a free democratic society. Counsel went on to say: It is as much a matter of principle so far as this form of order is concerned. By and large of course we are willing to accept that there have been and no doubt there will be in the future appropriate and proper occasions when the reporting of evidence or the taking of evidence in camera is appropriate and I would expect that my appearance here ... will not be so frequent. He went on to say: . .. that the media in representing the public interest has standing to make applications to be heard where the interests of the public may be affected ... That is courtesy of a case called Re Broomfield in the Western Australian Supreme Court. He went on to say: ... we are concerned on this occasion with the direction made that there be no publication of the fact of the closure of the hearing or that it be referred to in any manner or form. The application effectively went to, as counsel put it subsequently: The subject of your order was not a restriction on the publication of the evidence. It was in fact a restriction on publishing the fact that evidence from the witness had been taken in camera and that is a completely different matter from that which is the subject of section 19B(1). This is in the context of the suppression order on Mr Kyle having been raised a couple of days later, which I have referred to. Counsel went on to say: That brings me then, sir, to the significance of the fact that the witness gave further evidence in camera and the relevance of that and your order. Why is it relevant that the journalist wishes to include in her report of the proceedings the fact that the witness did give further evidence in camera? You might say, ""Well, there's nothing much in that. Why would she want that anyway?"" Counsel said: We would say, sir, that in reporting the proceedings the best endeavours are always used to try and ensure that the report is fair and that it is balanced, and that it is reflective of the evidence given during the course of proceedings in the day of being reported. Counsel made the following concluding comments: If it closes the proceedings, it should give proper reasons so that the public know and are aware as to why the hearing is being closed, and if it is going to hear evidence in public and restrict any reporting of the fact that evidence has been heard in public then again it should be given proper reasons so that the public which you represent knows, understands and is aware as to the working and the operation of this commission. He further said: Perceptions sometimes are stronger than reality, and I say this in all fairness because no doubt you are mindful of the perceptions which are raised and oftentimes perceptions will be raised and held where there is no factual background or reason for those perceptions to be held. Counsel concluded by saying: ... the fact of the order which was made. That is the principle which we find abhorrent and, as I said at the outset, the ultimate form of censorship. It is the ultimate form of censorship in these circumstances because it also denies the opportunity for any criticism, as I said, being it ill-informed or otherwise, to be directed at the manner in which this commission is proceeding in dealing with its inquiry. The royal commissioner, in rejecting that application, in the course of his reasons said: Mr Groves has raised a number of submissions this morning concerning the order that I made on 12 November that the fact that the closure of the hearing in relation to evidence to be given by Mr Fowler was not to be published. This was said in the course of the commissioner's ruling: It cannot be denied that the vigilance of the press is a factor in the conduct of tribunals such as this, but the proper supervisory role is of course for the courts. There are competing public interests involved. Then the commissioner discussed the public interest. He said: As to the order prohibiting publication of the fact of closure with respect to Mr Fowler, it was put by Mr Groves that the making of such an order means in effect that observers must assume that the commission is part of some form of cover-up to protect other interests. I reject that proposition. The commissioner went on to say: . .. it was necessary that there be no public reference at all to the fact that he had spoken to the commission in private ... I note that it is the first time an order of that nature has been made by this commission. It may very well be the last. Counsel . .. has not persuaded me that those interests should be subordinated to the public's desire to be kept informed in this instance. ... a royal commission is by its nature a flexible, dynamic and inquisitorial body. It must be able to adapt to situations which arise, often ... The point here is one of very grave concern for those people interested in accountability. A suppression order has been made and that suppression order itself is suppressed-I could not have put it better than counsel for the interested party-and the conclusion I came to was that the royal commissioner was wrong when he made his ruling that the arguments were not persuasive. The question of perception is relevant because there is a state election on foot and a suppression order was lifted in respect of Mr Kyle. As I said to the chair, I will not traverse the evidence which was given because that would fly very close to the sub judice rule. I do not want to do that. But it is clear that Mr Fowler, in the course of the evidence he gave, was proposing to refer to statements made by the staff of Richard Court. There may well have been good reasons for doing that, but the commission needs to be very careful about putting itself in that invidious perception position which it was prepared to accept. These are very important issues which go to accountability, to openness, to public scrutiny, to the way in which tribunals which are not courts can legitimately on a range of occasions suppress evidence in the public interest. But I think it is qualitatively different to go the next step and to say, 'A suppression order has been made, but we are now proposing to suppress the fact of this suppression order.' (Time expired)",79
160,Mr TRUSS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On several occasions in this House, I have found it necessary to express concern about proposals to increase the allowable levels of cadmium in Australian food. In the past, these proposals have generally been instigated by food and beverage importers. There was an application a couple of years ago by the Food and Beverage Importers Association to more than double the permitted levels of cadmium in some Australian foods. I am alarmed now to learn that the National Food Authority, an organisation which I would have thought would have primarily had as its objectives to protect the quality of Australian food and to guarantee that what we eat is healthy and safe, has actually instigated its own proposal to double the permitted levels of cadmium in peanuts. There are two proposals. Proposal 144 relates to general increases in permitted cadmium levels and proposal 148 seeks to double the permitted levels of cadmium in peanuts from 0.05 parts per billion to 0.1 parts per billion. I am concerned that such proposals are again being considered in Australia. Cadmium is a naturally occurring metal and cannot be removed from the environment. It can accumulate in the body and, with exces-ive intake, gradually poison the system. It is Important that exposure is restricted to the lowest possible levels. Health authorities believe that long-term exposure to cadmium can cause irreparable kidney damage. There is also concern that high cadmium levels may be a significant factor in the early onset of osteoporosis in post-menopausal Women. Those considered to be at high risk of cadmium poisoning include young children, pregnant women, vegetarians and smokers. It IS extraordinary that the Australian National Food Authority, which is now linked with the food authority in New Zealand as a single organisation, would be prepared to risk the health of Australians by advocating or even considering higher levels of cadmium. The National Health and Medical Research Council said in March 1989 when considering these matters, 'It is clear that any increase in Cadmium cadmium levels in food is unacceptable.' At that time, they declined to support proposals for higher levels of cadmium. Generally speaking, most Australian producers, particularly of products like peanuts, meet the current cadmium standards. Low levels of cadmium in Australian produced foods is of obvious benefit to Australian consumers. Any proposals to increase cadmium levels have always been opposed not just by health authorities but also by the Australian consumer organisations. There are obvious competitive benefits in Australia producing peanuts with low levels of cadmium. Those competitive benefits give us an advantage in trading around the world. Low levels of cadmium can only be sustained with careful management and effective monitoring of production areas. In 1989 there was a case in Western Australia where peanuts imported from the United States by the Peanut Marketing Board were found to contain unacceptable levels of cadmium. Since that time, the Australian industry has taken a number of precautions to ensure that our products meet the current standards. A number of agronomic practices have been recommended to farmers. These include lifting the pH levels, applying zinc-because zinc deficiency can result in high cadmium levels-avoiding growing peanuts in soil with a history of high phosphorus applications and growing varieties of peanuts with low cadmium uptake potential. Those measures have been adopted by growers throughout the peanut growing areas but there are some areas where, because of the potential for cadmium intake, peanuts are no longer recommended for production. The Australian industry has gone to considerable lengths to ensure that it is able to meet this high standard that has been set for cadmium levels for Australia. Instead of being proud of this achievement and endeavouring to build on Australia's success in this regard, it seems the National Food Authority is now proposing that we abandon what has been achieved and relax the permitted levels of concentration of cadmium in food products. This has naturally caused alarm to the Australian industry. I recently received a letter from Mr Mal Goodger, secretary of the peanut subcommittee of the Queensland Graingrowers Association. On behalf of the Australian farmers, he expressed alarm about the rumours of raising cadmium levels for peanuts. He wrote: We do not understand why this change in MRL for Cadmium should be undertaken as Australian producers of peanuts can meet the current Ian Standard of 0.05 ppb. We attempt to produce Clean Green Australian Produce and now find we may be undermined by these inferior imports. It is his last word that is the key to why these proposals come forward regularly. While Australia works very hard and has been able to maintain low levels of cadmium, in some countries that want to export to Australia that has been more difficult. The impetus almost invariably for increased levels of cadmium has come from those who want to export to this country. What the Australian producers are protecting is not some attempt at an artificial trade barrier. It would be somewhat hypocritical for any other countries of the world to point the finger at Australia in that regard. It is ing to note that the two major peanut exporting countries are China, which totally bans the import of peanuts, and the United States, which allows some imports on a quota basis but there is a two-tiered pricing system. US domestic producers receive $863 a tonne for their peanuts, but importers get only $495 a tonne irrespective of quality standards. It would be utterly hypocritical for any other country to point the finger at Australia. Australia has been unable to produce sufficient peanuts over recent years to meet our requirements, so we do need to import some peanuts. The Peanut Co. of Australia, the major peanut organisation, has been the biggest importer of peanuts. Since 1990, it has brought in something like 25,000 tonnes from countries around the world and without a single cadmium problem. This is not a trade barrier. It is about maintaining quality standards. It is about recognising that we should provide Australian consumers with the best possible product. There are a number of countries, such as China, which have considerable difficulties meeting Australia's standards. The most commonly rejected imported food into Australia is peanuts. The country from which peanuts are most commonly rejected is China. The most common reason for the rejections is high levels of cadmium. In some circumstances Chinese peanuts with more than five times the acceptable levels of cadmium in this Austral- country have been rejected. We are not talking now about banning imports; we are talking about bringing in imports from countries that are able to meet the standards that Australian farmers have demonstrated over the years that they are capable of meeting. It is completely illogical for us to double the levels of cadmium permitted in Australian peanuts and other foods just to accommodate the wishes of some importers. There is some suggestion that there is an international standard of 0.1. Even that argument is threadbare. There are different standards in other parts of the world. New Zealand intereststandards are something like 20 times Australia's. It really is inconsistent to suggest that we need to take this kind of action to accommodate producers in other parts of the world. Australian farmers are able to supply consumers with peanuts having very low levels of cadmium contamination. That provides real benefits for the health of Australian consumers, and there is no sensible reason why these benefits should be compromised in any way to accommodate the wishes of a few importers. I call on the National Food Authority to reject any proposals to raise cadmium levels and I call on the authority to maintain the highest possible standards for Australian consumers. Question resolved in the affirmative. AUDITOR-GENERAVS REPORTS",81
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Andrew)I present the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 13 of 1996-97 entitled Performance audit-Tax debt collection, Australian Taxation Office. Motion (by Mr Ruddock)-by leaveagreed to: That: (1) this House authorises the publication of the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 13 of 1996-97; and (2) the report be printed.

162,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, I present the committee's sixth report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Native Title Amendment Bill 1996. Ordered that the report be printed.",83
163,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Section 206 of the Native Title Act requires that this parliament address the act after two years to report on its workings. During the term of the previous government, the Brandy case raised issues which showed that there were concerns about the workings of the act. In fact the previous government had brought into this House amendments to the act, which lapsed with the prorogation of the parliament. This report addresses the Brandy case and issues that this government has seen to be problems associated with the workings of the act. It requires that some of these amendments, if approved by the parliament, might see a smoother working of some of the areas of the act. The committee had considerable input. They travelled through some 14 areas around Australia and heard quite an amount of evidence from witnesses, which really revealed that there were problems associated with the workings of the Native Title Act and that there was a need for some amendment to that act to see that it worked smoothly. I think we need to go back to the findings of the High Court in Mabo No. 2 where the High Court majority confirmed that the Miriam people were entitled to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands. It was at that stage that native title was recognised. The High Court also found that in certain circumstances native title can be extinguished. I believe that last part of the decision is the nub of a lot of the problems that we have with the workings of the act today. While this report on amendments does not address that particular issue, I am sure that the report on the operations of the act, which is due to follow in a few months time, needs Report to address that particular issue. I might spend some small amount of time on it. If you look at the subtitles in the report dealing with extinguishment of native title, the registration of claims, mediation, future acts and representative bodies, at the nub of all of that is the need for a definition of 'native title'. At this stage, the court has not clarified what they see as being the common law rights under native title. The committee heard various conflicting evidence, depending on whether it was coming from legal people or from those who had been advised by lawyers who were representing them. There is no doubt that the legal fraternity have endeavoured to expand this decision as much as possible. That is a worry to me. If it goes on for an extended period of time an amount of money will be expended by Aboriginal people for what might, at the end of the day, be an expectation that will not be achieved. If we take the advice of Mr Justice French, the Chairman of the Native Title Tribunal, in evidence before the committee he said that he believed the High Court decision was that there was a continuing common law right of Aboriginal people on lands where native title had not been extinguished for their right of hunting, gathering and ceremonies. In Western Australia, in Perth, there was evidence from the Aboriginal Legal Service that they believed the rights were much greater than that. In evidence, they said that they believed the Aboriginal rights were exclusive freehold rights which in fact allowed Aboriginal people the right to manage or govern that particular land they had claimed-they had rights of either granting or denying access to that land and they had mineral rights and even air rights. So you can see there was a wide expanse of opinion which came from evidence put before the committee as to what native title really is. problems. I think it really does come down to some of the problems we have. The court has come down with a decision which means that most native title claims now need to be registered. As soon as the claim is registered, there is a statutory requirement that negotiations must commence for that claimant as to their rights on that particular claim. Where we do not have an absolute clear definition of what the native title rights are that particular negotiation is very obscure, to say the least, and gives rise to these ambit claims that are presently in the system. There are not only ambit claims but also claims over the same land. We had evidence from Aboriginal people where they showed that in south-west Queensland, in Western Australia and in other areas there are different groups claiming the same land. In fact in Western Australia a brother and sister are claiming the same land. So we have a problem there as to the definition of how these claims could be sorted out. We talked about whether it should be the representative bodies that first looked closely at the claims to see whether it was in fact a genuine claim. Obviously, some people felt anxious about that because they believe some of the representati ve bodies do not represent them personally. That concern has been addressed in the report. If the claimants believe they are not being represented correctly by those representative bodies, they have a right to appeal to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to have their claims heard. This is a very serious subject and I believe this parliament must take it seriously. Obviously, on behalf of the Aboriginal people, they believe they have a right, and in fact the High Court has come down on that decision. We found in much of the evidence that there already is friction-friction between Aboriginal people and the wider community and friction between Aboriginal people and Aboriginal people. So it needs to be clarified. Everyone can live with a law that they understand. The problem we have at the present time is that we have a law which we do not understand, and that is causing considerable Again, because of definition, we heard evidence in Western Australia-for instance, at Kununurra-that a company that had built a hydro station at the Ord River Dam has had to come to an agreement to traverse Aboriginal land to reticulate the electricity to the Kimberleys and the claims are that $3 million was paid. This particular instance, again, is evidence that, where you do not have a clear definition of what these rights are, you will get these types of claims and you will get people paying out because they do not understand. Because they have a huge investment and must get a return on that investment, they can be held to ransom. I do not believe this is a healthy situation as far as the operations of native title are concerned. Evidence was put before the committee that the operations of native title at the present time are inhibiting development and inhibiting exploration in the mining industry. The suggestion in the amendments that there be a once only negotiation in order to establish native title had considerable support. It also had support from the Aboriginal people where there were multiple claims. There is no doubt that, if you have an exploration licence which subsequently turns into a mining licence, any rights that Aboriginal people might have can be negotiated in one negotiation and not have to be readdressed at a later date. I am sure that is an amendment which will considerably free up the title process whereby these issues can be addressed. As I said, I do not want to take up too much time of the parliament today, but I note that there is a dissenting report. It is disappointing that there had to be a dissenting report. I would note that the Democrat representative on the committee attended only one meeting, and then for 10 minutes. I assume the parliament will get a report from the Democrats, even though they have not heard the evidence that was put before the committee. The dissenting report comes down mostly to the anti-discrimination act. I think in many areas that has been addressed. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made it very clear in the parliament that this government will not do anything that will in any way affect the anti-discrimination act. I believe the amendments, as proposed by the government, will not do that either. I am at a bit of a loss to understand why the Labor Party has come in with a dissenting report on that particular issue. As I said earlier, it is an issue which demands bipartisan support in this parliament. It is an issue of considerable concern to all Australians. I do not dismiss the rights of the Aboriginal people. They certainly have those rights, but it also is an issue that has a large bearing on the mining industry and on people with other rights. We did have evidence before the committee to say that there was an undertaking given by the previous government that leasehold extinguished native title. Of course, we do realise now that the Wik case has been brought since then, so obvious-y that undertaking was not clear, particularly In the minds of the court. We all await the findings of the Wik case because we believe that it could clarify a lot of the uncertainties - ithin the Native Title Act at the present time. For that reason, the report recommends that one of the amendments from the government that greater rights be given to leaseholder- should be dropped and that we await the Wlk case to seek clarification in that way. I commend the report to the parliament. I believe that a lot of work was put into it and that a lot of very good evidence was given. I commend the reading of the Hansard because I think that there is a lot of evidence in there that will reveal a lot of the problems in the working of the act. I think this is a genuine attempt to address the problems that have arisen and to see that the act works smoothly, and I hope that the amendments will be carried eventually by the parliament.",83
164,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Native title is an established aspect of the legal and cultural landscape of Australia. Mabo No.2 was handed down in June 1992 and the Native Title Act 1993 commenced from January 1994. Today the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund tabled its report on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996. By virtue of that bill the Howard government purports to make the act more workable. The committee's majority report essentially agrees with the government's proposals to amend the Native Title Act. Nevertheless, two significant aspects of the committee report can be endorsed: support for the proposed amendreally ments to address the Brandy problem-where a tribunal, such as the National Native Title Tribunal, purports to exercise the power of a court by making determinations; and the deferment of consideration of the government's proposal to permit the renewal of pastoral leases on terms more favourable to lessees, including in perpetuity, to the possible detriment of native title claimants. That said, the overall thrust of the government's proposed amendments to the act and the committee's endorsement of them are contrary to the interests of the indigenous people whose native title rights were proclaimed by the High Court little more than four years ago. For this reason, the nongovernment members of the native title committee dissent from the committee report and have presented their own minority report. The minority report analyses the government's proposed amendments and the committee's approval of them. It does so resting on the conviction that the Native Title Act is a finely balanced statute encompassing the interests of various parties. A compromise was reached and some significant concessions were made by indigenous people. Amendments need to preserve that balance. Even more importantly, the amendments must not depreciate the common law native title rights of indigenous people. Extinguishment of native title, either inadvertently or by stealth, must be resisted. The act will not in fact be more workable if native title holders are forced to resort to the courts in defence of their rights. The most workable arrangement is the process of mediation by which reasonable claims can be settled. In addition to its regard for the original Native Title Act, the minority report respects the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 by giving it primacy over the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996. The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 is effectively our bill of rights by making us all equal. It was a cornerstone of the Mabo decision. Amendments to the Native Title Act, which has as an objective the protection of native title, must not be inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. A number of the government's proposed amendments are vulnerable to such scrutiny. Accordingly, the minority report is founded on two crucial elements. They are: the acceptance and preservation of the common law on native title-extinguishment must not be further effected by statute and where there is doubt about the extinguishment of native title the courts must decide; and, to avoid any doubt, it is imperative that the provisions of the amendment bill make it clear that the intention of the parliament is that the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 shall prevail over all provisions amending the Native Title Act 1993. In view of some words that were spoken at a press conference and that have been tabled in the Senate, I wish to read from the minority report on pages :3 and 4. At 2.2 it says: Coalition Policy states that it will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. The Coalition Government has confinned on many occasions and at the highest level that it will respect the RDA. The first Outline document 'Towards a More Workable Native Title Act' (May 1996) advises (pI): The Government's policy prior to the election was to ensure the NT A's workability but in so doing to respect the provisions of the RDA. On 6 May 1996, in response to a question by Mr D Melham MP, Prime Minister Howard confinned: The Government has no plans to introduce any amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act. On 21 May 1996 in response to a question from Mr BH Wakelin MP concerning amendments to the Native Title Act, Prime Minister Howard said: We also said that we would respect the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act, and we will. This is consistent with the policy of all political parties. To avoid any doubt it is imperative that the provisions of the Amendment Bill make it clear that the intention of the Parliament is that the tenns of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 shall prevail over all provisions amending the Native Title Act 1993. With that we make a recommendation that the following be adopted into the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996: (I) Without limiting the general operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 in relation to the provisions of the Native Title Act 1993, the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 are intended to prevail over provisions of this Act. (2) The provisions of this Act do not authorise conduct that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. It is the opposition's intention that the Racial Discrimination Act prevail over the amendment act. Consistent with these principles, the minority report has recommended against numerous proposals to amend the Native Title Act. In essence, those proposals would: install what would amount to a 15-part registration test for native title applications that would be onerous for the tribunal to administer and draconian in its effect on applicants; deny access to the right to negotiate over development proposals to those whose applications do not pass the unreasonable registration test; and provide for a once only right to negotiate over developments, potentially covering both exploration and mining, and denying native title holders what is one of their rights-to negotiate entry to their country for a range of purposes. The proposals would also allow intervention by the minister at any stage once a future act notice had been issued for three months. This would effectively deny the right to negotiate in such circumstances. Prior to any consideration by an arbitral body, the proposals would permit the minister to allow a development on what could be native title country. They would limit mediation to a narrow scope: it would effectively be limited to matters that would be litigated in a court. They would also limit all negotiations under the right to negotimajority ate to four months: at present six months are allowed before arbitration concerning mining can begin. The proposals would limit to physical, and not include spiritual, the kind of interference that could prevent use of the expedited procedure for developments. Finally, the minister may make decisions to recognise or derecognise native title representative bodies on quite inadequate grounds. The minority report regards these proposals by the government to be self-evidently unacceptable. They are grossly unfair, do not respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act and could result in increased delays to development proposals as indigenous people pursue their common law rights through the courts. In any event, the government has not shown that the act as it is being administered requires anything like these amendments in order for it to be workable. The Native Title Act consists of 127 pages. The government's amendment bill and exposure draft amount to 161 pages. Given the significance of the issues, the complexity of the bill and the length of the associated documentation, further consideration of the proposed amendments is necessary. The opposition endorses the recommendation to request a continuing referral to the native committee until 13 December 1996. .It is important, especially in the current chmate, that all political parties and stakeholders work in a constructive manner in an effort to achieve consensus on the proposed .-endments. Prime Minister Howard promISed that the amendments were 'not some kind of Trojan Horse to gut the Act'. He also expressed the hope that he would draw the support of the opposition and the Australian Democrats for the amendments. There is still some way to go to ensure that this comes to fruition. That is why there needs to be a lot more consultation with all the parties concerned. I am disappointed that some members of the government have chosen to criticise the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chery 1 Kernot, for not attending all the committee meetings. The reality is that commitments precluded her from attending the of the hearings. However, it should be noted for the record that she did send a staff person along to most of the hearings to monitor and report back. We made this minority report available to government members before its tabling today. The normal process is that minority reports only surface during the tabling of a committee report The Labor Party stands here ready to work with the government to achieve workable amendments-workable amendments that do not derogate from indigenous people's rights. I am sure that with some goodwill we can achieve this. There will not be total unanimity in some of these amendmentsthere will be differences of opinion-but that is the way it should be. One thing that we will not walk away from is the commitment to the Racial Discrimination Act in relation to subsequent amendments to the Native Title Act 1993. We do not want to be misrepresented in relation to that. It is in the policy of all political parties. For the government not to accept that amendment, which we say relates only to the amendment bill, I think exposes some doublespeak. Hopefully, we will work our way through the issues. I commend the whole of the report and the title minority report to members of the House as part of the process of working towards a more workable Native Title Act. The act can be improved. In the current climate, it is important that we send a signal to the wider community that we can achieve cross-party support. However, there are some principles we on this side of the House will not walk away from. We will not say one thing and do another in terms of our respect for indigenous people. We will be debating this bill in the week of 2 December. 1 can flag now that the Labor Party will not be moving detailed amendments during the House of Representatives debate. We will leave the detailed amendments to the act until the bill reaches the Senate. The only amendment that we will be moving at this stage in the House of Representatives will be the amendment relating to the Racial Discrimination Act. Corporations and Securities Committee",85

166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Andrew)I thank the member for Watson for his explanation. NA BILL (No.3) 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 31 October, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time.",88
167,Mr LATHAM,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that: (I ) the Government has substantially increased the tax burden on ordinary PA YE taxpayers; (2) the Government's tax and transfer policies substantially disadvantage women who choose to have both a family and paid work; (3) the Bill will substantially reduce industry research and development in Australia, eroding our competitive advantages, economic growth and employment creation; (4) the Bill will damage co-operative companies and especially damage employment, investment and local ownership in regional Australia at a time when the Government has flattened growth and economic activity; (5) the Bill further erodes the universal health safety net provisions associated with Medicare and further leads to the creation of a two tier health system in Australia"". The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996 contains nine diverse provisions. It enables general debate on the government's taxation policies as well as scrutiny of the Report specific measures. One of the disappointments about the government's handling of the bill is that so little time has been allowed for industry and public consultation on its provisions. On the detail of these measures, those with an interest in the whole range of industry organisations, plus members of the general public, have been allowed less than three weeks to consider the detail. The second reading was issued by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) on 31 October. Now, less than three weeks later, the House is expected to deal with this technical, complex set of provisions-nine diverse matters-in parliamentary debate. The opposition flags its disappointment that the government, on these taxation matters, is not allowing for more public scrutiny. The government, when it is hurting regional Australia through changes to the taxation treatment of cooperative companies, is not allowing more time for consultation. The government is running down our reputation and capacity as a clever country through these changes on the taxation treatment of research and development and is not allowing more time for public comment. The Australian Labor Party, the opposition, is supporting three measures we announced when in government: first, the changes to the regime for tax exempt entities; second, the anti-avoidance provisions for infrastructure borrowings; and, third, the improved taxation treatment of equity investments. Further, the opposition will not oppose three new measthereby ures introduced by the government in the legislation. The first of those is the withdrawtoday al of the tax exemption on income for the sale of mining rights; second, anti-avoidance provisions relating to superannuation annuities and pensions; third, the coalition's election commitment on tax rebates for self-funded retirees. The opposition, however, has concerns about three matters, and on two of those we will be seeking to move amendments at the consideration in detail stage. The first involves changes to the taxation treatment of R&D-the termination of the syndication provisions plus the reduction of the 150 per cent concessional deduction to 125 per cent. The second item of concern involves changes to the taxation treatment of marketing cooperatives-something that will have a devastating impact in Queensland as well as other parts of the Commonwealth. The current law, which has been in place for 60 years, allows a 200 per cent deduction for the cost of assets purchased by cooperatives with funds borrowed from a government-that is, normal depreciation is allowed on the asset and, in addition, a tax deduction is allowed to the cooperative for the repayment of the principal amount of the loan. The opposition opposes the repeal of this provision in the context of a dead flat economy and other cuts impacting severely on regional Australia. The third item where we express concern, but not necessarily amendments in the detail stage, is lifting the threshold for the 20 per cent rebate on large out-of-pocket medical expenses from $1,000 to $1,500. It is the opinion of the opposition, and it is expressed in my second reading amendment, that this provision will erode universality and the safety net features of Medicare and will continue the government's undesirable path towards a two-tier health system in Australia. Day by day the government's tax policy is becoming less rational and less fair, particularly with its impact on the ordinary PAYE taxpayer. The reason and fairness of the J:Ioward government's tax policy is unravelhng day by day. Let me just provide some of . the examples dealt with in my second reading amendment. The first of those involved the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in question time and on other occasions talking about the government's belief, saying that it should not be imposing higher taxes on battlers. This defies any credibility or element of truth whatsoever. The PAYE taxpayer in Australia is dragging the extra load under this government's tax policies. I refer the House to Budget Statement No.1, page 482. It provides a graphic illustration of the extra load that the PAYE taxpayer is dragging and carrying in Australia under this government's policies. In 1995-96, gross PAYE income tax collections, as a proportion of all Commonwealth revenue, was 46.4 per cent. For the current financial year, the forecast under Treasurer Costello is an increase of 0.7 per cent to 47.3 per cent. So the extra burden in Commonwealth revenue is being carried by the ordinary PAYE taxpayer. It was again stretching credibility and truth to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time talking about a $1 billion benefit for taxpayers through the so-called family tax initiative. In truth, through the impact of bracket creep and fiscal drag in the first Costello budget, those gains are being wiped out with interest before they even start. If we look at the extra collection on gross PAYE-I refer the House again to Budget Paper No.1, page 428-we find that there is a change on 1995-96-an increase of 8.3 per cent. That is, for every $100 of gross PA YE paid under the Keating government, under the first year of the Howard government the average taxpayer will in fact be paying $108.30-an 8.3 per cent increase in the first year. In that increase and the extra revenue collection of $4.4 billion, perhaps 5.5 per cent could be explained away in terms of an increase in nominal GOP-the growth rate, probably overestimated in the budget, of 3.5 per cent plus CPI at the headline rate of two per cent. There is a nominal GOP increase of 5.5 per cent. Where then is the rest of the 8.3 per cent increase in gross PAYE? Of course, it comes out of bracket creep. It comes out of this government allowing the average PAYE taxpayer around Australia to move into higher brackets. There is the impact of nominal GOP growth, particularly through inflation, plus the impact of ordinary PAYE taxpayers moving into higher brackets. The government, through that measure, that uncorrected aspect of bracket creep and fiscal drag, in 1996-97 will be collecting an additional $1.5 billion. So that is the real burden and the real impact of this government's policy on the average taxpayer-the family tax initiative wiped out before it even starts. In fact, there will be an additional $1.5 billion collected through bracket creep and fiscal drag not corrected by this government.",88
168,Unknown,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8,90
169,Mr LATHAM,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Before the dinner break I was pointing out how, day by day, the government's taxation strategies are being exposed as more irrational and more unfair. Let me just quote from the editorial of the current edition of the journal of the Australian Taxpayers Association: When a marginal tax rate exceeds lOOper cent then something is seriously wrong. In the case of the Medicare surcharge, the effective marginal rate is closer to 50,000 per cent. For families the rate is 100,000 per cent. This occurs because individuals who exceed the threshold of $50,000 by a single dollar will be required to pay an additional cent on the entire amount. The effective tax payable on that one dollar is $500. For families tax payable on that one dollar is an additional $1,000. It is a rare moment in the history of the Commonwealth, one would think, when a government has introduced an effective marginal tax rate of 100,000 per cent on some families in Australia. This is an extraordinary thing, a government claiming its tax policy is family friendly when in fact for some families there is a 100,000 per cent marginal tax rate in relation to the Medicare surcharge. Beyond that, my amendment to the second reading makes mention of the way in which the government are actively disadvantaging women in Australia when they pursue not only a family but also paid employment. The social engineers of the Lyons Forum have a lot to answer for when one assesses the statistics for financial incentives for a woman re-entering the work force in Australia, following the passage of the government's so called tax initiative. These statistics take account of, in this instance, a husband's income of $25,000 per annum, three children in the family and various options for a wife's earnings. They take account of family payment, basic parenting allowance, the family tax initiative parts A and B, child care net costs and the costs of working in calculating the final marginal tax rates. I know the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) will be interested in this because he has been one of the social engineers. For that family unit, with the husband's income of $25,000 and the number of children is three, p.m. if the wife were to rejoin the work force and earn $1,000 the final marginal tax rate would be 76 per cent. If the wife were to earn $4,000 upon rejoining the work force the final marginal tax rate would be 70 per cent. With an earnings level of $26,000 the final marginal tax rate is 66 per cent. That means that for a family type with the husband's income of $25,000, the wife's earnings of $26,000 and with three children in the family-perhaps the typical Australian family in the 1990s; no sign of a white picket fence there, this is more likely-the Howard government has its hands in the pockets of that family in its tax one per take to the tune of 66 per cent as a final the marginal tax rate. That is a shameful outcome of this government's social engineering, which is denying choice and economic opportunity to women in Australia who hope to reenter the work force, who hope, fairly enough, to combine the opportunity of having a family and the opportunity for paid employment. The figures get even worse. When the husband's income starts out at $40,000 and the number of children is three, if the wife were to earn $4,000 the final marginal tax rate is a shameful 80 per cent. If the wife were to attempt to rejoin the work force and earn $18,000, the final marginal tax rate is a shameful 78 per cent. When earning $25,000, the tax rate is almost 87 per cent-almost taking the whole lot. So for women in the family type where the husband might earn $40,000, the wife $25,000 and they have three children, this government is virtually taking the lot. That truly is a shameful indictment of the type of social engineering of those who would deny women the choice which is so reasonable in our society, to combine the opportunities and enjoyment of a family with the opportunities and benefits of a working career. On other aspects of this legislation the opposition believes passionately that this is not the time to cut the R&D arrangements and this is not the time to hurt regional Australia through changing and lessening the taxation treatment of cooperative companies. The opposition believes the economy is so flat and the government has reduced growth to such a low level that any move to cut the R&D taxation concessions or to hurt marketing cooperatives in regional Australia is absolutely an act of folly. It is fair to say, looking at the current economic circumstances of low growth and sluggish opportunities particularly in the retail and housing sectors in Australia, that the only thing the Treasurer has growing at the moment is his lawn; the only thing this Treasurer can truly grow is the lawn we read so much about in his newspaper articles. The provisions in this bill are relative to a of this government's failure to adopt a high growth economic strategy. We know the Treasurer is a drifter. Throughout his time in politics he has kept drifting from position to position, issue to issue, without the anchors of conviction, commitment, passion and new ideas in public life-a true drifter. At the moment he has drifted into the arms of Treasury orthodoxy in a fashion that really has sullied the scope of high growth economic strategies for this financial year and beyond. As he drifts we see again the limits of the Treasury line: a narrow attachment to the twin deficits theory and the - mpetitive advantage paradigm. They failed In the past and they will, as certain as night follows day, fail again. The Treasury line of orthodox economic !heory has no analytical framework by which It can deal with the cultural and spatial dimensions of economic activity. It, through the construction of certain assumptions about 'factor and market conditions, is essentially a - one-dimensional discipline centred on market transactions and resource flows. This reflects the way in which last century economics was deemed to be a science and its impact on society could be judged through a series of mathematical formulae. The cultural habits of a society-particularly elements of thrift, industry and innovation-were deemed to be exogenous to the scientific predicability of economic events. Just as much, the civil and spatial relationships upon which society itself is based were deemed to be disconnected from the workings of a free market. With an assumption that each of the factors of production were fully mobile, space and distance simply did not matter. That is why within the Treasury orthodoxy they give no regard to funding the cost of distance in Australia. They give no regard to the type of taxation arrangements that are needed to benefit cooperative companies-of crucial importance, as you would realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, to rural and regional Australia. Commonsense tells us that both culture and space do matter in the management of an economy, especially in a nation like ours. critique Australia, given its unique geographical location, the limited size and yet wide dispersion of its markets, its complex cultural features, does not easily fit the textbook economic model. In Australia, the cultural and spatial dimensions of economic activity not only matter but are all-important; they are absolutely critical. By sticking to the textbook and the orthodox Treasury line, the government makes mistake after mistake in its economic management. This is the drift and malaise of those unable to develop new ideas and policies suiting uniquely Australian conditions. As we note the flatness in the Australian economy, it is important to reflect on the flaws that this government has brought to economic strategy, to national economic policy making. The first flaw is the lack of a spatial dimension: failing to realise that markets are imperfect in a country as big as ours. There is an active role for the public sector in funding the cost of distance in Australia. That is why the Labor Party argues passionately that now is not the time for reducing the taxation concessions available to cooperative companies. Rural and regional Australia is feeling the impact of budget cutbacks more than any other part of the country. In the regions-I include the fringe of metropolitan areas that I so proudly represent in the south-west of Sydney-for every $1 cut in public spending for the inner city my estimate is that $2 or $3 are impacting on those regional economies throughout the country. Now is not the time to lift the scab on those cuts. Now is not the time to aggravate the wound. Now is not the time to punish cooperati ve companies with such a piddly return to the Commonwealth revenue situation. The second flaw in the government's economic strategy is the lack of a cultural dimension. Australia's poor savings problem is more cultural-that is, it is a private sector phenomenon rather than a public sector one. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, is treating the wrong patient with his budget strategy. These cuts to the public sector, all in the name of national savings, are not producing the results that he would wish. I received earlier today an answer to a question I placed on notice to the Treasurer. There is always the assumption, with his bravado in question time, that economics is so precise that all these things can be calculated out. I asked him about the estimated impact of the budget on national savings. This is what he had to say: The Budget papers do not provide an estimate of the net effect of the announced fiscal consolidation measures on national saving. The net effect on national saving would depend on any consequential changes in private saving, which could not be estimated with any degree of accuracy because of the difficulty of separating out the effects of influences on private saving. This demonstrates conclusively the folly of the twin deficits theory, the assumption that an increase in public savings has no consequential impact on private savings in Australia. I would argue that most of the public savings measures the government has emharked on, including those in this legislation, are nothing more than a transfer from the private savings of Australians to the public savings and colTers of the Commonwealth. There is no precision in this. There is no degree of certainty by which the Treasurer is managing economic strategy in Australia. He needs a cultural dimension, one that recognises that the private sector bears a heavy burden in improved national savings performance. He is, in many respects, treating the wrong patient with his flawed attachment to the twin deficits theory. The third flaw is the lopsided nature of the coalition's micro-reform. They love labour market reform, but where is the product market reform? Where is the service market micro-reform under this government? All we see in that regard are crude attempts at National Party rent seeking and special pleading. With concern to the labour market, the government fails to understand that it is not a market that easily fits the textbook model. It is not like the market for dead fish-an expression of supply and demand with pricing outcomes. It is a market that has dual features in an open economy-a strong spatial dimension and important collective elements of cooperation. The fifth element of the government's flawed economic strategy driving down growth and mismanaging Australia's economic circumstances relates to the twin deficits. I have dealt with that earlier and in previous speeches in the House. The government has also jettisoned wages policy at a time when monetary and fiscal policy are converging. In the hands of national governments, on an international scale, wages policy is very much the main discretionary tool for macro-management. In Australia, the Reserve Bank through the absence other of wages policy and the accord has lost its security blanket by which it can judge forward movements in wage fundamentals. As the Reserve Bank engages in forward looking monetary policy, it has lost the security by which it can judge forward looking wage outcomes. It has lost the security blanket of an accord of effective wages policy. The abandonment of wages policy by this government has placed a new speed limit on growth in Australia, another reason why now is not the time for these draconian cuts to R&D and cooperative companies throughout the Commonwealth. The seventh area of flawed economic strategy is that the government has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the business cycle in Australia. Between 1983 and 1996, Australia was proudly near the top of the OECD growth table. We are now falling off the back of the next upswing in the international business cycle, falling towards the bottom of those OECD growth tables. The government is misjudging the turning point in the cycle. There are mixed messages in the stock and spending cycle in Australia: the patchy nature of sectoral growth, the patchy nature by which the economy is trying to move from sluggish arrangements to the next upswing in the business cycle. To add insult to injury, to rub salt into wound, the government in its budget strategy is knocking half a per cent off GDP. That is the Treasury estimate. Treasury takes such an orthodox view of arguments about the crowding in and the crowding out effect in the economy that it is probably much greater than half a per cent of GDP being lost because of the contractionary economic strategy, of which this bill is part. The government has flattened growth. As I mentioned earlier, the only thing that is growing in Australia is the Treasurer's lawnthe lawn we read so much about in newspaper articles. It is the only thing he can grow. He is not growing the Australian economy. Moreover, on the eighth area of failed economic strategy he has no answers on the crucial question of unemployment. The nation's No. I economic problem and its main priority for policy is to reduce unemployment in Australia. Yet this financial year it is very likely that the unemployment rate will cut through the nine per cent mark and keep on rising. The Treasurer has locked himself into the competitive advantage paradigm, but you still have exclusion. I would argue that you can have all the competition policy and micro reform under the sun, but in an open economy a number of citizens and workers will still be excluded from playing an active role in the economy. A leading paradox of modem capitalism is that it seemingly solves the problems of Production and wealth generation, yet a significant number of citizens remain excluded from the production process. The semipermanent high rates of unemployment in most Western nations are a result of market failure-a mismatch between the mobility of capital on a global scale and relative immobility of labour market skills and participants. Within this framework the government is making two serious mistakes. The first is that, in its national savings strategy, it has engaged in the folly of cutting the stimulus to exogenous growth influences in the economy. There is no easy answer in an open economy. There is no simple tax and spend formula by which you can pump prime the national economy out of an unemployment problem. the You get spill-over effects on the external account. The key to growth is to stimulate those exogenous growth factors: the R&D, the infrastructure and the universities of this nation-the clever country agenda. This really is the wrong time for the government to be running down the capacity for Australian industry, in manufacturing and services, to engage in research and development. If we want to boost economic growth beyond the tax and spend formula we need a boost to those exogenous growth factors. R&D bulks large. R&D is absolutely critical to the attainment of the clever country agenda. The government is engaged in the folly of cutting government services. Hence, that lowers employment in the non-traded sector. It is also engaged in the folly of not preserving effective regional employment initiatives. The member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) would know this more than most: the government is engaged in folly by changing the taxation treatment of cooperatives. If there is one part of Australia that has felt the burden of these budget cuts it is regional Australia. We even had the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp )-regional development in name but not deedabolishing regional development, saying that the Commonwealth has no constitutional or funding responsibility for regional development. He is just a National Party member dressed in Liberal Party clothes. He is a just a National Party member mouthing all the rhetoric and ideas of his Liberal Party colleagues around the cabinet table engaged in the orthodox Treasury line which says that space or distance does not matter in the Australian economy. There is no role for the public sector to fund the cost of distance. It is no surprise then that the National Party has rolled over, has been knocked over, in the stampede to change the taxation treatment on cooperati ves. I noted with great interest, as I know other members did, all those powerful resolutions out of the recent National Party conferenceresolutions echoed by the member for Kennedy-saying that they should have a distinctive role, they should be standing up, almost MCEwen style, putting the argument for funding the cost of distance in our large country. Mr Katter-Hear, hear!",90
170,Mr LATHAM,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am glad that the member for Kennedy recognises that MCEwen would probably be rolling over in his grave if he could see National Party members wearing the clothes and following the ideologies of the Liberal Party. They are rolling over on major issues like the taxation treatment of marketing cooperatives. The Labor Party has a different approach to this, We do not see competition policy and the principle of competitive neutrality as an end in itself. It must be linked to two tests. The first of those is: does it add to international competitiveness? I would argue in this case no. The second test is: is there a likelihood of jobs and services being replaced to compensate for those lost? One would imagine that it is very hard in regional Australia replace the jobs that will be lost by running down the Commonwealth's taxation treatment of cooperatives. There is no replacement effect. The Treasury line argues for the replacement effect, but those on the ground who know the spatial and regional dimensions of economic activity know that there is no easy replacement effect. We on this side of the House believe passionately that by both those tests there is no need to abolish the taxation concessions available to marketing cooperatives in Australia. Why do it when the budgetary returns are so sparse? Why do it when all we are talking about is a $2 million gain in the 1996-97 financial year? The financial gains to the Commonwealth to 1999-2000 will be no greater than $6 million. Why attack jobs, investment and economic opportunities in regional Australia for such a small return on the budget of the Commonwealth? This is the same government that can find $500 million in taxation concessions to fill the already bloated coffers of private health insurance funds in Australia. This is a government that can find $80 miIIion for the big banks and construction companies in tollway infrastructure concessions. This is a government that can find hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix up wardrobes and security at Kirribilli House-all for the convenience of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his family. If it is good enough for the Prime Minister at Kirribilli, why is it not good enough for cooperative companies in North Queensland and other parts of the Commonwealth when the financial gain this financial year would be no more than $2 million? This is a government with its priorities upside down. This is a government with its economic strategies upside down. It argues that things should go up when we all know that the economy is going down. When it argues for more jobs we know that fewer jobs are being provided and created in regional Australia. Now is not the time to sully the agenda of the clever country by reducing the R&D tax concessions. Now is not the time to aggravate the wound in regional Australia by abolishing these taxation arrangements for marketing cooperatives. I foreshadow that the to Labor Party will be moving further amendments in consideration in detail. (Time expired)",94
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded?,94
172,Mr MELHAM,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,94
173,Mr BRADFORD,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"They often say in this place that you are only regarded as being as good as your last speech. I imagine that people listening to the speech of the member for Werri wa (Mr Latham) tonight might be very disappointed indeed. If he is one of the leading lights of the Labor Party front-bench, I wonder what the people of Liverpool in his electorate must have wondered-if indeed they could have understood one word that he said. He was full of big words, sweeping statements and flowery language that would not have meant anything to the average person; in fact, it would have meant hardly anything to anybody in this place if they had been bothered to listen. I could hear J-curve economics coming through the whole time. We have heard some of this rubbish before when you people were on this side of the House. It did not make any sense then, and it does not make sense now. We do not support this ridiculous amendment. I will deal with in detail in a moment. The member for Werriwa accuses this government of benefiting from fiscal drag. That would be just another case of the pot calling the kettle black. Time after time we are going to be able to come into this place and remind them of what happened during the 13 years that they were in government. The underlying cause of fiscal drag is inflation. The member for Werriwa did not mention it, but he might well have mentioned that we are now in a very low inflation environment. In the early years of the previous Labor government, during high inflation, that is when there was fiscal drag. That is when fiscal drag really had an effect and when it did disadvantage people seriously. So there no sense in which we are benefiting to any great extent from fiscal drag. It was, for the former Labor government, an enormous revenue grab. Like all the revenue it grabbed from the Australian people, most of it was wasted on programs and all sorts of policies that did not work and in fact often had the opposite effect to what was intended. They not only wasted the money that they raised that way but borrowed money and wasted it and, in the end, they wasted opportunities to set Australia in the right direction. Now, in this amendment, they accuse the government of substantially increasing the burden on ordinary PA YE taxpayers. The member for Werriwa could not and did not argue for that proposition. He pointed out some ridiculous, distorted, exaggerated examples of effects of marginal tax in extreme circumstances. He does not talk about the way average tax rates have moved. He just did not argue. In fact, the proposition is quite wrong. Since this government was elected we have done exactly the opposite. We have decreased, not increased, the burden on ordinary PAYE taxpayers. The family tax initiative is one example of that. We are having a broad ranging debate here, because the member took considerable licence with the bill we have got before us. It might well have been an appropriation debate that he was speaking on. We have delivered money into the pockets of Australian families at every tum. The latest it example of that was spoken about in question time today. Our responsible budget which, after all, was aimed to redress-or fill in, if you like-the $8 billion black hole that we were left with has led to lower interest rates. Already the immediate benefits of that for Australian families are perfectly obvious. For the average Australian family with the average mortgage there will be perhaps an additional $100 a month-perhaps as much as $25 a week-in after tax income. So the proposition that this government has in some way increased the tax burden on ordinary PAYE taxpayers is plainly ridiculous and wrong. The member for Werriwa argues that the government's tax and transfer policies disadis vantage women. Once again the actual opposite is the case. This government has been, by virtue of the family tax initiative, aiming to reverse the very disadvantage that women had under the previous government. Under the previous government, women were actually conscripted into the work force by virtue of economic necessity. There was no such thing as choice for many Australian families under the previous government. This governme-t' s policies have been aimed to allow that chOice. So we refute the second plank in this amendment that in some way our policies disadvantage women who choose to have both family tax and paid work. We actually facilitate that choice, and that is what our policies aim to do. What choice have families had in the past? The member for Werriwa accuses some of us on this side of being social engineers. We have just come out of 13 years of social engineering extraordinaire. We have never seen social engineering like that which we saw over the past 13 years. If there is anything to be done, it is social unengineeringexactly the opposite-to undo some of the disastrous social policies that were enforced on us by the previous government and some of the bureaucrats that essentially ran the government. The member even has the audacity, in talking about the way this government is spending money, to criticise the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for some minor alterations that he made to his home at KirribiIli, but at least he did not install a heated dog kennel, like the former Prime Minister did over the road at the Lodge here. We are not into heated dog kennels or some of those other extraneous luxuries that we saw. Two can play that game, if the member wants to stoop to criticising expenditure at that particuchanges-as lar level. The fact is that the member for Werriwa accused the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of not growing the Australian economy. What he does by suggesting that the Treasurer should be doing that is exhibit for all of us to see where he·is really coming from as one of the leading economic lights on the opposition front bench. He simply believes that, like the former Treasurer-the world's greatest Treasurer, as he was called at one stage-the current Treasurer should have his hands on those levers every day, that he should have the Governor of the Reserve Bank in his pocket. Of course, this Treasurer has a vastly different approach to the running of the government's finances, and it is not one of hands on intervention and interference. He is not there to grow the economy. We on this side are not in a sort of stimulate or perish mode. To some extent at times there is a case for fiscal stimulus, but the opportunity was destroyed by the previous government which continued to force this country into debt during times of strong economic growth when it ought to have been practising what it is now preaching-that is, doing exactly the opposite. I am disappointed with the speech by the member for Werriwa, firstly, because I do not think most people would be able to understand most of it and, secondly, because the sort of ideology we hear coming across is what we heard for 13 years. It did not work and this government was elected to fix the problems that were created. In the budget we went about doing that. Sure, there is some pain in that budget-we have acknowledged that-but it is pain that is spread evenly, which the Australian people have recognised. In fact, the Australian people elected us to do the job properly, and it is a job for which the Treasurer has received a lot of justified, deserved congratulations as a result of the budget. We have set about getting the government's spending in line. In the particular legislation we are dealing with, there are pluses and minuses, but the underlying effect of these with all of our changes in the budget-is they are fair. The pain is spread as evenly as possible and, by and large, people have accepted that. An example of this is the Lindsay by-election. If there was an opportunity for people to express their dissatisfaction with the direction in which this government was going, they had the ideal opportunity to do so at the Lindsay by-election. They not only did not do it at all but also actually came further in the government's direction. They substantially and overwhelmingly endorsed the government's strategy. So I believe it is still the case that people realise we were elected to do a job and we set about doing it. I wanted to make a few remarks to do with a couple of aspects of this bilI. They are particularly to do with the delivery of what I saw as one of our major election commitments-that is, to recognise the plight of low income, self-funded retirees, or independent retirees as they are often called. They are a group of Australians who were completely ignored by the previous government mainly because, I suspect, the Labor Party saw those people who had saved and managed to provide for their own retirement as somehow privileged, but they were not. Very often at the low income level of independent retirees they were actually worse off than people who were social security beneficiaries on the same level of income. The retirees who are proudly, I believe, regarded as self-funded or partially self-funded are so because they were fortunate in some cases, but in many cases they were prudent enough to have provided for their own retirement. They chose not to be a burden on the public purse and did exactly what all people are now being exhorted to do. In my view, and because I have a lot of these particular people in my electorate, there was never any reason why they should have been discriminated against. After all, they were doing what we are now expecting everybody to attempt to do. In my view, it was never acceptable that they should have been discriminated against in the tax system and in a number of other ways. I am very pleased to stand here in this House tonight and see the government delivering on that particular pre-election commitment. It is a very important commitment, and I am pleased to have been one of the prime advocates for this group of people and the policy this particular bill implements. By virtue of this bill, low income, self-funded retirees at or above pension age will receive equitable tax treatment with the tax treatment of pensioners who receive a tax rebate, which raises their effective tax free threshold. The maximum rebate is $1,157 for a single pensioner and $805 for each member of a couple. The rebate for 1996-97 is a transitional one that will be equivalent to half of the current pensioner rebate. There are many other benefits in this budget for this particular group of people which, as I say, were ignored by the former government. Our health fund initiative of providing assistance for people to pay for their private health insurance will benefit a lot of these people. Many of these people-and, indeed, a lot of pensioners-have struggled to maintain their private health fund contributions. that particular initiative, which is in the process of being implemented, will also benefit people as from 1 July 1997. I need to emphasise that that particular rebate will give couples earning under $70,000 a rebate of up to $250 per annum whether or not the person is liable for income tax. In that context, the member for Werriwa criticised the health funds. We on this side have made statements. The relevant minister has made statements and, indeed, the Prime Minister has made statements expressing concern. He pointed out, as the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) did in the parliament today, how many increases health funds had been routinely approved during the 13 years of the previous Labor government. Attention has been focused on those requests for increases and they are not necessarily being routinely approved; they are only being approved in the context of making sure that the health funds remain viable. Of course, that is important but, nevertheless, it is disappointing that the timing of some of those increases may impact to some extent on our proposal to give people subsidies to assist with their private health insurance. Quite clearly, the bottom line is that the people who continue to maintain their private health insurance will be better off either way. They would have been substantially worse off as the health funds increased premiums, as they no doubt would have if it were not for this particular initiative. So in that sense it is doubly welcome. The measure we are talking about in this bill also builds on assistance to people who pay provisional tax by virtue of the reduction of the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. The government has also delivered to older Australians, including self-funded retirees, its promises to keep Medicare and bulk-billing. I need to say, in deference to my own constituents, that I believe we could go further. And I hope that the government will go further in a number of these ways. I think that what we did in the budget in a very So difficult situation, facing as we did that huge black hole, was deliver on our election promises and set a direction. One clear direction we set was to recognise the plight of people who had provided for their own retirement. I hope that we will go further in the future. There are still inequities in the system for independent retirees. Unless they are partpensioners, for example, they do not receive a health care card. Like pensioners, as older Australians, independent retirees spend a lot on health care. Assuming that a couple will shortly be having to pay $20 to have a prescription filled, you could imagine that older couple that could easily cost up to $1,000 a year. I ought to say in fairness that, ironically, this legislation also raises the existing thresto hold for the medical expenses rebate from $1,000 to $1 ,500-it is actually $1,430 this year-and the medical expenses over the threshold qualify for a rebate of 20c in the dollar. The net effect of that-at least by my rough calculations-is that it will not have a great impact and certainly, by virtue of this measure that is being introduced into legislation tonight and the package of other benefits, there are enormous net gains for independent retirees that have been provided by this government since it was elected in delivering its election promises to that group of people. At the moment, independent retirees are having to cope with lower incomes which result from falling interest rates. I often have people in that group complaining about falling interest rates. Of course, the answer, which they understand because they are intelligent people, is that lower interest rates are of substantial benefit to most people but, while interest rates are falling, those on fixed incomes from their investments are likely to receive lower incomes. The present system of asset and income testing seems to me to still be inadequate. We have spent a lot of time looking at asset and income testing. The previous government fiddled around with it. We have made some further adjustments to it, but it still remains, in my view, fuJI of anomalies and inequities. Deeming was apparently part of the solution, but I think it is becoming, as I thought it would, part of the problem, as deeming rates are shown to be ad hoc and inflexible. There will always be an argument about what the deeming rates ought to be, and that is why that system is ultimately flawed, in my view. It may be simpler-and that is the great argument for it-but in the end it is not necessarily fairer. Tonight I have with me a couple of submissions that I read today, including one from the National Seniors Association. Its submission to the Wallis inquiry showed that there are within the current system serious disincentives for an for older people to change their housing arrangements, for example. Often, people living in an expensive older home cannot afford to maintain it but they are not prepared take the risk of selling up and moving into much more suitable accommodation because of the possible loss of part-pension-and not only loss of part-pension but often, more importantly, the loss of the fringe benefits such as the health care card which go with that part-pension. I ought to also put on the record, while we are on the subject of the treatment of independent retirees, what I think is an important contribution to the debate made by the Institute of Actuaries of Australia. They have recently prepared a paper entitled 'A better retirement strategy for Australia'. I think this document has a lot to commend it. I hope that honourable members on both sides will read it and perhaps it will form the basis for some debate. Everyone would agree that the primary objective for retirement income policy would be that people should be able to look forward to their retirement with a secure and adequate level of income. That expectation has not been met in recent years and is still not being met in many respects. There is still a degree of uncertainty, insecurity and inadequacy. The Institute of Actuaries of Australia paper addresses the basic conflict which is inherent in the present system, which discourages savings because of the effect it has on the entitlement to the pension and associated benefits. I believe that the debate really needs to go on. I am pleased and proud that, in relation to the treatment of retirement incomes, the government has delivered on its election promises in this legislation to that group of people that the former government ignored for so long: self-funded or independent retirees.",94
174,Mr CREAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"If Australia is to reduce its unemployment rate, it must sustain economic growth at over four per cent per annum. The last three years when Labor was in office showed what could be achieved when we had economic growth averaging 4.2 per cent per annum and employment growth averaging three per cent per annum. Through that combination, we saw unemployment fall from 11 per cent to 8.1 per cent-with the five per cent target for the tum of the century achievable. In contrast to that, this government forecasts economic growth at 3V2 per cent and employment growth of only two per cent. And already we are seeing the results: unemployment back up to 8.8 per cent and trend unemployment rising. If we are to sustain economic growth above the four per cent which is necessary to get unemployment down, we need to develop industries which are committed to expanding the nation's net exports. We must get away from relying just on a commodity based export mentality to doing more to those commodities by value adding them-by combining our natural resource and our human resource potential far better. And if we are to make this connection, it requires innovation and support for clever applications. If we want our future generations to be able to get more interesting and better paid jobs, we also have to encourage innovative adaptation and growth in new goods and services produced here in Australia for a world market. To achieve that, we need a partnership between government and industry . We need a more interventionist industry policy-not a dead hand of government sort of intervention but a partnership that is driven by industry, not by Canberra. We need a policy that is based not on raising tariffs and propping up poor performers-that is what the National Party wants-but on supporting industries and firms that embrace best practice and are internationally competitive. It is not picking winners; it is government giving support and backing to those industries and firms committed to the challenge, which are efficient but which, for various reasons, have difficulty competing or getting into overseas markets. One area that government must give priority to is improving our research and development effort. It is in that context that I want to address my remarks in this debate on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3). Expanding our support for research and development must be an integral part of our industry policy. We must link our proven track record in strategic research to further developing our resource base and the emerging high value-added growth industries. There has traditionally been a strong commitment to research and development by the public sector in Australia but a very poor commitment by the private sector. That is why Labor produced a suite of policies to encourage growth in private sector research and development. The first policy was the 150 per cent research and development tax concession, a straight tax deduction, providing an up-front incentive to help overcome the risks involved in getting research off the ground and recognising the long lead time associated with commercialisation. We also had a second string in the bow: syndication for research and development to encourage the clustering of firms by providing the opportunity for projects too big or too risky for anyone company to be undertaken by a group of companies, also recognising that many companies just starting out could not have effective claims on the 150 per cent tax concession in any meaningful sense. The third string in the bow was the government grants scheme. This approach by Labor achieved significant results: a doubling of business investment in research and development in just eight years and the second highest growth rate in research and development by the private sector of all OECD countries. A recent Business Review Weekly article concluded: The policies introduced in the 1980s to kick start private research and development have been highly successful. Even the Industry Commission reached the same conclusion last year when it recommended that the concession be retained at 150 per cent. It stated that the removal of the concession at that rate would reduce the nation's gross domestic product. Those achievements are now being put in jeopardy by this bill which, amongst other things, reduces the research and development tax concession from 150 to 125 per cent and abolishes research and development syndication-both massive broken promises because the coalition did not tell Australian industry that these changes would be introduced in the first budget. In addition, the government is now cutting $2.2 billion from research and development spending and replacing it with a paltry $340 million program of grants, the as yet undefined START scheme. Apart from this massive reduction in support, the problem with this approach is it is putting all of its eggs in the grants basket. It is too limiting; it will be enough on its own to continue to promote the growth of research and development by the private sector that we have experienced. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has shown yet again that he simply will not stand up for industry. His pathetic defence was that it could have been worse: that Treasury wanted to cut the 150 per cent tax concession to 100 per cent and that industry should be thankful for retaining it at 125 per cent. We also have the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) admitting that the cut to 125 per cent from 150 per cent was the price for retaining the diesel fuel rebate and, with that, bolstering Tim Fischer's leadership of the National Party. We have the Treasurer (Mr Costello) saying that the cut from 150 per cent to 125 per cent is like paying a parking fine. He does not even attempt to justify the massive cuts to research and development assistance; he simply makes the claim that those companies using the tax concession are 'rorters'. However, none of the examples put by the government to justify abolishing the syndication scheme has been shown to have rorted it. You cannot stop applications of dubious quality being made, but you can ensure through the guidelines that they do not get up. Yet the government of today opposed in the Senate when it was in opposition last year our tightening up of the guidelines. We also have a government without commitment, driven by Treasury in pursuit of the budget bottom line regardless of the consequences. The consequences of this measure are horrendous. The government ignores the fact that research and development can travel. There is already plenty of evidence that it will travel. In a recent Deloitte' s survey, 51 per cent of companies indicated that they would consider moving their research and development operations to countries like Malaysia and Singapore, which offer a 200 per cent research and development concession. Australia does not adopt these policies in isolation. Like the industry bounties, which the government has also abolished, we introduced them to enable our companies to not compete with other countries that have those measures. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself in today's newspaper has acknowledged in the lead-up to discussions that are being held with the US President that there is no such thing as a level playing field. But his government decision to slash research and development assistance in this way will tilt it even further against us, putting many companies out of the game. The result will be the exporting of innovative Australian research and the job opportunities that go with it. The only thing that we will be exporting is jobs. For example, a joint Price Waterhouse and Australian Industry Research Group survey of 250 companies revealed that more than half the companies expect to reduce their investment in research and development by 20 per cent or more, or will reorganise how their research and development is done, such as by moving it offshore. We are opposing the provisions in this bill which implement these measures-that is, items 1 to 14 and items 71 to 73 of schedule 4. I will be moving amendments in relation to these measures and another matter that I want to come to at the conclusion of my remarks. Other items in schedule 4 have the effect of tightening up on eligibility for the 150 per cent research and development tax concession. These include the changes to R&D related interest expenditure, feedstock, core technology, pilot plant and the definition of eligible research and development activity. We do not oppose these measures; in fact, we tightened up on eligibility for the 150 per cent concession from time to time when we were in government. However, the opposition does reserve its right to oppose individual changes which the Senate committee process shows have particularly negative impacts on business. We oppose short-sighted decisions to cut the research and development tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and we also oppose the scrapping of research and development syndication. We do support measures to overcome so-called rorting where it is shown to exist, but we do not support the abolition of syndication as such-that is equivalent to throwing the baby out with the bath waterand we will vigorously oppose the exporting of ideas and jobs overseas. We also oppose the retrospecti ve impact of the decision to end research and development syndication. The Senate has recently rejected the retrospective approach in its consideration of the so-called gravedigging provisions of the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1996. At least 46 syndicate proposals were in the pipeline when the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism announced that they were ending the syndication scheme. But transitional provisions in this bill will those 46 proposals from proceeding to the stage of final consideration for approval by the Industrial Research and Development Board. That is retrospective, and it is another reason why we will oppose the decision. These provisions also ignore the fact that the research and development board has sat on many project applications, giving no approvals for many months-in other words, there is a question about process in the leadup to what became the decision of the government-with the result that some companies, like Orbital Engine Corporation in Perth, have commenced legal action against the board. They say that they have had enough of the uncertainty. It is not only unfair to the companies involved but also inconsistent with the coalition's previous stance on retrospectivity. They opposed other tightening measures that we proposed in the 1995 budget. For all these reasons, we have supported the reference of this bill to the Senate committee. It will enable those in industry, those whom the Treasurer is fond of calling 'the recipients of business welfare', to come out and demonstrate the impact that these decisions will have, as they have done in force in relation to the scrapping of the bounties. We want to demonstrate the difference between submitting applications for research and development syndicates and having them approved and to prove that they are not rorters, and we will use the process to achieve that. We also want to show that these cuts will result in valuable research and development activity being driven overseas along with export, investment and employment opportunities for Australians. The other thing I want to tum to is the provisions in this bill to change the tax treatment for cooperatives-that is, items 17 and 18 in schedule 1 of the bill which remove the tax deduction cooperatives have long been able to claim for government loans used to purchase assets. We do this because it is yet another kick in the teeth for regional Australia by this government-a government that has the National Party Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fisher) unable to stand up for his conprevent stituency in regional Australia. Presently, capital debt incurred by cooperatives is not taxed if it is borrowed from a government entity. However, this provision removes that tax free status. It therefore taxes every future repayment of debt incurred by cooperatives to purchase assets for the expansion of their business. It is a minimal measure in terms of budget savings achieved-$12 million over three years. But understand the effect of it. We have National Party members frequently coming into this place complaining about the crippling effects of rural debt, yet they have supported this measure which can only worsen that situation. Cooperatives, whose members are overwhelmingly farmers, will now have to pay a new tax on debt and their future viability is threatened by this measure. Yet, without them, there will be no investment in many regional centres. This measure is not just an attack on efforts to encourage value adding in our primary production industries; it will also hit regional Australia hard. Queensland cooperatives such as the Golden Circle Cannery in Brisbane supporting the north coast pineapple growing industry, the Mackay Sugar Mills and dairy cooperatives operating in the Atherton Tablelands, Caboolture, Toowoomba and Ipswich are just some of those that will be hit. Another example is United Milk in Tasmania-the largest cooperative in that state with over $170 million in sales last year, employing almost 400 people. Transitional arrangements in the bill will shield some cooperatives from the removal of the tax deduction and a government amendment will assist some others. But what about those cooperatives that do not qualify under the transitional provisions? Many of them will have made plans for expansion on the basis of the deduction continuing, although not in the formal sense required by the government amendment. The amendment and transitional provisions are just tinkering with what amounts to a bad policy decision, ill-considered, not thought through and taken without consultation. So Labor opposes the provisions in this bill which amount to a massive attack on our national research effort because of the stifling effect the government's approach will have on innovative research in Australia and the commercialisation of that research and because it is yet further evidence of the government's failure to produce and implement an industry policy for Australia's future. We will also oppose the attack on regional Australia, evident in the removal of the tax deduction for cooperatives. We will be looking with interest to see whether the government members representing rural seats, particularly those in the National Party, will support us on this measure. I foreshadow amendments to be moved by Labor in consideration in detail of this bill. These amendments have been circulated to the House. The effect of these amendments is to ensure the deletion of the provisions in the bill on those items which I have indicated we oppose. The opposition is taking positions on other aspects of this legislation. But the two items that I particularly want to focus upon are the cuts to research and development and the impact and restraining influence on the ability of cooperatives to grow. Both are bad decisions for the constituencies concerned, but they are bad decisions for the nation and they are bad decisions because they will only see growth restrained rather than improved. We will not get unemployment down in this country unless we get faster economic growth and that is why we oppose the provision. (Time expired)",99
175,Mr KATTER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The previous speaker, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), said a number of things with which I very strongly agree. I gave a commitment, which I cannot get out of, for tomorrow night before I knew the House would be sitting. However, I formally advise the House that if this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) is voted upon either prior to or after that commitment then I will most certainly vote against it. I do not take that decision lightly. However, it cuts at the very heart of the reason why I passed up opportunities and left the very prominent front-bench position I held in the Quyensland parliament to come to the federal arena. Constantly-daily, weekly and monthly-I could see the Australian economy collapsing. Virtually not a month went by without some devastating blow to the vital underpinning of the Australian economy. Tonight we have heard reference to MCEwenism-a word that is strongly abroad these days. Many newspapers and media outlets in Australia are reflecting upon the figures for the MCEwen era. For those people in this place who decry the MCEwen policies, it is unfortunate that history records things in writing. Going through the performance indicators for the MCEwen era and the last 13 but, arguably, 15 or 16 years, the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party strikes me as more than passing strange, as they presided over the implementation of the greatest economic rationalism-ideologically driven policies-which has continued for over a decade. I will reflect upon how successful the policies of the super-dries-the economic rationalists, the level playing field people in this place-have been compared with the unapologetically interventionist policies of the MCEwenists. I come from Queensland where the BjelkePetersen years saw that state rise to a level of economic dominance that could not have been dreamt of when Bjelke-Petersen was appointed Premier. And he followed the same sorts of policies as John MCEwen, who was a very similar person. For the benefit of all those wonderful idealogues in this place who think they have all the answers, let us look at the record. Before I read out the record to this place, if you go back and pick up my speeches, you will find that at one time. I was an economic rationalist and a super-dry. But I assessed how each of those decisions worked out on the ground and I rapidly came to the conclusion that the Australian nation was embarking upon a disastrous road. Let us look at those figures which changed my mind. I find it very difficult to understand how anyone could see these figures and not have their minds changed in exactly the same way. Let me choose the first and most devastating figure of unemployment. In 1972, the last year of the MCEwen era, the average rate of unemployment for the 12 months prior to that period was 2.2 per cent. In 1991, it was 10.5 per cent and in 1996 it is arguably 8.8 per cent. Referring to the work of John Langmore, the ALP member in this place, Dr Kemp and John Quiggan, who won the Academy of Science prize, all three people quote 17 per cent as the real comparable unemployment figure. So we are comparing the great economic rationalist policies that delivered unemployment levels of 17 per cent with the unemployment level of 2.2 per cent in 1972. The balance of payments in 1972 was a surplus. We now say 'current account deficit' as one word, but in 1972 it was a current account surplus of $403 million. The current account deficit in 1991 was over $12,000 million, and the current account deficit for 1996 was $20,259 million. Let us tum to interest paid on foreign debt. It would be far more startling if I used the actual debt figure, but the figure for interest on foreign debt is what we have to meet out of our taxes and our incomes every year. The interest on foreign debt in 1972-these are non-constant figures-was $202 million. In 1991, it was $14,800 million. In 1996, it was $12,800 million. I tum to bankruptcies. I do not think there is any clearer indicator of the state of the economy than the bankruptcies and unemployment figures. Bankruptcies in 1972 totalled 2,648. In 1991, they totalled 13,091. In 1996, we hit the all-time record for Australia of 17,340 bankruptcies-17 ,340 versus 2,648. Tax revenue in 1972, with this great interventionist policy decried in part by the previous speaker-in part he praised it, I must admit in all fairness to him-needed for these handouts, picking winners and helping and looking after all these people was $8.9 thousand million. In 1991, tax revenue was $97.9 thousand million. In 1996, it was $116,000 million. Interest rates in 1972 were seven per cent. In actual fact, the average for the four years rising from 1972 was only five per cent. In 1991 they were 15.5 per cent, and in 1996 they were 10.5 per cent. The value of the Australian dollar in 1972 was $1.28 and rising. In 1991, it had collapsed to 76c, and it now stands at around 79c. It took 384 Japanese yen to buy an Australian dollar in 1972. Now it takes only 86 Japanese yen. In 1991, it took 95 Japanese yen. I think one of the most relevant figures is the change in real terms-I emphasise 'real terms'-in average weekly earnings over the 10 years to 1972: a rise of 42.9 per cent. The average working man in Australia was fairing tremendously well under the policies of John MCEwen, with a rise of 42.9 per cent. For the 10 years to 1991 it was 2.7 per cent. By 1996 it had fallen to minus 1.2 per cent. If you add to that figure of minus 1.2 per cent the tax bite-remember that taxes have increased 300 per cent over the last 12 years-we are looking at a diminution of some 25 per cent in real income for average weekly wage earners. Let me move on. I think this bill is very much in the mould of the MCEwen era. It is very good to have with us this evening the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) in the mould of his father, who was first lieutenant and then leader and the person who was responsible for carrying on those policies which were so tremendously effective in delivering a rich and great country to us all. I particularly prefer to the greatest earner for the Australian economy, the wool industry. One-tenth of our entire earnings came from that one commodity. Thanks to the efforts of Doug Anthony in this place and the continuation of those policies of interventionism, if you like, we found that the price of wool rose some 400 per cent, arguably 600 per cent, in the two or three years after he introduced the price scheme. In the two or three years after the removal of the price scheme, the removal of interventionism, we saw the price collapse, fall clean in half, around 900c a kilo down to around 380c to 390c a kilo. The previous speaker, the member for Hotham, said the National Party believes in tariffs and putting up protective barriers and not being scared to involve ourselves in the outside economies of the world. John MCEwen spoke only ever in terms of nursery tariffs. They were there for a period to allow new businesses to arise, but today there are two very good reasons for their continued existence. One of them is that every other country in the world enjoys huge tariff protection. In the sugar industry, which I think is the fifth or sixth biggest export earning industry for this nation, we compete in the world market against Europe. The last time. I looked they were the biggest sugar exporters in the world. I think the figures were revised two years ago. At that time they enjoyed a tariff support system from the European Community of 192 per cent. It is extremely hard to compete against a 30 to 40 per cent subsidy or tariff level. To compete against 192 per cent is nigh on impossible. That is the reason why, if you want to play on a level playing field and you want to be fair dinkum, if they have got a 192 per cent subsidy and they are our biggest competitor in the world, you have to provide something equivalent for our producers or they will simply be crushed and crucified by that sort of competition. This is not a figure that I have plucked out of the air. I am quoting from page 1072 of a 1990 report to the President of the United States on tariff and tariff equivalents on a series of primary industry commodity products throughout the world. The banana industry is an excellent example. We are competing against people in Central America who work for $2.60 a day. If you want to have a level playing field, then our workers work for $2.60 a day or we have to close down the banana industry, which is worth $300 million a year to the Australian economy. There is no in-between; either you go down to those slave wage levels or you close down the industry here. I can quote many other examples of what from I am talking about. The way in which these people went about delivering the intervention that was so desperately needed for us to stay alive in the international marketplace was through things like the AIDC, the PIBAmoney for water, the building of dams throughout Australia. I will quote one figure in that regard. In Queensland, we have moved to a user-pays principle-some would argue, imposed upon us by the federal government-which takes us to $30 a megalitre for water. The biggest agricultural state in the world apart from Queensland and New South Wales, I would argue, is the state of California. Water charges in California on the last occasion I looked were $3.90 a megalitre. Clearly, the government there builds the dams and does not charge the dams out to the farmers, which was the way in which we operated in this country until very, very recently. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can say that these people are being subsidised, but if you do not do it you will not have any agriculture taking place in this country. That is exactly what is happening today. This country has lost 40 per cent of its sheep herd, its biggest export earning item throughout our history. It was the biggest export earning item in 1988, when this House removed the reserve price scheme for wool. To those who say that it was going to happen anyway, I say that it is very funny that when the reserve price scheme was introduced the price went up by 400 or 500 per cent; when the reserve price scheme was removed it dropped clean in half. Coincidence! With regard to government contracts, I was very surprised to find out the other day that 24 per cent of the cars traded in Australia are now being traded to governmental or semi governmental bodies. So a simple administrative decision to buy all Australian made motor cars will be of absolutely tremendous benefit to the motor vehicle building industry in Australia. There are many other analogies that I can draw to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker. I refer to Chalmers Johnson's famous book on the Japanese economy. The computer company IBM has never won a major contract in Japan, yet outside Japan not a single Japanese operator has ever won a contract in competition against IBM. So these are all devices that are used. I have seen them used and I have used them myself in the Queensland government. I applaud some of the other outstanding examples, such as Doug Anthony's saving of the wool industry in Australia, which delivered an extra $2,000 million or $3,000 million a year into the Australian economy because of his aggressive marketing approach. The other great example was former Senator Button's rescue and re-creation, if you like, the Australian steel industry-the most inefficient industry that you would probably have found in the world. One worker in the car industry in Australia produced 80 tonnes of steel, one worker in South Korea produced 260 tonnes of steel and one worker in the Kaohsiung plant in Taiwan produced 600 tonnes of steel a year. You could not get anything much more ineffective, competition wise, than that. A very large grant of money was given by the federal government to BHP-some will argue that it was $300 million; some will argue that it was $1,000 million-on condition that they invest $4,000 million. The industry was restructured and, even though it is now in struggling times again, for 12 or 13 years it was internationally competitive. That was a terrific achievement. I tum back to the specific proposal before the House tonight with regard to section 121C. The Mossman mill is in a very difficult position. You have to be big if you want to be a successful and efficiently operating sugar mill. They are going to have to expand because they are in a burgeoning tourism area and the cane areas are closing down and being subdivided. That is similarly the case with a number of other mills. But if they want to expand, as they do, they have a very suitable area in which to expand but it will cost them a lot of money-tens of millions of dollars. That is similarly the case with the South Johnston mill, the Tully mill and the Ravenshoe proposal-and I hope that the Queensland government is intending to build a big dam at Ravenshoe-that will produce 2Y2 million tonnes of cane a year. There is a classic example at Ingham. CSR point blank refuses to expand its milling capacity at Ingham. So, if we want to grow any more sugar cane at Ingham, we simply have to build a farmer owned mill because there is nobody else out there who will build a mill for us. There are farmers who want to expand and produce an extra million tonnes of cane a year. When you add all of that together, that is 5.4 million tonnes of cane which we want to of grow. That will be a great addition to the Australian economy. It seems to me that we have general principles here but we never climb to the coalface to look at reality. If you are a cooperative, it is very difficult to raise money. You cannot float a share fund because legislatively you are not allowed to. You are a cooperative; you are a farmer owned operation. It is very difficult to borrow money from the banks because the banks, for obvious reasons, find it difficult to foreclose on a cooperative. So it is very difficult for them to raise money. That is the reason why the clause was put there in the first place and that is why successive governments since 1930 have left it there. That is why a number of us, particularly in the National Party, feel so very strongly that the clause must be left there. If the clause is removed, those people will not be able to raise finance, and if they cannot raise that finance then that expansion will not take place. If that expansion does not take place, then Australia will lose $270 million a year in extra export earnings. The stupidity of these decisions is happening continually in this place. Existing industries will collapse as well because they will be inefficient. (Time expired)",102
176,Mr MARTYN EVANS,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"This is a research driven government, but unfortunately it is the research which comes from the public opinion poll. It is the research which comes from the focus group. It is the research which gives the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) his famous one-liners in this House. It is not the kind of research which provides for a sound industrial and technological base for this country into the future. It is not the kind of research on which good science is based. It is not the kind of research which will deliver for Australia the innovation and growth in our marketplaces that we so desperately need. While I am happy to report that it is a research driven government, I very much regret that it is the wrong kind of research. It is the kind of research we do not need in this country which will provide for the good science and innovation which we have always had in the past. Australia has a very famous track record throughout the world in its mining industries, its agricultural industries, its manufacturing and its defence science for producing sound innovation and sound research and development work. We have many historical precedents on which we can rely in terms of producing Australia's high standards of innovation and science. But we are always going to need that spark of discovery, that spark of innovation. We are always going to need the initial oneoff discovery that breaks new ground if we are to keep on moving in the high-tech era of the 1990s and the 2 I st century. In the past, breakthroughs were slower. The pace of change was much slower. World trade was minimal. We could base our innovation on individual effort. If you look back in history in Australia you will see that our agricultural innovations-for example, the stump-jump plough-were based on the inspirational spark of an individual who had a clear problem which needed to be solved in the context of their own farm, industry or whatever. They were able to produce that innovation and it spread slowly throughout society. Years, in fact, were allowed for these things to develop. But we do not have that kind of time scale now. Modern society requires a much greater effort on our part, a coordinated and sustained effort in research and development to produce the kind of innovation and pace of change which modern society demands. Research also carries with it substantial costs. It is not always possible for people to make this level of commitment privately and individually in the way in which they could in the past. Industry also has conflicting demands for immediate results and for research driven by commercial goals. That is perfectly understandable in the context of industry. They have shareholders to account to, they have an annual general meeting coming up within a few months and they have the share market jUdging their performance on a daily, even a minute-by-minute, basis. Industry needs to respond to those imperatives of the short-term profit motive. But that may not always be in the long-term national interests of Australia. Government commitment through the taxpayers is necessary, indeed essential, to drive that initial spark of innovation and to ensure that resources are available for the long term for those forward-looking, basic research projects which have no immediate commercial return. That is what we have always used organisations like CSIRO for. That is what our universities have always done in the past. Industry has contributed to that process, but perhaps not on the level that is essential if they are to reap the full returns of this and if Australia is to get the full industrial research and development benefit. There are two good examples of that which are very relevant and which I would like to share with the House. For example, 1996 is the 50th anniversary of the birth of ENIAC, which was the world's first programmable computer, built for very limited strategic purposes during the Second W orId War. It was initially used to calculate naval artillery ranges, the distance the shell would travel from a given gun. Subsequently, it was used for many thousands of calculations in developing atomic weapons during World War II. This particular device had substantially less computing power than my current wristwatch, which I bought for some $30, and which is probably disposable. The computer chip in that wristwatch is substantially more powerful than that first programmable computer developed 50 years ago. ENIAC weighed some 30 tons. I can assure you that my wristwatch does not weigh 30 tons, so you can get some idea of the speed and innovation in the computer industry. Ideas about the future of computing were very limited in those days. The Popular Mechanics magazine of the day speculated that one day we may have computers that weighed even less than 1.5 tons. When confronted with this idea, the CEO of IBM, which was then a business machine corporation which had never heard of computers, foresaw that the world might have a global market of perhaps five computers one day. It just shows how dangerous it is to make predi cti on s. This all came from a modest US government grant for university research. ENIAC came about as a result of a very modest grant from the US government to Penn State University. They had no prospect of future commercial return from this investment and no industry would have supported that level of commitment to the development of a computer back in 1946. The other very important example which is shaping our society even as we speak is the development of the internet. The internet was developed back in 1969, again based on a US government grant to establish a computer network that would be redundant and fail-safe in the event of nuclear war and which would allow the research communities to talk to the military community to ensure that the research effort of the time was sustained even in the face of attack. No-one at the time ever imagined that that network would evolve into the internet that we know today. The very small grant which helped to establish that in the first place and to sustain it through its development at times when it had no commercial return and when it had no relevance to society day by day again came from government. It is that spark of innovation which those government grants fostered at the time in the development of the first programmable computer and the development of the internet and finally in the development the world wide web browser that now makes the internet user friendly in a way that even members of parliament and school students can use them with great effect these days. That all came from initial government grants. The Internet and the whole computing environment change the very way in which we perceive society. Communication on a distributed intelligence basis has to be the new metaphor for our society. As Vice-President Al Gore has recently pointed out, we are no longer faced with a hierarchical top-down imposition of ideas but rather a distributed intelligence network which ensures that everyone can make a contribution through their own individual effort to society as a whole. Even our very democracy is underpinned by this kind of concept but we would not have got there without the commitment of governments and taxpayers in funding research with a very narrow base and with no immediate prospect of any substantial pay back-and certainly with no immediate commercial relevance which industry would have supported at the time. Industry is constrained in the way they do things. They are required to do more with less. They adopt a design-they either produce it themselves or they buy it from outside-they provide incremental improvements to that design in response to customer demands and they continually find ways of making more of that design for less and less cost. That is the way they drive their bottom line and maximise their profit. Industry, of course, is reasonably constrained to act in that way. That is quite reasonable in the context of our current industrial age understanding but the information age into which this country is rapidly moving demands a whole new way of thinking and it provides the tools to do it with. But the concept of distributed intelligence and information age technology is fundamentally underlined by sustained research, development and innovation. That research and development sustains the very innovation itself and ensures that we will constantly be in a position of moving forward and regenerating our ideas base, providing a new way of ensuring wealth and jobs in this country. But it also demands a number of other things if you examine this model of distributed intelligence which ensures that our policies must be radically different from those this government is promulgating in its budget and this bill tonight. We need to support our universities. We need to support access to those universities and the HECS changes in the recent budget send all the wrong messages to students. They send all the wrong messages particularly to science and engineering students whom we desperately need in this country to take on board the kind of research and development and innovation effort we will need in the future. This government's attack on the university sector to the extent of some $800 million in the recent budget will ensure that only the wealthy can gain access to our universities and it will fundamentally undermine the research and development efforts of our universities, which have always been so critical in the past-the research of CSIRO, AIMS and ANSTO, the other public sector organisations which have served this country so well in the past. In fact, one of the greatest frauds of the 1996 budget was the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on budget night that he had provided an extra $115 million to CSIRO. That, indeed, was one of the greatest frauds because the reality over the next four yearswhen you examine the pluses and minuses in the CSIRO's budgets and the commitments to repay funding to this government which the government has forced on the CSIRO-is that that famous organisation will be some $4 million to $10 million worse off at the end of the four-year funding period than it was before the budget. That is some contrast to the $115 million which the Treasurer promised them in additional funding. In fact it is a $4 million to $10 million decrease. What about the Australian Research Council and the NHMRC, which also provided substantial funding over many years to our universities and our independent researchers in this country? The ratio of grants approved in that area is declining. We can expect under this government that it will decline even further. What kind of message are school students in science and technology getting from this government when they see cutbacks in funding to universities and when they see cutbacks in research and development? Any students contemplating science, engineering or technological careers must surely learn something from this government and this budget; and that is that they are not interested in science and technology. We have seen cutbacks in industry training through the gutting of the Working Nation program. Worst of all-and tonight's legislation confronts this directly-we have seen the dramatic reduction in R&D tax concessions from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, and an end to syndication. Studies have clearly shown the direct link between research and development and innovation. It is that kind of direct link which will ensure the dramatic cut in research and development, which this legislation will bring about, and will ensure a significant and equally dramatic reduction in innovation and subsequent job creation in this country. We had a very poor record of business sector investment in R&D prior to the innovative changes which the former Labor government introduced in the 1980s but, during the 1980s, following the introduction of those incentives to stimulate research and development in business we saw significant changes and improvements in business commitment to research and development. Those studies that have been conducted by the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and others all show that those taxation incentives and syndication were very good at improving business research and development. Innovation is directly linked to that research and development. We have seen the benefit of that in the rapid growth of elaborately transformed manufactures over the last decade. That has been our best growing sector, something of the order of 18 per cent per year. That, of course, has driven job growth, exports and wealth creation in this country in a way nothing else could. Conversely, the cutting of those incentives and tax concessions will have an equally dramatic reverse effect on all the good that has gone before. When confronted by the benefits of this cycle of research, investment, innovation, job creation, wealth creation, allowing more funds to be invested back in research, development and innovation-what does this government do? It attacks the very basis of that cycle and undermines the very basis of the sustained innovation we have had and, therefore, cuts all the potential for job creation in this country, going against the very tests which this government has set itself for new policy: that it must create jobs; it must create exports. The test enunciated by the Prime Minister is destroyed by the very policy we are expected to vote on in this legislation. Recent surveys by accounting firms Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Price Waterhouse and the bureau have shown only too clearly that industry in this country will withdraw investment from R&D. In some cases, they will simply withdraw the investment; in other cases, they will take that investment offshore because, contrary to the expectations of the Treasurer and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), countries like Malaysia and Singapore offer very substantial research and development tax concessions, and companies are gradually becoming aware of that. The surveys show that, as they do so, they will take their investments offshore and Australia will lose out on that kind of investment which is so essential to our future economic growth. Many companies are not yet even aware of those overseas concessions. The surveys reveal that, as they become aware of them, they will shift that investment offshore and we will be denied access to that cycle of investment, innovation, research and development, and job growth. The research and development concessions which are in place up until this legislation comes into effect also have the effect of speeding up research and development in companies, allowing them to get to market faster. One of the most critical things you can do to assist a company in the modern technological era in which we live is to provide them with a mechanism for getting their product to market faster. Product life cycles these days are dramatically foreshortened. There is no question that, if you can get your product to market earlier, you will have much greater success, much greater return. One of the best ways of doing that is to enhance your R&D effort. What have this government done'? They have undermined the research and development effort of companies, thereby increasing the time it will take them to get their product to market and thereby undercutting the very basis of the investment, job growth and export led recovery of the 1980s and 1990s. They have also attacked the export facilitation processes through the abolition of the DIFF scheme and by their capping of EMDG. All of those things go a long way towards further undermining the ability of companies to export. One of the other sectors of this industry which is important to touch on prior to concluding is the information technology industry. This industry is vitally important to the information age. It is the very fundamentalon which the information age is based. It is part of the new infrastructure which Australian society and industry will need to compete in the 21 st century. This government is undermining the information technology industry in a number of very important ways. It firstly promised as a pre-election commitment, as if this was something to be proud of, that it would cut $1 billion out of government expenditure on IT. That severely threatens the domestic infrastructure base of the IT industry. In the recent budget, the government imposed a freeze on IT expenditure until a cabinet decision early in the new year which will set a new standard for government information technology but which, I suspect, will tum a lot of that over to overseas multinational companies, again freezing out the domestic industry. The end of the computer bounty, which is also in legislation before this House, will have a significant impact on our domestic information technology base. The reduction in research and development concessions, which is before the House, will also undermine the information technology industry. Clearly, this government have specially targeted the IT industry, the very basis of the information age, the very basis of moving into the 21 st century, and the basis for investment in job growth and in innovation, research and development. They are undermining that industry in so many ways that it is surprising that people are not moving out of it in droves. Unfortunately, their multi-pronged attack on that industry will have the effect of destroying our domestic base just when we are importing more and still exporting more at the moment-at least until this government has its way-but the deficit between what we import and export on IT and telecommunications is growing at a frightening rate. Unfortunately, Australia has a substantial deficit in the information technology and telecommunications areas. I am afraid that all of the steps which this government are taking will contribute towards widening that deficit, when the government should be working towards improving the domestic base and when they should be working towards strengthening information technology industries, not only as a basis for an important domestic and export industry in itself but as the very basis on which society, industry and education will move into the 21st century. They are undermining that vital infrastructure day after day. This bill is disastrous for our industry. disastrous for our science. It is disastrous for Australia's future. It fails the government's own policy tests on job creation and innovation. The $2 billion cut which we see in R&D as a result of this bill is to be replaced by only a very modest scheme which will have nothing like the impact. It is Canberra attempting to pick winners instead of allowing the community to pick winners. It is depriving Australia of a vital infrastructure of research and development and of innovation and job creation on which we will depend in the 21 st century, but which this government shows no signs of understanding.",106
177,Mr TUCKEY,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (9.42 p.m.)This omnibus legislation seeks to further amend the income tax act to make it fairer to sectors of the Australian community, such as the self-funded retiree, but generally seeks to close off tax concessions which the government believes are now either overgenerous or being abused. As usual, such measures create areas of inequity and unfairness for people who have used these tax concessions appropriately and in Australia's national interest. In this regard, I wish to mention the changes to the research and development measures and the removal of the tax exemption for the bona fide prospector. In the case of prospectors, I welcome the government's more recent decision to extend the start-up date for the removal of the tax concession available to prospectors until 30 November or 1 December. However, my preferred position, which I argued in party forums, was that this measure should have been applied on the same principles as the capital gains tax when it was introduced, which exempted properties acquired prior to the introduction date, or certainly some pro rata arrangement that took account of the period of ownership. That situation is the best that could be achieved. If people are making substantial amounts of money in this day and age, there are probably grounds, considering the prosperity that has applied in the mining sector in more recent times, for taxation to be paid. Overall, I regret that tax agents chose to use It is the R&D measures for tax minimisation instead of its stated purpose as a research and development incentive, because that is a very essential need for a country like Australia with its highly educated work force. It is in the technology area where Australia must focus a large percentage of its effort. As the previous speakers have pointed out, we find it difficult to compete with very low wage nations in terms of basic manufacturing activities. Nevertheless, even those activities are becoming subject to extremely high technology and Australia is well positioned, with its highly educated work force, to deal in these areas. Tax minimisation has too frequently become the reason people get involved in certain areas. The government sets out to give incentives to other sectors that are in genuine need. The reality is that this bill now adds a further 68 pages to our income tax law. The income tax law has probably quadrupled in recent years as the tax department has tried to keep up with the various schemes that have developed when certain sectors have been given encouragement through the tax system. The government sets out to assist by giving concessions, be they research and development concessions or others, and within days the industry says, 'We can do a deal for you on this.' The pity is that people are prepared to participate in schemes like that. Why are people in Australia so determined to minimise their taxation, particularly their income taxation. The answer is that the incidence of income tax in Australia is far too high. The incentive to cheat is therefore of equal measure. This is a problem for our nation. Businesses that should employ cost accountants in fact employ tax accountants. Businesses that should invest in research and development to grow their businesses in fact invest in research and development because it is a tax dodge. Businesses invest in the movie industry not because Australia produces some of the great technicians of the movie industry but because it is a tax dodge. People have to have a tax dodge before they are prepared to invest. This is a problem for our nation. It comes down to one simple issue-that is, Australia's tax system is a mess and Australia as a nation resides in a tax time warp. I will quickly review the Australian tax system as we know it. I want to look at the disincentives that our tax system, as it exists today, produces for the Australian national interest. I will start with an article that appeared in the Financial Review on Monday, 23 September. It outlines that markets are losing business to Asia. It was only two or three years ago that the previous government, and it certainly had my support for this, announced that it had the intention of making Australia the financial centre for Asia. There were good reasons for trying to do that-a highly educated work force, people who knew how to run the computer systems, relatively cheap real estate and relatively cheap salaries and wages in the high technology area. They are the reasons people should invest in Australia. The article states: The slide documented in a report commissioned by the Australian Financial Markets Association has seen the combined annual turnover of the over the counter market, the Sydney Futures Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange fall by $1 trillion in 1995-96. It goes on to tell us why. It is the Australian tax system that is the problem. We said to the Asian region, 'Come and set up your financial service operation in our secure environment.' Then we told them that we are going to tax them on everything they do. We do not have one tax on financial services, we have three or four. We have the bank account debit tax, which is best described as the BAD tax. That was a Liberal invention. It did not take us long after that for the states to establish the FID, financial institutions duty. They have relied heavily for years on stamp duty on share transactions. It was only when the Stock Exchange did a deal with Queensland recently that they collectively managed to get some reduction in that impost. We say to the world, 'Conduct your financial services in Australia, but we will tax you if you do.' They tum around and say no. Where have they gone? They have gone to Hong Kong and Singapore where those taxes do not apply. It is pretty silly to tax people into leaving. It is pretty silly to rely so heavilyon income tax that we now have a situation where people spend more time trying to cheat the system than developing their businesses. Then we have the fuel tax. Fancy taxing transport in a nation as big as Australia. Do not think we stop at that. We have another tax. We have sales tax which applies to trucks, tyres, batteries and everything else that has to be replaced on a vehicle. I worked out once that a transport operator pays $2,000 a week in indirect taxation for a standard semitrailer rig. We pass that on to the customers and too frequently the customers are private enterprise. Then we have such things as payroll tax. We tax people for employing people, which seems dopey. As I have mentioned, we have stamp duty and all these other taxes on business. There is the company tax itself. We get terribly carried away with the problem that some big company seems not to be paying enough tax. I have always perceived a company as a piece of paper. I think it is much better that the shareholders pay the tax, but in fact we give them franked dividend rebates. We also tax land. All of this adds up to an intrusion into the efficiency of, for instance, our primary industry sector, where we see those types of taxes intruding as a cost to production of about 4 per cent net. That is more money than most people would dream of making as a profit on their turnover. So the taxation that we apply to the primary industry sector or the agricultural sector is in fact more than they would be quite happy to make as a profit. Those opposite have said plenty about motor cars and their manufacture in Australia. There is no doubt that today we manufacture a good quality vehicle, and it is probable that our work force is approaching the international best standard of efficiency. But we have no chance of competing on our own soil or, more particularly, overseas. Why? Because we impose a tax burden of $800 on the manufactured cost of every Holden Commodore or Ford Falcon. What a silly thing to do. We are one of the few countries that still operate in that fashion. Taxing our productive sector is silly; there are, of course, alternatives. One of those alternatives is to follow the lead of just about all other OECD countriesI think I can say all OECD countries-that have a form of indirect taxation, originally known as a VAT, that does not impose that intrusive tax burden. It taxes consumption. It does not tax productivity. It rebates through so that we do not get these sorts of taxes building up on the cost of competing with the rest of the world. I thought to myself when it was first raised, when we had the Fightback proposals, that this was a measure that would help Australia, although I doubted sincerely that politically an opposition could succeed, and I told my party room accordingly. However, I have watched things develop. I have watched Australia's competitive position get worse, and I have stood up now in party forums and said that the Australian tax system has got to be reformed. You can do it however you like, but you cannot do it just in this place. It has got to be done around Australia. Many of those taxes that are impacting on industry are not federal taxes, they are state taxes, such as payroll tax. The states are hooked on it. It is such a large percentage of their revenue there is no way they can cut it back. But it is a very bad tax and today, of course, they are the owners of most of the financial institutions duties taxes, which I think Premier Kennett recently pointed out raises about $1.7 billion a year-and they cannot do without that either. They are the heroin of the states' organisations. They have no wider revenue base. The only people who can fix it, nevertheless, who can consider the entirety of the Australian tax system, are the people in this parliament. And this parliament is doing nothing about it. There is a good reason for that. We find it in all of the papers today, with the Leader of the Opposition playing stupid politics with the national interest, putting the kybosh on anybody even trying to achieve decent tax reform. They cry crocodile tears about jobs, but they do not want a tax system that makes it possible for people to compete within Australia and create those jobs. The rest of the world has got it, but Australia cannot have it. I have got to say that it will never happen unless both sides of politics stand up, recognise the fundamental problem and set out to do something about it in the national interest. We can have a bipartisan argument on race and a conscience vote on euthanasia. But at this point in time we have the intransigence of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley-he is quoted here today-because there is a state election in Western Australia and he wants to score a silly political point and accuse Premier Court of having a secret agenda to bring in a GST; and we know that, constitutionally, he cannot do that anyway. He sees gaining this tiny political point as being more important than standing up in this parliament and saying to the government, 'The Australian tax system is a mess.' It is very negative to business development and the competitive position we need to compete with these other countries. We have got to take that $800 off the cost of an Australian manufactured motor car. We have got to reduce the cost to our primary industry sector. We probably have to reduce the cost to our mining sector as things go by. Many Third WorId countries are now opening up. The Minister for Minerals and Energy from Mauritania visited my office the other day. They are hawking their country to Australian mining technology. They came all the way over to say, 'Come join us, we'll look after you. We have not got any of these silly taxes that you put on yourself. Why waste your time in Australia?' Of course, the evidence is that a lot of those mining companies are moving out, and they are taking those opportunities. So life is going to get tougher, not easier. I heard the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) speak tonight. He and I get along all right in the corridors, but he is living in yesterday'S world when he makes all those propositions about how we can turn the clock back. Let me warn the Labor Party: if they think that interventionism is what their blue collar workers want, they are barking up the wrong tree. The blue collar workers frequently do not know what that word means. What they want from you is a few other old-fashioned values that you walked away from as you chased that so-called middle class vote. The most outrageous part of this comment is that suddenly the Leader of the Opposition says he is only opposing changes to the tax system because: . . . we do regard ithe means a GSTas a mechanism for hitting middle Australia. We will continue to oppose it. The last time. I heard them, he and Bill Kelty were saying it was a mechanism to hit the poor in Australia, but now apparently it is a worry for the middle class. The reality is that, unless we are to have a broad based tax on consumption, which then has an effect on how many imported goods Australians might buy because in fact we would be imposing a tax there, unless we are prepared to reduce income tax to the point where it does not pay to cheat, we then will not be bringing 68 pages of tax amendments to this parliament almost fortnightly. It has become so complex nobody understands it and it has become ridiculous. The solutions are there. I understand why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) do not want to be involved in this issue. They are not going to be the political chopping block for this man Beazley, who in opposition has not got the sense, has not got the commitment to the national interest to stand up and say, 'Taxation in the fundamentals should be off the political agenda.' Taxation should be addressed in the national interest and the national interest demands substantial reform. It demands reform at the local government level, it demands reform at the state level and it demands reform at the federal level. All those reforms are plain to see. It is quite practical for Australia to basically have two or three major sources of taxation, throw all the others out and put it in a way where people can see it. We have heard for years that the three main requirements of taxation are simplicity, certainty and equityand I always add the fourth, visibility. I do not think we should have the sorts of hidden taxes we have like sales tax and fuel tax where people do not know how much tax they are paying. The greatest discipline you can put on politicians is to ask them to write down how much tax is paid. That is why people hate income tax. That is why we have to pass all these laws to stop them abusing the process. It is too high, it is too much and they know it because that is the tax they do see . I do implore the opposition and the shadow minister, the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), who is sitting at the table, to go back to their caucus room and say, 'What about doing something in the national interest?' You have gone feral since you have been in opposition. You are now irrelevant consequently. Give yourself a chance. Stand up and start talking some common sense about tax reform so the people recognise you have something to contribute in that political debate. I am sure that if we had a sensible position from the opposition(Time expired)",110
178,Mr ROCHER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is extremely unsatisfactory that the government has chosen to incorporate nine separate and unrelated amendments in a single bill. Along with other members, I am reduced to the choice of either superficially addressing nine categories of tax amendments or discussing a lesser number in detail to the exclusion of others. I do not believe that either option is satisfactory. Nevertheless, because they are the circumstances under which we legislateit might laughingly be called that-in this chamber, I have opted to discuss just a couple of the amendments in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) and maybe take the opportunity in the detail stage to go into two or three other areas. Of those I want to talk about in this second reading debate is the amendment to encourage equity investments in small business. At the outset, I want to express my wholehearted support and the view that it is extremely welcome. For too long the needs of Australian small businesses have been ignored. That has been despite the fact that small and medium sized enterprises-SMEs for short-have been recognised as the potent force behind employment growth in Australia. In fact, the July 1996 Productivity Commission's publication entitled Industry brief found that small businesses now employ just under 50 per cent of all Australian workers. Small business has regularly articulated the difficulty it has in obtaining long-term debt finance and equity capital. However, the former government-the Labor regimedemonstrated a total lack of understanding of what small to medium sized business needed and wanted. Worse still, the previous government compounded the cashflow problems experienced by small business with the introduction of new taxes, including the allpermeating fringe benefits tax, along with the earlier collection of existing taxes. The fringe benefits tax has played its part in the erosion of the working capital base of SMEs since its introduction in 1986. It is little wonder that small business ranked the FBT regime as the factor which most affected finance in the May 1996 report entitled Open for business. I would sincerely hope that the current government, having had 13 years in opposition, during which time it has had ample opportunity to determine its attitude towards small business, proves to be more responsive to that sector. I have yet to be convinced that it is, and certainly it has not reacted or acted with undue haste to the problems of the sector. A report commissioned by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1993 found that small business is particularly vulnerable to inadequate funding at start-up when it experiences a strong expansion phase. That report confirmed that the ability of small business to export and grow is restricted by a lack of sufficient debt and equity finance within our financial system in to to. I emphasise this point: if the provisions in this bill encourage lending institutions to make long-term investments in small businesses, it will signal a small step forward in the business sector in general and the smaller end of the market in particular. I say 'if' because a similar attempt by the former Labor government proved to be an unqualified failure. I am referring to the then feted pooled development fund scheme introduced by them in 1992. I made it clear to the House in at least one speech a couple of years later that the operation of the fund was then an abject failure. It failed because it did not provide increased amounts of capital for SMEs. The incentives offered to investors did not compensate for the additional risk and lack of liquidity associated with investments in the small business sector. In May of 1996, the Institute of Chartered Accountants suggested that 'much could be done to promote venture and development capital through pooled development fund investment'. It proceeded to recommend that a tax deduction be allowed for investments in PDFs. However, given the government's recent decision to reduce the tax benefit for research and development projects, it is extremely unlikely that the institute's proposal was given much consideration-and of course the proposal is not reflected in this legislation. I simply want to reiterate this evening that SMEs' access to equity is important but the general or broad policy environment in which small business operates is the most important factor affecting the performance of small businesses. This amendment and the increase in the fringe benefits tax minor benefits exemption and the reduction in the provisional uplift factor are steps in the right direction, but they go nowhere near as far as is needed to go, despite what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and others might suggest at question time and on other occasions. I want to restate my position that the two reforms which I just mentioned do not go anywhere near far enough in reducing unnecessary government burdens on small business and basic inequities in those two areas remain. It appears that the current proposal is likely to be more attractive to investors than the pooled development fund scheme. However, one of the criticisms levelled against the PDF program was that it was not promoted widely enough amongst investors. The coalition would do well to take note of that criticism. The amendments will allow equity investments in small and medium-sized enterprises to be taxed under the capital gains tax provision rather than by way of income tax. The effect of this amendment will be to bring the tax treatment of equity investment by banks and other financial intermediaries into line with those individual taxpayers who choose to make equity investments. At present, banks and the like either pay tax on the profit realised from the income of the sale of the equity investment or qualify for a deduction if a loss is incurred. In short, these investors cannot claim a deduction for expenditure at the time of making the investment. That happens to be in contrast with individual taxpayers who are now taxed under the capital gains tax provisions where only real capital gains are taxed on the realisation of income. The government seems to be anticipating that these lending institutions will be encouraged to invest in SMEs as a result of benefiting from the capital gains treatment-and I am inclined to agree with that, at least on the face of it. The Institute of Chartered Accountants goes further than this, suggesting that banks, which are the major source of external finance and debt for small businesses, should be encouraged to lend against cash flows rather than only against the asset bases of SMEs. In its report entitled The road to recovery for small business, the Institute of Chartered Accountants recommended that, in order to facilitate increased bank lending on the basis of future cash flows, improved consultation between the government, lending institutions and small businesses was essential. I have to say that at the moment there is no sign that that interaction is taking place. I would hope though that meaningful tripartite consultation between the government, the small business sector and potential and actual investors is a feature of the coalition's three-year plan for small business. Much fanfare was made about this three-year plan in the lead-up to the election, but I note with more than passing interest that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer  at all, about it in recent months and since the election. The government should recognise that the proprietors' capital and money earned by their businesses are the best and cheapest source of revenue. The Institute of Chartered Accountants suggested that all initiatives taken to support the financing of small businesses should adopt this as an overriding principle. And it is something that I subscribe to also. The small business sector could be excused for its 'Let's wait and see' attitude towards the proposed equity investment scheme. The large increase in support for the coalition following its return to the government benches soon gave way to feelings of discomfort and disillusionment. The message that business is sending and that continues to prevail is that endless committees and task forces are no substitute for action and real reform. The government has taken steps to implement only minor changes to encourage the small business sector. At the same time, the government has made it very clear that its principal motivation for axing the research and development syndication tax relief scheme and for reducing the general concession to 125 per cent is to stop what it claims is perceived to be a rorting of this scheme. Having spoken on 18 September about the government's announced intentions towards tax incentive programs intended to encourage research and development projects by Australian businesses, it gives me no satisfaction to have to note that nothing the government has said and done since then has mollified my concerns and nor will this proposed legislation. While the government persists in maintaining otherwise, the only valid reason for pruning or axing the R&D tax incentive programs is to improve its revenue in the short term; that is, in the life of this parliasituation; ment. Being short term, it is also short sighted. The government has become obsessed it seems-at least outwardly-with the notion of abuse. Yet, as I indicated in my earlier speech, the coalition has not been able to substantiate its claims. The government has, in my opinion, shamelessly harped on this notion of tax avoidance by big business to gain support from the average Australian taxpayer in its decision to axe R&D syndication and related legislation. That public perception was, quite rightly, the level of community anger towards individuals who benefited by ignoring their tax obligations. But we are not talking about the Christopher Skases of business in this context; we are talking about reputable Australian industry engaging in legitimate research and development. We are talking about the savaging of an incentive that was the only effective program likely to induce research and development in our country. The 1994 Bureau of Industry Economics report identified that syndication helped embed a commercial focus in R&D programs and that it was responsible for inducing significant new research and development activity in the companies that took advantage of it. This report found that between 1989 and 1983 syndication was responsible for 23.8 per cent of induced research and development. Yet the government has decided to ignore those findings and persist with what I regard as myopic amendments. Despite the government's claim that the tax concession remains generous, there is a very real danger that Australia will lose much of its research and development activity to foreign shores should this bill be passed without amendment. This was noted, I might add, in the editorial of the Australian Financial Review on 26 September which stated: To pretend that Australia can establish itself as an important finance centre without bidding for business is both naive and complacent. By failing to confront this reality Australia has let an important opportunity slip past largely by default. I am not just speaking about a hypothetical I am talking about real business decisions. The reality is that many researchers are abandoning their research here in favour of other countries, including Singapore and Malaysia. A recent article in the Business Review Weekly highlighted this very point. That particular article quoted figures from a recent survey of 125 companies by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. It found that 57 per cent of those companies claiming the concessions said the proposed reduction would have a negative effect on their R&D decisions. It also found that almost a quarter of the respondents and 34 per cent of those who have claimed the concession in the past five years say they are considering moving their research and development efforts overseas as a result of the amendments we are addressing tonight. In the case of the team at the Sydney Children's Hospital Cancer Institute, cutting edge experimentation into the treatment of cancer and AIDS is tipped to relocate to Canada because of the unfavourable R&D environment in Australia. It is imperative that the government tap into the wider scientific pool by encouraging foreign companies to locate their research and development headquarters in Australia. It would be one element of their claim-so far a forlorn hope-of creating Australia as a financial centre for the region. There is no doubt that we will be less competitive in the global marketplace as a result of these amendments. Mr David Forman, the author of the article in BRW to which I earlier referred, states that the changes to the R&D concession must be viewed in an international context. He says: It will not take much of a change in the view of Australia's relative merits and commitment to attracting R&D in a rapidly globalising marketplace for the dream of a clever country to evaporate. I could not have said it better myself. Does the government really think that Australian research and development-like Taubman's paint used to be-will 'keep on keeping on', despite such an unstable if not hostile environment? The truth is that syndication and the general research and development tax concession have emerged as the real driving force behind innovation in Australia. Ms Vivian MCCarron, the R&D tax specialist at Coopers and Lybrand, observed in an article in the Australian earlier this year: ... history has shown that without some form of tangible government assistance, Australian investors and corporations tend to be unwilling to put money into research and development. R&D is at a crossroads in Australia. With strong endorsement for the R&D concession by several independent industry bodies, it is difficult to reconcile the government's decision as reflected in this bill. It is obvious that the government is kowtowing to a Treasury that is hell-bent on revenue protection, and that is the only explanation. The government is being railroaded, in my opinion, by a Treasury more concerned with the smaller, short-term picture than with the larger, long-term issue of Australia's international competitiveness. I acknowledge the need for economic restraint, given the magnitude of the former government's fiscal mismanagement, but not at all costs.",114
179,Mr HARDGRAVE,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in support of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996. The bill contains a number of measures which will enable this government to deliver election commitments in several important areas and also ensure a fairer taxation system for all Australians. It will enable tax rebates to be provided to people of age pension age who do not receive the age pension. It will provide an incentive for banks and other lending institutions to make long-term investments in small business by becoming equity partners. It will also enable the threshold for the medical expenses rebate to increase from $1,000 to $1,500, with medical expenses in excess of the threshold to qualify for a rebate at a rate of 20c in the dollar on the excess. Also included in the bill are measures to withdraw the exemption from tax on income from the sale, transfer or assignment of mining rights for gold or other prescribed metals or minerals. This bill will also implement the repeal of paragraph 120(1)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to remove the unfair commercial and taxation advantages cooperative companies and government lending institutions have over other companies by being able to claim an effective 200 per cent tax deduction for the cost of certain assets. As well, the integrity of the infrastructure borrowings program will be strengthened by enabling amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 to prevent schemes from operating which break the· symmetry in the special tax treatments of the payer and receiver of interest. As was stated in statement 4 of Budget Paper No. I, if allowed to proceed such schemes would substantially increase the value of tax benefits to those involved and also increase the cost to revenue without a commensurate increase in the funding for the private sector infrastructure projects. This bill will enable measures to be taken to reduce the cost inefficiencies of the research and development tax concession and encourage Australian companies to undertake innovative R&D, which is what we need to increase our international competitiveness. We are very good at R&D in Australia, and this bill will not harm this. This bill will amend the income tax law to deal with transition issues which arise when previously exempt entities become taxable, as well as close a loophole which allowed the conversion of non-rebatable annuities to rebatable annuities and pensions. It is certainly clear all of these seem fair and responsible measures, which will re-establish equity of treatment for both individuals and business under the current taxation system. They are welcome improvements in this sense. I am sure most people will agree with the logic and good sense of these particular measures before us. Another good thing about this bill is it is also heading in the right direction in terms of being user-friendly legislation. Most of it has been written in clear and plain language so it has a clear and common sense order and feel to it. This is certainly what everyday people in Australia, especially small business, want. People need legislation which is easy to understand instead of making it so complex so they have no other option other than to hire accountants and consultants and accept Australian Taxation Office interpretations. Small business people in my electorate of Moreton, through their two chambers of commerce-the South-West Chamber and the Southside Chamber-believe the Australian tax act needs to be shredded and we should start all over again. In fact, a few months ago they shredded a copy of the tax act kindly donated by one local businessman who wanted to see the thing go for a cathartic reason. Over 5,000 pages went through a huge industrial shredder, and they gave me a bag of the shreddings to bring to Canberra as their symbolic protest against the length and complexity of the act which they have to cope with. This bill, however, shows major tax reform is possible without resorting to such a wholesale demolition of the document. The bill before us is partly a product of the Tax Law Improvement Project-T-LIPwhich started in 1994 with the aim of rewriting the tax act. The project has had bipartisan support, and I hope this continues because the benefits will be enormous. The challenge for those opposite will be to look at elements within the tax act which can be changed, which can be simplified, so ordinary, everyday Australians are empowered by the process. Apart from reducing complexity, it is important to lower the compliance costs involved with the tax act. Taxpayers and accountants would then become a lot more certain about the law, and less time will be required to interpret the legislation and the laws which come from it. As a result of a simpler taxation system, we can promote fairness by spelling out the rules more clearly. People will adhere to the rules if they can understand them. If we could reduce the 5,000-plus pages-which currently the tax act is-to, say, 2,500 pages, it would be a good thing. If we could reduce the average sentence length from 140 words to 40 words, it would be a very good thing. How can anybody actually follow what the tax act currently is? The people of Australia are without the power they need to cope with the system. We need to empower the people at the expense of the Australian Taxation Office. Sure, the ATO are doing their job interpreting the acts which we pass here. We pass the bills, but they tend to be so complex. We give the ATO a very broad briefperhaps a little too much rope-and the ATO tend to try to please themselves. You only have to look at the example of the Mutual Pools sales tax case, which started after the rush of tax reform in the mid-1980s, where the ATO decided in-ground, built-onsite pools could be afforded exactly the same sales tax treatment as prefabricated fibre glass pools which came from a factory and were delivered into a hole in somebody's backyard. As a result of the ATO's interpretation of sales tax in this particular case, many people paid sales tax on their swimming pools. Some of them, including Mutual Pools, took them to court and the High Court determined the ATO had overstepped the mark. As a result, there was a certain amount of refund which had to be paid back. The ATO have a slogan about taxes building a better Australia. I am sure no-one in this place would dispute the fact taxes certainly do grease the wheel. We all know this. Changes to the tax act over the years have created an industry which helps people to cope with the complexity of the act, but we also have a situation where professionals are not able to cope on a daily basis. My own accountant has to send out regularly for more updated information on a year-by-year basis, which costs me money as a client of his. Small businesses in my community are paying much more money each year as they engage consultants through their tax accountants to try to cope with the complexity of the current tax laws. We need to make things simpler. Debate interrupted. NA",117
180,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjoum. Remembrance Day",119
181,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Monday, as members would recall, was 11 November which was Remembrance Day, the 78th anniversary of the end of World War I. On the Sunday prior to that, 10 November, I attended a service in ANZAC Mall at Campsie which is in my electorate. It was conducted by the Campsie RSL subbranch and many people were present-local sub-branch members, the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, local state members, myself, the mayor, the patron of the Campsie RSL club, Kevin Stewart, a former state member for the area, and the sub-branch officers. It was a very moving service. I can recall attending the first Campsie subbranch service in my electorate on ANZAC Day in 1979, a few weeks before I was first elected. I do not think I have missed either an ANZAC Day service or a Remembrance Day service that that club has held since then. In my electorate there are many RSL clubs and memorial clubs and they all hold very moving services on days such as this, but the Campsie service always stands out and continues to stand out in my memory. I do not know whether that is due to the simplicity of the services, the attitude of the sub-branch members and the officers of the sub-branch or the particular hard work that John Campbell, the president of the sub-branch, puts into ensure that the service at Campsie goes properly. But it is always one of those services that continue to stand out in my mind. While I was there two Sundays ago on a sunny Sydney morning listening to the prayers offered by the Salvation Army chaplain, and in particular listening to the Last Post, I was reminded of the two occasions that I have visited the Australian war graves in the Villers-Bretonneux area in France. Unlike some members here who were fortunate to go on the Gallipoli pilgrimage a year or so ago, my experience of travelling to parts where young Australians have died has been to that Villers-Bretonneux area. I do not think it is possible to visit any of the Australian war graves in that area without being overcome by an incredible sense of sadness caused by looking at all those long lines of white crosses that denote the resting place of young Australians who died so far away from their own homes. As there are very few First World War veterans left alive to remind us, often people now forget what happened 70 or 80 years ago. It is amazing thinking of the effect on Australia of the contribution this country made to the effort in that war. During the First World War, Australia had a population of about five million people, but this country sent 330,000 young men to fight in that war and 226,073 became casualties-68V2 per cent-and 59,258 died. Australia's contribution to the British Empire, as it was in those days, was the greatest of any country in the Empire. The effect of that sacrifice in the First World War was felt by every family in this country at that time. Every family in this country knew the sadness of a family member who had either died or had been wounded in that war. Many would say that the families of those who were wounded and came back had a worse life than those who might have been luckily saved from that walking death by death itself. As a member of parliament standing there in Sydney on a sunny Sunday, it brought back to me the great sacrifice that people made. For members of parliament it should also cause them to consider, if ever thinking of whether to commit this country to war, that the people who die in those wars are always our young people and that the people who make the decisions to send them often are people who are quite senior to them. We should always remember days like ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day because of the sacrifice that those young people made. Health Services",119
182,Mrs BAILEY,ADJOURNMENT,"MCEwen) (10.35 p.m.}-We are all aware of the burgeoning costs of care today-the cost of new drugs, the cost keeping patients in hospitals and certainly cost of new equipment and the technology needed to provide all of those services. However, it is that very technology that, while costly in the developmental stages, help reduce the overall cost of health care. I want to bring to the attention of the House tonight new technology that is at the cutting edge of international development in preclinical drug trials and diagnostic research to assist in the treatment of cancer, cardiology and psychiatry. I refer to the PET centre at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne. PET stands for positron emission tomography. I visited the PET centre at the Austin Hospital recently and I must say that I was excited by what I saw and heard from the talented and dedicated people who run the PET centre. The PET machine looks to me, as someone with no medical training, much like any other large scanning machine. But that is the only similarity. For while, for example, a CAT scan machine produces an image of structure and anatomy of organs, the PET machine, also using a non-invasive technique, produces an image of the physiology of organs. And this together with the use of radioisotopes which, I might add, are produced at the Austin PET centre, provide a unique diagnosPET tic tool because specific biochemical processtreated es occurring within a particular patient produced. In other words, while conventional scanning machines will produce an image of, for example, a cross-section of the brain, the PET machine will produce an image provides information about the functional and metabolic state of the brain. This is the unique quality of the PET machine because the actual chemical function of the particular organ being investigated is able to be anascanner lysed and evaluated. To give an actual example of the extraordinary value that this PET machine provides as a diagnostic tool and the clinical application available as a result of this machine, let me tell the House a remarkable story of a young boy who suffered from a severe form of epilepsy. The severity of his disease meant that the only way his condition could be health managed was for him to be placed on an of extensive regime of medication, with the the result that he was rendered incapable of leading anything like a normal life. A PET scan revealed the level of chemical imbalance in a particular area of his brain. can This was the first time specialists had been able to identify exactly the area and extent of the problem. This meant that that young boy was able to be operated on and today he leads a normal life. He owes the opportunity he was presented with to lead this normal life to the function of the PET centre at the Austin Hospital and to the talented people who were able to analyse and evaluate the information. The quality of life that that young boy now enjoys cannot be quantified in dollar terms, but just take a moment to consider the cost of his medication, the cost of hospitalisation, the fact that he would never have been able to complete his education or be employed and would have had to exist on a disability pension, and the fact that his family would have had to forgo both social and economic opportunities in order to provide the level of care he would need. Just consider the cost of that in both dollar and human terms. Another area that the PET centre at the Austin Hospital is pioneering is in the identification of heart disease. For example, the scan will identify patients who can be successfully using methods other than are the costly methods of heart transplant or bypass. Research currently being undertaken using the PET scan was helping to understand heart disease and leading to further investigatwhich ions to improve treatment. Specialists at the Austin PET centre are also exploring mechanisms of cancer cell growth and developing methods for more effective treatment of cancer. As well as the PET being used for this level of research into cancer, cardiovascular disease and psychiatric disease, it is being used to evaluate new drugs. The PET centre at the Austin Hospital has achieved an international reputation in both research and clinical applications and has effectively demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of PET in managing patients. The long-term benefits for patients and cost containment are both real and attainable. I believe that with continued support the PET centre at the Austin Hospital will provide hope for countless people in the future. Racism",120
183,Ms ELLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I use my time in the adjournment debate tonight to talk about the racism debate that is going on in the community today and to put a little bit of a positive spin on it. Before I do, I just want to revisit a couple of points. I find it particularly sad that in a country like ours, where we have gained so much and come so far in accepting people from other nations into our community, we have to have this debate in the first place. I deplore the role the people who have contributed in some sense to triggering this debate, and I hope they take the time to ponder what they are doing rather than finding some excuse in trying to evade the depth of their comments. We really do need to see some good leadership in this country today. I could aim that at the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and I do. But I also aim it at anybody in a position in public office anywhere where they have the ability to take on a position of leadership and actually offer to the community some guidance through this very difficult time that I believe our community is facing. There is no doubt that in our community in Australian society we have always had and always will have people with a minority view of some kind-people who have a view on a margin ali sed group. Whether it be that a single parent should not get a pension, whether it be about migrants and the immigration issue or whether it be whether or not we should have foreign aid funding, we will always have those marginalised or small minority views. Suddenly some people in the community with some extreme views of these kinds believe it is now acceptable to air those views in a very aggressive way. When I talk about that, I think particularly of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson); the Mayor of Port Lincoln, who I think has been credited, unfortunately, with some of the most damning comments I thought I could ever hear anywhere in the world, let alone in my own country; and the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). It is not one person. There are a number of people, all of whom should wear responsibility for the sort of scaremongering that is going on in relation to the immigration debate. The point is, though, that the majority of Australians do not tolerate the sort of behaviour being demonstrated by those sorts of people. It is just not acceptable in our society to physically abuse people because they come from a different country. It is just not acceptable to verbally assault these people. It is not acceptable for children from ethnic backgrounds to feel suddenly threatened in their of school ground. Unfortunately, that is happening. We also have to acknowledge, whether the Prime Minister likes it or not, that newspapers in foreign languages, newspapers in countries in South-East Asia, are carrying this story from Australia. Tonight I also heard from some people very well versed on this issue that the internet is now carrying a huge number of reports on the debate in this region of the world, particularly in our own country. There are economic reasons why we could argue against these particular views, and they are valid arguments. But, more importantly, there are moral reasons why we should argue against those views. It is more important because these people have come here to make their home. They have done it successfully. We now have second and third generation children of families born of an ethnic background but who have come here. They still look and appear different to the rest of us but, by golly, they are as Australian as the rest of us. They have been long-term investors in their family, in our society and in their contribution to it. Tonight I had the pleasure with my Labor colleagues in the ACT to meet in Parliament House a very large number of representatives of the Asian community in the ACT. The positive reaction we got from those people in hearing their views, in understanding their concerns and in hearing their contributions to the sorts of things they believe we can jointly do to try to overcome some of the bias in the community really made me believe that we will survive this debate. But we will survive it only if people like those we spoke to are given the opportunity to take that role. We will survive it only if all of those people in public office, including the Prime Minister, stop running away from it, draw a line in the sand and say, 'No more will we tolerate this outrageous type of behaviour.' It is anathema to this country and to our society. I encourage all members to take that role very seriously within their own electorates as well as within this place. Aboriginal Communities: Food Costs ATSIC-Army Community Assistance",121
184,Mr DONDAS,ADJOURNMENT,"During today's grievance debate I raised some concerns in regard to the speech last week by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, at the ninth annual Joe and Dame Enid Lyons Lecture at the ANU. I did not have enough time to conclude my remarks so I thought I would use this opportunity during the adjournment debate to pick up the remainder of them. The minister in his address at that lecture made some very extensi ve and welcome remarks. I think it will become his blueprint for having things done in terms of Aboriginal affairs. I commend the statement to members. I am quite sure that the minister will circulate it to all honourable members. In his speech the minister spoke about the high cost of food in Aboriginal communities. He said that in some instances food costs were as much as 50 per cent more than those in capital cities. That is a fact. In fact, in some communities in the Northern Territory, food costs are almost 100 per cent more than capital city prices. I will give some examples. A 100 gram jar of Vegemite would probably cost about $1.45 in Coles here in Canberra. The same jar of Vegemite would probably cost $2.90 in some communities in the Northern Territory. A 350 gram jar of IXL jam would cost about $1.45 to $1.60 in Canberra, depending on the store, but in some of these remote communities in the territory it would cost as much as $3. The main reason for the high food costs are the transportation costs to the territory, especially to remote areas. Unless the government works out some kind of formula whereby it can subsidise transport operators-those people who are providing remote communities with freight services-for moving freight around regional parts of Australia, I do not think the costs will ever go down. The minister also spoke about real jobs in Aboriginal communities. In his statement he implied that in some communities up to 50 per cent of the community were unemployed. That is quite right, too. Of course, the CDEP program, which has been in place for a Project number of years, is working, and that will obviously alleviate some of the high unemployment figures which could be reflected if that program were not in place. I will give an example. In October 1995 the Northern Territory's unemployment rate was seven per cent. In October 1996 it was only 4.8 per cent. But if some of the CDEP programs that have been carried on in the Northern Territory are not maintained, obviously, in October 1997 we could see a far different picture. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) was asked a question today about water and how the army might help to provide some kind of infrastructure for essential services. In some communities there is no water. No matter what the army or the government does, the water is not there, and the only way people will get water is to cart it in by water tanker. In some communities the cost of water can be as high as $1 per litre. I welcome the minister's initiati ve in trying to encourage some of the essential services to be provided by the army, but earlier today I cautioned the minister that this program can work only if communities in remote areas are consulted. If you had talked to a community in 1995 and asked them to list their priorities, they would have listed them from 1 to 5. You could go back a year later and the priorities would have changed. That is the important thing-consultation. Unless we consult, as I said earlier today, we could find the army chasing its tail trying to provide services, especially essential services, to these communities. I will be writing to the minister to outline some of my concerns in terms of the consultation process. Before I finish, I would like to quote from the remarks of a former minister for Aboriginal affairs, Peter Howson, who said, in an article in the Adelaide Review of September 1996: The States, local government, community groups and private business all have to be involved in the changes to aboriginal policy which now have to occur. These changes can best be implemented by people who are close to the problems and who have to live with the outcome of what is done. The problems have been exacerbated by Canberra and will now have to be solved by local knowledge and experience. Those people who are concerned about, and have experience in, Aboriginal affairs should now be thinking very strenuously about where we go from here. Aboriginal affairs and the current parlous condition of Aborigines, can no longer be entrusted to the Canberra-based Aboriginal industry. His All Holiness The Ecumenical Patriach of the Othodox Church",122
185,Mr MCCLELLAND,ADJOURNMENT," I rise in this adjournment debate to address an issue which is of concern to a substantial number of my constituents and a number of Australians of the Orthodox faith-that is, the lack of proper protection for the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople to carry out its mission. As all of us are aware, His All Holiness, Patriarch Bartholomew I, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, is currently visiting Australia. However, many Australians would not be aware of the difficulty and danger that the Ecumenical Patriarchate and His All Holiness must continually struggle with. His All Holiness is the spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. As the Vatican is the heart of Roman Catholicism, the Ecumenical Patriarchate is the heart of Orthodox Christianity. Today, the great city that was once Constantinople is called Istanbul by the present day Republic of Turkey and is no longer the capital of any empire. In 1923, the Turkish government agreed that the Greek Orthodox patriarchate could remain in Istanbul provided that the patriarch confined himself to religious affairs. Since that time, the situation of the patriarchate has fluctuated along with Greek-Turkish relations. A number of unfortunate incidents have occurred involving the patriarchate. In July and August of 1993 the Christian Orthodox cemetery in Yenikoy, near Istanbul, was desecrated by vandals on two occasions. Many such cemeteries and other religious monuments are continually targeted by vandals. On the night of 30 March 1994 a Molotov cocktail bomb was thrown inside the courtyard of the ecumenical patriarchate itself. On 24 May 1994 three bombs were placed in the attic of the building where His All Holiness resides and were found shortly before they were set to explode. More recently, the Cathedral Church of St George in Istanbul was bombed, reportedly by the extreme right-wing organisation Great Eastern Islamic Raiders. Another extremely serious problem for the patriarchate is the closing of the Halki Patriarchal School of Theology, the academy that between 1844 and 1971 trained clergy for the ecumenical patriarchate. The closing of the Halki school by the Turkish authorities is in direct violation of international human rights agreements, specifically the Lausanne Treaty signed in 1923. Article 40 of that treaty expressly guarantees the Greek minority in Turkey the right to establish and control religious institutions. That is also a right recognised by the Geneva 1991 conference on security and cooperation in Europe meeting of experts on national minorities. A further attack on the religious freedoms of the Greek Orthodox minority is a campaign by various government figures and elements of the Turkish press to convert the most famous and most sacred monument of Greek Orthodox Christianity, the Church of St Sophia, into a mosque. In conclusion, the ecumenical patriarch and those associated with the patriarchate, as Turkish citizens, must be protected under Turkish law against blatant attacks on ethnic minority. It is the Turkish government's obligation to protect the patriarchate, a major international religious institution that is located on Turkish soil, and to guarantee the rights of the Greek minority under international treaties and conventions. Turkey can be proud to have this historical religious institution on its soil and to allow it to flourish. The ecumenical patriarch Bartholomew I is a Turkish citizen who proudly served in the Turkish uniform. The Turkish nation can be proud of him as an individual and indeed can be proud of his work in providing a bridge in his capacity as head of the Orthodox Church between Eastern and Western Europe. He deserves the encouragement, the support and the protection of the international community. Seabird Conservation",123
186,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to pick up from where I left off from my remarks this morning in relation to the bycatch of albatross identified in the third report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. There is also some doubt as to the effectiveness of mitigation devices presently available. The best options appear to be tori poles, bait throwers, night setting and bait thawing. Early results with tori poles suggest a 30 to 75 per cent reduction in seabird bykill. Setting the lines at night avoids ing albatrosses but will catch other seabird species, such as shearwaters and the whitechinned petrel. Initial results of night setting indicate a 70 to 96 per cent reduction in seabird bykill. Over 100 Japanese boats have installed bait throwers and it is being used increasingly on Taiwanese vessels. Depending on the design, a 60 to 80 per cent reduction in bykill may be achieved. A mechanism that shoots the line from the hull so that the hooks do not appear on the surface is working in some long-liners in the Northern Hemisphere. Early indications arc that a 50 to 70 per cent reduction in seabird bykill can be achieved by thawing baits. Other mitigation methods include not discharging offal during line setting, changes in boat design, education of fishing vessel operators and area or seasonal closures of fishing zones. Mitigation measures being developed include colouring the bait, hook design such as smart hooks, artificial bait and identification of best setting techniques. In 1995, the previous Minister for the Environment announced a $ I. I 3 million program over four years towards a threat abatement plan. That plan is looking at a suite of measures to reduce albatross bykill. The effectiveness of the threat abatement plan may depend on a number of legal issues. The threat abatement plan must have regard for social and economic impacts under the ESP Act, which may limit the effectiveness in protecting albatross species. I am concerned at the lack of progress on the threat abatement plan as the first meeting was not scheduled until October 1996. The committee was told that not a lot of research is being done into mitigation measures to prevent seabird bycatch pending the development of the threat abatement plan, which still has two years to go. The committee is concerned that this may slow the progress of this research and urges the government to ensure that this does not occur. Mitigation measures developed as soon as possible will enable their use to be incorporated in the threat abatement plan. It was sugcatchgested to the committee that the general impression from research facilities and fishery agencies is that the albatross bycatch could be greatly reduced 'without a lot of pain and investment in the technology to reform the fishing methods'. The workshops and meetings for developing the threat abatement plan have now commenced. The committee supports the consultation process being conducted with a range of interested parties. The committee would like to see this broadened, however, to include representatives from New Zealand and Japan. The Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals 1979, the Bonn convention, provides a framework for enhancing the conservation status of rare and threatened migratory species. Under this convention, Australia is obliged to enter into regional, bilateral and multilateral agreements to ensure effective conservation of migratory species. I was very impressed with the work of the Southern Oceans Seabird Study Association. SOSSA is a wildlife research and conservation group which consists of dedicated people, both professional and trained. Though primarily concerned with the conservation and greater understanding of the seabird fauna of this region, SOSSA is dedicated to greater knowledge of the biodiversity of the southern oceans. I was particularly impressed with the people who are behind SOSSA, amongst many others, but I mention in particular Janice Jenkin-Smith, Lindsay Smith and Harry Battams. The Australian community owes a great debt to these people for their bringing to the attention of both the committee and the people of Australia the terrible ing the albatross. In conclusion, I refer to page 99 of the report, which - l1ows a wonderful photo of an albatross nicknamed Annie. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the story of Annie from page 3 of the Southern Oceans Seabird Study Association's issue No. 1·2. Leave not granted.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Foreign Reserves (Question No. 10) Mr Rocher asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 1 May 1996: (1) What were the total sums of foreign reserves at (a) 31 March 1995 and (b) 31 March 1996. (2) What percentage of each total sum referred to in part (1) was held in (a) US$, (b) each other foreign currency and (c) bullion. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Total official reserve assets were (a) $A21,240 million as at 31 March 1995; and (b) $AI7,935 million as at 29 March 1996. US dollars Japanese yen Deutsche marks Other foreign currencies Special Drawing Rights Gold Reserve Position at IMF Total Contingent Debt (Question No. 392) Mr Rocher asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 17 June 1996: Further to his answer to my question without notice concerning contingent debt (Hansard, 28 May 1996, page 1505), is he now able to say whether the Government will propose amendments to taxation laws to enable participation by Australian investors in the growth international market for contingent debt; if so, when. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Contingent debt, in a generic sense, is a contract with the form of debt but under which the payment of principal or interest, or both, are contingent on a variable, often a commodity or equity price. NA (2) Official reserve assets are mainly invested in the three major world currencies (US dollars, Japanese yen and Deutsche marks). Minor amounts are also held in a wide range of other currencies, mainly as working balances. As well as foreign currencies, also included in official reserves are Special Drawing Rights issued by the International Monetary Fund, gold and Australia's reserve position in the International Monetary Fund. The composition of reserves varies from time to time reflecting foreign exchange transactions undertaken by the Reserve Bank for intervention purposes and as part of its management of reserves, and changes in the values of currencies and gold. The composition of official reserve assets at each of the two dates listed above is as follows: 31 March 1995 29 March 1996 % % 21.1 29.3 23.4 22.0 30.7 22.0 0.8 0.4 0.5 0.4 20.0 22.4 3.5 3.5 100.0 100.0 The tax law does not prevent participation by Australian investors in contingent debt markets. Rather, it regulates the tax treatment: contingent debt attracts the tax treatment of debt rather than the tax treatment of equity. It has recently been suggested that some debt (if not all debt), including contingent debt, should receive 'equity tax benefits'; in particular, such debt should be able to be franked. Proponents of such a move argue that this would provide a substantial overall boost to national savings. Upon investigation, however, the proposal would have, at best, an uncertain impact on national saving and is inconsistent with the general purpose of the imputation system. To achieve an increase in net national savings, the increase in private savings from the proposal must exceed the revenue cost to the Government. In light of the potentially signifi-ant reve-ue cost associated with increased franking credIt usage (particularly with conti-ued inte.rest deductibili.ty!, and an uncertain net pnvate savmgs response, It IS not clear that net national savings would be increased. Australia's dividend imputation system generally seeks to relieve double taxation of corporate profits distributed as dividends while maintaining one layer of taxation at company level. Maintaining a corporate layer of taxation requires ensuring that the benefits of franking credits pass to those otherwise bearing this burden of double taxation and are not transferred to those who do not. In the presence of interest deductibility, the franking of contingent debt necessarily involves franking credits passing to persons not bearing the burden of double taxation. While the franking of contingent debt may be inappropriate, proposals of the above type touch on the more general issue of whether it is desirable for economically similar instruments to receive different tax treatments because of their legal form. This is one of the issues being addressed in the current ATO and Treasury review of the taxation of financial arrangements. In the presence of financial innovation and a continued distinction for tax purposes between debt and equity, there is stronger case for taxing financial arrangements according to their economic substance. While the issues are complex, one of the objectives of the review of the taxation of financial arrangements is to identify proposals that will improve the fit between the evolving financial system and the taxation system. This involves removing anomalies and uncertainties, and ensuring that taxation policy does not unduly inhibit the efficient allocation and management of risk throughout the economy. A more certain and neutral system for taxing financial arrangements would facilitate financial innovation while reducing the scope for tax arbitrage that is opened up by certain types of financial innovation. It should also improve the consistency of the application of taxation arrangements at the borderline between debt and equity across a range of financial arrangements, including contingent debt. The officials working on this project have consulted widely in an attempt to develop proposals that appropriately reflect industry concerns as well as taxation policy objectives. A Consultative Document on the taxation of financial arrangements was released in December 1993. Submissions received from industry following the release of the Consultative Document have been comprehensively reviewed and an Issues Paper, being prepared by the ATO and the Treasury, addressing the issues raised by those submissions, is at an advanced stage of drafting. The Issues Paper will set out, and invite comment on, the ATO and Treasury's preferred approach to addressing the major issues raised by industry submissions. The Issues Paper will form the basis for further consultation in relation to any outstanding issues. Australian Sport: Foreign Ownership (Question No. 473) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 June 1996: (1) What restrictions will the Government apply to the foreign ownership of Australia's national sporting codes and competitions. (2) What principles have been developed under the national competition policy framework to prohibit long term, exclusive access rights between infrastructure owners and carrier companies. (3) Will the Government apply principles for competitive access rights to long term, exclusive broadcasting rights between sporting organisations and broadcasting companies. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government's foreign investment guidelines provide for scrutiny of many proposed foreign purchases of Australian businesses and properties. For most industry sectors, including the services sector, which incorporates the sports/entertainment industry, proposals for the establishment of new businesses involving total investment of $10 million or more and proposals for the acquisition of existing businesses with total assets valued at more than $5 million are notifiable. Proposals where the assets or planned investment outlays are valued above these thresholds but below $50 million will normally be approved without detailed examination. Proposals where the valuation is $50 million or more will be approved unless judged by the Government to be contrary to the national interest. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the Act) provides legislative backing for ensuring compliance with the guidelines. While most foreign investment brings direct economic benefits to Australia, the Government has the power under the Act to block proposals that are determined to be contrary to the national interest. There are also powers to impose conditions when approving foreign investment proposals. Specific restrictions on foreign investment are in force in more sensitive sectors such as the media and developed residential real estate. (2) and (3) The competitive conduct rules of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Part IV) includes a prohibition on 'exclusive dealing' (s.47). These rules prohibit exclusive supply arrangements which substantially lessen competition in an Australian market. For instance, an arrangement for the exclusive supply of transmission services by infrastructure owners to carriers would be illegal if it substantially lessens competition in an Australian market. This prohibition is, however, subject to the qualification that the parties can obtain immunity for such an arrangement by giving notice to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. If the Commission believes that the arrangement will not generate an overall benefit to the public, it can terminate that immunity. The national competition policy reforms have led to the establishment of a legislated regime for access to the services of certain key infrastructure facilities. The regime came into operation on 6 November 1995. This regime sets out a process whereby the Commission can, following Ministerial declaration, require a facility operator to provide access in certain situations. In doing so, the Commission can override exclusive rights between facility operators and users where those rights are not being used. The access regime provides for access to infrastructure services. In the case of communications infrastructure this may include broadcasting services or communications services, ie the service of transmitting information. However, it does not provide for access to the information itself. Generally the regime cannot be used to obtain access to intellectual property. Computer Systems Modifications (Question No. 527) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) What steps are being taken to ensure that all computer systems in the Minister's Department or any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility are modified so that they continue to operate properly after 1 January 2000. (2) What is the estimated cost of the modifications. (3) Will all systems be modified by 1 January 2000. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Treasury (1) The Treasury is reviewing all applications to determine whether they will continue to work successfully on and after 1 January 2000. (2) No estimate of costs is available, as applications are still being reviewed. However, it is expected changes will be made wherever possible, while maintenance is being carried out. (3) Yes. Australian Bureau of Statistics The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is actively reviewing all of its computer systems to ensure that there are no adverse impacts from the Year 2000 and that all systems will continue to operate correctly throughout the remainder of this century as well as from 1 January 2000. (1) In June this year the ABS assigned a very experienced senior officer to be the ABS Year 2000 project coordinator on a full-time basis. The coordinator will shortly be producing a strategy document for consideration by senior ABS management. It will describe the issues and opportunities and propose various actions requiring the participation of many ABS staff at some time over the next few years. In the meantime, extensive information is being gathered (eg through attendance at ""Year 2000"" seminars, discussions with a number of vendors of Year 2000 services, and discussions with key IT Suppliers). Information is also being gathered through literature searches on the Internet and from other sources and lodged on a widely used in-house discussion database. The ABS is also represented on the Year 2000 Sub-Committee of the Government Information Services Policy Board. (2) No estimate of the total cost has been made as yet as the ABS is still in the investigation stage of the process. (3) Any action that is justifiable will be taken at an appropriate time. The ABS strategy involves performing a ""Year 2000"" risk assessment for all ABS computer systems as well as for connections with other organisations. It is anticipated some systems will need to be suitably modified, some will be replaced or withdrawn, some will not require any modification, and some very low-risk systems will be presumed correct (with appropriate contingency plans). Wherever practicable, modifications will be made concurrently with changes required for other business reasons. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1) The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has completed a preliminary examination into the ""Year 2000 Problems"" regarding computer systems. A more detailed investigation is underway which will consider responses from vendors regarding off-the-shelf applications used by the Commission. A comprehensive program for resolving all of the issues will be developed by December 1996 in accordance with the ""Office of Government Technology Guideline 1/96"". Most computing hardware operated by the Commission is Year 2000 compatible. Some of the older equipment has not been fully tested but are programmed to be replaced over the next 2 years for performance reasons. Consequently, they have not been included in these costings. The Commission has developed a number of inhouse applications which are Year 2000 sensitive. Replacement of these applications has commenced and should be completed by early 1999. (2) The projected cost of these software replacement programs is estimated at $200,000 to $250,000. The cost of upgrades associated with vendor supplied off-the shelf applications is unknown at this stage. Initial tests indicate that they 2000 compatible and require no modifications to meet the business needs of the COfl1mission. Vendors have been contacted for their technical advice and upgrade strategies. (3) Yes. Australian Securities Commission (1) The Australian Securities Commission (ASC) is examining all IT Systems to determine compliance with the date format required to ensure successful continuity of operation on and after I January 2000. Evaluation will be completed by December 1996 and an action plan developed to rectify instances of non-compliance. (2) The ASC estimates that the resource costs to modify non-compliant systems will be $50,000. (3) Yes. Australian Taxation Office (1) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has established a project to fully address the Year 2000 date issue for its computer systems. An inventory of all in-house and third party systems is being compiled and impacts assessed. Planning is underway for system modification and testing. Conversion and testing of some systems has already commenced and it is anticipated that testing of all systems will be substantially complete by the end of calendar year 1998. The ATO has representation on the Year 2000 Sub-Committee of the Government Information Services Policy Board, and will address the Year 2000 issues in co-ordination with other agencies through this involvement. (2) Detailed costing has yet to be performed. The initial estimate for costs to modify and test systems is of the order of $4.2 million. In addition, the A TO may need to upgrade its mainframe system software in an earlier time frame than originally planned, resulting in an increased expenditure of approximately $2.8 million. Whilst the ATO will attempt to accommodate testing associated with Year 2000 changes on its current computing equipment, there is a real possibility that equipment will need to be acquired for this purpose, at an estimated cost of $1. 8 million. Overall costs are therefore expected to be of the order of $7 to $8.8 million. (3) It is intended that all current systems which are required to be in use after 1 January 2000 will be modified and fully tested well before that date. All new systems being developed will be designed to accommodate the Year 2000. Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (1) The Corporation's Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) adequately handles the storage, use and display of dates beyond the Year 2000. Minimal modifications are required to a small number of programs, however, these will are Year be modified internally by existing staff. (2) Cost will be negligible. (3) Yes. Insurance and Superannuation Commission The Insurance and Superannuation Commission's (lSC) position on the system implications of the Year 2000 date change is as follows. (1) All the in-house developed legacy systems will be replaced before 1 January 2000. (2) Costing of modifications for the date change is estimated at $0, due to the modifications being incorporated in system redevelopments. (3) All the in-house systems will be replaced before 1 January 2000. The ISC will be relying on the vendors of any packaged software to release appropriate versions and conversion tools to ensure their systems handle the date change. Royal Australian Mint (1) The Royal Australian Mint has reviewed all systems currently installed as to their level of compliance with the Year 2000 requirement. Only one system may not work on or after 1 January 2000, and this system will be upgraded if required under maintenance at nil cost to comply with tile Year 2000 requirement. (2) No costs are expected to be incurred by the Royal Australian Mint in anticipation of the Year 2000. (3) Yes. Productivity Commission (1) The Productivity Commission is following guidelines offered by the Office of Government Information Technology in preparing computer systems for the c\1ange of date in the Year 2000. The next significant milestone to be achieved in this process is the formulation of detailed plans for the Year 2000 Project to be submitted to OGIT by December 23, 1996. (2) Preliminary investigations have revealed no Productivity Commission computer in need of upgrade because of the Year 2000 date. Estimated costs at this early stage are zero for modifications. (3) Yes. Research and Development: Tax Concessions (Question No. 559) Mr Rocher asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: What sum of revenue was forgone as a result of tax concessions for research and development in 1995-96. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: According to the methods used in calculating the cost of the research and development tax concession employed in the Treasury's Tax Expenditure Statement (TES) the revenue forgone from the concession in 1995-96 was $790 million. Annual Budget Statements: Treasury (Question No. 578) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 34 (Hansard, 28 June 1996, page 3195), did his Department survey all members of parliament in 1994-95 on the 'reader friendliness' of the Budget statements; if so, (a) what did the results of the survey indicate and (b) how has his Department responded. (2) Did he state on 12 March 1996 that the purpose of budget policy was to increase national savings. . (3) Will the 1996-97 Budget statements include only the estimated direct impact of the Budget on national savings; if so, why will the estimated indirect impact not be included. (4) Will he include his Department's estimate of the indirect impact of the annual Budget on nation- name. al savings in his 'charter of budget honesty'. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) My press release of 12 March 1996 stated that the Government's budget strategy will repair Australia's savings. (3) The 1996-97 Budget statements focus on the underlying budget balance as the appropriate measure of the Budget's impact on public sector saving. The underlying budget balance estimates the Commonwealth budget sector's contribution to the national saving and investment imbalance, which in tum approximates the nation's current account deficit. The Budget papers do not provide an estimate of the net effect of the announced fiscal consolidation measures on national saving. The net effect on national saving would depend on any consequential changes in private saving, which could not be estimated with any degree of accuracy because of the difficulty of separating out the effects of other influences on private saving. However, as indicated in Statement 1 of Budget Paper No.1 1996-97, based on international experience fiscal consolidation, especially programmes concentrating on outlays restraint, can be expected to result in an increase in national saving after allowing for some partly offsetting change in private saving. (4) The Charter of Budget Honesty legislation will require governments to frame fiscal policy in accordance with principles of sound fiscal management. As outlined in the Charter of Budget Honesty Ministerial Statement, these principles include a requirement that governments ensure that fiscal Review policy contributes to the achievement of adequate national saving. The Charter will require governments to demonstrate how their fiscal policy complies with the principles of sound fiscal management but is not intended to be prescriptive about how this is achieved. Productivity Commission (Question No. 593) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: (1) Will he introduce legislation to establish a new Productivity Commission and abolish the Industry Commission (IC), the Economic Planning Advisory Commission (EPAC) and the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE); if so, on what legal basis did the Government instruct the IC, EPAC and BIE to co-locate in the Treasury portfolio, amalgamate on an administrative basis and undertake their work under the Productivity Commission (2) Is this action consistent with the Prime Minister's election policy of asserting the supremacy and authority of Parliament over the Executive. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Consistent with the Government's pre-election commitment, legislation is presently being drafted to establish the Productivity Commission, and abolish the Industry Commission and the Economic Planning Advisory Commission. The Productivity Commission will have a wide charter and flexible processes to examine ways of improving productivity in the public and private sectors of the economy. I intend to introduce the legislation into Parliament as soon as possible this Session. Under the Administrative Arrangements Order proclaimed by the Governor General on II March 1996, I was given responsibility for the administration of the Economic Planning Advisory Commission Act 1983 and the Industry Commission Act 1989. The Bureau of Industry Economics was a division of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, and the decision to transfer the Bureau to my portfolio was an administrative one by the Government. The three agencies were co-located in my portfolio so that amalgamation could begin on an administrative basis as soon as possible. The Government is keen to realise the budgetary savings involved through rationalising functions and eliminating overlaps. More importantly, the Government wanted the work programs of the three agencies directed quickly and efficiently towards supporting its priorities. During the process of amalgamation on an administrative basis, reports and papers released have indicated the stage of the amalgamation process and the author agency or joint authorship. (2) The Government's action in this area is entirely consistent with all relevant pre-election commitments. Parliament will have the opportunity to scrutinise the legislation to establish the Productivity Commission. SkillShare Projects: Electoral Division of (Question No. 607) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training .and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 22 August 1996: What SkillS hare projects were funded in the electoral division of Greenway during 1995-96 and what sum was granted in each case. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: During the 1995-96 Financial Year two SkillShare projects in the electoral division of Greenway were funded: The Work Place SkillShare-$431 ,000 Mission Employment SkillS hare-Seven Hills$492,900 St George Bank (Question No. 612) Mr MCClelland asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: (1) Is the St George Bank one of the largest regional banks operating in Australia. (2) Does the St George Bank have its head office in Kogarah in the electoral division of Barton. (3) Is he able to say (a) how many (i) males and (ii) females are employed by the St George Bank throughout Australia on a (A) full time or (B) part time basis and (b) what is the annual salary bill of the St George Bank. (4) Which banks in addition to the St George Bank have their head offices outside the central business district of capital cities. (5) In any prospective takeover of any of the regional banks will the Government act to protect the economic interests of the regions in which the banks have their head offices. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As at August 1996, the St George Bank was the fifth largest bank in Australia in terms of total assets. (2) St George Bank's head office is at: St George House, 4-16 Montgomery Street, Kogarah, NSW 2217. The head office is within the electoral division of Barton. (3) This is a question that should be directed to the St George Bank. Greenway (4) The only other domestic bank that has its head office outside the central business district of a capital city is Bendigo Bank Limited. (5) Any merger between banks will be considered in terms of the implications it may have for competition and stability in the financial system, including the impact on competition within regions. More generally, the Government aims to maintain a competitive, stable and efficient financial system to promote savings and allocate funds to their most productive uses. At a broader level the Government has a range of initiatives directed at addressing regional economic interests. Bank Employees: Electoral Division of Barton (Question No. 613) Mr MCClelland asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: Is he able to say (a) how many (i) males and (ii) females are employed by banks in the electoral division of Barton on a (A) full time or (B) part time basis and (b) what is the annual salary bill of each of these banks. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government does not have access to the information required to answer the specific issues raised. This could only be obtained by directly approaching the banks concerned. Telstra Staff: Electoral Division of (Question No. 614) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: (1) Further to the answer to question No.95 (Hansard, 17 June 1996, page 2050), is the staff reduction program of Telstra now sufficiently advanced for Telstra to be able to provide a figure for the number of redundancies planned within the electoral division of Barton, if so, (a) how many staff will be offered redundancy packages at each of the sites in Barton and (b) what will be the total loss of salaries payable on (i) a fortnightly and (ii) an annual basis as a result of the redundancies. (2) Is planning sufficiently advanced for Telstra to provide details of which premises in the electoral division of Barton will be closed; if not, when will information be provided. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) Business planning within Telstra is not done on a geographic basis. Staff reductions are an outcome of a range of cost reduction initiatives which Telstra is implementing in an endeavour to remain competitive in the marketplace over the next several years. Planning for reductions at specific locations is not undertaken. World Exposition: Lisbon, Portugal (Question No. 618) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: (1) Where and when will the next world exposition take place. (2) Will Australia be represented at the next Expo; if so, in what form will its representation take. (3) What is the estimated sum that Australia will be expending on its presence at the Expo and how many Australians will it employ. (4) What theme will be presented by Australia at the Expo and how far have plans developed for Australia's representation. (5) Has any Expo committee been established; if so, who are the members of the committee. Mr Moore-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Lisbon, Portugal, 1998. Barton (2) No. (3) Not applicable. (4) Not applicable. (5) Not applicable. IMF and OECD Reports (Question No. 633) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: (1) Is he able to say whether the IMF and OECD recently published reports showing that the private sector tends to compensate for changes in public sector saving; if so, what are the detailed findings of these reports. (2) For each of the major revenue and outlay measures in the 1996 Budget, what is the extent of compensation between private and public sector savings. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I refer the honourable member to what has already been written on this matter in the 1996-97 Budget Statements (Budget Paper No.1, 1996-97, Budget Statement No.1, page 1-11). ""Both the IMF and OECD have recently published reports which suggest that the private sector tends to compensate, in part, for changes to public sector saving.' The OECD analysis-based on examining episodes of significant fiscal consolidation over the past two decades-found that an improved saving performance by government tended to result in a rise in national saving."" The more detailed findings of the OECD are as follows: ""Fiscal consolidation was usually reflected in higher national saving rates by the end of the episode, but the extent of the improvement was limited by a tendency for household saving rates to decline during the course of consolidation; fluctuations in business saving were more variable."" The IMF reports that: ""... the preponderance ofresearch suggests that while there is some tendency for private savers to compensate for changes in public sector saving, the offset is far from complete."" (2) Estimates of the extent to which private saving will compensate for changes to public saving flowing from each of the major revenue and outlays measures are not available. As noted in the response to Question No. 578, the effect on private saving of fiscal consolidation measures cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy because of the difficulty of separating out the effect of influences on private saving. However, as reported in the answer to the first part of the honourable member's question, empirical evidence based on studies by the IMF and OECD of developments in a number of countries and over time suggests that while there is a tendency for the private sector to compensate for changes in public saving, these offsets are not complete.

Disability Support Pension Recipients: Electoral Division of Bruce (Question No. 639) Mr Griffin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: (I) How many persons in the electoral division of Bruce receive a Disability Support Pension. (2) How many of those recipients will (a) lose their Disability Support Pension and be transferred to Newstart Allowance and (b) become ineligible for any form of income support provided by the Minister's department. (3) Which physical, intellectual and social disabilities may affect Disability Support Pension recipients who are being transferred to Newstart Allowance. (4) Is it a fact that a range of disabilities may cause disabled Newstart Allowance recipients to be late, not attend or appear disinterested or nongenuine, at either the CES or job interviews. (5) What mechanisms have been established to investigate allegations that a disabled Newstart Allowance recipient breached the conditions of receipt of the allowance. (6) What special considerations are given to a disabled Newstart Allowance recipient who is found, after investigation, to have breached the conditions of receipt of the allowance. (7) What rights of appeal will disabled Newstart Allowance recipients have if found, after investigation, to have breached the conditions of receipt of the allowance. (8) What mechanism has been established to waive any appeal costs for disabled Newstart Allowance recipients who consider that they have been treated unfairly. (9) What special considerations will be given to disabled Newstart Allowance recipients who are unable to work due to their disability. (10) How will those persons survive who lose their Disability Support Pension, become ineligible other for any form of income support provided by the Minister's department, are unable to work and cannot be supported by family. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) As at December 1995, it is estimated that there were approximately 2800 recipients of Disability Support Pension residing in the electoral division of Bruce (source: Recipients of Social Security Benefits in Commonwealth Electoral Divisions December 1995 Background Paper No 8 of 1995/96). (2) There are two measures from the 1996/97 Budget concerning medical eligibility for Disability Support Pension. These are the medical reviews of former recipients of Invalid Pension, and the introduction of the revised Impairment Tables. The estimates of the number of people affected by these measures are based on national, point-in-time data. When applied to small areas, the figures are potentially subject to a margin of error, and should be regarded as indicative only. The estimates provided for the electoral division of Bruce are based on DSS data and Background Paper No 8 [referred to at (1)]. (a) It is estimated that slightly more than 100 former recipients of Invalid Pension living in the electoral division of Bruce, will apply for another form of income support (usually Newstart Allowance) after their medical eligibility for Disability Support Pension is reviewed. With regard to the introduction of the revised Impairment Tables, it is estimated that less than 10 people claiming Disability Support Pension will be affected. (b) It is estimated that, following medical review, less than 20 Disability Support Pension recipients in the electorate of Bruce who formerly received Invalid Pension will be ineligible for any form of Social Security income support. With regard to the introduction of the revised Impairment Tables, it is expected that the number of Disability Support Pension claimants affected will be in single figures. (3) In accordance with long-standing criteria Disability Support Pension (DSP) recipients are required to transfer to Newstart Allowance only if they are found to have: an impairment rating of less than 20 per cent as assessed under the Impairment Tables, or no continuing inability to work. Customers who lose entitlement because of these decisions will have a range of physical, intellectual and psychological disabilities which have only a minor impact on their ability to work. For example, a customer may have a mild loss of respiratory function and a moderate loss of lower limb function but may be assessed as capable of performing sedentary work for at least 30 hours a week. (4) to (6) There has been no change to the provisions that govem these contingencies. Payment is not stopped unless the circumstances of the case have been fully investigated and all mitigating factors taken into account. In the case of a customer with a disability, specialist Departmental staff such as a Social Worker or Disability Support Officer may be involved. If an intellectual or other disability is the cause of the breach, it is unlikely that a penalty would be imposed. (7) Newstart customers with disabilities have the same appeal rights as other customers. They can ask for the decision to be reviewed by a Departmental Authorised Review Officer. If the customer is still not satisfied with the decision they can appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. If still dissatisfied, they can go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and finally, in some circumstances to the Federal Court. (8) Customers are not charged for appeals to an Authorised Review Officer, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Customers who wish to appeal to the Federal Court must be prepared to meet their own costs. The Court may allocate costs in accordance with its operating procedures. (9) A Newstart Allowance customer who becomes temporarily incapacitated for work due to illness or injury will maintain eligibility for the allowance and be exempt from satisfying the activity test for the period of the incapacity. (10) Only those customers who are assessed as having an impairment rating of less than 20 per cent or an ability to work or undertake training for at least 30 hours a week will lose eligibility for Disability Support Pension. Of these, most will be eligible for income support in the form of Newstart Allowance. A small minority will not be eligible for any Social Security payment on the grounds that the level of their income and/or assets precludes payment. In such cases, people are expected to use their private resources for self-support. If after a period of self-support, a former Disability Support Pensioner's income and/or assets falls to a level below the threshold amount for Newstart Allowance, he or she may claim that payment. People in financial hardship and unable to support themselves and their dependants for reasons beyond their control may be eligible for Special Benefit. This payment is only available to people who are not eligible for any other Social Security payment. This approach to assisting people with disabilities has been in place for many years and ensures targeting of payments to those in need. Consumers Federation of Australia (Question No. 647) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: (1) Did he undertake to address the consequences of the Budget decision to defund the Consumers' Federation of Australia; if so, what assistance will be provided to the approximately 150 independent consumer representatives on government, industry and Standards Australia committees to honour this commitment. (2) How will consumers from rural, regional and smaller States be given access to government, regulators and industry representatives in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. (3) Was the Consumers' Federation of Australia provided with funding in the Budget in order to ensure that staff in the secretariat received their pay and entitlements; if not, does he recommend that small business operators retrench their own staff in such a fashion.  member's question is as follows: (1) The Government will continue to facilitate the appointment of consumer representatives to relevant consultative and dispute resolution bodies. The Consumer's Federation of Australia (CFA), like all other consumer organisations, will continue to have the opportunity to nominate qualified people to fill these positions; in fact CFA has already submitted nominations for a vacant position. The Government's approach, using advertising as well as direct approaches to relevant organisations, will actually widen the pool of potential representatives. It should be noted that many consumer representatives on government bodies have been and are selected independently of advice from the CF A and these arrangements will not be affected by the Budget decision. (2) Consumers in rural and regional areas, and the smaller States, will continue to have access to government, regulators and industry representatives. This access was not conditional on the good offices of CFA and occurs, in virtually all cases, independently of CFA. CFA's main role in this respect was to provide nominations for consumer representative positions; as explained earlier in this answer, the access of people outside the major cities will, in fact, be enhanced by the Government's use of direct advertising for nominations. The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs has been directed to facilitate contact between Commonwealth agencies and consumer groups. The Bureau will consult widely with consumers on developing consumer issues and policies to ensure that the Government stays informed of consumer views. When needed, the Bureau will convene suitable fora on emerging consumer issues to bring together industry and consumer representatives. (3) Funding to the CFA ceased from 21 August 1996. The CFA has received Commonwealth funding for over 20 years and the grant has represented the major portion of the CFA's annual revenue. The CFA has been funded by previous governments on an annual basis, subject to review in the Budget. Future funding was not assured, either by this or previous governments. The CFA was responsible for its own staffing arrangementsthe Commonwealth's funding was for particular purposes, not specific positions. Like all employers, the CFA is directly responsible for making provision for staff salaries and entitlements. Mount Gravatt Sporting and Workers (Question No. 675) Mr Hardgrave asked the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 12 September 1996: (1) What processes were put in place for the acquittal of funds under the previous Government's Community, Cultural, Recreational and Sporting Facilities Program. (2) Has the acquittal of funds to all recipients been completed, including funds provided to the Mt Gravatt Sporting and Workers' Club. (3) Will he detail the purposes and items on which recipients have spent the funds, including the Mt Gravatt Sporting and Workers' Club. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) An acquittal strategy, consistent with the ANAO guidelines for best practice, comprising the following elements has been implemented by my Department. (a) Specific resources have been allocated. (b) A database of all outstanding acquittals was developed. (c) All recipients of unacquitted grants have: received at least 3 separate written advices of outstanding action required to acquit their grant; and (ii) been telephoned to followup written requests for information. (d) Where recipients of unacquitted grants over $20,000 have not responded, my Department arranged meetings with the organisation's officials. (2) No. As at 12 September 1996, 164 grants remained to be fully acquitted. Many of these, including the Mt Gravatt Sporting and Workers' Club, are partially acquitted. (3) To provide the information in the level of detail sought by the honourable member would require the diversion and expenditure of a high level of resources in my Portfolio as the Community Cultural, Recreation and Sporting Facilities Program provided grants for 1011 separate projects. I am not prepared to authorise any such diversion of resources. In the case of the Mt Gravatt Sporting and Workers' Club, $36,405 was claimed for architectural, survey and Council fees and $160,000 for payment to the primary building contractor for start up costs associated with stage one of the redevelopment of the Club's facilities. Inland Marketing Corporation: Parkes Airfreight Project (Question No. 691) Club Mr Andren asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 17 September 1996: (1) Did he state during the 1996 federal election campaign that he would match the Australian Labor Party's undertaking to complete the research work for the Inland Marketing Corporation's Parkes airfreight project; if so, when will financial support be forthcoming. (2) Will the Government provide ongoing support for the project. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) During the election campaign, as Leader of the National Party, I stated that a Coalition Government would match the Labor Government's commitment to a feasibility study regarding intemational air freight from the Parkes Airport. This commitment has been completely fulfilled and the feasibility study is currently being undertaken by the Joint Standing Committee on Transport, Communications, Infrastructure and Microeconomic Reform which is chaired by Mr Mark Vaile, Member for Lyne. The conclusions and recommendations of the Committee's findings will be forwarded to the responsible portfolio Minister, Hon John Sharp, (i) Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Obviously there will be no requirement on Australia's tax payers to separately fund this feasibility study as it is being undertaken by a Standing Committee of the Parliament. (2) Any ongoing support for the proposed Inland Marketing Corporation will depend on the reCOffimendations of the Committee and decisions taken by the responsible Minister, Hon John Sharp. Ministerial Overseas Visits (Question No. 732) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: Has the Treasurer undertaken any ministerial overseas visits; if so, (a) how many visits have been undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. (a) 3 visits. (b) and (c) March 1996-3 days-Japan. May 1996-7 days-France, Germany and the United Kingdom. September/October 1996-8 days-United States of America. Ministerial Overseas Visits (Question No. 747) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister assisting the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: Has the Minister undertaken any ministerial overseas visits; if so, (a) how many visits have been undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. (a) One visit. (b) and (c) April 1996-9 days-United States of America. Departmental Liaison Officer: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (Question No. 757) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: Further to the Minister's answer to question 350 (Hansard, 28 June 1996, page 3216), (a) when was a second Departmental Liaison Officer appointed to the Minister's office, as indicated in the September 1996 issue of the Parliament House Communications Directory and (b) why was the appointment made.",124
187,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question: (a) 19 August 1996 (b) To liaise between the Minister's office and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Ministerial Staff: Travel Payments (Question No. 760) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: (1) What provisions relate to travel payments to ministerial staff who reside in cities other than that of their Minister. (2) Have these provisions been altered since 2 March 1996. (3) Have ministerial staff had their airfares paid for travel to a residence in a city other than that of their Minister; if so, how many. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Ministerial staff are required to nominate their home base for the purposes of travel. When absent from the home base on official duty they are eligible for the payment of travelling allowance on the same terms and conditions which apply to staff of the equivalent level in the Australian Public Service. Generally, the place nominated as the home base is where the staff member expects to spend more of his or her time on official duty than anywhere else. Staff may nominate the Minister's city or town, the capital city of the state where the Minister's electorate is located or Canberra. In exceptional cases approval may be given for a home base in a place other than Canberra or the Minister's state capital city or place of residence. In these cases travelling allowance is not payable when the staff member travels on official duty to the Minister's electorate, the capital city of the state, or the actual place of residence. (2) Yes. Under the previous Government persons engaged under Part 11 of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act were able to nominate as their home base anywhere in Australia and were able to claim travelling allowance for time spent on official duty No. away from the home base, including in the Minister's electorate. Staff employed under Part III were subject to the same condition as set out in paragraphs one and two of answer (1) above. (3) Yes-most of whom are resident in Canberra. H.R. Nicholls Society (Question No. 763) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: (1) Are Mr E. A. Evans and Mr H. M. Morgan members of the Reserve Bank Board. (2) Is he able to say whether (a) Mr Evans is the chief economic adviser to the Government and (b) Mr Morgan is a member of the HR Nicholls Society; if so, does occupancy of those positions compromise the role these persons play in serving on the Reserve Bank Board. (3) Will he take action to ensure that executive salary increases remain within a 4 to 5% band; if so, (a) what action will he take and (b) will the action include use of the corporations power available to the Commonwealth. (4) What restrictions have members of the Government placed on their own commentary and speculation about future movements in official interest rates, in recognition of the independence the Reserve Bank. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) (a) Mr Evans is the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury. (b) I do not know. (3) The maintenance of low inflation requires that wage and salary increases reflect productivity improvements. Nominal increases in wages and salaries for any individual or at any individual enterprise need not conform to any particular band or level. The remuneration of executives is determined by individual companies. The Government regularly makes comment on the desirability of productivity based wage outcomes. (4) I refer the member to the statement on the conduct of monetary policy agreed upon by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and myself. Military Units: Holsworthy (Question No. 792)  Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 19 September 1996: (I) Which military units are located at Holsworthy, NSW. (2) What information is available on the (a) cost to (i) clear Holsworthy of unexploded ordnance and (ii) relocate military units from Holsworthy and (b) lead time required to relocate the units. (3) Will an environmental impact statement (EIS) be required to determine a new site for the units if they are relocated; if so, what is the estimated (a) cost of the EIS and (b) time required to complete it. (4) Has a study been commissioned to select a new site for military units relocated from Holsworthy. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The following Australian Defence Force units are located in the Holsworthy Military area: Headquarters I st Brigade I st Combat Engineer Regiment Element of 1st Brigade Administrative Support Battalion 1st Parachute Surgical Team 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, Holsworthy Detachment of 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment 4th Battalion, Royal Australian regiment 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian regiment 8th/12th Medium Regiment 10th Field Battery 17th Construction Squadron, Rear Party 35th Field Dental Unit 104th Signal Squadron IlOth Signal Squadron 145th Signal Squadron Base Administrative Support Centre-Liverpool School of Military Engineering Directorate of the Royal Australian Engineers 1st Field Hospital (under construction) Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre Joint Movement Control Organisation 2nd Military Police Company School of Military Police Directorate of Military Police Defence Force Correctional Establishment (2)(a)(i) The cost of clearing an area of the Holsworthy Reserve for the purposes of constructing and operating an airport is being assessed as part of the second Sydney airport environmental impact statement (EIS) process. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon John Sharp MP, has responsibility for this process. It is my understanding that this information is not yet available. (ii) The precise impact on Defence of an airport located at Holsworthy cannot be determined until more information is available on the proposed location of such an airport on Holsworthy Reserve, and on the associated flightpaths. When this information becomes available, Defence will be able to identify units which will have to be relocated, based on judgements about the extent to which existing Defence facilities would be noise-affected, the need for Defence units to access training areas, and the relationships between the units. At this stage, it is not possible to provide a soundly-based estimate of the cost of relocating military units from Holsworthy. (b) The lead-time required to relocate the units will be based on the number and type of units to be relocated, and the nature of the new location. These issues are being examined. (3)(a)&(b) Defence has not yet determined the location or locations to which units might be relocated. When this decision is made the requirement for an EIS will be considered. If an EIS is required, the cost and timing would vary depending on the site, the nature and extent of the facilities required, and the Defence activities which would be associated with the facilities. (4) No. (Question No. 811) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 15 October 1996: (1) Has the Government decided to limit the number of visas under subclass 100 (Spouse) for the 1996-97 program year; if so, (a) how many visas will be granted and (b) how many visas places will be allocated to each overseas immigration post. (2) If capping limits for visa subclass 100 have not been imposed, is it a fact that correspondence from the migration section of the Australian Embassy in Belgrade states that he has placed a limit on the number of visas to be granted in the 1996-97 program year; if so, why. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government has not placed a limit on the number of visas which can be granted in visa subclass 100. On 3 July 1996, I announced the Migration Program which included a notional planning level of 36,700 places in the Preferential Family Category. The spouse subclass is managed within that global figure. (2) Capping limits for visa subclass 100 have not been imposed. In the case of the Australian Embassy in Belgrade, two spouse applicants were incorrectly sent capping correspondence. The applicants have now been correctly advised of their situation. Migration Policy: Serbians (Question No. 812) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 15 October 1996: How will the migration policy of the government be applied to Serbians from the Krajina region who were displaced by Croatian forces in August 1995 and who have applied for entry into Australia as part of the humanitarian program under Special Assistance Category visa subclass 209. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 3 July 1996 I announced the Government's 1996-97 Humanitarian Program. The Program consists of a total of 12,000 offshore places and 2,000 onshore places. This includes the 2,000 offshore places already brought forward or borrowed from the Program by the former Government. The 2,000 places allocated onshore will Visa Limits provide for the estimated number of people granted permanent residence as a result of meeting the United Nations' refugee criteria in Australia. Should onshore grants exceed 2,000, the excess will be absorbed into the offshore program, so that humanitarian resettlement services can properly meet needs. The 10,000 new places are for 3,335 refugees, 2,133 persons who meet Special Humanitarian Program criteria and 4,532 who meet Assistance Category criteria. The Humanitarian Program is limited and reflects our international commitments and our ability to provide settlement services. Priority will continue to be given to the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Africa. Those priorities take close account of the needs for humanitarian resettlement identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and reflect the outcomes of my widespread community consultations in April 1996. The Special Assistance Category visa subclass 209 was introduced in 1991/92 to provide resettlement opportunities to persons from the former Yugoslavia who have been displaced by the fighting, who fear discrimination because of their ethnic or religious affiliation and who are unable to resume living in their normal home. They must also have a near relative who was an Australian citizen or permanent resident on 30 June 1993. Between 1991192 and 1995/96 some 14,300 people were resettled under this Special Assistance Category. In addition, a further 7,000 former Yugoslavs have been resettled under other categories of the Humanitarian Program. In 1996/97 I have allocated 1,622 places to this Special Assistance Category for applications processed at Australian missions in Belgrade, Vienna and Bonn. The post in Belgrade is now holding some 10,800 applications including substantial numbers from Krajina Serbs. However, it will not be able to process the vast majority of them this financial year. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has indicated that it does not see group resettlement in another country as the appropriate durable solution for the Krajina Serbs. It is giving priority to their repatriation or their local settlement in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. In line with UNHCR assessments and current political developments in the region, I have directed that among Serbs from the Krajina region who have applied for entry under the Special Assistance Category priority be given to persons of mixed marriages who cannot return to their former homes. Kurdish People: Humanitarian Program (Question No. 813) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 15 October 1996: Has he made provision within the humanitarian program for a worsening of the situation in northern Iraq resulting in an exodus of Kurdish people, many of whom would have family members living in Australia. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 3 July 1996 I announced the Government's 1996-97 Humanitarian Program. The Program consists of a total of 12,000 offshore places and 2,000 onshore places. This includes the 2,000 offshore places already brought forward or borrowed from the Program by the former Government. The 2,000 places allocated onshore will provide for the estimated number of people granted permanent residence as a result of meeting the United Nations' refugee criteria in Australia. Should onshore grants exceed 2,000, the excess will be absorbed into the offshore program, so that humanitarian resettlement services can properly meet needs. The 10,000 new places are for 3,335 refugees, 2,133 persons who meet Special Humanitarian Program criteria and 4,532 who meet Assistance Category criteria. The Humanitarian Program is limited and reflects our international commitments and our ability to provide settlement services. Priority will continue to be given to the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Africa. Those priorities take close account of the needs for humanitarian resettlement identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and reflect the outcomes of my widespread community consultations in April 1996. Within the 1996-97 Humanitarian Program the Government has allocated 2,313 places under the Refugee and Special Humanitarian Programs to the Middle East. The Government has the capacity to assist those in the region for whom resettlement is the appropriate durable solution. The program has assisted Iraqi Kurds in the past and there is provision in this year's program to again provide places where this is appropriate. I have recently visited a number of Middle Eastern countries and my Department monitors situations relevant to the Humanitarian Program. We also remain in close contact with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The UNHCR has not identified the recent exodus of Kurds as in need of third country resettlement. To date, the posts concerned with processing applications from Iraqi Kurds have not reported any increase in the application rate following the recent events in Northern Iraq. Unidentified Flying Objects: Reports (Question No. 836) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) How many reports of unidentified flying objects have been received by the Minister's Department and agencies under the Minister's control in each year since 1994. (2) Are the reports investigated; if so, (a) how and (b) by whom. (3) How many of the reports have not been explained by natural or human activity. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Defence Force (ADF) ceased recording and investigating sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) in December 1993. Members of the community seeking to make reports to the ADF are referred to a number of civilian UFO research organisations (presently these number 11, including two national organisations). I have provided the honourable member with a list of these organisations. (2) & (3) I am not aware of the subsequent handling of reports by the civilian UFO research organisations. Unidentified Flying Objects: Reports (Question No. 837) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) How many reports of unidentified flying objects have been received by the Minister's Department and agencies under the Minister's control in each year since 1994. (2) Are the reports investigated; if so, (a) how and (b) by whom. (3) How many of the reports have not been explained by natural or human activity. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Nil (2) Not applicable (3) Not applicable Native Title Act 1993: Australian War (Question No. 847) Mr Filing asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) Are Australian war memorials protected by existing native title legislation. (2) Will Australian war memorials be subject to native title claims under proposed legislation. (3) Will access to Australian war memorials be restricted or prohibited under proposed including those located in National Parks or on other Crown land.",137
188,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Given the diverse range of memorials across the country, it is not possible to state the position in relation to each memorial without knowing the particular circumstances of that memorial's establishment and its nature. However, speaking generally, if the memorial is located on land held under freehold or if it comprises a building or other permanent structure that is a public work, it will have extinguished native title. If it is on leasehold land, it will have extinguished native title, if not wholly, then to the extent of any inconsistency. (2) All Australian citizens have a right to bring their claims, of whatever nature, before a court. This does not mean, however, that claims will be successful in establishing that native title exists. While there is no legislative bar to a native title claim being made over a war memorial, such a claim is unlikely to be successful, for the reasons given in (1) above. There are also likely to be Memorials significant obstacles to any such claims being registered under the new registration test in the proposed amendments and therefore attracting the right to negotiate and other statutory benefits. (3) Access to Australian war memorials will not be restricted or prohibited under proposed legislation. Assuming that the question is referring to the restriction of access by the public, confirmation of public access and enjoyment of public places is provided by paragraph 212(2)(e) of the NTA which states that: ""A law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory may confirm any existing public access to and enjoyment of areas that were public places at the legislation, end of 31 December 1993."" All States and Territories have passed legislation to ensure such public access.",141
