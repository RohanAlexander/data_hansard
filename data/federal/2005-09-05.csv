2,Ms HALL,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the Russian Federation and the Italian Republic, 17 April to 1 May 2005. The delegation, led by the President of the Senate, Senator Calvert, with me as deputy leader, visited Russia from 17 to 24 April and Italy from 24 April to 1 May. Both countries are of significance to Australia-Russia particularly for geopolitical reasons, and Italy as a prominent member of the European Union and a source of considerable migration to Australia. The visit of a parliamentary delegation to Russia was perhaps overdue, given that an Australian delegation last visited the Soviet Union in 1990. It enabled the delegation to develop ties with the Russian parliament, gain a first-hand appreciation of current political and economic developments, and explore opportunities to increase trade and other relationships with Russia. The delegation's first official activity to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Kremlin Wall. Among others, the delegation met with the chairman of the upper house, the Federation Council, Mr Mironov; a deputy chairman of the lower house, the State Duma, Mr Zhirinovsky; the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Zhukov; and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Lavrov. The delegation arrived in Russia only a fortnight before Australia Week in Moscow. This was a major initiative by Austrade to promote trade and investment with Russia. The delegation took the opportunity to promote Australia Week in its discussions with Russian ministers and its parliamentary hosts. The delegation also met with a representative of RSL, a major Russian aluminium company which recently bought a 20 per cent stake in Queensland Alumina Ltd and intends to bid for a licence to develop the Arakuan bauxite deposits. It also met with the Russian representative of BHP Billiton, who discussed that company's plans for Russian investments. The first full day of the delegation's visit to Italy, 25 April, was ANZAC Day. Because Senator Calvert was in London to officiate in ANZAC Day observances there, I, as acting leader, and Senator Lightfoot were privileged to lead the delegation in the laying of a wreath at the Commonwealth War Cemetery in Rome on behalf of the Australian parliament. April 25 was a public holiday in Italy as it is Liberation Day, which commemorates the liberation of Italy by allied troops in the Second World War. The delegation's visit to Italy coincided with a crisis in the Italian government which resulted in the resignation of the Prime Minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, and the subsequent formation of a new government led by Mr Berlusconi. Under the Italian constitution, the new government is required to obwas tain a vote of confidence in both houses of parliament. The delegation was present in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, on 26 April when Mr Berlusconi presented his government and program prior to the vote of confidence being taken. It was quite a unique experience. The delegation was officially welcomed by the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Mr Casini, with whom it had earlier held discussions on a range of parliamentary matters. The delegation also held discussions with the President of the Senate, Senator Pera, and the chairs of a number of parliamentary committees. Of particular note was its meeting with the chair of the Anti-Mafia Commission, Senator Centaro, and a discussion of the work of the commission, which provided a fascinating insight into how the parliament can be involved in the fight against organised crime. The delegation was to have met with the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr Fini, but because of the resignation of the government this proved not to be practicable. For parts of its visit the delegation was personally hosted by the President of the Italy-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group, Mr Vincenzo Siniscalchi. Mr Siniscalchi was an excellent and personable host. He looked after us extremely well and ensured a successful and enjoyable visit. (Time expired) NA Migration Committee Report",19
3,Mr RANDALL,COMMITTEES,"Canning) (12.36 pm)On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the committee's report of the inspections of Baxter Immigration Detention Facility and the Port Augusta Residential Housing Project, April 2005. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",20
4,Mr RANDALL,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The migration committee's one-day inspection of the Baxter Immigration Detention Facility and the Port Augusta Residential Housing Project was conducted on 19 April 2005. Six of the 10 committee members participated in the visit. Apart from me, the others present were Mr Michael Keenan, Dr Andrew Southcott, Dr Carmen Lawrence, Senator Alan Eggleston and Senator Andrew Bartlett. The visit was timely, for Australia's immigration detention policies are currently subject of enormous public interest and indeed are at a critical stage. At Baxter, the committee was able to inspect the compounds where people reside, along with the educational, medical and recreational facilities and the visitors centre. The committee also briefly inspected the Residential Housing Project at Port Augusta where women and their children are accommodated. The committee found the inspection to be useful and informative. One aspect of the visit that the committee found particularly valuable was the opportunity to meet a group of detainees. The committee had a lengthy session with about 20 long-term detainees from very diverse backgrounds. The members of the committee were stunned by the number of young men held in detention. Personally I could not help thinking what a waste of life that was. These people could either be back in their own countries helping to rebuild those countries or be in Australia helping us. The detainees raised a number of concerns, including loss of dignity, depression, frustration at the system awaiting the results of appeals, and the perceived use of mental health care as a means of managing detainees rather than helping them. The clear message conveyed by detainees was that they did not seek more comfortable detention but sought release. For the committee, the major areas of concern emerging from the inspection were the length of detention, mental health issues in detention and the possibility of physical abuse. In particular the committee believes that detention contributes to high levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorthe der, self-harm and suicidal behaviour. On 14 July, the Palmer report on the investigation of the wrongful detention of mentally ill Australian resident Cornelia Rau became public. Mick Palmer's assessment of inadequate mental health treatment provided to immigration detainees has been highlighted recently in numerous submissions to the current Senate inquiry into mental health. The committee has an interest in the closer examination of mental health care services available to people in Australia's immigration detention centres-indeed, in the continued monitoring of the general conditions under which detainees are held. I might add as an update that I have a document which further examines the Baxter Immigration Detention Facility. It addresses three questions: whether amendments to the Migration Act or policy procedures have had any effect on the operations of the centre; whether the number of persons detained at the centre has changed since April; and what is the expected future use of the centre. Rather than read that out and rob others of time, I seek leave to table the document. Leave granted.",20
5,Dr LAWRENCE,COMMITTEES,"I was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration who visited Baxter. As the chair, the member for Canning, has indicated, we did hear complaints about the conditions, although it is true that most of the complaints were not about the conditions per se but were about people's wish to be released. Nonetheless, there were people who were concerned about the quality of food and living quarters-as they were, understandably, about their lack of freedom. But one complaint we certainly did hear related to mental health services-not surprisingly, given what we subsequently learned about the treatment of Cornelia Rau-and the fact that, in the perception of some, at least, the psychologists employed at Baxter were not trusted by the detaineesindeed, were perceived to be operating in the interests of management. One of the men that we talked to said that many detainees felt the counselling and the heavy prescription of medication were part of a strategy to manage and control the detainees rather than to treat them. It is worth having a quick look at the structure of the provision of the mental health services which have been so severely criticised. At the top there is the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the department, who are responsible to this parliament. GSL Pty Ltd is contracted by DIMIA to run the detention centres, and Davidson Trahaire Corpsych is in turn subcontracted by GSL to provide mental health care services at Baxter. Davidson Trahaire Corpsych is contractually responsible to GSL-and, by the way, it provides services to DIMIA employees as well, a clear conflict of interest, in my view-and is also subject to the supervision of professional bodies like the South Australian Psychological Board. GSL is contractually responsible to DIMIA, and DIMIA is responsible to the minister, who, at least theoretically, is responsible to this parliament and, through this parliament, the people of Australia. I want to come back to the actual complaints of detainees that we heard on the visit to the Baxter detention centre, because in my view they conform to a very worrying pattern-the same one detailed by Mr Mick Palmer in his report on the detention of Cornelia Rau. The pattern goes roughly like this. First there is evidence of a problem-in this case, the complaints we heard about mental health services, among other things. Then there is a flat denial, including initially by the minister, that there is any problem. The Palmer inquiry report also identified this pattern. Palmer reported that ‘the level of mental health care delivered at Baxter is inadequate by any standards' and that DIMIA was prey to a culture of assumption and denial. I would like to draw attention to another instance of this pattern which arose from our visit to the Baxter detention centre. On 26 April following that visit, I issued a media statement with credible information to the effect that unregistered psychologists were practising at the Baxter detention centre. I had checked their status through registration sources. On the same day, the acting minister for immigration, the member for Gippsland, issued a statement. I guess you could more accurately call it a denial-titled ‘Labor wrong on Baxter health care'. The minister went on to say: All people working as psychologists at immigration detention centre facilities are appropriately trained and registered with relevant agencies. The next day I received an inquiry from the Registrar of the South Australian Psychological Board, who confirmed that they were not indeed registered in South Australia. I was able to point him in the direction of affidavits filed in the Federal Court in South Australia by employees of Davidson Trahaire Corpsych that indicated that the two employees in question were employed as psychologists at Baxter and had described themselves as practising psychologists. I should say in passing that I did not receive an inquiry from the acting minister for immigration or his staff, or from anyone at DIMIA. It was only, apparently, the registrar in South Australia who was interested to know whether they were properly registered. In any case, on 24 June I received a letter from the registrar confirming that the psychologists in question were practising at Baxter while unregistered. This is not only the very definition of unprofessional conduct; it is in fact against the law in South Australia. Under the SA Psychological Practices Act 1973, it is an offence to practise as a psychologist or to assume the title ‘psychologist' without being registered. On 2 and 4 May respectively, the employees in question were duly registered-as they might be. That was within a week of the media statement. I issued, and within a week of the denial issued by DIMIA and the acting minister for immigration. They have never sought to correct the record. The important thing here is that these two psychologists were operating without proper registration. It may simply have been an oversight, but it shows that neither DIMIA nor GSL was aware of these problems, and initially neither was prepared to acknowledge that they needed to act. It was only after the psychologists registration board in South Australia took action that there was any change to the status of these people. The consequences could have been far more serious. Indeed, we have seen occasions where they have been. What it has shown to me is that, sadly, this culture of denial is still operating in the department and this government. That is something that needs to change. (Time expired)",21
6,Dr SOUTHCOTT,COMMITTEES,"Firstly, to put the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration into some sort of context: it is the policy of the government that unlawful non-citizens be detained and that is the policy of the opposition as well. It was introduced by the Labor government in 1992 by the then minister for immigration, Gerry Hand. It does not look like the government is going to change the policy. Detention works in an administrative way and in the main the stays involved are very short-less than a month, with the vast majority being less than three months, during which time people are processed and then return to the country where they have citizenship. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration does have a very important role in the oversight of the conduct of immigration policy, particularly in the management of detention facilities. The committee did go and visit the Baxter detention facility in April. What struck me then was the fact that both the DIMIA staff and the GSL staff were committed people who were trying to do their best. We have heard a bit about the Palmer inquiry, but that was confirmed by the Palmer  There is considerable evidence of highly committed DIMIA staff-particularly at Baxter Immigration Detention Facility ... He also went on to say at paragraph 4.2.4: The Inquiry found considerable evidence of dedicated GSL and DIMIA staff doing their best to achieve results of value in what, by any standards, is a very difficult environment. This issue came to the forefront when there were about 4,000 unlawful non-citizens entering Australia in 1999-2000 and in 2001. The numbers have fallen dramatically since then. The numbers have fallen dramatically in the last six months, in the time since we visited. There were 645 people in detention in early August. This is the lowest number since 1999. There have been improvements in the government's policy. The residential housing project, which we visited, allows families to live together and children to attend local schools, to participate in activities and so on. There have now been changes whereby further families have been released from the detention facilities. This is all good; this is welcome. The Palmer report did make a lot of very valuable recommendations. It is perhaps to be regretted that, in the space of half a day, the committee was able to have a reasonable look at the facilities but not able to go into the sort of detail that was gone into by the inquiry by Mick Palmer. But Mick Palmer did say, on the Baxter detention facility, which concurs with my own views: The Inquiry was saddened by attempts on the part of some external parties to demonise detention officers and Baxter staff. At no time during its visits to Baxter and its analysis of Baxter records did it find evidence of malicious or demeaning behaviour by detention officers or Baxter staff. It did, however, find many situations where processes and procedures should be improved. It also found considerable evidence of many people trying to do their job well in difficult circumstances. As I said, there are a lot of very good recommendations in the Palmer inquiry relating to food, to recreation and to the health services. We did meet with those in the health and medical centre and got an idea of the facilities that were available to the detainees. Again, the impression was of people trying to do their best. There was access to general practitioners Monday to Friday, access to a psychologist and the possibility of referral to a specialist psychiatrist. Unfortunately, a specialist psychiatrist only visited every six weeks. I commend the report to the House. It is an important part of the committee's oversight of immigration policy.

7,The SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for Canning wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,23
8,Mr RANDALL,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report.,23
9,The SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 39, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Corporations and Financial Services Committee",23
10,Ms BURKE,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the following reports, together with evidence received by the committee: Property investment advice: safe as houses? and Timeshare-the price of leisure. Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.",24
11,Ms BURKE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I recommend both these reports to the House and note that they are majority reports with no dissent. I commend the committee secretariat, who did an awful lot of work on two rather large reports that were taken on concurrently with several hearings across the state. To Anthony, Alex, Loes and Laurie I want to say a big thankyou. There was an awful lot of work that went into producing both these reports. I recommend both reports to the House and ask people to read them. I call upon the ernment to adopt the recommendations in these reports now and not let them sit in the cupboard gathering dust, because they are too important to the financial security of nation. The big question in both reports is: when is a financial product not a financial product and when is a financial service not a financial service? Most of us will know of Henry Kaye, who is discussed in the ‘property spruikers report'-I suppose that is the best way of describing it. Although Henry Kaye has gone out of the industry, there are still property spruikers out there who need to be regulated. Both this report and the timeshare report look at how we can create legislation to ensure that it covers all the various complexities of the financial industry. Labor pushed for an inquiry into property spruikers because of the surge in people beReport ing ripped off by property investors. We welcome the recommendations of this bipartisan report. Key recommendations include: giving responsibility for the regulation of property investment advice to the Commonwealth; implementing a regulatory scheme to protect investors; giving courts the power to order property spruikers in breach of the Trade Practices Act to issue refunds to consumers; and expanding and enhancing public awareness and financial education campaigns. Property spruikers have been able to get away with so much for so long because of a loophole: state governments are responsible for real estate, but the federal government is in charge of financial services. As investment agents rather than ordinary real estate agents are behind seminars pushing people to buy property, they do not fall into either jurisdiction. State governments are also powerless when operators sell property across state borders. The need for regulation was all too gov- evident when so many were caught up in Henry Kaye's promises of becoming a millionaire overnight. The need for individuals providing financial advice to be licensed unour der financial services regulation should stamp out these practices in the future. This was all too evident during the hearing when the Chair of the ACCC, Graeme Samuels said: In respect of Henry Kaye ... there was a period of time when this was a matter that we believedand I think ASIC believed-needed to be dealt with by ASIC because it involved financial services. This is the complexity of dealing with financial services on the one hand and nonfinancial services on the other hand. What we got Henry Kaye on, I have to say to you, was nothing at all to do with what occurred within his seminar door. It was the advertisement for the seminar that promised to make property millionaires out of those attending his seminars. We did not focus on what occurred within the seminar door because, as you got within the door, as I have said on previous occasions, it probably fell outside the diction of the ACCC and into the jurisdiction of ASIC. So we had this huge problem: who was in charge of regulating this industry? State, federal, ASIC, ACCC or the Real Estate Institute-who? Someone needed to be in charge because too many people were being ripped off. Labor have long called for industry regulation at a national level to crack down on property spruikers and we urge the government to promptly address these recommendations. With mounting pressure on individuals to provide for their own retirement and the increasing number of people finding themselves with superannuation payments to invest, there is a growing need to ensure that sound investment advice is easily accessible to all. The notion that because it is a house it is safe is something we need to demystify out in the community. Just because you buy bricks and mortar does not mean it is going to provide for your financial security in the future. The sad reality is that all the regulations in the world will not stop unscrupulous operators from preying on investors, which is why the committee has recommended that the government expand financial literacy programs to educate the public. Property buyers need to be aware of the risks and dangers of get-rich-quick schemes or any deal that seems too good to be true. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. In the short time available, I also want to refer to the timeshare inquiry. Sadly, in this inquiry we demonstrated why this industry needs regulation. We went onto the floor of one of the sale institutions and were confronted with: ‘Buy now! Buy this now or you will miss out on the deal.' This, again, is a vague industry where you are buying a financial product, but you are not buying a financial product; you are getting a title, but jurisyou are not getting a title; and you are getting a holiday, but you are not getting a holiday. People who have time share do enjoy their holidays but they need to know what they are going into. They need to know that they are not buying a holiday house; they are buying a leisure product that will devalue over time. It needs to have serious regulation, especially in the cooling-off area. (Time expired)",24
12,Mr BARTLETT,COMMITTEES,"I would like to make some brief comments about the two reports of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The first report is regarding the regulation of property investment advice. This inquiry arose out of a number of concerns regarding high-pressure selling techniques; the use of so-called ‘education seminars' to avoid regulation; the inadequate disclosure arrangements currently existing; and unrealistic expectations and unbalanced advice, especially regarding potential risks. The main aim of the committee was to create recommendations regarding a regulatory regime which takes reasonable steps to protect consumers from get-richquick scheme promotions that target the vulnerable but, at the same time, does not unduly constrain bona fide investment advisers or the legitimate work of others in the industry. Given the high level of home ownership and housing investment, and its economic importance in this country, this is an important area of investment advice. In general, the committee considered that the current regulatory regime is inadequate and needs to be strengthened. While real property transactions are under state regulation, property investment advice should be a Commonwealth responsibility. The simplest and most effective approach would be to include advice on real property investment under the existing FSR provisions in the Corporations Act. This would require anyone giving property investment advice to hold an Australian financial services licence. The key point of definition is that it is vice about the future-expected yields, expected rates of appreciation, expected returns and expected profits. This will necessarily mean that exemptions will apply to people quite appropriately involved in the property industry and advice pertaining to it. This will include, for instance, accountants properly giving advice in tax matters relating to property investment, lawyers advising on legal matters, valuers advising on current property values, and real estate agents providing advice on past trends and current market conditions. This is important because the aim of the recommended regulations is not to restrict the bona fide activities of these businesses, particularly as they are usually subjected to other regulatory regimes within their own industry. The recommendations regarding property spruikers are aimed at strengthening the role of the ACCC and the application of the Trade Practices Act to provide more protection for investors. Other recommendations refer to efforts to improve financial literacy amongst consumers to strengthen their own ability to detect and avoid unscrupulous dealers. The second report of this committee is on the inquiry into the regulation of the timeshare industry. The committee concluded that the Australian regulatory regime is, at least in its current form, commensurate with protection provided to consumers in most other countries. However, the treatment of time share as an investment product under the financial services regime does create some problems for the operators and seems to inhibit the development of a resale market, which is important for investors themselves. The committee recommends, amongst other things, that, firstly, time share continue to be regulated under the Corporations Act, but under a separate chapter specifically dealing with timeshare issues; secondly, the adACCC be given a watching brief on the level of concentration in the market; and, thirdly and perhaps most importantly, a number of measures be introduced to reduce pressureselling, which does unfortunately occur in this industry. Those recommendations, for instance, would include full refunds for customers if they can show their decision was procured by threat or intimidation or excess pressure; clearer definitions regarding what constitutes pressure-selling; training for sales personnel to avoid pressure-selling techniques; and mandatory cooling-off periods. In addition to these recommendations, other recommendations include improved disclosure requirements prior to contract formulation, and the introduction of antihawking provisions. These changes should enhance investor protection and concurrently assist the industry to improve its reputation both domestically and internationally and therefore better meet the needs of purchasers of timeshare arrangements. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat for all their work in these inquiries and in the development of these two reports.",25
13,Mr BOWEN,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to speak on the presentation of these two very important reports by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services-Property investment advice: safe as houses? and Timeshare: the price of leisure. I join with other speakers in thanking the secretariat, ably led by Dr Anthony Marinac, for its excellent research and support. I will firstly deal with the property investment advice report. This is a vitally important area. We are all aware of a number of cases of property investment advice charlatans who have ripped off innocent consumers. Perhaps the most recent is Mr Kovelan Bangaru, who has received some publicity in recent weeks. It is incongruous that we have the situation that people giving advice on almost every asset class in this country come under federal government regulation, except for those providing advice on property. People giving advice on shares, bonds, superannuation and even, as I will address shortly, share have been covered by financial services regulation and come under the supervision of an appropriate federal agency-but not, up until now, property. The key recommendations of this report include: giving responsibility for the regulation of property investment advice to the Commonwealth; the implementation of a regulatory scheme to protect investors; giving courts the power to order property spruikers in breach of the Trade Practices Act to issue refunds to consumers; and the expansion and enhancement of public awareness and financial education campaigns. These matters are always a matter of balance. We need to balance the protection of consumers with the risk of over-regulating good, reputable advisors in the property industry. I think policy makers sometimes err on the side of over-regulation. However, this is to me an open-and-shut case, where the need for more regulation has been clearly identified. I call on the Commonwealth government to implement this committee's unanimous recommendation-it is supported by the government, the opposition and the Democrat member of the committee. I now turn to the committee's report on time share. I do not mind admitting that before this inquiry I knew very little about timeshare industry, and it has been a very educative experience. Time share is an industry which once again has received bad publicity from time to time, much of it warranted. This is one area where, however, we have in the past got the balance between protection and regulation wrong. This is an area where we unquestionably need consumer protection, but the method of the protection that has been put in place has led to unintended consequences and some, quite frankly, silly results. Time share is regulated under the Corporations Act as a managed time investment. However, time share is, under most definitions, not an investment. It is effectively impossible to buy a time share and make money. That is not why people buy them. The committee unanimously recommends that time share continue to be regulated under the Corporations Act but that a separate chapter be inserted into the Corporations Act to specifically deal with time share. This will result in some of the disingenuous regulatory outcomes we see in the timeshare industry at the moment disappearing. For example, at the moment, timeshare sales personnel must undergo training in managed investment products to tier 1 level, the more onerous level of training required. But timeshare personnel should not refer to time share as an investment, as clearly it is not. As one of the witnesses to the inquiry said, we train people to a high degree in managed investments and then tell them to forget everything they have learned. The committee has no problem with requiring a high degree of training, but it is ridiculous to require training in managed investments that have absolutely no relevance to or bearing on time share. This is an example of the type of inconsistent result we get under the current regulation regime. The recommendations of the committee strike a sensible balance be the tween the need for consumer protection and the need not to shackle the industry with irrelevant over-regulation. I commend both reports to the House.",26

17,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, I present the committee's supplementary report on the trafficking of women for sexual servitude, together with evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",28
18,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission has a statutory responsibility to examine and report on trends and changes in the method and practice of criminal activities. In 2003, the committee conducted an inquiry into the commission's involvement in assessing trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual servitude in Australia. At about the same time the committee commenced its inquiry, the government announced its national action plan to combat trafficking in women. The plan included a legislative review as well as policy initiatives funded by an allocation of $20 million to the key agencies involved. These agencies included the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Attorney General's Department, AusAID and a range of state agencies. In its report of 24 June 2004 the committee made nine recommendations. Broadly, these included that the Australian Crime Commission investigation should focus on the methods people traffickers use to perpetrate visa fraud; that the interdepartmental committee established to implement the national action plan be formalised; that the legislative review and assessment of adequacy of provisions dealing with recruitment, transportation and transfer of trafficked women be finalised speedily; that the measReport ures needed to ensure Australia's compliance with the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children be assessed and implemented; that benefits payable to women under the victim support scheme be reassessed urgently; that all trafficked women accepted onto the victim support program or receiving criminal justice stay visas be exempt from compulsory return to their country of origin; and that the government review current visa provisions and include changes to provide for a ministerial discretion to allow witnesses to return to their country of origin for short periods for contact with their families. The committee decided to revisit the issues to assess progress made in relation to the implementation of its recommendations. On 23 June 2005 the committee invited officers of key agencies to participate in a round-table discussion. The committee found significant progress had been made in creating a more effective and equitable response to the trade into Australia of women for the sex industry. Many of the issues over which the committee had expressed concern had been addressed by the package of legislation passed by the parliament on 21 June 2005 and assented to on 6 July 2005. However, the committee would like a review of the new legislation and its administration to take place a year after implementation. In particular, the committee wants a review of the amendments to enable victim statements specific to those offences to be implemented. The intelligence gathered by the ACC shows the problem of trafficking in women is significant. The committee is pleased to note that a recent ACC board determination ensures the continued active involvement of the commission in intelligence gathering in this area. That is particularly important given what the ACC has advised regarding the potential involvement of organised crime in trafficking. Nonetheless, despite significant improvements, a number of areas remain of interest. Firstly, there is no automatic removal of a person's compulsory return to their country of origin. This is an issue that needs to subject of continued oversight. Secondly, there are significant differences in reported numbers of persons involved in trafficking and sex crime areas. Thirdly, the community awareness strategy that was intended to be implemented has been very slow in its implementation. A sum of $400,000 was to be spent on the community awareness strategy to combat sex trafficking, but government consultant Open Mind are finding it difficult to get appointments with the targets of the advertising-the sex industry workers and their clients. Stage 1, which is to determine the focus of the strategy and identify target audiences and to develop key messages, is still where the campaign is at. A task as obviously important as developing key messages has now dragged on for nearly two years.",28
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! Could the honourable member for Denison wind up?,29
20,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"I will do so. The last point I will make is that important advances have been recognised in our report. I commend it to the House. We want an audit by the ANAO of the community action plan after three years of operation, to ensure that the announced initiatives are implemented. (Time expired) ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee Report",29
21,Mr MCARTHUR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the listing of four terrorist organisations. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",29
22,Mr MCARTHUR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I present the fifth report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD under be the section 102.1A of the Criminal Code Act 1995. In this report the committee reviewed the relistings of four proscribed terrorist organisations, namely the Hezbollah External Security Organisation, the Hamas Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Except for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which was proscribed under the Criminal Code in 2004, these organisations were initially listed as terrorist organisations by way of specific legislation in 2003. Subsection 102.1(3) of the code provides that these regulations cease to have effect after two years. However, section 102.1A states that the committee may review relistings and report its findings and recommendations to the parliament. The Attorney-General advised the committee that he was seeking early relistings for these organisations to ensure all regulations would begin and sunset at the same time. The committee saw no problem with this and welcomed the Attorney General's decision. As in previous reports, the committee reviewed both the procedures and the merits of the listings. There is some minor comment on broader issues relating to the proscribing power, but this is a matter that the committee will examine in detail in 2007. As with previous reviews, the committee took evidence from the Attorney-General's Department, ASIO and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The consultation process with the states and territories continues to be rather cursory. However, only the Australian Capital Territory responded to the committee on these listings, and they appear to seek additional notice of listings. The request made during the last review by the premiers of New South Wales and Western Australia that notification of a listing should be made between the Prime Minister and the premiers, in accordance with the Inter-governmental Agreement on Counter-Terrorism Laws, was not yet resolved. Nevertheless, consultation on these relistings occurred between the attorneys-general. There appears to have been little change in the input from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade into the government's listing process. The committee would appreciate more information on the strategic circumstances in which the proscribed organisations operate and the foreign policy implications, if any, of the listings and any information relating to Australia's obligations to the United Nations on particular organisations. In its report Review of the listing of six terrorist organisations, the committee recommended that the Attorney-General's Department hold community consultations on listings. The committee notes that such consultations were not conducted on these relistings but urges the department to consider this recommendation in future reviews. On the merits of the particular listings, the committee notes that three of the organisations-the Hamas brigades, Hezbollah's external security organisation and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad-have no known links to Australia. The committee recognises that this is not a legislative requirement under the act, but it could be an issue if the legislation is to be given effect in practice. Therefore, in future listings, the committee would like to receive more information on how these organisations' activities affect or could affect Australia. Nevertheless, the committee agrees that, in the broadest sense, all these organisations are preparing, planning and fostering the commission of terrorist acts and, therefore, should be proscribed. A final recommendation in this report requests that ASIO address each of its own selection criteria in future statements of reason, particularly for new listings. The committee thanks all those who provided submissions for these reviews and it hopes that there will continue to be constructive debate on the listings process. The committee does not recommend to the parliament that any of these regulations be disallowed. I commend the report to the House.",29
23,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"In view of the time, I will be short. I concur with the recommendations of the committee, particularly with respect to not recommending disallowance and to the request that in all future statements of reasons, particularly for new listings, ASIO and the Attorney-General's Department specifically address each of the six criteria identified by ASIO as its criteria in its process of selecting entities for proscription under the Criminal Code. This is particularly significant, in my view, in relation to what arises in these particular reports. As has been referred to already in speeches in this House, the Attorney General's statement of reasons advances no suggestion that there are current links to tralia-other than some general sympathy for rejectionist objectives-by the relevant sections of Hezbollah, Hamas or the PIJ. It concluded that neither Hamas nor the PIJ has ever conducted terrorist operations outside the Middle East or targeted Australian or Western interests. The statement of reasons stated that, although Hezbollah has a history of targeting Israeli or Jewish targets outside the Middle East, that organisation has not engaged in such attacks for over 10 years. I therefore noted in the report that, while falling within section 102 of the Criminal Code, in the cases of Izz al-Din al Qassam brigades, Hamas, the ESO, Hezbollah and the PIJ, of the six criteria applied by ASIO and adopted by the committee to discriminate between those organisations which warrant listing and those which do not at least twothose relating to links to Australia and threats to Australian interests-were not met. I believe that the committee has again pointed to the importance of those criteria. Obviously, in a matter of relisting organisations that were listed by the parliament as a whole by special legislation, there is a proper concern that, in the absence of any change in circumstances, the case for continued listing needs to be carefully addressed. I accept that the security organisations, ASIO in particular, put the case for listing essentially as being a preventative measure. How we address such arguments is a matter that needs more exploration. The committee has acknowledged in its report that, in its full review of these proscription powers, it will be taking evidence and assessing how relistings and listings should operate. Obviously, that will be an important part of the work of the committee in the next year of its service. Whilst I join with the committee in its conclusions, I do so more or less, as I have said, as a precautionary measure, not wishing Aus- to challenge the basis that ASIO has asserted-that there is an appropriate case for caution in this regard. But I do think that there are legitimate questions that will need to be addressed in a more substantive way when we come to reviewing these provisions. Might I also say that, because there are no asserted links to Australia, it does limit the civil liberties impact of the listings, which might be more serious in other circumstances. I conclude my remarks by indicating that the committee treats these issues very seriously. It will need to look at the way in which the listing criteria are addressed. In my own particular view, there is considerable force in the suggestion that, in the interests of transparency and effective administration, we must pay close attention to those criteria so that we do not obtain inconsistent results in this area that so profoundly affects the civil liberties and security interests of all Australians.",30

Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",32
28,Mr SECKER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I have pleasure in presenting the committee's first report for 2005. Its full title is Antarctica: Australia's pristine frontier-report on the adequacy of funding for Australia's Antarctic program. I am pleased to advise the House that this is a unanimous report, with some additional comments. The work for this report was undertaken as part of a general monitoring of Australia's external territories by the committee and was based on a review of the annual reports of the Department of the Environment and Heritage. At the outset of the review, the committee sought a briefing from the Australian Antarctic Division, as the lead agency for Australia's Antarctic program. That briefing provided a fascinating insight into the positive nature and scale of the work being carried out by the Australian researchers in the Antarctic region. From that briefing it became clear that the critical issue confronting tralia's Antarctic program was whether the Antarctic Division was receiving adequate funding to achieve the government's stated goals for the Antarctica. The issue of the adequacy of funding for Australia's Antarctic program therefore became the focal point of the committee's inquiry. The inquiry lapsed with the dissolution of the 40th Parliament but was recommenced by the new committee in the 41st Parliament. Report The government's goals for advancing the nation's interests in the Antarctic reflect Australia's status as a major player in Antarctic affairs. The goals are: to maintain the Antarctic treaty system and to enhance Australia's influence within the system; to protect the Antarctic environment; to understand the role of Antarctica in the global climate system; and to undertake scientific work of practical, economic and national significance. Meeting these goals and consolidating Australia's leading reputation in Antarctica require substantial financial support. Operating in such an unpredictable, hostile environment is an expensive exercise, but continuing participation is critical if Australia is to preserve its sovereignty over its Australian Antarctic Territory. During the inquiry, the committee heard of the fundamental need to establish an intercontinental air link between Tasmania and the Australian Antarctic Territory. It was suggested than an air link would attract a wider spectrum of researchers to the continent. Currently, researchers are largely reliant on the research and resupply vessel Aurora Australis, which means that a significant amount of scientists' time is spent at sea. Obviously the committee was pleased to learn of the commitment in the 2005-06 budget to fund an intercontinental air link from Hobart to Antarctica. The air link will complement the air service between AustraAus- lia's bases on the continent, which became operational last summer, and will bring Australia into line with other major stakeholders in the Antarctic that already have air transport capacity. However, in the committee's view, the introduction of the air link does not diminish the need for additional funding to be invested in Australia's Antarctic program. In spite of a generally static budget, the Australian Antarctic Division has continued to develop new initiatives by implementing a range of innovative cost-saving measures, yet the evidence the committee received at its inquiry suggested that the division has now exhausted all avenues for creating meaningful savings. Australia's contribution to Antarctic science is considered world leading by scientific peers, and the committee believes that the efforts of our researchers should receive greater domestic recognition, particularly given that much of the science being undertaken has implications for the region, as well as global relevance. In closing, I would like to express, on behalf of the committee, our gratitude to all those who participated in the inquiry and to the staff of the secretariat. I thank my committee colleagues for their support throughout the course of the inquiry. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.",32

32,Mr KATTER,FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS,"The Fuel Quality Standards (Renewable Content of Motor Vehicle Fuel) Amendment Bill 2005 is a mirror of the bill which was moved by way of amendment to the President's Energy Policy Act by the United States Senate. It was overwhelmingly passed on bipartisan lines. The amendment was rejected by the Congress initially but last month was passed into law by President Bush as the Energy Policy Act 2005-HR6. The act commences: An Act. To ensure jobs for our future with secure, affordable, and reliable energy. The United States has already capped emergency reserves of oil and now will have a further five to 10 per cent of the nation's requirements provided from within the United States itself. Within five years, Australia, in recent years arguably self-sufficient in oil, will move to a situation where it will have a dwindling resource of less than 50 per cent self-sufficiency. The US is already on around three per cent ethanol, not through self-sufficiency legislation but through health legislation. I make reference to the United States bill, which I have in my hand. On the health issue as far as the United States is concerned, the first reference I make here is from the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most distinguished medical journal in the world. On page 1137 of the 6 March 2002 edition is a graph which indicates that, when there is an increase of small particles in the atmosphere-pollution, if you like-there is a doubling of lung cancer mortality. I will seek leave to table that document at the end of my speech. New Scientist magazine, one of the most distinguished science magazines in the world, makes reference to exactly the same report and gives it further credibility and authenticity, not that that is needed. The leading spokesman about and expert on atmospheric research in Australia, Dr Tom Beer from CSIRO, is quoted as saying at the air pollution conference last year: Mortality due to air pollution in Australia is higher than the road toll. I make similar reference to a statement by Professor Kearney at the University of Sydney, where he says that more people are dying from motor vehicle emissions than from motor vehicle accidents. I further make reference to the Congressional Research Service paper on ethanol and renewable fuels in the United States. Using oxygenates, vehicle emissions of volatile organic compounds have been reduced by 17 per cent and toxic emissions have been reduced by approximately 30 per cent. So, apart from the issue of the fine particles that cause lung cancer, there is the entirely separate issue of the volatile organic compounds and toxic emissions which desperately need to be reduced as well. For those people in this place who say that you cannot make ethanol mandatory, let me say that we already have. We made it mandatory that lead be taken out. Now it is necessary, for exactly the same reasons-health reasons-to make it mandatory that ethanol be put in for at least 10 per cent of that fuel. A very large percentage of the petrol that we put in our tanks in Australia consists of aromatics, which are in the main very poisonous-benzine being the worse-and the government has moved to reduce that percentage slightly. From the point of view of people who live in our big cities such as Sydney and Melbourne we need to act upon this to save lives. I must also mention one of the industries that I represent. I represent 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the sugar industry. The United States contested Brazil in the WTO, and Brazil admitted that $US1,000 million was paid in help and benefit to their sugar industry. We would hope to secure a similar benefit in Australia. That would rescue an industry now on its knees. I further indicate that Minnesota has been on ethanol for 10 years. If we compare the price of petrol in Minnesota and the price in its neighbouring states, which are not on ethanol, the Minnesota price is actually lower. I make the point to the House that the reason this is the case is that there is no tax charge. Of course, the government makes money on producing the product, so it is revenue neutral as far as the government is concerned. Bill read a first time.",33

34,Mr ALBANESE,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Grayndler) (1.32 pm)Climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing the global community and one of the greatest threats to Australia's way of life. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have significantly contributed to a rise in global average temperatures of 0.6 degrees over the past century. The international consensus is that this trend will lead to a rise in global temperature of between two and six degrees over the next century. This will be devastating for much of the world. A recent Australian government report, Climate change risk and vulnerability, suggests Australia could face the following risks from climate change: an increase in annual national average temperatures of between 0.4 and two degrees by 2030 and of between one and six degrees by 2070; more heatwaves and fewer frosts; more frequent El Nino southern oscillation events; reductions in average rainfall and run-off in southern and much of eastern Australia, with rainfall increases across much of the tropical north; as much as a 20 per cent reduction in rainfall south-west Australia and up to a 20 per cent reduction in run-off in the Murray-Darling Basin by 2030; more severe wind speeds in cyclones, associated with storm surges being progressively amplified by rising sea levels; an increase in severe weather events such as storms and bushfires; and a change in ocean currents, possibly affecting our coastal waters, towards 2070. These are profound risks which demand urgent action. It is important that a suite measures is adopted by the Australian government to tackle climate change. These measures should include ratifying the Kyoto protocol, establishing a national emissions trading scheme, adopting an ambitious renewable energy target and establishing a climate change trigger in federal environmental legislation. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act provides a framework for environmental protection for any actions that are likely to have an impact on matters of national environmental significance. Seven matters of national environmental significance-World Heritage properties; National Heritage places; Ramsar wetlands of international importance; nationally threatened species and ecological communities; migratory species; nuclear actions, including uranium mining; and the Commonwealth marine environment-are currently provided protection under the EPBC Act. The glaring gap in matters of national vironmental significance is climate change. This bill closes that gap. The climate change trigger will enable major new projects to be assessed for their climate change impact as part of any environmental assessment process and will ensure that new developments represent best practice. The climate change trigger will apply to the establishment of any industrial plant or other facility which emits, in or is likely to emit, more than 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent per year; or any other action, series of actions, or policies which will leador are likely to lead-to the emission of more than 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Any such action will require ministerial approval, unless the Minister for the Environment and Heritage decides that the action is not controlled under the act. If the action is apof proved, the minister can, under the act, attach conditions to the approval, such as the need to mitigate its greenhouse emissions. The Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Climate Change Trigger) Bill 2005 provides that the minister must consider whether the direct or indirect emissions of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent that are likely to result from the action will be minimised by the use of best practice environmental management and low emissions technology. This provides some substance to the government's commitments under the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. According to its vision statement, the partnership will: ... collaborate to promote and create an enabling environment for the development, diffusion, deployment and transfer of existing and emerging cost-effective, cleaner technologies and practices, through concrete and substantial cooperation so as to achieve practical results. Given that, the Howard government should support this bill. We know that the Howard en- government has been considering and procrastinating on a climate change trigger since 1999. In May 1999, the Prime Minister committed to a consultation process regarding a climate change trigger. A consultation paper was released in December 1999, and a draft regulation and model trigger was released in November 2000 for public consultation. We understand that a specific proposal for a climate change trigger has been with the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage since 2001. It is time to act. It is time for procrastinabrought tion to end. The tragic events in New Orleans and in other southern states in the United States of America highlight exactly what can be expected from the impact of climate change. We cannot any longer afford to be complacent on this issue. We need action and one of the actions that we need, which has been acknowledged by the government for many years, is this amendment to the EPBC Act. We urge the government to support this private member's bill. I present the explanatory memorandum to the House. Bill read a first time.",34
35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"In accordance with standing order 41, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PARLIAMENTARY (JUDICIAL MISBEHAVIOUR OR INCAPACITY) COMMISSION BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Kerr.",36
36,Mr KERR,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"The Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill 2005 gives parliamentarians from all parties an opportunity to support the establishment of a formal, fair and transparent mechanism to permit the testing of allegations of misbehaviour or incapacity that may be levelled against federal justices. The reason I put forward this measure flows from 18 years of experience in this House, the beginning of which was coloured by the then aftermath of the controversy that engulfed former High Court Justice Lionel Murphy and the sensitivities that that matter generated, and more recent events, particularly the allegations that were made in the Senate by Senator Heffernan against Mr Justice Kirby in 2002. Whilst those extraordinary and ill-founded allegations were quickly disproved, it home to me that we need a process which is well known, predictable and rule based to resolve issues of alleged incapacity or misbehaviour because, although those matters were capable of disproof, it reminded me that there were going to be circumstances where matters might be much less clear cut. Following the instances where this parliament struggled with how to deal with those allegations against Mr Justice Murphy, we still have in place no effective means of addressing those concerns. This parliament therefore needs to set ground rules for how it goes about exercising its powers under section 72 of the Constitution. To protect the independence of the judiciary, judges are appointed under section 72 until retirement age and can only be removed from office by an address praying for the removal of the justice passed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate in separate proceedings in the same session of the parliament. But we have not a mechanism present before us as to how those matters should be dealt with. This bill proposes the creation of an independent commissiona Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission-to assist the House in carrying out its duties under section 72 of the Constitution: the duty to scrutinise allegations which may be made against a federal justice, to review the evidence and to report back to the parliament before this parliament undertakes its high constitutional responsibilities. I want to make it plain that I regard the importance of judicial independence as a paramount responsibility for this parliament to protect. There is far too ready resort to criticism of judges. But whilst too ready resort to criticism is properly to be deplored, too great a caution, too much nicety in approach by the parliament, can also be damaging if there are serious matters that it should address. If this parliament fails in its constitutional responsibility as the ultimate guardian of the probity of the judicial system and does nothing when plainly it ought to, then whilst controversy may be avoided for a while the cost of leaving a justice on the bench when the facts warrant their removal will, when exposed, result in a much greater loss of public confidence. The Constitution gives it to no body other than this parliament to make those judgments. So we must put in place a fair means of dealing with these matters, and the only fair way is to do it in an up-front, transparent way-a rules based way-which respects judicial independence, which prevents the making of frivolous or ill-based allegations, which requires a member of parliament to make a proper case for it to be triggered, and which also contains protections that protect the rights of a justice whose conduct is said to fall short of the measure. Sooner or later parliament will be faced with a serious allegation that it must address. In the heat of the political moment, judgments are likely to err. There are now almost 150 federal justices in the High Court, Federal Court, Family Court and Federal Magistrates Courts appointed to hold office until retirement, subject to section 72 of the Constitution. Because this matter is so complex and because the basis of the various provisions of the bill are detailed, I seek leave to table a background paper I presented at the 2005 Australian Institute of Administrative Law administrative law forum in Canberra earlier this year on 30 June, titled ‘The removal of federal justices', and an outline of the standing orders that are proposed to give effect to the protection of the interests of members and at the same time ensure that these issues are dealt with fairly in the spirit of the legislation that I am proposing.

40,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to raise a very important issuethat is, the government's agenda in relation to media ownership laws in Australia. I noticed yesterday that on Meet the Press Paul Bongiorno asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, this question: Minister, just on media, won't the changes that you outlined on Wednesday lead to Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer being able to keep the assets they have now and extend their influence in Australia? Senator Coonan replied: I think the point I want to make, Paul, about that is that what I have flagged is a series of ideas. And she went on and on with a lot of sophistry. This is a very serious issue. It is quite clear that the government is not running this; our two biggest media companies are running the agenda. There is nothing more vital in a healthy democracy than to have a fair dinkum media scrutinising what we do here in parliament and reporting both sides of the argument to the people of Australia. But it is clear from Senator Coonan's speech in the Press Club last week that the government is going to allow a newspaper proprietor to own television, newspapers and radio stations, as well as to have monopoly pay television and to get into the internet-and that is a very serious threat to the public interest and the future of our democracy.

Lynne is coming to Canberra next week as part of a disabilities services conference for families with children with developmental disabilities. She is going to meet the minister with responsibility for disability services in this parliament. I wish her well, and I am sure it will do Lynne-and the other mums from what is called the Unique Mothers Group, who also have children with autism-a great deal of good. While I am talking about autism, I also want to highlight in my electorate a Mrs Denise Crouch, who has written a magnificent book, which I have here, called Patience, Love and Autism. She is a teachers' aide working at Armadale Senior High School. She has worked with young autistic boys and has been able to help them to get through to year 12, where they have gone on either to tertiary education or to get good jobs. I recommend this book written by Denise Crouch because it is about her personal experience, with which she has been able to help other people going through the same trials, the same challenges, with disabilities.

42,Mr KERR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I will add a few short remarks to the speech I made in relation to the Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill 2005, which I just presented. This is an unusual legislative initiative, in that it has been presented-specifically and deliberately-without the support of the parliamentary party of which I am a member. I have sought permission to table the legislation and to bring it before the House, but the initiative I am seeking to undertake is one designed as far as possible to get bipartisan or multipartisan support. We need to address the issue of how to put a fair process in place that can address the possible crisis that might emerge if allegations were made against a federal justice, in a way which avoids partisan controversy. From the outset, I have kept the Attorney-General and the shadow Attorney General advised, and I have sent copies of the paper, legislation and background materials to the leaders of the major parties. Senator Kirk will be proposing mirror, or similar, legislation to address in the Senate the very issue that I have addressed in the House. This is an issue that ultimately cannot be avoided by this parliament. We will either address it at a time when we are able to do so in a calm and reflective way or address it at a time of crisis. It is far better for us to do it in a calm and reflective way, where we can gain multiparty support, and to have all members of parliament address this as individuals with a constitutional responsibility as the ultimate protectors of the independence- (Time expired) Mr Jeremy MCClure",38

Jeremy was declared legally blind in June 2002, when he was 15, due to a genetic disorder. It affects the optic nerve, and it has left him with only a tiny amount of peripheral vision. This condition, from onset to Jeremy only having two per cent vision, took a period of only eight weeks to develop. Yet this young man has come out with an incredibly positive view of life. He has gone on to achieve incredible things in his sporting endeavours. He is the current captain of Melville Swimming Club. In 2003, he represented Australia in the ParaPan American Games, and he won five gold medals and one silver medal. In 2004, Jeremy set an Australian record for the 50-metre and 100-metre backstroke. He was selected to compete in Athens in the 100-metre backstroke, 400-metre freestyle and 100-metre breaststroke. In his disability category of S12, he is the current holder of Australian age and open records for the 50and 100-metre backstroke events and holds the world record for the 50-metre backstroke.

Father Neil has handed over the reins to his son Stephen who now manages the business, whilst Stephen's wife Kerri, his father Neil, his mother Colleen and his sister Sharon all work in the newsagency. It was an experience that I found most overwhelming: the number of people who came into that newsagency not only to conduct transactions but to speak to the owners, the support that they give that community, the way they communicate with the people who live in Toukley, and the way they look after their needs and their interests.

I regret that this is the first opportunity I have had to bring his passing to the attention of the House, but it should not go without mention. Father Ted Kennedy was born in 1931 and was a prominent Catholic priest in Sydney. He grew up in a house in my electorate, on the corner of Marrickville Road and Livingstone Road. He was very much a product of Vatican II. In November 1971 he, John Butcher and Fergus Breslan set up a new communal ministry in the Redfern Presbytery. They worked with the Indigenous community at the Block in Redfern and in particular with Mum Shirl, who died in 1998 and to whom I paid tribute in this House at the time. In an obituary in the Sydney Morning Herald, Father Edmond Campion stated: Kennedy was the friendly face of the church for thousands of Aborigines as he spoke the truths of their loss to the conqueror's world. He is survived by Marnie and the Aborigines who took this white priest into their hearts and made him part of own story. Father Ted Kennedy is the best of the Australian story, and I pay tribute to him in this House today. Water Management",40
47,Mr BAIRD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Early in July, the New South Wales Labor government announced a plan to build the world's largest desalination plant to provide water to Sydney at a cost of some $2 billion. This announcement was greeted with great surprise and genuine concern by the scientific and environmental experts. The plant threatens several endangered species. It is located at the site of Cook's first landfall in Australia. The plan will double the price of water and is so inefficient it will produce as much greenhouse gas as one-quarter of a million cars. On 2 September, the new Minister for Planning, Frank Sartor, announced that the plant had formally been designated as critical infrastructure under new laws that had been recently introduced. This designation as critical infrastructure has but one effect: it does nothing else but remove the very environmental oversight and environmental safeguards against which a project in an area as valuable as this should be held. Kurnell is of such environmental, cultural and historical worth that it was the first site in New South Wales to be inscribed on the Natural Heritage List. The New South Wales Labor government should be prepared to enter the battle of ideas over the future of Sydney's potable water supplies. Their approach to date has been to bully and cajole, not to discuss and debate. This latest move is just one example. Residents of southern Sydney are roundly concerned by the lack of transparency and due process. We are outraged by the avoidance of any community their consultation. The case as to why this should take place has not been convincingly put. (Time expired) Howard Government",40

The government came forth with what was-let us face it-a strong election result that included control of both houses, but they have no control over themselves. In respect of the National Party, the new senator from Queensland Barnaby Joyce is not so much a senator as a talk-back radio host. He is out there on a regular basis commenting on what is going on, and changing his mind from one day to the next, at a time when the coalition seems to be a rabble. There have been endless developments around Telstra. The views of the member for Hume, the senator from Queensland and other National Party members are all over the place in respect of that. On the issue of voluntary student unionism, every single member of the coalition seems to have a different opinion. They do not seem to clearly understand what they are trying to do as a party. On the issue of tax, the Treasurer is the country and there is, effectively, another Treasurer up there on the back bench. He is not in here yet-he is probably out there doing another press conference-but the fact of the matter is that he is out there commenting every single day. Mr Schultz interjecting",41

A big congratulations to the whole school community and in particular to the principal, Mrs Lynne Walsh, and the deputy principal, Ms Margaret Ball. The school has a population of 585 students. It designed an outstanding numeracy program that caters to all ability levels and integrates technology into numeracy teaching and encourages students to be proud of their work. Another feature is the identification of students at risk and specialised intervention programs. Teachers are constantly involved in ongoing development of the program, and the school maintains close links with Griffith University. Traditionally Bellevue Park's numeracy outcomes have been high.

55,Mr HOWARD,HURRICANE KATRINA,"I seek the indulgence of the House to say something that is properly available for indulgence-that is, on behalf of the parliament, to convey to the people of the United States of America our profound sympathy on the terrible devastation and apparently very large loss of life occasioned by Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. I have already personally conveyed to President Bush my concern and sympathy and that, I know, of all Australians for these events. Hurricane Katrina is a terrible reminder of the capricious damage that can be done by natural disasters. It is a reminder that even the most powerful nation on earth can be ravaged by these natural catastrophes. As the House will be aware, the government has already made a donation of $10 million to the American Red Cross. In addition, as an immediate first step, an advanced party of two to three emergency disaster experts, to be shortly followed by some 15 more, has gone to the United States. They are available to assist the American authorities in relation to any assistance that might be required over the weeks and the months ahead. We have also indicated that we are prepared to offer the American authorities additional experts to help provide emergency assistance on the ground. This does represent a terrible natural disaster. The exact loss of life is yet to be known, but it could run into thousands, if not tens of thousands. It is very easy, from tance, for people to cast judgments about the adequacy of the response, or otherwise. What is properly called ‘the blame game' is already fully under way within the United States. I do not seek in any way to enter that debate. I do, however, want to say on behalf of the government that we greatly appreciate the efforts of Australian consular officials in the United States. There has been criticism of them. I think that criticism, on the basis of the facts known to me, is unfair. Having said that, I do understand fully the anxiety and the anguish of families who are out of contact with loved ones in situations of apprehended danger or violence. Their reaction is totally natural, totally human and totally to be expected. The foreign minister will no doubt have something further to say about this matter, either in question time or later today, but I do understand that this morning one Australian consular official was allowed to enter New Orleans. I understand there are some 15 to 20 Australians in the affected area, of which there are concerns held for two. Every effort is being made, in cooperation with the American authorities, to render assistance. I do want to record the thanks of the government to those members of Australian press organisations who assisted and facilitated assistance to Australians. The situation as I am advised was that, whilst access of consular officials was denied by the United States authorities to all counties, Australia included, no attempt was made to prevent press people from entering the affected region, for reasons I think that will be apparent on a moment's reflection. Any attempt to ban the press from this disaster region would no doubt have provoked, in a country such as the United States, and indeed in Australia, an a disenormous amount of adverse comment and criticism. Can I conclude my remarks by saying that we hope that the remaining 15 to 20 Australians are safe and sound, and that the particular fears entertained in relation to two of our citizens are not realised. Can I convey, again, to the people of the United States our great condolence, our sympathy, our desire to help, and our desire to participate in rebuilding the shattered region. As I said in my message to President Bush, I have no doubt that the American spirit will ensure the rebuilding of New Orleans and that the difficulties of recent days will recede as the process of rebuilding and renewal in those affected areas proceeds.",42
56,Mr BEAZLEY,HURRICANE KATRINA," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to speak on the same matter. Hurricane Katrina has wreaked havoc on New Orleans and large parts of southern United States. It is a natural tragedy of truly mammoth proportions. I think the hearts of all Australians have been touched by the plaintive sights of mothers holding up their babies and of families bereft, looking for other family members, as they confront the most dreadful personal crises in the most dreadful possible circumstances. Unfortunately it is a scene that we have become all too accustomed to-to seeing areas of the globe less well resourced than the United States. In all those situations, United States has always responded positively with great assistance and with alacrity. Now the United States finds itself in the same circumstances, and I think it behoves all of us to respond with the same level of generosity and the same level of alacrity. Therefore we support the $10 million initial contribution that the government has made to the Red Cross society in the United States. We note that President Bush has appointed his father, the previous President Bush, and former president Bill Clinton to head up a private aid donor effort. I urge all Australians to make a contribution to that to show our appreciation of the generosity of individual Americans and American governments in the past in situations of national tragedy elsewhere and to show in contemporary terms the concerns that we all feel for the families that are suffering so greatly now and that will suffer for some considerable period. These tragic situations bring out the best and worse in people. There is no doubt about that. I want to pay tribute to those with very few resources-members of American emergency services and individuals-who took up early the effort to try to sustain law and order and the movement of aid to people who were suffering. There are some very brave policemen in the United States and there are some very brave individuals who, in the worse of all possible circumstances and at considerable risk to their own lives, tried to bring into this fraught situation a sense of order. Our admiration ought to be extended to them. I want to extend that admiration, too, to young Australians who found themselves caught up in this dreadful situation. I am pleased to hear from the Prime Minister that those numbers are now down to 15 to 20. At the last briefing we had, they were at 40. The the opposition joins the Prime Minister in expressing hope that the two who have definitely not been accounted for turn up safe and sound. As Australians, we have just seen examples of teams of young Australians banding together to survive-to survive in an urban environment wrecked by floods and in an absence of the rule of law. I want to pay tribute to the young Australians who protected each other, bonding together to get through a crisis even though they had not been familiar with each other before that crisis began. In the sea of chaos that descended, it seems that these men and women found in each other the will and the strength to survive. They are to be commended. Personally, I am unhappy with the response that we have made in consular terms to this point in time, though there appears to be a situation where we have caught up somewhat during the last 24 hours. Frankly, the response has not been good enough. It is true that the United States has said, and understandably so, that it did not want people to find themselves tripping over diplomats and consular officials as they went about the task of organising their aid effort. It is an entirely sensible thing that the Americans, and the American President, with tens of thousands of casualties on his hands and a complete wreck of a situation, do not pay mind to what might be going on with 60 or 70 Australians in that situation. It is not his job; nor is it the job of his officials. the job of Australians. It is the case that, when placed in that situation, members of the media, with very few resources to hand for themselves, were able to do an effective consular job. Our thanks ought to be extended to them on behalf of Australians who have nothing but praise for them, in the comments we have seen so far, for the work that they were able to do. In the United States we have the biggest embassy that we have anywhere on earth and we have numerous other Australians attached to various American activities. Many of them are service personnel; all of them are resourceful and used to hopping on helicopters in the worse of all possible circumstances and doing the job. Quite frankly, I think they should have been called on a little earlier than they were. That having been said, that is a comment that I think is entirely legitimate in the circumstances. Let me go again to saying this to Australians who did so well in ensuring that they protected their fellow citizens in the worse of possible circumstances: you have shown individual initiative, courage and mateship thoroughly in keeping with the Australian spirit; you did us proud. To the United States, we want to say this: we sympathise completely with you in this hour of your anguish and suffering. We sympathise completely with the people who have found themselves without homes, without family members and with their lives in absolute chaos. We know that at the end of the day the great generosity that moves the heart of the American spirit will see that everybody is taken care of, that everybody is nurtured, that everybody has a chance to go through their grieving with the nation behind them. As the Americans go about things in the way in which they usually handle them, with that generosity of spirit to themselves, it It is is important that there are others who share that view with them and who will be watching with all the supportive sentiment capable of being mounted as they go through the processes of settling down the nation and getting over their grieving. NA Hurricane Katrina",43
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement made today by Brisbane woman Fiona Seidel, who is stranded in New Orleans following the Hurricane Katrina disaster. When asked what message she has for the Prime Minister, Ms Seidel said: I'm a good Australian. I pay my taxes. I work. I own a home. I do the right thing. I don't commit crimes. And he pretty much wasn't there for me when I needed him. Why wasn't the Prime Minister and the Australian government there helping when Fiona and others like her were trapped in New Orleans with no way out?",44
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I first say, through you, Mr Speaker, to not only the Leader of the Opposition but also the lady in question, that I can fully understand why she would say that. I can. I can fully understand that anybody caught in that situation-anybody who had a son, a daughter or any other relative or friend in an apparently very dangerous situation-would feel that way. If she feels that the government has in some way failed her, I apologise to her, because we never like to fail those who we are charged to represent. If she feels that way, then of course that is how she feels and I do not seek in any way to avoid responsibility. But can I say that her criticism, however understood and however well intentioned, is misplaced and, for reasons I will try to explain, unfair. It is the case that, when a disaster of magnitude occurs, the only way it can be fairly handled, properly handled, efficiently handled and safely handled is for it to be handled by the domestic authorities. The idea that you could have the military personnel of a range of foreign countries operating independently within the United States to rescue their own foreign nationals is a recipe for chaos and potentially for bloodshed, particularly in a society which has a far moreMr Beazley interjecting",44
59,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is quite a serious issue and I am going to deal with it in a serious manner. The reality is that for anybody to suggest that the military forces of this country, as guests in another country, could operate in some independent way inside that country to rescue our nationals, without accepting that the military forces of Great Britlist ain, Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua and a whole range of other countries also have personnel in the United States-the Leader of the Opposition talked about tripping over diplomats. Tripping over diplomats would be chicken feed to tripping over the armies of several other countries had the advice of the Leader of the Opposition been followed. The Leader of the Opposition on this occasion has succumbed to a piece of cheap populism. It is nothing more. If you doubt that, I refer you to some remarks made by the member for Griffith, speaking on Sky TV only yesterday: To be fair to the government and to Mr Downer, I think their hands are tied at the moment by the United States authorities, which for so long now have not allowed Australian consular officials access to the disaster affected areas. Mr Rudd-That was yesterday.",45
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, that was yesterday! He has said it all: that was yesterday. You know what has happened? They turned on the radio this morning, they heard a bit of this talkback and they thought, ‘Gee, we can score a cheap political point on this.' We know exactly that that is what the Leader of the Opposition did. I do not blame any of the people. I do not blame the lady quoted. I say again, quite unconditionally: if that lady thinks I let her down then I say to her that I am sorry. I have tried in the 9½ years that I have been Prime Minister never to let an Australian down. If any Australian thinks I have let them down, they will always receive an expression of apology and regret from me. But I have to say, on behalf of the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, that I think the criticism that is being made of them is unfair. That was the view of the member for Griffith when he was in Mr Responsible mode  mode and he thinks he can score a cheap political point. I think that the Australian people will understand it. Some will be critical of me, some will not-that has always been the case; it always will be the case. But I say to that lady: I understand how she feels, but it is not fair to blame the efforts of the consular officials, it is not fair to blame the behaviour of the government. We did what we could in the circumstances. I think the attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to make a bit of political mileage out of this is absolutely pathetic. Families",45
61,Mr BAIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House of any recent analysis of the financial position of Australian families?,46
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cook for his question. Last week I visited the electorate of the member for Cook. I attended a function in company with the member for Cook and the member for Hughes. When I was there the member for Cook did not remind me about the performance of certain football teams but he did remind me that unemployment in the Sutherland Shire has now reached an amazing low of about 2.3 per cent. That is an example of the way in which the families of Sydney, in company with the families of all Australian cities, have prospered under this government. I can inform the member for Cook that last week the Treasury released its analysis on the tax position of a range of Australian families-and was that not fascinating reading. When it modelled 20 family typesfrom young to old, with varying income levels; singles and couples, with or without children-it found that all family types modelled were estimated to have experienced an increase in real disposable income of between 12.7 per cent and 29.5 per cent between 1996 and projected into 2006. In other words, every single family type that was modelled had enjoyed a massive real increase in its disposable income. This is not only a consequence of the general strength of the Australian economy but also specifically a consequence of the family tax benefit system that has been introduced by this government and which is clearly in the gun sights of the member for Rankin and the member for Lilley, both of whom over the last two weeks have begun to gnaw away at the family tax benefit system and to talk darkly and glibly about middle class welfare, which is code for introducing an income test on average Australian families. Let me go back to the Treasury analysisI should not allow the member for Lilley and the member for Rankin to distract me. The Treasury analysis shows, amongst other things, that a single-income couple on an average wage with two children will have increased their real disposable income by 29.5 per cent, from $38,000 to $49,000; a single person on an average wage will have increased theirs by 21 per cent; and senior Australians will have also substantially increased theirs by between 12.7 per cent and 27.8 per cent. The Treasury paper also calculated the net tax threshold for the 20 family types. The net tax threshold is the income point at which personal income tax pay exceeds cash benefits received. In 2005-06, an estimated 38 per cent of all families will receive more cash benefits than they pay in personal tax. The story in that department is even better for larger families. Fifty-nine per cent of families with three or more children aged under 16 pay no net tax-no tax in net terms. This analysis, which is of government policy over the last 9½ years, is in stark contrast to the alternative offered by the Australian Labor Party. The policy taken by Labor to the last election proposed the abolition of the government's $600-a-child payment, a payment that hundreds of thousands of families all around the country are receiving at this very moment. Also under Labor's election policy, parents were punished by up to $2,000 a year if they chose to stay at home and look after their children. What this Treasury analysis does is to demonstrate that the greatest winners under this government have been the lowand middle-income families of Australia. This government is immensely proud of that achievement. Hurricane Katrina",46
63,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to  concerning his son John, who together with other Australians had been trapped in New Orleans for some days. Minister, is it true that when Senator Ron Boswell contacted your staff seeking assistance one of your staff hung up on Senator Boswell? Is it also true that when the MCNeils contacted the minister's office, and I quote Mr MCNeil: His staff just were not interested in helping us one iota. They told us just to ring a 1800 number and that was it-they hung up on us.",47
64,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question. My office and my department have received hundreds, probably thousands, of calls. During a crisis like this, I admire the incredible patience, perseverance and hard work that they put in-I am sorry if that does not suit the opposition. I think they do an absolutely outstanding job. It is incredibly stressful. Those in the opposition who have had the privilege of being in government would understand that in a situation like this it is extremely difficult. I can only speak with great admiration for the work that they have done. In terms of Senator Boswell, he issued a statement today and I will table that, if the honourable member wishes. I am delighted that John MCNeil, Mr MCNeil's son, is now safe and has been evacuated from New Orleans. On Brisbane radio this morning, John's mother, Mary MCNeilMr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. I asked whether the minister's staff hung up on the MCNeils.

67,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,47
68,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will come back to you a little later. Honourable members of the opposition might be interested to know that John's mother, Mary MCNeil, said on Brisbane radio this morning: I tried to explain the other night about the problem that the Australian government have had getting in and they have only been aware of one side of the ledger. She went on to say: So now they do realise that the American government have stopped our people getting in there. The point here, as the Prime Minister said, is that those who were trapped in New Orleans were understandably unaware that our consular officials were not able to get in. It is also understandable that they became upset and frustrated. I think that now people better understand the situation of what was possible and what was not possible. In this particular instance, we are delighted that John MCNeil is safe and sound. Hurricane Katrina",47
69,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on the situation of those Australians caught in Hurricane Katrina in the United States? What is the government's response to this crisis?,47
70,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, can I say to the honourable member that I appreciate her serious interest in this terrible issue. As the Prime Minister has covered some of this ground already, I will be brief. But let me say that, thankfully, there are no reports of tralians who have been killed or seriously injured at this stage, though we do remain concerned about two people. One of them is a 75-year-old dual-national who has lived in the United States for a long time. He lives near New Orleans. The other is a 30-year-old Victorian man who was scheduled to be in a hotel in New Orleans when the hurricane hit. The consular officer who has managed to get into New Orleans has had the opportunity of going to the hotel. The hotel was apparently undamaged but locked, closed. We have not yet been able to track the 30-year-old Victorian man. On that point, I should also add that we know of around 15 Australians-I will choose my words very carefully here-who may still be in the affected area. That is not to say that they are-they may be. A lot of these people have been permanent residents of New Orleans and surrounding districts. They may be awaiting evacuation or they may not. We are pleased that eventually an Australian consular officer, who invited a British consular officer to join him, became the first consular officer from any country enter New Orleans and to look for stranded Australians. He followed up on the information about Australians who might be in the area. There has been, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, some comment that consular and military staff should have been sent into New Orleans sooner. We need to understand that we are, unfortunately, constrained by the laws and the rules of a foreign country, this time the United States of America. We expect-as do the British government, the Canadian government, the Mexican government and all other governments-our consular officers to adhere to local laws and the advice of local authorities when they are in a foreign country. What is more, we certainly Auswould not want to put more Australians into a position of danger by flouting local laws. I think our ambassador and our staff at the embassy in Washington have done a simply outstanding job. I would like to express my admiration for the endless hours of work our consular staff have been doing in Baton Rouge, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and elsewhere. They have worked tirelessly day and night. The Prime Minister quoted the opposition spokesman earlier-I will not read the quote again. We appreciated the support-up until today-of the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition put out a press release on Friday saying that the Australian Labor Party will support any assistance the government seeks to provide to the people of New Orleans and surrounding areas. In a tragic situation like this, none of us should trade on misery. It is a sad thing that the Labor Party has decided that this most appalling of tragedies is today, on 5 September, worthy of party-political debate. I must confess, enthusiastic as I often am about party-political debate, I do not happen to agree with that political judgment. I think to that will do the Leader of the Opposition a good deal of damage with the Australian people. Hurricane Katrina",47
71,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it a fact that the 11 Australians trapped in the New Orleans Superdome were eventually evacuated from New Orleans by a Channel 9 crew? Having reached Dallas, was accommodation for Australians there organised and paid for by Channel 10? Did Channel 10 also purchase clothes for Australian victims of Hurricane Katrina? Prime Minister, while media organisations were providing assistance and rescuing Australians, where was the government?",48
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is my understanding that a number of Australians were assisted out of the area in New Orleans by, I think, two of the channels. As to whether, their having got to Texas, some of those expenses were paid by another channel, I am not personally aware of that, but if the Leader of Opposition asserts it I will not with him. The Leader of the Opposition continues to make the point. He has chosen to have a go at the government-that is his right. I simply say to him that we must observe the laws of the countries in which we operate. I am sure that, if a similar disaster were to befall country, Australians would not appreciate Americans in this country taking the law into their hands in order to save their nationals. do not believe that for a moment. Mr Beazley interjecting",49
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am referring to the proposition advanced by the Leader of the Opposition that Australian military personnel should have commandeered helicopters in order,49
74,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Where did I say that?,49
75,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You said it today. The Leader of the Opposition says, ‘Where did I say that?' He ought to have a look at the transcript of his press conference. He ought to have a look at what he said. I noticed that in his indulgence he retreated a bit",49
76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on relevance. Is it relevant for the Prime Minister to accuse me of saying something I have never said",49
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition is well aware that there are forms of the House in which he may wish to correct his statement later.,49
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I stand by what I have said. I think what the Leader of the Opposition has done in this is very unwise. I can understand that Australians who have been caught up are concerned. I have said that, if any Australian feels that the government let them down, I regret that. I have said that repeatedly. I do not believe that they have been the let down when you take all of the circumargue the toss stances into account. As the member for Griffith was fair and generous enough to acknowledge 24 hours ago, our hands were tied by the fact that the American authorities would not allow consular people to go in. The member for Griffith, who has had a little more experience in this this than the Leader of the Opposition, acknowledged that yesterday. In the 24 hours that have gone by, the opposition have made a I tactical decision that they can get some political mileage out of this. That is exactly what they have done. It is as transparent and as weak as that. The attack by the Leader of the Opposition is as insubstantial as that, and I agree with the observation made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the Leader of the Opposition's motives. Hurricane Katrina",49
79,Dr JENSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Given the tragic events that have occurred in the United States, would the Attorney advise the House what expertise the Australian government is ready to provide to the United States to assist in dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina?",49
80,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question. Like him, all Australians are very interested in what we are doing to assist, where we have the capacity to do so. As I speak, three experienced emergency managers from Emergency Management Australia, an organisation within my department, are travelling to the United States to assess what expertise we can offer to the recovery process in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The team brings experience in community capacity building and the social consequences of disaster, and a detailed appreciation of international disaster coordination arrangements. In particular, the team will share its experience in developing disaster assessment strategies; identifying areas of high community risk such as public health, accommodation and transport issues; prioritising community needs such as shelter, food, water, electricity and safety; and structuring a coordinated community response. Emergency Management Australia has recent and very significant experience from responding to the Indian Ocean tsunami; major cyclones, which have impacted on the Northern Territory and elsewhere and devastated several Pacific nations; and, most recently, forest fires in Sumatra. It has strong links with the United States emergency management agency, FEMA, which is leading the United States response to this disaster. I met with some of FEMA's senior officials when I visited the United States in July, and I know they understand the importance of an all-hazards approach to emergency management, ranging from terrorist attacks to natural disasters. Of course, that has taken on additional significance in the light of these recent tragic events. Like all Australians, having watched the devastating footage from New Orleans, I am pleased that we are in a position to offer expert assistance to the United States at this time. Like the Leader of the Opposition, I am glad of the support that Australians are giving. I might add a little information. The Red Cross, which is coordinating support for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, can be contacted through its web www.redcross.org.au or on 1800811700. Hurricane Katrina",49
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My further question on these matters is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the fact that until today the Minister for Foreign Affairs had failed to persuade the United States government to allow Australian consular officials access to New Orleans. Prime Minister, why is it that the government has failed to have any effect on its counterparts in Washington after nine long years of telling Australians that the Howard government has unprecedented access to and influence with the government of the United States? Why is it that the Howard government has failed when Australian citizens needed help in America most?",50
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has not failed its citizens. What occurred in this particular case was that a decision was taken by the United States government not to allow in consular officials from any country. If in fact the Leader of the Opposition is saying that we have failed, then he is saying that Tony Blair has failed and he is saying that the Canadian Prime Minister has failed. The Leader of the Opposition is engaging in cheap populism. Trade: Exports",50
83,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade inform the House of Australia's recent export performance? Would he also advise the House how this government's sound economic management is contributing to this export success?,50
84,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. The member for Maranoa would be aware, as all members would be aware, that ABS figures for Australia's international trade in goods and services for site the month of July were released last week. Those figures indicated that, in July, exports of goods and services rose by two per cent to achieve an all-time record monthly figure of $15 billion worth of exports of goods and services. There have been significant increases and record highs in both value and volume terms in 2004-05 and these were achieved again in the month of July. This is right across the economy, and the member for Maranoa's own electorate contributes significantly to that through beef exports and a lot of resource exports that go out of the electorate Maranoa in Queensland. The government has worked hard over the last nine years to create a solid economic platform in Australia, through sound economic management that has delivered a very competitive circumstance to Australia's exporters of both goods and services. Interestingly, the ABS statistics showed that Australia's exports rose in all sectors, not just the resource sector. Mr Tanner interjecting",50
85,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member interjecting might listen to the statistics. In the ABS ures, which showed that all sectors increased, in the non-rural and other goods area-which includes the resources sectorour exports rose by three per cent. In the manufacturing sector, exports rose by 2.1 per cent. Rural exports rose by one per cent and services also rose by one per cent. I know that it has impressed the members of the Labor Party that all sectors of the export community have increased their capacity. It is important that we also note some of the rationale behind this. It has been this government's sound economic management over the last nine or so years that has delivered a set of circumstances in Australia that are increasingly competitive and superefficient. That economic management, which has delivered low interest rates, low unemployment, low inflation and budget surpluses",51
86,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,51
87,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are interjecting. The government gave it to them. Look at the surplus budgets. When did the Labor Party ever produce a surplus budget? What the Labor Party did give us was $96 billion worth of debt. Something else this government has done is pay off Labor's $96 billion worth of debt. If you look at the economic fundamentals that have developed in this country under of the leadership of the coalition government, you will see that the coalition government has created an incredibly strong, competitive and efficient platform for Australia's exporters to compete on the world stage and increase what they are selling to the world. Taxation",51
88,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the member for Wentworth's response to the Treasurer's mockery of his tax proposals-saying on 2GB on August 30 that figthe Treasurer's attack on his tax proposal was ‘slick and of no substance'? Does the Prime Minister agree with the member for Wentworth?,51
89,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the member for Wentworth is an excellent addition to this parliament and I thank him for the contribution he has made to the debate; and I think the member for Higgins is the best Treasurer this country has ever had. Medicare: Bulk-Billing,51
90,Mr BAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister update the House on the latest GP bulk-billing figures?,51
91,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I can understand why he is interested in this topic, because the bulk-billing rate in the electorate of Braddon has increased by almost 20 per cent-20 percentage points-over the last 12 months. I should point out that bulk-billing is not the be-all and end-all of Medicare, but it is important and it should be widely available, particularly to pensioners and children under 16. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, the national GP bulk-billing rate was almost 75 per cent in the June quarter. That is, three out of four visits to the GP were bulk-billed. That is up from only two in three GP visits being bulk-billed in October 2003. I can inform the House that, at 82 per cent, the bulk-billing rate for children is at an all-time high. At 69 per cent, the bulk-billing rate in country areas is at an all-time high; it is up 16 percentage points on December 2003. The member for Lalor likes to talk down our Medicare system. She likes to say that increases in bulk-billing rates are unsustainable. I can inform the House that the bulkbilling rate in the electorate of Lalor has risen eight per cent over the last 12 months. I look forward to her press release saying that the Howard government is truly the best friend that Medicare has ever had. Mr John Brogden",51
92,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Can the minister confirm that, in his capacity as minister for health, he attended a fundraiser with health industry representatives in Sydney on Wednesday, 31 August 2005? Can the minister confirm that at that function, which took place just 12 hours after the former New South Wales opposition leader attempted to take his own life, he made the following remark in response to a policy suggestion: If we did that, we would be as dead as the former Liberal leader's political prospects.",52
93,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I accept that I made a very insensitive comment. I should not have made it, and I apologise. Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate",52
94,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, I am interested to know of, and I am sure that the House would like to be informed about, international responses to the formation of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. Minister, are there any alternative views?",52
95,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and for the interest he shows in the issue. The first meeting of the Asia-Pacific partnership is to be hosted by Australia later this year. It will bring together for the first time six key Asia-Pacific countries to pursue a technology focused pro-growth approach to addressing climate change. The foundation partners-Australia, the United States, China, Japan, India and Korea-represent about half the global population, GDP and greenhouse gas emissions. It has been welcomed, not surprisingly, around the worldby the British environment minister, who said that it was a welcome step forward, by the German environment minister and by the European Commission. Last week I met with the Canadian environment minister, Stephane Dion; he came to Adelaide. He said that Canada would be interested in playing a role in the partnership as well. Several other countries, by the way, have also expressed an interest in joining. Are there any alternative views? Within the Labor Party there are several alternative views. The opposition leader-thinking there might be votes in it, I suppose-said, ‘It's nothing.' That is what he described it as: nothing. The member for Grayndler issued two press releases in two days condemning the partnership. They were headed ‘Secret climate pact more spin than substance' and ‘Climate pact spin and hypocrisy'-classic opposition press releases. But, if I may say so, I am thankful to some members of the ALP for turning around ALP policy. The shadow minister for resources, the member for Batman, in a speech on 23 August, did not say it was nothing, as his leader did; he welcomed the initiative, saying that it represented: ... a regional partnership of great significance even greater opportunityand that it has the capacity to make a serious global impact on patterns of energy use and greenhouse emissions ... I very much welcome the contribution of the member for Batman. Somebody in the opposition is having a bit of a think about the substance of what is going on in Australia, instead of just trying to work out what the latest opportunistic political line might be. The tragedy is that you have someone like the member for Batman not being mentioned at the moment as a possible Leader of the Opposition. Given the more serious approach he takes to public issues, I think he would make a much better Leader of the Opposition than the opportunist who happens to be sitting in that chair for the moment. Mr John Brogden",52
96,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Is the minister aware that Senator George Brandis, his Liberal Party colleague and a member of the Senate, has said in reference to the minister's inappropriate remarks of 31 August: I think it was a disgusting thing to do. Does the minister agree that what he has done is ‘disgusting'?",53
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister for Health and Ageing may to answer that question.,53
98,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did the wrong thing, and I have apologised. I am not going to quibble with criticisms my colleagues wish to make. Building and Construction Industry",53
99,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of current impediments to and productivity in the Australian building and construction industry? What are the alternative views?,53
100,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question. We are on the cusp of major reform of the building and construction industry in Australia. It is reform which has been four years in the making. It will see the end of the unlawful, corrupt and illegal behaviour that was identified by the Cole royal commission in the commercial building and construction industry. It is notable that this reform has been fought tooth and nail by the ALP and the Leader of the Opposition, yet in the Cole royal commission Justice Cole identified the Leader of the Opposition's state as one in which some of the most corrupt practices occurred. This is what the Cole royal commission said about Western Australia: The building and construction industry in Western Australia is marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct. Fear, intimidation and coercion are commonplace. Contractors, subcontractors and workers face this culture continuously. At the centre of this culture and much of the unlawful and inappropriate conduct is the CFMEU. This is important economic reform, because it delivers benefits to all Australians. As the Econtech report demonstrated, the reality is that getting rid of corrupt and unlawful behaviour in the commercial building and construction sector could lead to a one per cent increase in GDP in Australia, something which flows through to ordinary Australians whose retirement investment is tied up largely and partly in the major constructions in the capital cities around Australia. That is, the extra cost of building major buildings in Australia is something which flows through and affects the retirement incomes of many hundreds of thousands of Australians. It is appalling that, in the face of this clear evidence about corruption and unlawful behaviour, the Leader of the Opposition will not support what is going on. Instead, what we have from the opposition is support for what they call the Victorian system. In fact, at the 2004 inquiry into this bill, we had Labor senators saying that the committee majority recommended that the government promote cultural change through the industry by encouraging states to institute tripartite industry councils at state level, and that the Victorian model could be used as an exemplar. The exemplar of the Victorian model is what the Herald Sun described last year as ‘Rort City: unions' free beer, BBQs and phantom pay cost states millions'. Not only do the Labor Party want Rort City in Victoria; they want a policy which basically means ‘Rort Nation', rather than just ‘Rort City'. The government are going to do something about the rorts in the building and construction sector; we will get this legislation through the parliament and, for once, this side of parliament will be able to do something to clean up that unlawful and corrupt behaviour. Mr John Brogden",53
101,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the mental health sector has said the following about the 31 August remarks made by the Minister for Health and Ageing: For any minister, let alone the federal health minister, who has direct responsibility for the national suicide prevention strategy, to use the tragic circumstances of John Brogden to make a political point is quite outrageous. Given both health professionals and members of your party have lost confidence in the minister for health, will you ask for his resignation?",54
102,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. National Transport Infrastructure,54
103,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House of recent progress the government has made in meeting national transport infrastructure needs?,54
104,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. He is well aware of the government's commitment to the $12.7 billion AusLink initiative, something which will help involve our nation in upgrading infrastructure, particularly in road and rail, from one end of the country to the other. Some major nation-building projects are involved in the AusLink plan. I am very pleased to note that, in the member's state of Victoria, there has been a ready commitment to the AusLink program and, as a result, some significant projects are already under way-one example is the government's commitment of $121 million to the Pakenham bypass. But, unfortunately, other states have not followed Victoria and South Australia's lead. In fact, states like New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia have still not signed up to AusLink. As a result, funding from the Commonwealth for important road and rail projects ended on 1 July. There is simply no funding available to those states unless they are prepared to be a part of the AusLink process, which will unlock significant financial resources to those states. I have been meeting with ministers in various states to try to talk through the issues. It is important that they be resolved, because we want to get on with the task of building many of these important projects. I know that the member for Cowper has been particularly concerned about the Bonville stretch on the Pacific Highway, and recent accidents demonstrate again how vital it is that the project should proceed. The Commonwealth are ready, and our funds are ready. All we are waiting for is New South Wales to sign the AusLink agreement and get on with the task. I know that there are similar projects in Queensland and other states which are ready to go, so I call upon the states to move quickly and to agree to the AusLink arrangements. Victoria and South Australia have agreed, so why is there such a problem for people in other states? If they do not get involved quickly, from 1 October all the unsigned agreements will also be subject to the new construction code guidelines that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has just spoken about. I would encourage all the transport ministers to immediately make commitments to AusLink so that we can get on with the important task of these nation-building construction projects in every state. Mr John Brogden",54
105,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall saying, about the matter involving Mr John Brogden: Well look, his future is obviously a matter for him, and it's a matter for his parliamentary colleagues. That's a matter for the state parliamentary party, but that sort of commentthat is, Mr Brogden'sis just quite wrong. Prime Minister, weren't the comments made by the Minister for Health and Ageing after Mr Brogden's suicide attempt quite wrong? Will the Prime Minister apply the same standard he applied to Mr Brogden to his minister for health and have the matter dealt with by his parliamentary party on the same basis-that the minister for health resign?",55
106,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second and third parts of the question is that Mr Abbott, the Minister for Health and Ageing, has apologised for his remarks. He continues to enjoy my full confidence. Ministers in my government are appointed by the Prime Minister. Social Welfare",55
107,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Human Services. Would the minister inform the House what recent measures the government has taken to ensure that people are paid their correct entitlements under our welfare system?,55
108,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to thank the hard working member for Greenway for her question. On Friday, the Minister for Workforce Participation and I launched a new marketing campaign called Support the System that Supports You. It is an attempt to properly inform all Australians that they should properly support the welfare system and that if they engage in fraud they will be caught and they could end up going to jail. This program is very important. Fraud and compliance are key parts of Centrelink's activities. Last year, Centrelink reviewed over four million entitlements, and that resulted in over 700,000 customers having their payments cancelled or reduced. We save over $50 million a week as a result of fraud and compliance activity. Centrelink investigated 70,000 tip-offs, and that resulted in 17,500 customers having their payments cancelled or reduced. If we can send a message to those who are attempting to defraud the system: last year there were nearly 3,000 convictions for welfare fraud. We have to do our part to help families and those people endeavouring to do their best to properly comply with the system, and one of the ways to do that is to bring together the agencies within human services, to work in partnership as against sometimes working against the interests of each other. I can port that the Senate has just passed the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005, which ensures that Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission no longer have boards, that they are directly reportable to the minister-that being me-and that the HIC, after 30 years, will become Medicare Australia. So what does that partnership mean? It was brought to my attention that, in order to claim the maternity payment or in order to claim a Medicare card for your new child or in order to claim the family tax benefit, you had to fill out extraordinary forms that go on forever, covering pages and pages with questions-more than 32 questions-and, in addition, you had to go not just to Centrelink but also, separately, to Medicare, to get your Medicare card. As from March next year, a three-page form replaces these indecipherable, complex forms that end up causing people great grief. That is going to save tralian families seven million pages of questions each year. That is what human services is about: better delivery for consumers. Mr John Brogden",55
109,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the view that he has expressed in public that Mr Brogden's comments and behaviour made in a social setting were inappropriate. If the Prime Minister believes the former New South Wales Leader of the Opposition's remarks were inappropriate and that the ‘right decision' was taken by Mr Brogden, why won'the apply the same standards to his own minister, whose comments were made in a sober state and in his official capacity as Minister for Health and Ageing?",56
110,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have already indicated to the parliament that the Minister for Health and Ageing has apologised for the remarks he made. My responsibility and my authority re- extends to the appointment of ministers. I believe that the Minister for Health and Ageing has been an outstanding minister, and I have no intention of terminating his commission. NA NA Censure Motion",56
111,Mr BEAZLEY,AGEING,"by leave-I move: That this House censure the Minister for Health and Ageing for failing to resign after making cruel and callous remarks following the suicide attempt of the former Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, remarks that demonstrate the Minister's complete incapacity to provide any leadership on mental health issues. It is a serious matter when any opposition decides that it will move a censure motion on a matter like this. To be able to justify a censure motion, you have to demonstrate that the minister has acted well outside the stanAus- dards that would be expected of a person holding a particular portfolio. That means that, if the offence is related directly to that portfolio, it is a very serious matter indeed. The remarks made by the Minister for Health and Ageing on the situation on the day after the attempted suicide by the former Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales were precisely the sorts of remarks that would be made by a minister no longer fit to hold the position of Minister for Health and Ageing. Mr Brogden made inappropriate remarks in his cups-that is no excuse, but he made them in his cups-about the family of the former Premier, and Mr Brogden left the leadership of the Liberal Party on the basis of it. The Minister for Health and Ageing made completely inappropriate remarks about the circumstances in which Mr Brogden found himself, and he made them in the cruellest possible way, fully reflecting the massively poisonous atmosphere that prevails in the New South Wales Liberal Party. In the process he caused anguish and concern amongst many of the people in the community who have to deal with the minister that, when they are dealing with him on health matters, they face a clumsy, callous individual with no sincerity in him-a blockhead absolutely determined that, as far as he is concerned, nothing he does or says matters a wit to them, who has no natural sympathy or concern about the people with whom he must deal. And he is protected in this place by a Prime Minister who makes one set of judgments about his political enemies in the Liberal Party and another set of judgments about his political supporters. His supporters in Liberal Party and members of the Liberal Party can have no confidence in any dispassionate dealing with them by the man who is Prime Minister of this country. This whole sorry episode reflects the hubris, the arrogance and the cast of mind which has developed inside the government since the last election and more particularly since they got control of the Senate. They could not care less. They could not care less about appropriate standards of behaviour, they could not care less about respect for the community and they could not care less about anguish and concern in the community on any particular matter, be it from petrol prices to mental health. They could not care less. But we care a great deal, and we are going to hold the government accountable. To watch the government react and scream and squirm when subjected to a bit of decent questioning in question time today-trying to hold them accountable while they flick passed responsibility on a variety of matters-was not an edifying spectacle for anyone interested in the issues of good government in this country. Let me go to the Prime Minister's performance when Mr Brogden made the statements that he did in the immediate aftermath of the public revelation of the utterly unacceptable comments that Mr Brogden had made about Mr Carr and Mr Brogden's other inappropriate behaviours with women in the press gallery in New South Wales. I can recollect the Prime Minister's demeanour very well. It is his demeanour that counts at least as much as his words on these subjects. His demeanour was: ‘This man's gone. This is an opportunity.' His demeanour was: ‘One of the people whom I despise in the Liberal Party has turned himself broadside on and I'm going to stick a torpedo right into the middle of his political career.' Mr Brogden, the of course, recognised his foolishness and he apologised at that point of time. The apology was not accepted with alacrity by the Prime Minister. We would not have accepted it with alacrity, and why would you expect us to? For us the offence and the hurt was vastly greater than anything that could conceivably have been experienced by the government. But it was an interesting thing that the Prime Minister was not interested in Mr Brogden's position being defended by an apology. ‘Oh, no,' the Prime Minister said, portentously, ‘this is a matter for the state party, but this is not an acceptable statement.' When Mr Brogden resigned the Prime Minister could not get onto the radio fast enough to put himself into a position whereby the body language, the nudging, the intonation in the comments was, ‘Well, really, I had something to do with this'Mr Michael Ferguson-Get real!",56
112,Mr BEAZLEY,AGEING,"‘Get real'? You get real. You are a new member in this place. You start to face a few facts about party life in parliamentary Liberal Party, because I can assure you, my friend, you are going to be obliged to before this term in parliament is out. So you get real, young man. You get real, because you are going to have to answer in your constituency for the behaviours of your ministers over the course of the next couple of years. Dr Stone- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order: I ask that you remind the Leader of the Opposition to address his remarks through the chair.",58
113,The SPEAKER,AGEING,I thank the member for Murray. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to refer to members by the names of their seats.,58
114,Mr BEAZLEY,AGEING,"Sorry, I do not know it. Anyway, such is life. That, of course, is a distraction but a distraction which here absolutely illustrates the point. We had the Prime Minister there manoeuvring. We had the Prime Minister conforming to a description given of one of his predecessors by Gough Whitlam, which I remember so well and stands so well, I think, in comparison with this particular case. He then said of Billy MCMahon what could well have been said about John Howard in so many situations: ‘Tiberius on a telephone'. The Prime Minister was Tiberius on a telephone through to his colleagues in the New South Wales Liberal Party, with the intention of making absolutely certain that Brogden's career was over and that Brogden had gone. There was no defence from the Prime Minister in public. He did not come out and say: ‘ Mr Brogden has apologised in detail to Mr Carr. He has apologised in detail to the women who were offended by his behaviour at that particular party.' There was no suggestion by the Prime Minister of: ‘That's sufficient. That's all that's required to be done in this case. Mr Brogden, of course, is a valued member of the parliamentary Liberal Party at the state the level. He's been a close associate of minehe's given me support in the past. I would want to see Mr Brogden survive.' Not for one minute did you hear any sentiment like that. Our situation in the Australian Labor Party is that people out there in the public, in the media, have always been fascinated by our internal arrangements. They have always been interested in what we do around preselection time and in how we organise the affairs of our branches. I can tell you this: the structure of the Australian Labor Party is such that, while from time to time you can breach the rules and stack out a branch in a particular area, you cannot stack a whole branch. The structure of our rules is such that there is a protection, which turns out to be a community interest protection. But you can stack a whole branch in the Liberal Party. You can take out an entire state division when you put your mind to it. What has happened in New South Wales-and it is reflected in these circumstances-is that a narrowly based group, ideologically, has taken out the entire Liberal Party and apparently has the approval of the Prime Minister and a large number of members of the parliamentary Liberal Party from this state. The truth of the matter is that the former New South Wales Leader of the Opposition was not sacked for the comments that he made about Mr Carr's wife-though he should have been. He was not sacked for the behaviours that he demonstrated to the women journalists-but he should have been. He was sacked because he found himself on the wrong side of a factional divide and the factional divide found the Prime Minister on the other side from him. Let us understand that. Brogden went not because of what Brogden had to say but because of what Brogden represented in the parliamentary Liberal Party. If you want evidence that that is the case, all you need to do is to look at what has happened here today. Was Mr Brogden's apology any less comprehensive than the apology just given by the Minister for Health and Ageing? No, it was not. An opposition member-It was more comprehensive.",58
115,Mr BEAZLEY,AGEING,"Indeed, Mr Brogden's apology was far more extensive. Mr Brogden's efforts to deal with the hurt were even more extensive. He attempted to ring Mr Carr. Mr Carr understandably did not take his call-nor would I in those circumstances-but the attempt was made. He rang the women who had been offended by his behaviour. He attempted to make amends. For the first time in the last 30 hours we have seen the minister for health stand up in this place and apologise. He has not been out there on the airwaves. As far as I am aware, he has made no effort to ring Mr Brogden. He has made no effort to apologise to the person who has been offended by this. This man has finally come in here at the death knock, in terms of parliamentary debate on this issue, and has responded finally with an apology-not an extensive apology at all, not an apology which reflects the character of his portfolio but just ‘That's it.' And then he down immediately after it and started winking away at the Prime Minister. He showed exactly the level of seriousness with which he regarded the atonement that he made, sitting there winking away at the Prime Minister. I understand that the Prime Minister does not comprehend morse code, so there is no other reason, no other message, conveyed by that blink except, ‘Ha, ha, we got away with this one.' So, in the Prime Minister's mind, there is one standard in the Liberal Party for people who are his factional opponents, and there is another standard here for the members or the ministers whom he regards as his supporters. That is the parliamentary Liberal Party, and that is the state of factional affairs in the Liberal Party. But there is a wider audience here. There is an audience which is now beginning to treat with great seriousness mental health issues in this country. There is a substantial debate now in this nation on mental health issues. There was a view in the 1980s that taking those with mental afflictions out of institutions and putting them in the general community was the right way to go. As a result of that, in the general community, there has been an experience of very great difficulties in the case of some individuals. There has been a considerable difficulty in the justice systems of most of the states as they attempt to deal with the consequences of a mental health system in which there is very little capacity for them to protect the community and serve the needs of those who have found themselves with an affliction. That is a substantial issue now in Australian politics. There is a further issue related to that and to the broader issue in the community: the questions raised by the former Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. He now leads an organisation devoted to the study of depression and to broadening the knowledge in sat the Australian community that here is an affliction, a state of mind, that is far more widespread than has previously been comprehended and that is likely to be experienced by a very large number of Australians; and that we need to be a more open and forthcoming society in dealing with these issues. At the heart of the contemplation of both these concerns, of course, lie the ministries of health at state and federal levels. There is a further concern related to mental health issues now in our community. That goes to the question of suicide-the culmination of a variety of mental afflictions, some of which may be physiological, some of which may be purely psychological, but which are utterly tragic. There is an understanding now particularly of the problems related to suicide amongst men and boys and of the particular strains that have come with contemporary social conditions on young men and men of middle age as they face a world of greater insecurities, as they face a world that does not present them with the same sorts of challenges that take them outside themselves that times past have done. These issues, frankly, are beyond partisan politics. They are beyond the capacity for anyone in this chamber to be right. They are issues which we as a community now need to confront collectively and to arrive at conclusions. They do not lend themselves to ideology. They do not lend themselves to classic formulations around social democracy, liberalism or conservatism. They are issues of the heart and mind that go beyond the norms of politics. But one thing you absolutely need in a person who holds the position of the minister for health-be they at the state level or the federal level-is a person whose demeanour, carriage and every word lend weight to consideration for the afflicted or those responsible for the afflicted and that, when they approach this man or woman, they approach a person with an honestly open cast of mind, a person with a breadth of view who is prepared to accept that he may not be correct on any particular matter and who does not go bull-headed at new problems and new issues in his portfolio. There is nobody in the mental health community or those who are concerned with mental health issues who think for one minute that they have such a person in the Minister for Health and Ageing. He had problems in this area to start with. He has made statements to this point of time, which I am sure the seconder of this motion will deal with, which cast very severe doubt as to whether he thinks the things I have been talking about are problems at all-or, if they are problems, they are a matters merely of will. So he had a cast of mind to start with to be enormously dismissive of his Liberal Party colleague in New South Wales, because he stands for that section of the New South Wales Liberal Party that believes in openness, tolerance and in a broad community. The minister was dismissive of Mr Brogden for those points of view and is now dismissive of him for what he considers to be weakness on his part. And so the minister could make a joke at Mr Brogden's expense 24 hours later. You cannot be minister for health and do that. You may get away with it-but you should notif you happened to be Minister for Defence, the Treasurer or something like that, but you absolutely cannot get away with it if you happen to be minister for health. This minister should go. The Prime Minister is too weak to sack him. He has a leadership challenge under way-insipient, we know-from the Treasurer, and therefore the Prime Minister's allies are important to him. The minister for health is one of the allies of the Prime Minister in that confrontation with the Treasurer, so the Prime Minister needs to keep him on side. But the minister for health can do the right thing. He has had several opportunities to do right thing since the last election. He should have gone, for misleading the Australian people-and, I might say, his apology to the Australian people lacked comprehensiveness then, as did the apology that we just heard today. We ought to have seen this minister go for the deliberate misleading of the Australian people at the last election. And he did not go. He decided that he would cling to office, and he clings to office again here today. He should go. He should do the right thing. Mr Brogden, when confronted with these circumstances, started with an apology and proceeded from an apology to resignation. Mr Abbott has now, finally-30 hours on, and after we put him under questioning about it-come into this place and apologised, but he has done it nowhere else. Now he should move on. He should follow Mr Brogden's example and take the second set and leave this parliament and leave this government. (Time expired)",59
116,The SPEAKER,AGEING,Is the motion seconded? Ms Gillard-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,61
117,Mr ABBOTT,AGEING,"I do accept that the statements that I made were insensitive. I do accept that they should not have been made. I do accept that they were altogether inappropriate, and I am ing them. I have apologised and I am happy to apologise again. I am very sorry that I have given offence to the former Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales. I am very sorry that I have given offence to some of my own colleagues. I am even very sorry that I have given offence to members opposite. Let me simply say that I am certainly not a perfect human being. I make mistakes, as do we all. Perhaps I make more than most people but, when I make a mistake, I apologise and I attempt to make amends. For the information of the Leader of the Opposition, yesterday afternoon I called what I believed was the best number for the former New South Wales Leader of the Opposition to make it clear to him that I had said the wrong thing, that I was sorry and that if he wanted to make contact with me to discuss it I was only too happy to do so. We are in the presence of a tragedy. On Monday last week we saw a political tragedy unfold, which subsequently became a personal tragedy. Like everyone in this parliament-and I am sure everyone in this country-I feel deeply sorry for John Brogden, his family and his political colleagues in New South Wales. I make it very clear that my throwaway line at a small fundraiser for Barry O'Farrell in the Speaker's dining room of the New South Wales parliament on Wednesday was most insensitive. It should not have been said, and I am happy to apologise again. I should also not have made the ironic comment at the Kenthurst branch. I certainly do not think that anyone who was present at that would have thought that I was in any way being critical of John Brogden, but I certainly accept that the comment was open to misinterpretation. It should not have been said under all the circumstances and, sorry for mak- again, I apologise. We live in a tough public culture. Politicians give each other no quarter. The media is absolutely ruthless with everyone's mistakes. The public is highly judgmental. I am not complaining about it any more than I am complaining about the caterwauling from members opposite; it is just the world that we live in. I accept that my colleagues have a right to make critical comments about me under all these circumstances and I certainly am not in any way going to quibble with the judgments that they make. The Leader of the Opposition made a number of critical comments about the Prime Minister and about the New South Wales Liberal Party. He claimed that the former leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party was the victim of some kind of factional ploy. Let me make it very clear that John Brogden received strong support from his colleagues in New South Wales on Monday morning. He received strong support from his leadership team. He received strong support from those members of the federal parliamentary party who were in contact with him. Senator Heffernan, for instance, gave him strong support. Of course, it was up to his party room to make any judgments about the leadership, as it is always up to every party room and caucus to make judgments about the leadership. But the point is that John Brogden had all the support that a state parliamentary leader has a right to expect from the federal party, including the Prime Minister and including everyone on this government's front bench. I accept that the New South Wales parliamentary party has not had a happy time since losing government a decade ago. But I think it was honourable conduct of John Brogden to resign when he had made a serious mistake. I think it was honourable conduct of Barry O'Farrell to put the good of the party before his own personal advancement. I think these gentlemen have laid the foundations for a renaissance of our party. One of the things that has been lacking amongst the New South Wales party has been an inability to give colleagues the benefit of the doubt. I think that what we have seen over the last few days in the New South Wales party does offer considerable hope of a better future than the recent past. One of the strengths of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party has been that we have never leapt to immediate critical conclusions of colleagues. We have not rushed to believe the worse of each other. I think that the example of people like Barry O'Farrell and the honour of people like John Brogden suggest that those same sentiments are quite possibly beginning to be appreciated now in the New South Wales parliamentary party. There have been some claims that the New South Wales parliamentary party has been taken over by extremists. Let me repudiate those claims. There is nothing wrong with people who are practising Christians also being members of political parties. Ms Vamvakinou interjecting",61
118,The SPEAKER,AGEING,The member for Calwell should be aware that it is clearly disorderly to interject from outside her seat.,62
119,Mr ABBOTT,AGEING,"There is nothing wrong with the New South Wales upper house member David Clarke simply because he goes to church on Sunday and shares views that are not uncommon, even amongst some decent members of the political party sitting opposite me now. What is wrong with going to church and also being a member of a political party and a member of parliament? Some critical comments have been made in the course of this debate about the government's policy on mental health. Some critical comments have been made of me by people who are involved in mental health organisations. I can fully understand that anyone involved in advocacy of people with mental health issues would be unhappy at any suggestion that someone might have made light of John Brogden's personal tragedy. They are entitled to be annoyed, I accept their criticisms, and I will do my best to make amends. This is a government which has a good record on mental health. We have increased mental health spending from all sources, inour cluding the Medicare benefit schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme from under $800 million in 1996 to over $1.1 billion today in constant dollar terms. This is almost a 50 per cent real increase. The Better Outcomes in Mental Health program has resulted in some 4,500 GPs receiving additional training in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems. That program is a tribute to its originator, Dr Michael Wooldridge, and indeed to this government which has sustained it. I point out that the government committed an extra $110 million to various mental health programs in the election campaign and in the recent budget we more than delivered on that commitment. But we have not stopped there. There is a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiry into mental health. Its report is due soon. With the government's support, there is a Senate inquiry into mental health. This government will respond intelligently and sensitively to those reports. I am not surprised that members opposite have called for my resignation. The member for Lalor has called for my resignation on no fewer than seven separate occasions since November 2004. I have not counted the number of times the Leader of the Opposition has called for my resignation, but in ther his first or his second coming I am confident that it has happened on quite a number of occasions. If some good at least has come from all the sorry business of the last week or so, cluding my own crass and insensitive remarks, at least the Leader of the Opposition is finally talking about health. He has not talked much about health, but at least he has spent a little time talking about mental health. I hope he continues doing that in the weeks and months ahead.",62
120,Ms GILLARD,AGEING,"There is nothing wrong with going to church on Sunday, but there is something wrong with hypocrisy, and that is what we have seen on display in the last 48 hours. The Minister Health and Ageing has come into this place and claimed to have apologised for his grossly insensitive remarks. That claim simply is not true. Let us just take ourselves back to what happened here and then go through his bogus claims to have apologised. What happened here is that a man tried to kill himself. That is what happened here-a tragedy. A young man tried to kill himself. The minister for health, 24 hours after a young man tried to kill himself, was at a branch of the Liberal Party cracking hardy about it. It is very funny, isn't it, Minister? It is very funny when a young man tries to kill himself. The minister is cracking hardy and he says, ‘I just want to make it clear I've never told an inappropriate joke. I've never pinched a woman on the backside. I've never made inappropriate gestures to women.' Putting aside the question as to whether those statements are true or not, there he is making jokes at the expense of a young man who has tried to kill himself-making jokes less than 24 hours after it happened. But, even worse, less than 12 hours after it eihappened, in the presence of health industry professionals, a meeting the minister is at in his capacity as minister for health, he is asked about a health policy proposal and he responds: ‘If we did that, we would be as indead as the former Liberal leader's political prospects.' A young man has tried to kill himself and he says, ‘If we did that, we would be as dead as the former Liberal leader's political prospects.' What a disgraceful, insensitive and callous set of remarks. I would like to make a point here. Mental health issues and suicide attempts are not different from any other set of health issues. If John Brogden had been diagnosed with cancer, what would people have thought of for those remarks? What would they have thought if the minister for health had been there going ‘That's deader than John Brogden's political career' if John Brogden had been diagnosed with cancer? What if John Brogden had been tragically injured in a car accident and was in hospital, hooked to machines, fighting for life, and the minister for health was out there saying, ‘That's deader than John Brogden's political career'? What would people have thought of that? It is no different. Mr Brogden was involved in a depressive episode and a suicide attempt. It is no different. The remarks less callous. They are no less disgusting, to use a word that has been used today. They are so grossly inappropriate for the man who has on his shoulders the responsibility for mental health federally that he should have offered his resignation. The minister for health has come in and said, ‘Oh, well, you know, I've apologised.' That is simply not true. On the TV show yesterday, when he was asked to apologise, he basically said, ‘Oh, well, if it would make people feel better if I apologised. I am always happy to apologise if it is going to make someone feel better.' Then, in the course of the morning yesterday, he added to that and said, ‘I said on the program this morning that if anyone is upset I am happy to apologise.' When asked whether that was an unconditional apology or why he would not make it unconditional, he said, ‘If you'd prefer it that way, I'm happy to apologise.' Today we heard of some half-arsed attempt to try to get John Brogden on the phone yesterday afternoon. Then, of course, the minister for health is pursued round Canberra by TV crews looking to see whether or not he is going to apologise. He is finally, we think, caught by Channel Ten and, in what is then referred to as an exclusive doorstop, he says, ‘I'm very happy to apologise. I don't like upsetting people.' He does not come into this parliament and proffer an apology by way of statement or even by organising a dorothy dix question. No, he takes a dorothy dixer on bulk-billing. The only way in which he has come into this parliament and apologised is through us on this side asking him questions. If we had not questioned today, there would be no parliamentary apology. Then the minister fronts a censure motion and says, ‘I've apologised in the parliament.' Too right, Minister-because we asked you about it, are no not because you came in here and volunteered an apology. Do you know what the natural meaning of the word ‘apology' is? It means you are actually sorry. I do not know if anybody has ever explained that to you. It does not mean that you utter the words ‘If I've upset someone, I apologise.' It actually means you are sorry. What we saw towards the end of question time was the minister for health wink at the Prime Minister-‘Oh, I got out of that light. I got out of that easy. All done; all dusted; all in.' A quick little mea culpa and ‘Maybe I am a bit disgusting' and it is all over and done with. It is all play-acting. You never felt in any part of your person sorry for what you did or what has happened. The only thing you are sorry for is that you got caught. That is the only thing you are sorry for. That is not good enough. This minister has failed a series of basic tests in relation to this matter. First of all, he has failed the test that the Prime Minister set for John Brogden. John Brogden did a dishonourable thing. When he had done that dishonourable thing, the Prime Minister was on the airwaves saying this: ‘Well, look, his future is obviously a matter for him, and it is a matter for his parliamentary colleagues, but he owes Helena an apology, a very big apology.' There is the Prime Minister setting a test. He has viewed John Brogden's conduct and he has said, ‘This man needs to apologise in a big way.' Then he has done the political equivalent of throwing him to the wolves and not backing him, saying, ‘That's a matter for his parliamentary colleagues.' That is the test the Prime Minister set when John Brogden had made an inappropriate remark and behaved inappropriately at a social event. Why should the Prime Minister's test be any different when it is applied to the minister for health, when he is at a formal function in his capacity as minister for health and makes grossly inappropriate remarks about a young man who has tried to commit suicide? By the Prime Minister's own test not only does this man owe a big apology-which has not been given in any proper form yet-but he ought to place his fate in the hands of his parliamentary colleagues. We all know what that means: offering his resignation. Why is there one standard articulated by the Prime Minister-who should be in this parliament now but who is not; perhaps that is indicating something-for John Brogden and one standard for the minister for health? We know they are close. We know he is the teacher's pet, sitting on the Prime Minister's lap like a lapdog, doing all the jobs the Prime writes: Minister asks him to do. The Prime Minister sends him out on super and then kicks him in the guts on super, and he comes back and says, ‘I've never been prouder of the Prime Minister than I am today.' We know that the Prime Minister enjoys having him prancing around on and off the lap, doing everything that he wants done. But that does not mean, when you are drawing standards, that you draw a lesser standard. If the Prime Minister is serious about the John Brogden standard then it should be applied to this minister and this minister resign. He has not only failed the Prime Minister's standard; he has failed the test of his own colleagues. The most vicious criticism of this man has not come from the Labor Party; it has come from his own parliamentary colleagues, from New South Wales Liberals. The current Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales said, ‘I can't believe you'd make such stupid and insensitive remarks'. Then there is John Ryan, the deputy leader of the Liberal Party in the Legislative Council, who said: I'm sickened, saddened and disgusted ... If we can't be seen to care for each other, in a time of need, the public will hardly believe that we care about them. Then there is Senator Brandis who referred to the minister's conduct today as ‘disgusting'. He has failed a prime ministerial standard and he has failed the test set by his own colleagues. Those are two tests that should lead any honourable man to proffering his resignation. But it goes on from there, because he has failed the test of the Australian community. Mr Speaker, without using any names, because that would be inappropriate, I refer you to an email-and it is amongst the many, many emails I have received today from people about this matter-from a person who I have suffered from chronic anxiety and depression for a number of years now, and it has altered my life entirely, both in career and personal terms. Like many others I struggle everyday to manage it, and to hear someone such as Abbott speak with such contempt and arrogance is offensive in the extreme. I do not feel at all reassured knowing that he is the Minister responsible for mental health in our community. He has failed the Prime Minister's test, he has failed his colleagues' test and, perhaps most importantly of all, he has failed the test that has been brought to bear by decent should members of the Australian community, people who know the heartache, know the anguish of confronting mental illness all day, every day; who know that they face stigma wherever they go-in the workplace, in the home-and who are shunned by friends, often shunned by people who provide services. They know what it is like to bear that stigma and they look to political figures, and more than anyone else they look to those charged with the responsibility for health, leadership on the question of stigma. What they are asking for is no more than to be recognised as being unwell, as being ill, as being people who are entitled to be treated as human beings. What does this minister do when faced by that community expectation, this being one of the biggest burdens of disease in Australia? He thinks it is pretty funny to crack jokes about someone's suicide attemptsomeone he actually knows. What kind of leadership is that? It is a level of leadership where, across the spectrum, from right to left, from Jeff Kennett through, mental health organisations in this community over the last 24 hours have said, ‘This man cannot be our leader on health'-having distinguished himself in this particular, devastating way; having tagged himself as someone who thinks that mental health issues are a rich vein of humour, even when someone has tried to commit suicide. They are begging this government to get them a minister who would be prepared to treat seriously their needs and concerns and they know that this man will never be it. Mr Wilkie-It's not funny, Tony.",63
121,Ms GILLARD,AGEING,"It is not funny. He is laughing now, but it is not funny. When I say from left to right, I am talking about people like the former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett. I lived in Jeff Kennett's Victoria, and there was not a day in my life that I was not out trying to do something to get Jeff Kennett to no longer be the Premier of Victoria. He is not a man with whom I have shared any political common cause, but he is right on the degree of insensitivity that this ministest. ter has shown to people with mental illness. When a depression institute like beyondblue knocks itself out all day, every day to try to get community members to understand that people with mental illness should be dealt for with as human beings and their needs and concerns dealt with seriously, and that we should get over the stigma that we have historically applied to them, and when a man like Jeff Kennett is saying this minister has acted so dishonourably, then this minister should be offering his resignation. He has failed the Prime Minister's test, he has failed the test of his colleagues, he has failed the test of the community-and, for all of those reasons, he should go. But last, and by no means least, he has failed his own test. People in this parliament might well remember the day that this parliament struggled to come to terms with the suicide of a parliamentary member. I refer of course to the former member for Isaacs. We had a very emotional, heart-rending debate that day. I think that anybody who was in the parliament at that time would well recall it. I would like to remind the minister sitting here what he said on that day: One of the things which I know very much disappointed Greg Wilton in his time up here was the relentless character assassination which goes on both in public and in private. In public a government and opposition ruthlessly demonise each other, and in private people on both sides of the fence go around shoving the knife into their colleagues. This, sadly, has become an endemic way of life and I hope that the terrible tragedy that befell our late colleague will awaken us up to the need to change that, to try and be more generous to each other. He said that on the day that we were having the condolence motion for Greg Wilton. He was later asked on radio by Fran Kelly, ‘Will you change your tone?' and he said, ‘Yes, I will try.' Minister, you have failed your own You have failed it comprehensively and conclusively. Perhaps there is no worse test to fail than your own. If you are a decent human being, you will look inside yourself and realise that the right thing to do today is to resign.",66
122,Mr MCGAURAN,AGEING,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (3.52 pm)-We have just heard a speech on standards. I would like to ask the member for Lalor: where was she when one of her colleagues described a man who walks with calipers and walking sticks as ‘deformed'? Where was she when one of her colleagues described a senior, creditable and respected female journalist as a stinking whore? Where was she when one of her colleagues described a senior male journalist as a junkie and a cocaine addict? Where was she? All those comments were made by the former member for Werriwa and were documented over a period of time. With regard to the female journalist, Mark Latham made the comment in this House on 14 November 2002. With regard to the male journalist, he made the comment on 15 October 2002. With regard to Mr Tony Staley, he described him as a ‘deformed character' on 3 May 2002. Did the member for Lalor ever condemn Mark Latham for those comments? No. She was his numbers man to elevate him to the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. That was the ‘condemnation' of Mark Latham for his character assassination and mockery of people's physical appearance: to elevate him to the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. The Minister for Health and Ageing has described his comments as crass and ‘insensitive' and has apologised sincerely and genuinely for them. He accepts the admonishment of his colleagues and the community but he does not accept the admonishment of the member for Lalor-please! The member for Lalor said that there is some play-acting going on in the House today. There certainly is and it is coming from the member for Lalor, the Leader of the Opposition and those colleagues who support this trumped-up censure motion. The Minister for Health and Ageing clarified his remarks yesterday. He has repeatedly said that he apologises, in a way that I have not heard many, if any, other members of parliament say. I have certainly not heard it from the Labor Party with regard to Mark Latham. Those comments are just some of the mildest of Mark Latham's personalisations. Mr Ripoll interjecting",67
123,Mr MCGAURAN,AGEING,"I heard the member for Oxley-it is a bit hard to remember him; he is not the highest-profile memberinterject with: ‘And where is he now?' The point is that you made him the Leader of the Opposition and you put him up as the alternative Prime Minister. It is all very well now to wash your hands of Mark Latham. Mark Latham poisoned the Labor Party and damaged its reputation. The Minister for Health and Ageing has apologised in the most fulsome of ways, and members of the opposition know it. The members of the opposition know that he is genuine and sincere in his apology. His regret at saying what he said is plain and obvious to all. The hypocrisy-there is no other word for it and it was a word employed by Mark Latham on countless occasions-of the Labor Party, when they tolerated the worse possible standards from within their own ranks and in fact rewarded the purveyor of those low standards, is breathtaking. It is simply unacceptable for the Labor Party to assume, in a sanctimonious way, such a shroud of superiority and morality when they, quite frankly, will never come to the dispatch box or rise in their places and apologise for their insults. They play their politics hard and rough. They give no quarter and, in most cases, ask no quarter, whereas the Minister for Health and Ageing deeply regrets what he said and the context. He has made that perfectly plain to the public and to this House. He has therefore lived up to the requirements and responsibilities of his high office. The Minister for Health and Ageing is respected across party lines in this House as an honourable and decent human being. He has said to this House that he is far from perfect. He is stating the obvious human condition, naturally, but there is no doubt that many people hold the Minister for Health and Ageing in the highest regard. Those of us who work with him know of his idealism as well as his energy and commitment to public life and the ideals of public office. When he falls short of them-as all of us do from time to time-he has no hesitation in acknowledging his failings, faults and shortcomings. On this particular day, with regard to this particular instance, he has apologised fully and properly, as he ought. Moreover, he accepts the criticisms that others will make of him. But there has to be a line drawn and the Labor Party knows it. The Labor Party has crossed that line. The Labor Party and particularly the member for Lalor are being sanctimonious and lecturing from on high. The member for Lalor should stand up and say that she disassociates herself from, apologises for and regrets her support for Mark Latham, given his personal demonising of a great many people. Where do I start? There are several pages. What about Kerry Packer? Does the member for Lalor agree with what Mark Latham, your former leader, who you more than anybody else put into the position of Leader of the Opposition and helped keep him there, said in the Hansard-and these are always in the Hansard, with the protection of privilege-on 24 November 1999? He said: ... Kerry Packer would have been guilty of tax fraud numerous times in the 1980s ... He has more tax schemes than I have had hot lunches. He then goes on and on. I illustrate the point that the member for Lalor and those around her not only tolerated Mark Latham's excesses, never apologised for them or required him to apologise for them but then voted him leader of their party. That was the standard that they aspired to. That was what they endorsed and embraced. Thankfully, the Australian people saw through the bovver boy and bullying approach and standards that Mr Latham and his party brought to public life. The Minister for Health and Ageing is an imperfect person. Is there anybody here who is not? He recognises his faults. He has apologised for them, and that will be accepted and understood by any person of goodwill. Most certainly you can quote members of the public who are disappointed by and censorious of the minister's comments, as he is himself. All of us will learn from such intemperate remarks. But there has to come a point where people see the politics being played on this by the Australian Labor Party. It is a pity that, on a day when the Minister for Health and Ageing in discharging his responsibilities so admirably as an outstanding minister for health has announced the highest level of GP bulk-billing in country areas as a percentage of services bulkbilled, the Labor Party personalises his role. Just to be a little parochial and selfish here, I turn to my own electorate of Gippsland. Over the last 12 months the percentage of services bulk-billed in Gippsland has increased from 64.6 per cent to-wait for it76.3 per cent, an increase of 11.7 per cent. Overall, the nation's GP bulk-billing rate has reached almost 75 per cent. Much of that is due entirely to the minister's work with his staff and with the department in enlisting the had support of the government. He has been innovative and adventurous in his reforms of Medicare, and that has brought about tangible, real benefits for Australians. Whatever failings the minister has-and, as he has said, it is a severe failing on this occasion-his work in living up to the requirements and ideals of his office is entirely admirable. We thank the Minister for Health and Ageing for all the energy and enthusiasm he brings to the government. He is an inspiration to those of us who work closely with him, because, whatever his faults and flaws-and again I stress: who do we work with closely in whom we cannot identify faults and flaws?-his strengths and abilities serve this nation well, and it is over the top for the Labor Party to call for his resignation. The Labor Party, like the minister's own colleagues and the public, are perfectly within their rights and indeed entitled to call for his apology and to be convinced of its veracity. But, having apologised, the minister needs to get back to work because the work he is doing on behalf of the Australian community is invaluable. He has done a great deal more in the interests of his constituency and the Australian community than any on the Labor Party side could ever lay claim to. I was rather amused by a number of comments from the Leader of the Opposition but I will seize on one. For some reason, he went down the path of branch stacking-a Labor Party leader talking about branch stacking as if somehow our branch stacking is worse than their branch stacking! It is just an absurdity. The Leader of the Opposition said that under Labor Party rules you cannot stack a whole branch. Tell that to the member for Maribyrnong, the member for Corio and the member for Hotham, all three of whom are very likely to lose their seats to branch stackers. And the member for Corio and the member for Maribyrnong are both frontbenchers. When is the Leader of the Opposition going to show some strength? When is the Leader of the Opposition going to tell off the factional war lords who are stacking the branches? He has conceded that, by the way; he told the world that there is branch stacking going on in the Labor Party-as if he could deny it. When is he going to tell them: ‘Hands off my frontbenchers'? When is he going to show some leadership, some strength? When is he going to stand by his performing shadow ministers? Mind you, they have not got much chance to perform, but I think they are better performing than the alternatives. And there are several other members from Victoria sitting quietly, hoping not to attract the attention of the branch stackers. Mr Murphy- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to relevance to the motion before the chair.",67
124,The SPEAKER,AGEING,This is a censure motion. A wide-ranging debate has already occurred. The minister is in order.,69
125,Mr MCGAURAN,AGEING,"There is a point of order about me talking about branch stacking-the Leader of the Opposition introduced it into the debate. I think the Labor Party should get its lines right here. The Leader of the Opposition wandered down the road of branch stacking and, in doing so, entrapped himself in the Byzantine politics of Victoria-not that other states are immune from Labor Party standover tactics and factional warfare. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: of all the issues that are important to a number of his colleagues, surely their survival, particularly based on their performance, ranks above everything else? When will he defend them? When will the spotlight be put on the Leader of the Opposition? He comes in here with confected rage and then introduces a new topic into the censure motion but fails to follow through. I will follow through for him. Stand up for your colleagues. That is the test of leadership. That is the measure of loyalty. The Minister for Health and Ageing is above all else a man of ideas. The Labor Party deeply resent that. The Labor Party always tackle the warriors in the Liberal and National parties. I have noticed in my two decades in this place that the Labor Party always single out those who are most effective and those whom they most fear. It does not matter whether it was Ian Sinclair or the Prime Minister in past days or Doug Anthony or Tony Staley. They target a person and never give up until they trash their reputation and diminish their standing-but they will not succeed on this occasion and they have not succeeded in the past, because they always go too far. They always personalise it. They always reveal their particular demons, because in this way the Labor Party believe they can derive energy; they derive motivation from attacking individuals. But in this case it is obvious to any fair-minded person in this place or outside this place that the Labor Party have overplayed their hand. The Minister for Health and Ageing has not attempted to excuse or talk away his comments. He has faced up to them and has accepted the censure of the general public and his colleagues. He has apologised as strongly as anybody can. In doing so, he can move forward to fulfil his responsibilities and his tasks as a minister as strongly and as fervently in the future as he has in the past.

131,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In question time the Prime Minister said that, during the press conference I gave today, I suggested that Australian service personnel should-and I use the exact expression that the Prime Minister used-‘commandeer' a helicopter and take it into New Orleans. ‘Commandeer', as you would appreciate, Mr Speaker, has the particular meaning of ‘seizing control' of a helicopter and going into the business. Here is what I said, on the only occasions that I can find myself referring in any way to helicopters: Look, I was Defence minister for a few years. You've got your special mates in your equivalent defence forces in the United States. You ring up your special mates and you jump on a chopper. That's what you do. Then elsewhere, I said: I have a family connection in Baton Rouge, so we had a very clear-cut picture of what life was like there and things were-though the electricity was off-things were manageable and basically they could have got in very quickly to Baton Rouge and started to get themselves onto the choppers. I made it quite clear, of course, that they would take advantage of getting into a helicopter to go in and help the Australian public. You do not let bureaucrats get in the way of rescuing Australians.",71

137,Mr BALDWIN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On Saturday, 3 September in the Newcastle Herald, there was an article in relation to the Boeing workers headed ‘Battle of wits'. That article states: Striking worker and AWU delegate Mr Adam Zadai says ... Mr Baldwin had declined to meet with them either in his office or on the picket. What's worse, he actually went onto the base and met with a scab. That is incorrect. On 7 June, a couple of days after they had gone on strike, I met with Adam Bergoyne and Bruce Foster from the striking workers' unions. I have not been on the RAAF base since that strike started. That has nothing to do with the Boeing workers; I just have not had the opportunity to go out there. Therefore, as to both facts, this is incorrect.",71

142,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"On 17 August this year, the member for Paterson raised a matter of privilege concerning an email and facsimile letter that he received from Mike Berwick, Mayor of Douglas Shire Council. The member claimed that, in his letter, Mr Berwick threatened legal action against the member for Paterson should he raise certain matters in the House relating to allegations the member has put to the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission. Any attempt to threaten a member with a view to influencing a member's performance of his or her duties as a member is a serious matter and potentially could be considered a contempt if the threat amounted to an improper interference with a member. In a previous case that has some similarities with the one raised by the member for Paterson, the Committee of Privileges recognised that there were competing interests in such cases. On the one hand, members should be able to pursue matters freely without threat or intimidation. On the other hand, citizens have a basic right to protect their reputation, including using legal means to do so. In that particular case, the committee found the threat to commence legal action against the member did have a tendency to impair the member's independence in the performance of his duty, but the committee did not make a finding that there was an intention to intimidate or influence the member in an improper way. In the case raised by the member, I think similar issues of balance arise. The member should feel free to raiseparticularly in the House-any matters that he considers important to pursue. On the other hand, it is understandable that individuals will seek to defend their reputation against what they may see as inaccurate accusations. Having examined the correspondence provided by the member, I agree that the warnings made in the letter from Mr Berwick are not desirable and I can understand that the member for Paterson might see them as threatening. However, on the information available to this point, it is not clear that a prima facie case of contempt has been established in respect of the letter sent by Mr Berwick. Of course, if the member has any other material relating to this matter or if other similar approaches are made to him, I would be prepared to reconsider the issue.",72
143,Mr BALDWIN,PRIVILEGE,"Paterson) (4.22 pm)Mr Speaker, I accept your ruling, but there have been further exchanges of information between Mr Berwick and me. I will be assembling those and bringing them to this parliament as a further matter of privilege. NA",73

WE OPPOSE the Howard Government's plans to: - Remove employment conditions from awards. - Change the way minimum wages are set to make them lower. - Use individual contracts to undercut existing rights and conditions. - Keep unions out of workplaces and reduce workers' negotiating and bargaining rights. - Abolish redundancy pay and protection from unfair dismissals for the 3 million people who work in small businesses. - Reduce the powers of the independent Industrial Relations Commission to settle disputes and set fair minimum standards at work. - Take away rights at work by using federal laws to unilaterally override and weaken State industrial relations systems, awards and agreements. And we, your petitioners, ask the House to ensure that the Government upholds Australians' rights at work and does not implement these plans that we oppose. by Mr Hartsuyker (from 19 citizens) by Mr Jull (from 63 citizens) by Mr Melham (from 223 citizens) Workplace Relations To the Honourable Speaker of the House and Members of the House assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that Australeadership lian employees will be worse off as a result of Howard Government's proposed changes to the industrial relations system. The petitioners call upon the Howard Government to adopt a plan to produce a fair industrial relations system based on fairness and the fundamental principles of minimum standards, wages and conditions; safety nets; an independent umpire; the right to associate; and the right to collectively bargain. The Petitioners therefore ask the House to ensure that the Howard Government: (1) Guarantees that no individual Australia employee will be worse off under proposed changes to the industrial relation system. (2) Allows the National Minimum Wage to continue to be set annually by the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. (3) Guarantees that unfair dismissal law changes will not enable employers to unfairly sack employees. (4) Ensures that workers have the right to reject individual contracts and bargain for decent wages and conditions collectively. (5) Keeps in place safety nets for minimum wages and conditions. (6) Adopt Federal Labor's principles to produce a fair system based on the fundamental principles on minimum standards, wages and conditions; safety nets; and independent umpire; the right to associate; and the right to collectively bargain. by Mrs Irwin (from 987 citizens) by Mr Murphy (from 504 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Dafa To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia and visitors of Australia, draw to the attention of the House the persecution of Falun Dafa in China. Since 1992, Falun Dafa touched over 100 million people in over 40 countries. In July 1999, China's launched a crackdown on Falun Dafa. the The crackdown is a breach of basic human rights and the fundamental rights to assembly and free expression. Since then, over 100 million Falun Dafa practitioners (including more than 130 who have been persecuted to death), peacefully endure the unfair treatment for the sake of the principles “Truthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance”. Your petitioners therefore pray the House to act immediately on behalf of the petitioners to address China's leadership “in order to resolve the present crises that is taking place in China”, to urge China's leadership: 1) To stop the persecution of Falun Dafa immediately. 2) To withdraw the warrant of arrest of Mr Li Hongzhi immediately. 3) To stop torture and release all jailed Falun Dafa practitioners immediately. 4) To clarify all false propaganda used to defame Falun Dafa immediately. by Mr Albanese (from 735 citizens) Health: Public Dental Clinics The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the appalling availability of dental services through out rural and regional Australia in Public Dental Clinics for those in most need. This is caused primarily by inadequate staffing levels due to low salaries paid to lecturers in universities and the length of time required to train dentists. Your petitioners Therefore pray that the House will take the necessary action to train and fund adequate numbers of dentists willing to staff Public Dental Clinics throughout Australia to provide emergency dental care as well as maintenance and oral education to all citizens deemed eligible under current government policy. by Mr Andren (from 1,008 citizens) To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain members of the Heatherwood School community and Glen Waverley residents draws to the attention of the house our request to have our following message to the Japanese Ambassador, passed on. We oppose any attempt by the Government of Japan to increase whale kills in our region or elsewhere. We oppose in principle any form of whale slaughter for any purpose. Our message is as follows: Government of Japan please stop killing whales. Why do you kill and hunt these wonderful animals that are under threat of extinction? Stop hunting now. Your petitioners therefore request the House to pass on our message in the most powerful way on an ongoing basis. by Mr Burke (from 181 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Dafa To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: (a) Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa), a practice of meditation and exercises with teachings based on the universal principle of “Truthfulness-Compassion-Tolerance”, practiced in over 60 countries world-wide and has roots in traditional Chinese culture - has been subject to a systematic campaign of eradication in China since July 1999; (b) The Falun Dafa Information Center has verified details of 1023 deaths (as at 1/9/2004) since the persecution of Falun Gong in China began in 1999. In October 2001, however, Government officials inside China reported that the actual death toll was well over 1,600. Expert sources now estimate that figure to be much higher. Hundreds of thousands have been detained, with more than 100,000 being sentenced to forced labour camps, typically Whaling without trial; (c) The implementation of this policy of eradication violates the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China has signed, the Convention Against Torture and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, both of which China has signed and ratified. Your petitioners therefore request the house to initiate a resolution to condemn china's persecution of Falun Gong at all levels of government and request china to: I. Unconditionally release all Falun Gong practitioners imprisoned for their spiritual beliefs, including those family members of Australian citizens and residents currently detained; II. Allow unrestricted access into China to the United Nations rapporteur on torture, in order to carry out independent, third-party investigations on the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. by Mr Entsch (from 353 citizens) Electronic Banking To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Wakefield draws to the attention of the House that the community of ROSEWORTHY is an expanding rural community that presently has no ELECTRONIC BANKING service available at the Post Office. Under the promise of the Liberal Government, Roseworthy has been identified amongst those communities to receive ""Bank at Post"". The installation of this service and the fulfilment of this promise could take up to eighteen months. Meanwhile time members of the community are required to take their business elsewhere. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to recognize the needs for ELECTRONIC BANKING in the Post Office of Roseworthy and install this essential service with the highest priority by Mr Fawcett (from 273 citizens) Indigenous Australians To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition on certain citizens of Australia draws the following issues to the attention of the House: - Funding is urgently needed for Indigenous people disadvantaged by low-incomes, who suffer with incontinence. - Funding is also urgently required for the introduction of educational programmes in schools and healthcare facilities on the prevention of incontinence. Your petitioners therefore request the House to make funding available for Indigenous Australians who suffer with Incontinence. by Mr Fawcett (from 204 citizens) Employee Entitlements To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House, the need to change the laws to properly protect Australian workers when companies go bust. Your petitioners therefore ask the House for provision for payment of 100% of employee entitlements including unpaid superannuation to be paid to employees. We also reject income limits that prevent many salaried workers claims and support provision for payments also to contract workers. by Mr Laurie Ferguson (from 272 citizens) Environment: Kyoto Protocol To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: - That the Kyoto Protocol represents an essential first step in addressing the threat posed by global climate change; - That Australia, being the only developed country other than the USA refusing to ratify the protocol, is undermining international cooperation in this area; We therefore pray that the House urges the Government to ratify the Kyoto Protocol without delay. by Mr Martin Ferguson (from 18 citizens) Political Prisoners To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the following issues to the attention of the House: - That Dr Samir Geagea and Jirjis al Khouri are political prisoners in Lebanon who stand for democracy. have wrongly been convicted and sentenced to an indefinite period. - Both men have been held for over 10 years in solitary confinement in cruel inhuman and degrading conditions. in a manner detrimental to their physical and mental health. - Amnesty International and Cedarwatch have monitored Dr Giagea's situation and have strongly campaigned for his release and the release of his co accused, Jirjis al Khouri. Amnesty International and Cedarwatch have also criticised the occurrence of torture and incarceration as a result of Syrian occupation in Lebanon. We therefore pray that the House joins the Australian Lebanese and Amnesty International in taking urgent and immediate action in compelling the Lebanese government to free Dr Samir Geagea and Jirjis al-Khouri and bring its judiciary to international standards. by Mr Martin Ferguson (from 242 citizens) Globalisation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the undersigned, are sick to death of the misery and destruction which globalisation has wreaked on this country since it was adopted beginning 1983 by the Hawke/Keating governments, and continued by the Howard government. Except for a handful of the very wealthy, the globalisation policies of free trade, floating change rates, privatisation, competition policy, etc. have been a disaster for virtually all Austraers lians, including local government bodies, trade unions, Aborigines, ethnic groups, immigrants, students and teachers, healthcare providers, the rural sector, small business, the poor, the unemployed, the aged and disabled, and many other average, struggling Australians. Outside Australia, globalisation has produced a severe international economic crisis, with potential dire consequences for Australia. Therefore, we urgently demand that the Parliament begin immediate moves toward the nearterm establishment and participation by Australia in a New Bretton Woods international monetary system, as proposed by American statesman and physical economist Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jnr. The New Bretton Woods would revive the best policies of the old Bretton Woods monetary system of 1944-1971, such as fixed exchange rates, tariff protection, great infrastructure projects, and credit directed to agriculture and industry, instead of into speculation. These policies fostered almost three decades of steady, even spectacular world economic growth in the wake of World War II, including in Australia. In this new system, national banks would replace the present privately owned or controlled ‘independent' central banks, such as Australia's Reserve Bank. For Australia, this would mean a new national bank modelled on King O'Malley's original conception of the Commonwealth Bank, with wide powers to keep our callous private banks in line. A severe international economic and monetary crisis is already upon us; we must act now! by Mr Fitzgibbon (from 2,431 citizens) Environment: Ambrosia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain residents of the City of Maitland in the state of New South Wales draws the attention of the House to the rapid spread of Ambrosia more commonly known as Rag weed in pastures and on banks of water ways in the Local Government Area of Maitland, NSW. ex- Your petitioners therefore ask the House to provide financial assistance to enable local landholdand others to eradicate this weed which is increasing in size and number, smothering pastures. We fear that if the weed in not controlled at the earliest opportunity it will become a major problem particularly if seed is carried along local waterways that flow into the Hunter River. by Mr Fitzgibbon (from 20 citizens) Shipping: Nuclear Armed and Powered To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled: We, the undersigned residents of Australia ask that the House of Representatives consider the health and welfare of the present and future residents of this country and the environmental impacts of possible negative impacts relating to the visits of nuclear powered and/armed vessels into Australian ports. Nuclear navies are not welcome here whatever the colour of their flags. The recent spate of accidents involving nuclearpowered submarines should be enough to convince all governments that the risk to the environment of these floating Chernobyl's is a risk we don't have to take. Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Parliament legislate to prevent all visits of nuclear armed/powered vessels to Australian ports and waters. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever humbly pray. by Dr Lawrence (from 35 citizens) Family Law To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia points out to the House The current family law system, by failing to enshrine the right of the child to equal residence with both parents following separation and divorce is not operating in the best interest of chilcommit dren. Furthermore, proposed changes to family law by way of new relationship centres do not go far enough in guaranteeing equitable access for children and both parents. Our petitioners therefore request the House Continue the process of reform to enshrine the right of children to substantially equal residence with both parents in the event of separation & divorce. This is in the best interests of the child. Furthermore, the government should provide a means of ensuring that once made, contact orders Vessels are adhered to and that this should not require an application to the family court for enforcement. by Mr MCMullan (from 150 citizens) Mammograms To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We the undersigned residents of Australia draw to the attention of the House the lack of availability of free mammograms for women who have previously suffered Breast Cancer. We call upon the federal government to ensure that mammograms are free for all women, irrespective of their medical history. Women who have previously suffered breast cancer are more at risk and therefore more in need of this service. by Mr Melham (from 689 citizens) Environment: Kyoto Protocol To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned residents of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that - Australia is the only developed country, apart from the USA, refusing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol; - The Kyoto Protocol is a significant step in avoiding dangerous climate change and we must act now to ensure the health of our planet for future generations; and; - It is not too late for our nation to be part of the solution to global warming. We therefore request that the House legislate to Australia to the international effort to cut greenhouse gases by immediately ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. by Mr Murphy (from 205 citizens) In-Vitro Fertilisation Petition to the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House, the significance of IVF in our community, the opportunity that IVF offers to couples who would otherwise never have a family, and that 1 in every 35 babies born in Australia are as a result of IVF treatment. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to ensure no changes are made to current Medicare funding of IVF treatments as proposed by the Howard Government. by Mr Murphy (from 40 citizens) Mobile Phone Component Compatibility To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned residents of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that - There is a vast range of mobile phones now available in Australia; - The numerous types of mobile phone accessories (in-car chargers, ear phones, AC power chargers, car kits memory cards and USB connections) and batteries are often incompatible between models and or manufacturers; and; - The incompatibility of these components results in components being junked, increasing waste and threatening the environment. We therefore request that the House legislate to ensure all mobile phones and accessories sofa in Australia have standard plugs and connections. by Mr Murphy (from 32 citizens) Registered Dog Breeds To the Speaker and Honourable Members of the House of Representatives, Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia The undersigned dog owners and breeders of Australia aged 18 years and over, petition you in regard to the welfare of dogs in Australia. Recent legislative changes forced by extreme Animal Liberation Animal Rights organizations in a few European countries have seen the banning of the proven husbandry practice of tail docking. Further actions are being considered, such as banning breeds >15kg weight, or >45cm height, or which have a ‘pug' face, etc. Such changes are for ideological rather than scientific reasons. There is sound, scientific evidence that docking the tail of a pup <5 days old is not painful and has no untoward implications for the future; rather it protects against tail injury or putrid perianal soiling in about one-third of all breeds. Recent changes to State and Territory laws have removed the legal right of registered dog breeders to dock pups' tails and even registered veterinary practitioners now no longer have freedom of choice. The genetic material and biodiversity enshrined in the wide range of dog breeds is now threatened and we will fight passionately to avoid yet another threat to our deteriorating world environment. Australia is prominent in the international dog world, exporting and importing genetic material; the new State laws threaten such interaction with major populations such as the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan and in fact the entire world, with the exception of a few members of the European Union. Dog breeders of Australia petition our Federal Government to: 1. Urgently enact Federal Legislation that returns to registered dog breeders, and to Veterinary Practitioners, the legal and professional right to determine which veterinary procedures may be performed on their dogs. 2. Urgently take the necessary steps to ensure that the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) is permanently represented on the National Consultative Council for Animal Welfare (NCCAW), to maintain balance and work alongside members of this Council, viz., the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA), RSPCA, Animals Australia (animal liberation umbrella group), National Farmers Federation (NFF), National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Environment Australia, and State and Federal Governments. 3. Urgently enact Federal legislation to ensure that Australian citizens are able to own and breed purebred dogs of their choice, other than breeds banned (e.g. due to dangerous temperament) by the Australian Government in conjunction with the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) by Dr Nelson (from 12,470 citizens) Iran: Nuclear Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives and Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws your attention to the danger of a major military, conflict in 2005 between Iran, the USA and Israel, spreading to neighbouring countries, triggered by the Tehran regime's quest to acquire nuclear weapons. This could escalate into a nuclear war with massive global consequences. The Tehran regime is in major breach of its obligations to uphold basic human rights, and its obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Like Israel, it has no justification for acquiring nuclear weapons. The world would not know of this nuclear program except forits exposure by Iran's main opposition., the National Council of Resistance of Iran. The people of Iran must play the major role in determining their own future and therefore the democratic opposition in Iran should have global support to do so. The Tehran regime is notorious for its acts of terrorism. in the Middle East and Latin America. and its long record of assassination of opponents in exile in Europe and elsewhere. Yet. Australia and other Western countries have engaged with Tehran and even agreed to suppress Iran's legitimate democratic opposition movement including the National Council of Resistance of Iran and the People's Mojahedin Organisation of Iran (MEK) by raiding its supporters in exile and classifying their organizations as terrorist groups. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: - urgently request the Australian Government to ‘de-list' the National Council of Resistance of Iran and the People's Mojahedin Organisation of Iran (MEK) from the list of terrorist organisations maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs. - urgently request the Australian Government to call on the United Nations Security Council to act to de-escalate this crisis aging the withdrawal of threats of military action all parties, and instituting a verifiable program of nuclear disarmament for Iran and Israel, and part of the larger program of nuclear disarmament in the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. by Ms Plibersek (from 17 citizens) Environment: Bufo Marinus To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament We, the undersign draw to the attention of the House the following:Since bufo marinus (cane toad) was introduced into Australia from Hawaii in 1935 to control scarab beetles, a sugar cane pest in North Queensland, it has become a pest and a dangerous species itself to our wildlife and environment. The cane toad has reproduced by the billions and has spread into Northern New South Wales and across much of the tropical wilderness region of the Northern Territory. It can breed twice a year. The female can lay 10 thousand to 30,000 eggs each breeding. The eggs can hatch in 2 to 3 days. The eggs, tadpoles and toadlets are all toxic. Some animals die if they eat them. An adult cane toad exudes a powerful toxin over its skin from paratoid glands at the sides of its head capable of killing native predators-fish, crocodiles, dingos, snakes, goannas, quoits, and egrets-who see them as food. It causes rapid heartbeat, convulsions aid paralysis. We, therefore, urge the Federal Government to provide substantial funds to speed up research into developing a regulator virus that scientists believe will act as a vehicle for a genetic trigger that causes the toads to stop maturing and die when still tadpoles. We understand that it could take up to 10 years to introduce the virus to wipe out the cane toad though. In which case, before they move into sensitive areas of Western Australia like the Kimberleys, we request additional and urgent funds be provided to trap and kill manually adult cane toads, their eggs, tadpoles and toadlets. Cane toad hunters need to be trained to identity them from by encourother similar-looking frogs. Your petitioners call upon the House to support our urgent request for adequate funds to assist in the control and eventual eradication of bufo marinus (cane toad) from Australia. by Ms Plibersek (from 125 citizens) Public Housing To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain Sisters of Saint Joseph and their associates in mission draws to the attention of the House that a significant number of Australian citizens do not have access to safe, secure and affordable housing. We believe that it is the role of government to ensure the achievement of this fundamental human right. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House make the right to a home for all a priority by increasing funding for public housing and accompanying support services.  Child Support To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia points out to the House The Child Support Formula calculating amounts to be paid has always been fatally flawed and must be amended. Our petitioners therefore request the House Immediately use the Task Force report on Child Support as a starting point to amend the formula. The Government must also amend the Task Force recommendations so that: NO PAYER currently paying over $20 per week will be worse off under any new formula. And: Mutual obligation must be legislated for child support amounts that are above the cost of raising a child. To facilitate this a parenting plan lodged with the Child Support Agency, and adhered to. by Mr Schultz (from 145 citizens) Petitions received. NA Responses",73
145,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Ministerial response to a petition previously presented to the House has been received as follows: Mobile Phone Service Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Senator the Hon Helen Coonan Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600 Telephone: (02) 6277 7480 Facsimile: (02) 6273 4154 www.minister.dcita.gov.au Mrs Kay Hull MP Member for Riverina Suite 2, 11-15 Fitzmaurice Street WAGGA WAGGA NSW 2650 Dear Mrs Hull Mobile phone coverage at Marrar I refer to your petition on mobile phone coverage at Marrar, NSW which was received by the House of Representatives on 23 May 2005. The Government appreciates the growing importance of mobile telephony to Australians and believes that full and open competition is the best way to give Australians access to a wide range of high quality, lower cost telecommunications services. In an open and competitive telecommunications market, the decision to provide mobile phone coverage is largely a commercial matter for mobile phone carriers. In making the decision to extend coverage to a particular area, a mobile phone carrier will consider a range of factors including site availability, cost structures, likely levels of demand from users and overall economic viability of the service. It is not commercially viable to provide terrestrial mobile phone must be coverage in all areas of Australia. Advice was sought from Telstra about existing and any planned mobile phone coverage in the Marrar area. Telstra has acknowledged that mobile phone coverage in the district is patchy. Telstra has identified Marrar as a high priority and is actively working with the Coolamon Shire and community groups to improve CDMA coverage in the district. Telstra has advised that it is currently conducting a feasibility study for site acquisition. In areas that are sparsely populated or have little passing traffic, the only commercially viable option for mobile phone services is via satellite. Satellite mobile phone services cover the entire Australian landmass and population and are available from a number of providers. Further, residents of rural and remote areas may be eligible for assistance under the Government's Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme if they are unable to access terrestrial mobile phone networks. This subsidy provides up to $1,500 (including GST), depending on the monthly access plan chosen, to eligible people who live or work in areas without terrestrial mobile phone coverage, including maritime and aviation users who meet the eligibility criteria. Applicants for the subsidy must have their eligibility approved before they purchase a phone. Subsidies will not be paid retrospectively for phones already purchased. The Government has allocated a total of $6.9 million to the scheme as part of its commitment to improve mobile phone services in remote areas of Australia. I would also like to draw to your constituents' attention that dual-mode satellite/GSM and dualmode satellite/CDMA phones are available in the market. These phones enable the user to switch over to the satellite network when they are in areas beyond terrestrial mobile phone coverage. The Government subsidises the purchase of such phones by eligible applicants under the Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme. Dual-mode phones may suit the needs of residents of Marrar. Information about the scheme and application forms are available on the website of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts at www.dcita.gov.au/satphone. An information kit can be obtained by contacting the scheme administrator on freecall 1800 674 058 or email satphone@dcita.gov.au. Thank you for bringing your constituents' concerns to my attention.

146,Mr BARTLETT,HELEN COONAN,"I move: That this House: (1) recognises: (a) the extent and gravity of world poverty and the urgency of tackling this situation; and (b) that the most impoverished countries cannot escape the cycle of poverty without assistance; (2) acknowledges recent efforts by the Australian Government including increases in the Australian aid budget; (3) supports the Millenium Development Goals and world efforts to have world poverty by 2015; and (4) urges the Australian Government to continue to work towards the achievement of those goals. A quick snapshot of the desperate situation facing the impoverished people of the world is a strong reminder of the need for concerted and urgent action to reduce poverty. Over one billion people live on less than $1 a day and three billion on less than $2 a day. Some 113 million children do not attend school, of which 60 per cent are girls. Youth literacy levels are less than 80 per cent in the world's poorest countries. Every year around 11 million children under five years of age die of mainly preventable illnesses. Maternal mortality levels are unacceptably high-up to 670 per 100,000 live births, some 50 to 60 times higher than in wealthier countriesand over half a million women a year die during pregnancy or childbirth. An estimated 40 million people are living with HIV-AIDS, nearly one billion people live in urban slums and half the developing world still lacks toilets or basic sanitation. The Millennium Development Goals, agreed to in 2000 by all UN members, including Australia, set out eight clear goals for halving poverty by 2015. The devastating effects of poverty and the extraordinary difficulty in breaking free from the selfgenerating cycles of poverty require protracted and determined help if we are to make poverty history. Three key approaches are needed if we are to move towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Firstly, wealthy countries need to increase their levels of aid and ensure that it is better targeted. Last year the Australian government increased its aid by a very substantial 11.7 per cent to $2.49 billion or 0.28 per cent of GDP. I would urge the government to continue these substantial increases so that we can move towards the UN objective of 0.5 per cent of GDP by 2010 and 0.7 per cent by 2015. However, it is not only the quantity of aid that matters; the quality, direction and appropriateness also determine its effectiveness. It is also imperative that government administration, policy and anticorruption measures be improved in recipient countries. Secondly, a fairer international trade regime and better access to world markets are also necessary to stimulate growth and to assist the development process. The vast majority of the world's poor work in the agriculture sector, and it is this sector which erally provides the best export potential but which also suffers most from the protectionist policies of the USA and the EU countries. Poorer countries need free and fair access to these markets and support to assist them to better participate in world trade. Australia has for a number of years been at the forefront of international efforts to phase out export subsidies and other forms of protection and trade barriers. We are also leading by example, putting in place one of the most generous and comprehensive access schemes for exports from poorer countries-applying zero tariffs to all goods originating in the world's 50 least developed countries. We need to keep pressure on other developed countries to follow suit. The third key avenue of assistance is through debt relief. Escaping the cycle of poverty is virtually impossible with the added pressure of insurmountable debt. The only way out is to lift that burden. Australia has shown strong support for this process by cancelling 100 per cent of the bilateral debt of Ethiopia, Iraq and Nicaragua. We have also contributed $122 million in multilateral funding through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. This multilateral program has not been working as quickly as it could have been, although the increased commitment by creditor countries following the G8 announcement was a step forward. It was pleasing to see Australia's increased commitment of an extra $10 million a year as part of this, and I look forward to this being delivered. It is imperative that all the world's wealthier countries focus on the Millennium Development Goals to reduce poverty, and I would strongly encourage the Australian government to continue to increase its aid commitment as well as to use its respected voice in the international arena to take a gen- leadership role, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.",83
147,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HELEN COONAN,Is the motion seconded? Mr Baird-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,84
148,Mr MCMULLAN,HELEN COONAN,"I congratulate the member for Macquarie for his initiative in introducing this motion. Too often in this parliament, and in public debate in Australia more broadly, the immediate displaces the important. We spend a lot of time focusing on whatever today's front-page story is, but in the great scheme of things nobody's life is better as a consequence and too little time is spent on the long-term things that can make a change to the lives of those in greatest need. The member for Macquarie has turned our attention to the most profound issue challenging the international community today, and I congratulate him for it. I substantially agree with the motion, although I will indicate one area where I do not. The motion starts with an absolutely correct focus on the extent and gravity of world poverty, and the member for Macquarie quite properly referred in his remarks to other broader issues also in the Millennium Development Goals, particularly as they relate to issues about AIDS, malaria and other diseases. I agree with that and with the second point about the recognition that most impoverished countries cannot escape the cycle of poverty without assistance. Too many times those of us in the developed world forget that almost every country that has now come to be a successful and developed country has at some stage in the past received assistance-whether it was the assistance that the United States received from France in the very first instance, when it was established, or the great assistance western Europe and Japan received after World War II, or the assistance that Korea received a decade later, or the assistance that Israel received, or the assistance that Germany, Poland and Russia received after the collapse of communism. In all those instances, those transitions could not have been successful but for the support of others. We have to be careful that we do not impose standards on the poorest countries of today that are struggling to break the cycle of poverty and that we do not ignore how much assistance all of us received in the past when we were struggling. I agree with what is in point 3 of the motion, where it talks about the importance of the Millennium Development Goals. I do not have time to talk about them at length today-I will have something to say about them in the near future-but one of the things that I welcome is that this shifts the focus of the debate from one about process and inputs to one about outcomes. It says: ‘Here are some measurable outcomes which we commit ourselves to and against which we are prepared to be measured as an international community.' I think that is a template that we should apply to our domestic activities, and I will have something more to say about that in the near future. Apart from welcoming the initiative and supporting what the member for Macquarie has raised, I wish to express my concern about the unsatisfactory Australian response to the Millennium Development Goals. At the Monterey meeting, which followed the establishment of the Millennium Development Goals and met to discuss what countries would commit, Australia was one of the few-perhaps one of only two-developed countries not to make a commitment. We did not send a minister, we have not committed to more support, and in its review of our aid that program the OECD made that situation clear. It is true that following a catastrophic fall in our aid support there has been a slight turnaround recently because of two very welcome initiatives which I support-the initiative about the Solomon Islands and the initiative about the tsunami. The government was right about both of those initiatives. I do not have any hesitation in supporting them, but they do not contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. That is not a criticism. They were things that needed to be done and I support them. But our aid is still no more than 0.28 per cent. It increased only as a result of that temporary blip, and it has lost its poverty focus. Australia is missing in action in the great debates about the initiative by Gordon Brown, from the United Kingdom, about the international finance facility and the initiative by the United States about millennium challenge accounts. These are people trying to find new ways to mobilise resources to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and Australia is either silent or negative about them. It is a moral and an economic imperative, and it is in our self-interest that we act. We now know what Jeffrey Sachs's report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations makes clear: we have the capacity, we have the technology and we have the wealth to make poverty history if we have the will to apply it. I welcome the initiative of the member for Macquarie in raising this motion. I do not agree with every word in it, but it is a positive initiative and I am pleased to speak to it. (Time expired)",84
149,Mr BAIRD,HELEN COONAN,"I, too, would like to congratulate the member for Macquarie on his motion today. I believe it expresses the sentiments of many of us in this House that the millennium goals are very worthwhile. One could not readily say that they are going to be easily achieved. Nevertheless, we on both sides of the House-and I was interested in the comments of the member for Fraser, who basically agreed with the motion by the member for Macquarie-recognise that we need to move in terms of world poverty and that we need to have much more focus in our aid. It may surprise him, because he said that he would not be agreeing with all in the motion, that I agree with him that we should be looking in the next budget at increasing the size of our aid. It is time that an affluent country like Australia looked seriously at increasing the proportion of our GDP spent on aid. If we look at various comparisons across the board we see that we come out at a reasonable level, but Australians are by nature a very generous people, as was seen by the response to the very significant aid donation that was given by this government to the tsunami appeal. That showed the sentiments of Australia in wanting to express their generosity. This aligns with the millennium goals of increasing our aid. It behoves all of us to recognise our responsibility to see this as a priority. We had One Nation wanting to take us the other way, saying: ‘Let's not spend our money overseas. Let's spend more of our money at home.' It is time for us to say: ‘We're not spending enough. Let's increase it in the future.' If we look over even the last 20 years, we see that aid as a percentage of GDP has not moved significantly. We need to recognise that Australia's GDP has increased significantly because of the effective management of the economy by this government. I was speaking to the member for Eden Monaro, who was saying, reflecting the grassroots support for the millennium goals, that he had received a large petition supporting the millennium goals signed by hundreds of people in Braidwood alone, which is going to be presented to the Prime Minister this week. With regard to the aspect of trade protection, I see here several members of the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade. We recognise that there is increased protection around the world and we want to see increased moves by the WTO to counter it. There has been a stalemate in greater liberalisation in the Doha Round. With greater trade liberalisation we are assisting less developed countries in getting their products to market. In this regard we think of the protection represented by the CAP in Europe and the problems of very poor African countries getting their fruit and agricultural products into the European Community with its very high levels of protection. We need to make sure that these goals of trade liberalisation are achieved. There is also the goal of debt relief. The huge burden on many of the poorest countries in repaying their debt is overwhelming. Although one might be cynical in talking about some of the Bob Geldof initiatives, it motivates young people into focusing on the problem of world debt and trying to relieve the suffering and the lack of equity in wealth distribution across nations. We can all think of the reasons why many of these countries have not repaid their debt and why they are in the situation they are in. Nevertheless, we need to show the necessary compassion in debt relief. We encourage the government to move in that direction. Also a part of the lennium goals is the equity of women, assisting in the education of young girls and assistance for those suffering from HIV-AIDSthis devastating disease which has affected so strongly many of the poorest countries in the world. What we have in the motion before us today by the member for Macquarie is one that both sides of the House can support strongly. We want to see the implementation of this agenda. We want to see the government recognise the problems of the poorest countries around the globe and address them through the means of increased focused aid, through removing some of the protection and through greater debt relief. (Time expired)",86
150,Ms HOARE,HELEN COONAN,"I note all of us on both sides of the House are in quite good company in speaking to this motion today. I am pleased to be able to speak to this motion on world poverty and the Millennium Development Goals and I congratulate the Chief Government Whip for raising these important issues in our parliament. The eight millennium goals, written by the 191 member states of the United Nations, concentrate on income generation, health, education, gender equality and environmental sustainability. The first millennium development goal is to have extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 by halving the proportion of people whose income is less than a dollar a day and halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. Over 80 developing countries have produced reports and have begun to reshape their budgets to MDG standards. The second goal is to ‘achieve universal primary education' by 2015 by ensuring that children everywhere will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling. The third goal is to ‘promote milgender equality and empower women' in all levels of education. Countries need to eliminate gender disparity in education. Recent studies have shown that school enrolments for girls are increasing faster than for boys. The fourth goal is to ‘reduce child mortality' by two-thirds by 2015, focusing on reducing the under-five mortality rate. The fifth goal is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters by 2015. The sixth goal is to have halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases by 2015. To this end the global fund has already given $3 billion to projects in 128 countries. The seventh goal is to ‘ensure environmental sustainability' by 2015. The eighth goal is to ‘develop a global partnership'. Australia's aid levels are low by international standards and fail to meet international agreements. Although, as has been mentioned, there was a slight increase in the total aid budget this year to 0.28 per cent, it still falls far short of the goal of 0.7 per cent of GNI, the aid is not focused on achieving MDGs and in the 2002-03 budget only 2.7 per cent of the total aid budget was allocated to the MDGs, which was equal to only about $49 million. The United Nations recommendation is that we increase our aid budget to 0.5 per cent of GNI, with a goal to reach the full commitment of 0.7 per cent by 2013. This increase in Australia's aid budget, at $A60 per person, would help 32.7 million people reach their MDGs. The benefits of this budget change could result in an average of 40,000 fewer child deaths per year, an average of 1,200 fewer maternal deaths per year, at least 9,000 fewer AIDS deaths each year, an average of 9,000 fewer deaths from TB each year, almost 11 million more people with access to safe drinking water and around 60,000 more children receiving basic education. The current aid program provides high levels of aid to PNG and other Pacific island nations, yet aid levels are much lower with regard to other parts of our region. Australia should make a significant and equitable contribution to the poorest nations, such as Cambodia, Laos, Burma and Vietnam, in order to fill the MDG expectations. Australia also needs to increase the proportion of the aid budget which goes toward reproductive health care, family planning and population activities. Obstetric complications are the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age in developing countries, and every minute one woman dies from a pregnancy related condition. When women are supported by investments in family planning and reproductive health care, their whole family is freed from poverty. The Make Poverty History campaign urges the Australian government to join 19 of its OECD partners in making a substantial commitment to the MDGs. Australia's position in the ODA ratio with GNI is 19th out of 22 OECD countries, even though the Australian population is in the top five most generous contributors to the development of the world. The Make Poverty History campaign recognises that the quality of aid contribution is as important as aid volume. An opportunity presented by the MDGs is to improve aid effectiveness by improving coordination between donors and recipients. The UN summit on the MDGs to be held in New York this month must be attended by the Prime Minister, who still has not yet indicated if he will attend. Australia must take its place among the developed nations of the world and reflect the generosity of Australians and their overwhelming support for overseas aid by making a strong, resource backed commitment to these MDGs.",87
151,Mrs MAY,HELEN COONAN,"I join my colleagues today in supporting the motion before the House on world poverty and the Millennium Development Goals, and I commend the member for Macquarie for bringing the motion to the notice of the House. Here are some facts on the gravity of world poverty. One out of every four people in developing countries lives in extreme poverty, earning less than $US1 a day. More than 800 million people go hungry every day and 300 million are children. Every 3.6 seconds, another person dies of starvation. At the Millennium Summit held in September 2000, representatives from 189 countries gathered at the United Nations General Assembly and unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration, a declaration that included a set of goals designed to focus international development efforts on the major challenges facing developing countries in poverty and hunger, education, gender equality, child and maternal mortality, health and the environment. The 2005 five-year review of the implementation of the Millennium Declaration is scheduled for this month. This review will be an opportunity for a renewed and sustained effort by all heads of state and governments around the world to tackle the issue of poverty in developing countries and to assess what has been achieved in five years and the enormous commitment that will be needed to continue to meet the Millennium Development Goals. I respectfully encourage our Prime Minister to attend that meeting and take with him the strong support from this parliament to the international community of Australia's commitment to the MDGs. My particular interest in the MDGs is the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women in developing countries. Achieving this goal will protect the human rights of women, including their reproductive rights. Thoraya Obaid, the Executive Director of UNFPA, whom I had the pleasure of meeting in Australia last year, has said: The ability of women to control their own fertility is absolutely fundamental to women's empowerment and equality. When a woman can plan her family, she can plan the rest of her life. When is healthy, she can be more productive. And when her reproductive rights ... are promoted and protected, she has freedom to participate more fully and equally in society. Reproductive rights are essential to women's advancement. Those words are so true. Sexual and reproductive ill health accounts for over one-third of the global burden of disease of women of child-bearing age. When women have access to family planning, they can balance the size of their family and timing of their children with their need and desire to get an education and to earn an income. Through the MDGs, the international community must guarantee women's and girls' human rights, including their reproductive rights. We need to ensure that every woman has access to sexual and reproductive health services, information and education. Globally, we need to combat all forms of violence against women. We need to prohibit practices that violate the rights of women and ensure that a gender perspective is incorporated into economic policies. Impoverished countries cannot escape the cycle of poverty without assistance, and I encourage this government to continue Australia's aid program with a view to increasing our commitment in next year's budget. We are a rich country. We have a vibrant and strong economy. We are in a position to give, and it is my belief that we need to continue that giving through AusAID and our long term commitments to countries such as Indonesia and the Solomon Islands. Mr Martin Ferguson-But that doesn't feature in Turnbull's considerations.",88
152,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HELEN COONAN,The member for Batman cannot help himself.,89
153,Mrs MAY,HELEN COONAN,"We need to recognise as a country that our ongoing commitment to she debt relief programs, health and education programs and in some cases rebuilding programs, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, will help strengthen the region and address some of the complex development challenges facing the region. Successful poverty reduction involves a combination of trade, debt relief and sound domestic policies. Partnerships between developed and developing countries are tantamount to reducing poverty and achieving sustainable growth for developing countries. The task is enormous. In fact, to develop a global partnership for development is an enormous goal, but in my view it can be achieved with all developed countries participating and showing a strong commitment to wanting to achieve the MDGs. The MDGs provide the international community with benchmarks, benchmarks that are achievable, benchmarks that will hopefully see the eradication of poverty, hunger, disease and gender inequality and the achievement of universal education, health and environmental sustainability. One of the most common reasons behind poverty is indifference. Instead of indifference, let us together, as a nation, make a difference. I commend the motion to the House.",89
154,Ms VAMVAKINOU,HELEN COONAN,"I join with my colleague the member for MCPherson to respectfully urge the Prime Minister to consider attending the UN summit later this month, which is aimed at reviewing the Millennium Development Goals. I also express my support for the motion of the member for Macquarie. This is a very important motion, as has already been stated by other colleagues, because it recognises and raises awareness of world poverty and the importance of the Millennium Development Goals. As such, it has a very important role to play in addressing and achieving those goals. The more we can bring attention to these issues, the more likely it is that will be addressed in some serious and definitive manner. At a time when so many resources across the globe are being invested in defence and conflict, it is heartening that this year world poverty has been placed firmly back onto the international agenda. Not since Bob Geldof united the globe in 1985 with his Live Aid concert has there been such international attention and awareness of the extent and gravity of world poverty. In July, we were again united through the Live 8 concert and the Make Poverty History campaign, which resulted not just in increased awareness but also in a commitment from the G8 Summit to boost aid to poverty stricken Africa by $25 billion and to cancel the debt of 18 of the most impoverished countries. Throughout the year, the United Nations has also been prominent in raising awareness of and in addressing the Millennium Development Goals to have world poverty. Although adopted in 2000, through massive awareness campaigns this year the Millennium Development Goals have become widely recognised. The progress in achieving these goals and deciding what now needs to be done to achieve them will be the subject of the United Nations world summit next week. Whilst the eight goals seem to deal with impossible problems, these goals can be achieved by addressing the issues of peace, security, development, human rights and fundamental freedoms in a single package and with unprecedented collaborative efforts. However, it is not just the G8 countries or the United Nations that are thinking about these issues. People all over the globe are expressing concern about the urgent need to address extreme poverty and to provide assistance to the world's most impoverished countries. I know the people in my electorate they are very deeply concerned. When I go out to visit schools, students and young children raise their concerns with me. Community groups and my constituents generally also raise these issues with me. My electorate is home to people of over 116 nationalities, so my constituents are from diverse backgrounds. When they talk to me, they often raise two concerns: firstly, for newer migrants, it is about their love of our country and their relief that they have been given the opportunity to start new lives in Australia; and, secondly, it is about their loved ones and about people they have left behind in troubled parts of the globe, such as the people from the Somali interrivine community, whom I have previously spoken about. Many Muslim Australians from countries in the Middle East and Africa constantly remind me of their concerns and of the need to address world poverty. The recent efforts by the Australian government are to be commended. Increasing the Australian aid budget is sensible and appropriate and I support this motion, which ‘urges the Australian Government to continue to work towards the achievement of those goals'. It is also important to encourage the government to work towards increasing Australia's contribution to the ultimate level of 0.7 per cent of our gross national income. As has been stated by other colleagues, we are still very much a lucky country and, as such, we have a responsibility to the rest of the world community that is living in poverty. It is heartening to know that Australians are generous people-and we have proved this in our phenomenal response to the tsunami disaster-who recognise our responsibilities and obligations. Indeed, we respond quickly and generously at the personal, corporate and government levels to the needs of the world community. We all have a role in raising awareness of these issues and by doing so we can keep these issues on the government's agenda and work towards achieving these vital goals. We can no longer afford to allow many millions of the human community to perish daily as a result of poverty while so many of us in other parts of the world live in comfort. I am very pleased to support the motion and congratulate the member for Macquarie. (Time expired)",90
155,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HELEN COONAN,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order for the next sitting. NA,91
156,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,COMMUNITY PHARMACIES,"I move: That this House: (1) expresses its opposition to major retail chains such as Woolworths and Coles being able to open pharmacies in supermarkets; and (2) reaffirms its support for community pharmacies and in doing so recognises that the extension of pharmacies to major retail supermarkets will: (a) lead to the closure of many community pharmacies, the majority of whom are hard working small businesses; (b) lead to the loss of jobs amongst the 30,000 assistants currently employed in community pharmacies; (c) put at risk the 80 million free services provided by community pharmacies to the Australian community, many of whom cannot afford the cost of going to the doctor due to the decline in bulk billing; and (d) lead to the reduction in training and career opportunities for people who have chosen pharmacy as their career. I move this motion relating to community pharmacies in an endeavour to increase the public awareness of the community fallout that will follow in the event that supermarkets are allowed to sell pharmaceutical products. Should this ridiculous proposal go ahead, it will mean that ordinary Australians will lose $80 million worth of free health services that are provided annually by their local pharmacies. Protecting public health must be the priority of government. It is not in the best interests of the Australian people or the already overburdened public health system to allow major retail chains to open pharmacies in supermarkets. Supermarket chains have no interest in public health; their interest is in profits at the expense of the health and well-being of Australians. It would be irresponsible and stupid to promote volume sales of potentially dangerous medicines in supermarkets. This has the potential to stand as another example of the government's crusade to put profits before the best interests of the Austragovernment lian people. What makes things worse is that, this time, the Howard government is willing to gamble with the ordinary health of Australians. According to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, last year there were 140,000 hospital admissions due to medication mismanagement, and 96,000 of these could have been avoided if patients had asked their pharmacist about their medications. These numbers could rise if supermarkets were allowed to take on the responsibility of the broadly accepted community standard of the role of pharmacists. I contend that pharmacists play an absolutely essential role within local, metropolitan, regional and remote communities of providing crucial advice to Australians on safe medicines practice. Pharmacists also provide cost-free solutions to health problems of Australians by recommending dietary or lifestyle changes that can combat recurring ailments rather than encouraging an overreliance on prescription medicines. Pharmacies alleviate the incredible load on the Australian health care system. Health professionals who work within pharmacies not only give ordinary Australians immediate and free health assistance but also provide invaluable and often unrecognised support to community doctors. Pharmacies are all too often the first point of call for many Australians who can no longer afford to go to the doctor due to the decline in bulk-billing The professional services provided by pharmacies are essential. We are committed to curbing the effects of the decline in bulkbilling, in the face of doctor shortages and longer waiting times. A cost-benefit study of the services that pharmacists and their staff provide with specific over-the-counter medications has estimated the value of their interventions to prevent serious health consequences at $2.6 billion a year. The Howard is barking up the wrong tree if it believes it is going to benefit Australian health by smashing local pharmacies. The economic cost to Australia will be enormous if this proposal goes ahead, not to mention the social effects that will be felt by ordinary Australian people when $80 million worth of free and immediate health services are taken away at the stroke of a pen. The future of the pharmaceutical profession is also at stake. Local pharmacies in my electorate have reinforced this point to my staff member Bernie Desmond. Pharmacists and tertiary students studying pharmacy are worried about their professional future. Community pharmacies employ around 30,000 pharmacy assistants and 15,000 pharmacists. Allowing supermarkets to sell pharmaceutical products would only exacerbate the shortage of existing trained staff that we face. If this farcical proposal goes ahead, local pharmacies will simply be unviable and pharmacies in rural areas will be especially threatened. This bill can potentially drive local pharmacies out of existence. I commend this motion to the House. I also say that the government is deluding itself if it thinks it can maintain through supermarkets the same quality of service that is provided to Australians through pharmacies at the moment and if it expects all the services to be delivered by supermarkets. Protecting public health is more important than corporate profits. Supermarkets will let commercial considerations take precedence over the health of ordinary Australians. After all, we should not forget that supermarkets sell cigarettes and alcohol, which are two of the major causes of death and serious illness in Australia at the moment. The last thing we should give those supermarkets is an input into the pharmaceutical industry of Australia. We rely on local pharmacies in suburbs and regional communities to actually look after the health of Australians. They are concerned about community health, not the profit bottom line.

157,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNITY PHARMACIES,Is the motion seconded?,93
158,Mr MELHAM,COMMUNITY PHARMACIES,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,93
159,Mr HENRY,COMMUNITY PHARMACIES,"Since taking office as the member for Hasluck in October 2004, I have had the great privilege of speaking on a number of bills in support of small businesses. Small businesses, epitomised as they are by the local pharmacy, stand at the heart of many communities throughout Australia. They provide a high level of service that is based on local knowledge and a thorough understanding of the needs of the communities they serve. I know not of the ‘farcical' arrangements the previous speaker spoke of; however, I am opposed to pharmacies in supermarkets. I do not believe that such a development would be in the best interests of Australians or Australia. I agree with the opinion piece that appeared in the edition of the West Australian of 4 August 2005 that said that, while such a move might reduce the cost of medicines at the start, once supermarkets got a grip on the market and had driven traditional community pharmacies to the wall, price rises would be an inevitable result. Local pharmacies offer a level of real service and expertise that, in my view, will never be found as part of a faceless supermarket chain. The prospect that the supermarket duopoly of Woolworths and Coles should be allowed to threaten the future viability of the local pharmacy is not one that is welcomed by the Australian public at large. The community's lack of support for such a move stems from the knowledge that supermarkets are unlikely to provide the professional and independent health advice that people seek from their pharmacists. In essence, the public do not trust, or expect, the supermarkets to have their best interests at heart. In my view, the increasing dominance of the Coles-Woolworths duopoly has brought about many undesirable results. Its rise in power is increasingly a cause of great concern within the community. Indeed, the impact on local choice and locally available services is now well recognised and discussed in the public arena. The future viability of many community focused businesses is under threat, whether they be local grocery stores, the local bottleshop, our service stations or indeed the local pharmacy. The duopoly's ability to dictate the price to suppliers seeking a market for their products is squeezing the suppliers' margins to such an extent that it threatens the future viability of growers and food producers throughout Australia. Indeed, many orchardists and horticulturists in and around my electorate of Hasluck are feeling the effect and are worrying about how they can get their products into the local market and about their futures as growers. The ability of Coles and Woolworths to restrict choice through their ownlabel policies and their ability to restrict access to supermarket shelves does not augur well for consumers. The duopoly now dominates 45 per cent or more of the packaged liquor industry and, thanks to its discount fuel scheme, independent service station operators are at risk of closure. Given this picture, I do not accept that we should allow these supermarket chains to set their sights on such a valuable community asset as the local pharmacy. The hole in the wall dispensary option that supermarket pharmacies represent has the potential to rip the guts out of community medicine. I agree with the comments made by the Executive Director of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, Mr Stephen Greenwood, in the 9 April 2004 edition of the Sydney Morning Herald when he describes as ‘disingenuous' the claims of the big supermarkets that pharmacies oppose the supermarkets out of a desire to protect a magnificent income stream. The group of medicines with the highest mark-up and therefore with the greatest potential to be discounted by the supermarkets are those, in Mr Greenwood's words, that are products that ‘nobody in the health profession wants heavily promoted'. These items include asthma medications, nicotine replacement therapies and cough and cold remedies as well as pain-killing medications. These drugs are powerful and many are potentially addictive and carry the possibility of adversely interacting with medications. Local and community based pharmacies play a crucial role in providing quality impartial advice to consumers on the use of medicines and on general health issues. The care and services provided by local pharmacies located throughout my electorate of Hasluck in the Gosnells, Thornlie, Guildford, Midland, Lesmurdie and Forrestfield marketplaces and in many other communities are absolutely outstanding. These pharmacies do a fantastic job, and the supermarket duopoly should not be allowed to put these community focused services under threat.",93
160,Mr MELHAM,COMMUNITY PHARMACIES,"I am pleased to support the motion put by my colleague the member for Batman and soon to be addressed by the member for Shortland. I have with me petitions returned to me by my constituents expressing their concern at the plan by this government to allow the operation of pharmacies in supermarkets. I sent these petitions less than two weeks ago to the 28 community pharmacies in the electorate of Banks. Almost 400 signatures have been returned to my office in that brief time, and I have had requests for many more copies of the petition. I have no doubt that the number will continue to grow. This is a return to the past. In the 1970s and early 1980s, pharmacies existed in department stores such as Grace Bros and David Jones. One of the key reasons this is no longer the case is that, operating as concessions in a large retail environment, the pharmacies were not always profitable. Therein lies the critical issue underpinning the debate today. Retailers quite rightly operate to make a profit for their shareholders. Pharmacies operate as small businesses in a retail environment. However, they operate in a manner different from any other retailer. They operate to provide health advice, prodother ucts and medication to the community. As my colleagues have today made clear, the contribution of pharmacies to their communities cannot be measured in dollar terms. We have seen the supermarket duopoly in this country increasingly pose a threat to small businesses-in particular, independent businesses. Many small local grocers, butchers, greengrocers and liquor stores have experienced the full power of the retail giants: their businesses close when a supermarket moves next door or around the corner. I do not deny the right of supermarkets to conduct their business or make a profit. They contribute significantly to the Australian economy in dollar terms and employment opportunities. I do worry, however, about the insatiability of the major retailers in gobbling up businesses which do not represent their core business of food retailing. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has regularly commented on these practices. In a media release on 24 July, the guild noted that supermarkets ‘represent the most anticompetitive face of business, using predatory pricing to drive smaller operators out of business'. I regularly speak to pharmacists in my electorate, and overwhelmingly they tell me of their concerns about the nature of the support and advice their customers may receive if pharmacies were to be located in supermarkets. Members of the community, as reflected in these petitions, are also voicing their concerns about the quality of personal advice they may receive in the open environment of a supermarket. Community pharmacies, and the health professionals behind them, provide a genuine caring personal customer service and do not have the consumer spending focus of the supermarket chains. Pharmacies and supermarkets both have a place in their communities and make a contribution to them. However, the role of a pharmacy is completely different from the role of a supermarket. Labor believes the vital social and health functions provided by pharmacies to their communities must be allowed to continue in a positive and caring environment. There is no doubt in my mind that these will be lost if pharmacies are allowed to operate in supermarkets. I urge my colleagues on both sides to support this motion today. The petition that I have referred to reads: The petition of citizens of Banks draws the attention of the House to the important role that Community Pharmacies play in the health care system. The petitioners call upon the House to ensure the Howard Government opposes the extension of pharmacies to major retail supermarkets. The petitioners also ask the House to note that a failure to do so would: (a) Lead to the closure of many Community Pharmacies, the majority of whom are hard working small businesses; (b) The loss of jobs among the 30,000 assistants currently employed in community pharmacies; (c) Put at risk the 80 million free services provided by Community Pharmacies to the Australian community, many of whom cannot afford the cost of going to the doctor due to the decline in bulk billing; and (d) The reduction in training and career opportunities for people who have chosen pharmacy as their career. As I said earlier, almost 400 signatures have already come into my office. The community are voting with their feet. They support their local pharmacists. They do not support pharmacies going into Coles or Woolworths. I support pharmacies. They provide a soul to their local community. They provide health care services over and above what would be required of, and given by, supermarkets, and I think they deserve our support. I have no hesitation in saying that I will stand alongside my local pharmacist opposing a move into Woolworths or Coles, because I think it would be bad not only for people's health but also for the local community. Local communities thrive on their pharmacies, and people still want them. (Time expired)",94
161,Mr SLIPPER,COMMUNITY PHARMACIES,"I rise today to join with my colleagues in opposing pharmacies in supermarkets, including Coles and Woolworths. In recent times, there has been a notable shift towards major supermarkets stocking their shelves with items that were once the domain of other specific types of retail outlet. Magazines, for example, once were sold only in newsagencies, but supermarkets now stock them. CDs, videos and DVDs are no longer sold only in music stores; they are commonly found on grocery store shelves-as are consumer consumables such as disks, ink cartridges, paper and memory sticks. The list goes on: toys; blankets; bedsheets; kitchen utensils; knives and forks; pots and pans; electrical appliances such as toasters, hair dryers and curling wands; and make-up. All of these products used to be sold only by specialty retailers but are now available in the aisles of local supermarkets. For some time, there has been debate about the proposed addition of the specialised medicines currently sold by pharmacies to the list of items that supermarkets should be able to sell. There has been a similar debate about alcohol. But pharmaceuticals are in a stand-alone position for the simple reason that medicines, tablets and the like are potentially deadly items. In the wrong hands, or in criminal hands, the wrong mix or the wrong quantity of specialised prescription drugs can be lethal. On 5 April, the Sydney Morning Herald published a letter by Alison Roberts, which said: Medicines-even those that can be bought without prescription-are not ordinary items of merce, despite being viewed as such by Woolworths. They are potentially dangerous items consumers buying them need access to advice and information so they can make an informed and safer choice. It must be remembered that the dispensing of pharmaceuticals is a specialised field that is currently looked after by trained chemists. Several commentators argue that any dispensing of prescription drugs through supermarkets immediately contaminates the chemists' role with a pressure for profits. Shareholders demand a return on their investment, so the concern from some areas is that the sale of pharmaceuticals would become another means to that end. This concern was highlighted in the publication Pharmaceutical News on 10 May with the Vice-President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, Mr Frank Payne, saying: Protecting public health is more important than Woolworths' profits and should be the primary consideration in any government decision over whether to allow pharmacies in supermarkets. In my electorate of Fisher on the Sunshine Coast pharmacists have also raised several concerns-and I have met large numbers of pharmacists including Alistair Cook and Greg Irvine. In a letter, Mr Lawrie Bray, the proprietor of the Malouf Group Pharmacy in Maroochydore, points to the US experience, saying it is not at all an acceptable one: Walmart in the US run supermarket pharmacies. The pharmacist sits out the back-not in contact with the public at all. Scripts are passed through a hole in the wall and take anywhere from 4 to 48 hours to fill. They have publicly said that they do not want to fill scripts quickly as they want the shopper to be in their store as long as possible in order to sell other merchandise to them. Mrs Hull-That is unbelievable.",95
162,Mr SLIPPER,COMMUNITY PHARMACIES,"It is unbelievable, as the member for Riverina points out to us. Mr Bray described a situation that is both uncom- wanted and unacceptable. Pharmaceutical products and services must not be allowed to and become a marketing tool to promote the sale of other goods. When we buy petrol at the service station and walk to pay the attendant, we have become accustomed to negotiating an aisle lined with chocolate bars and pointof-sale confectionery displays to tempt us into a spontaneous buying decision. It is important that pharmaceuticals are never regarded as simply an enticement to spur shoppers into making other purchases when serious health issues are at stake. There is also the potential for the privacy of individuals to be at risk if pharmaceuticals are sold through supermarkets. Do ordinary Australians want their private health information accessed by our major retailers? That is not criticism of retailers but a simple voicing of a real community concern. Mr Bray also raises the issues of expertise and employment-factors that are somewhat intertwined-that would be affected by putting pharmacies into supermarkets: Pharmacy employs a lot of staff as the service levels in pharmacy are very high. Most of these staff will become unemployed. Supermarkets make money by cutting costs, the pharmacy staff will be the first to go. What it means is that consumers will no longer receive advice about their medications or be in a position to ask someone about nappy rash treatments or allergic reactions at the point of sale. I support the motion. (Time expired)",96
163,Ms HALL,COMMUNITY PHARMACIES,"I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Batman and seconded by the member for Banks, and I am pleased that the contributions from the members on the other side of the House have been supportive of community pharmacies. Unfortunately, I do not have the same good feeling about the approach of the Howard government. It is a government that constantly portrays itself as a friend of small business, but one look at the way the issue of community pharmacies has been handled demonstrates that it really is not a friend of small business. The Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority) Bill 2005, debated in this House back in June, extended the negotiations of that agreement simply because the government did not come out and say no to big business and say no to putting pharmacies in supermarkets. If the government had listened to the people of Australia, if it had listened to the good members from the government who have spoken in this debate and if it had listened to those the community, it would know that this is not what the community wants. Rather, the Howard government, instead of listening to members such as those who have spoken in this debate, has negotiated behind closed doors. I am really quite upset that this whole process has lacked transparency. Instead of all the negotiations happening out in the open, we have had this ongoing debacle of uncertainty as to whether or not pharmacies will go into supermarkets. To be quite honest with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that that there is absolutely no argument for pharmacies to be located in supermarkets. The government initially said, ‘No, we will not support it,' but then they changed their position. The Prime Minister and the Minister For Health and Ageing made a commitment to community pharmacies that they would not be locating pharmacies in supermarkets, but they seem to have moved from that position and it makes me wonder whether that may have been one of those non-core promises. It is interesting to note that the minister for health commissioned Roger Corbett, the CEO of Woolworths, to prepare a report on this very issue. That does not seem to me to be the right approach if the minister is genuine about making sure that the best outcome is provided to the people of Australia. I think this lacks transparency. It seems to me that we have a minister who is committed to putting pharmacies into supermarkets for all the wrong reasons. It will not deliver the savings that he and his government may believe it will. Rather, I think that there are some serious health implications associated with it. It is important to note that in the United States, which has a very deregulated pharmacy sector, it has been found that only 42 per cent of American adults received any verbal advice about their in medicines and in only 19 per cent of cases did pharmacists provide information on possible side effects. It is a matter of real concern when you consider the number of people in the United States, as has already been mentioned this debate, that have ended up in hospital because they have taken their medication inappropriately. The one thing pharmacists do very well here in Australia is ensure that people who present prescriptions are given advice on how to use that medication. The service provided by pharmacists in Australia is outstanding. I have had ongoing discussions with pharmacists in my area. One of the pharmacists from Toukley took the time to email me. He thanked me for supporting community pharmacies and said that they were under attack at the moment. But the thing I would like to share with the House is that he said: I still find it astonishing that we are even debating an issue to allow Australia's biggest retailers of alcohol and tobacco to become a health provider. It is a scenario that clearly belongs on an episode of the Simpsons. That is not the right approach to take. It is not going to deliver the best service to Australia. It is not going to deliver good health outcomes. It is a mistake.",97
164,Mrs HULL,COMMUNITY PHARMACIES,"I rise to support the many community pharmacies spread across the electorate of Riverina. I have been an avid supporter of our community pharmacies for some time and I am opposed to any attempts to see community pharmacies enter into the major retailing outlets, such as Woolworths and Coles. For Woolworths and Coles to be able to open pharmacies in their supermarkets is not conducive to having a regular, effective and important education process on the use of pharmaceuticals. There must be a healthy respect for pharmacy. If a person does not have that respect and is dispensing many other products, we will not have created what is required in order to see pharmacy move forward in the future. Sometimes the work and valuable services provided by community pharmacists may be taken for granted, not by those who use these services but by those removed from our communities. Do we stop and think about the work they do and the services they provide? Many of these services are free of charge. Pharmacies in my electorate provide free home deliveries to the elderly. If we remove this valuable service it will limit the independence of the elderly and ultimately place a greater burden on the health care system. Pharmacies provide subsidised Webster packing services-the incorrect use of medicine places a great burden on the PBS and on our health care system. Basically, pharmacies provide a valuable source for dispensing medicines and also valuable training in how medicines need to be used, along with the respect that pharmacy deserves. Many pharmacies are Diabetes Australia subagents, providing counselling and diabetes management to customers for absolutely no remuneration. Pharmacists provide many services to the public for which they are not reimbursed, such as counselling about medications and self-limiting conditions, blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol level monitoring. These activities are carried out by community pharmacists in rural and regional towns every day and they assist in improving the health of the average Australian, particularly the average rural Australian. Rural Australians require the services of pharmacies. Rural Australians require the dedicated services of pharmacists because many of our communities have little or no GP services. So your pharmacist is the person at the front end who is the first port of call for many country people. Dismantling the current system of pharmacies will, I believe, have an impact on rural and regional people and in the end will have an impact on taxpayers. As I have said, local pharmacies provide many services that are not profitable. Pharmacists choose customer and patient care over their bottom line. Would retail chains, such as Woolworths and Coles, place greater importance on patient care than on the return to shareholders? That is one of the major questions that needs to be asked. I have concerns about the push to limit full-line wholesalers of pharmaceuticals. Again it will be country people who will be disadvantaged if short-line wholesalers are the preferred distributors of pharmaceuticals. The cost associated with delivery and storage of coldchain pharmaceuticals would be absolutely prohibitive if this cost had to be borne by local pharmacists. I think that is something that we need to seriously consider. In rural communities pharmacists, as I said, are the first point of contact due to the limited number of general practitioners. Again, if the push for deregulation of this industry goes ahead then it will be our rural communities that will suffer. The Australian government has supported community pharmacies for years and it welcomes the valuable contribution they make to communities throughout Australia. I urge all the members of the House to throw their full weight behind community pharmacies to ensure that we do not let retail outlets-(Time expired)",98

166,Ms HOARE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Charlton) (5.28 pm)Tonight I want to pursue the atrocious treatment meted out to Vivian Solon Alvarez Young, an Australian citizen who was deported from Australia in 2001. Earlier this year immigration officials locked up an Australian resident, Cornelia Rau. This mentally ill woman endured appalling and degrading conditions. She was locked away unable to prove her identity, communicating only in German. She was not treated but abused and insulted. When Cornelia's case came to public awareness, Australians were outraged and demanded an inquiry, which the Prime Minister was forced to accept. Former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer was retained to conduct that inquiry. During the course of this media attention, Robert Young continued to ask questions about the possible wrongful deportation of his former wife and mother of two boys, Vivian Solon, an Australian citizen since 1986. Vivian married Robert Young in 1984; they had a son in 1988 and divorced in 1992. After the birth of her second son Vivian's life took a turn for the worse. She had spells of mental illness and was admitted for psychiatric care. Vivian did have family, including a brother in Brisbane, and she did have people who cared for her. Robert Young had taken care of their son at some stage during Vivian's illness. In February 2001 she left her younger son at a Brisbane child-care centre and seemed to disappear. This was the last time he saw his mother. He was four years old at the time. He is now nine. Vivian was found injured in Lismore on the night of 31 March 2001. She was taken to Lismore Base Hospital, where she advised she had been in a car accident. It has been reported that the medical view was that she had been bashed. This set off the dramatic and tragic series of events which resulted in the Australian government deporting an Australian citizen. Her admission to Lismore Base Hospital did not result in a phone call to police even though it was suspected that she had been the victim of a bashing. It appeared there was more concern over who was paying for her treatment-she carried no Medicare card and the hospital rang the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Vivian was drunk, dishevelled and screaming in pain when she was placed in a psychiatric ward. She was transferred to Sydney for spinal surgery and taken back to St Vincent's Private Hospital in Lismore. Why was Vivian's plight not reported to the police? Why were the immigration authorities notified ahead of the police? Was it because she was drunk and of non-Caucasian descent? Upon a meeting with DIMIA officials in Lismore, it was concluded that Vivian must be an unauthorised illegal noncitizen as there was no record of a Vivian Alvarez having arrived in Australia. Indeed, it was suspected that she was smuggled into Australia as a sex slave. During her recovery in Lismore no attempt was made by DIMIA to establish if her claims of having a husband and children were genuine. The department had two months in which to undertake this investigation and had leads to suggest that such an investigation was warranted. In his interim report on this incident, Mick Palmer noted that, if the department had used the information Vivian had supplied consistently, the connection would have been made  stated: The capacity existed in 2001 for DIMIA officers to have identified Vivian Alvarez as an Australian citizen. The fact that it did not undertake the search is a savage indictment of the department and seriously brings into question its motivations in relation to Vivian and people like her. Do officials have views that would prejudice their efforts in relation to certain people? Is there a racist streak to the department's culture and was Vivian considered nothing less than a Filipino prostitute who had no right to be listened to or have her claims followed up? The department apparently made no effort to understand that Vivian may have been suffering from a mental illness that could explain why she gave inconsistent responses to some questions. Vivian Solon was moved to a motel room in Brisbane under guard for one week prior to her deportation. The Philippines embassy was reluctant to allow her deportation to proceed on the basis of her health. The day before she was due to leave, the embassy indicated that it would not be issuing travel documents. As David Marr indicated in the Sydney Morning Herald on 20 August 2005, the Filipino consul-general advised the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that her deportation had ‘the potential to affect the bilateral relationship'. Pressure was applied to the Philippines authorities, who issued the relevant documentation upon receiving an all clear from a doctor hired by the private firm Australian Correctional Management. The doctor was not given a patient history for Vivian and signed off on the certificate that Vivian was fit for travel. He did not provide a psychiatric assessment. Indeed, that doctor has since indicated that, if he had received a briefing from the Filipino nurses who had previously examined Vivian and who witnessed Vivian being vacant and suffering fits, he certainly would not have permitted her to travel. Vivian, an Australian citizen and mother of two boys, was deported on 20 July 2001. She had no-one to meet her and was taken away by the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration in Manila, which looks after sick Filipinos returning home. Vivian ended up at a hospice run by the Missionaries of Charity. The Australian officials had washed their hands of Vivian Solon-a mother sent to another country away from her two sons and left to die. In 2003, DIMIA bureaucrats discovered the truth about Vivian's deportation. Her lawyers have copies of various papers to authenticate these statements and they are accurately referred to by David Marr of the Sydney Morning Herald in his articles of 20 and 22 August. There were at least 161 accesses of her file by DIMIA after her deportation. Her ex-husband, Robert Young, continued to be fobbed off or ignored by departmental officials, and only his persistence led to Vivian finally being found. For four long years Vivian was kept in pain away from her children due to incompetence on the part of the government and for two of those years because the government refused to own up to its incompetence. Now that Vivian's case is out of the news, some may be wondering where she is. Has the government come good with care and compensation packages and has Vivian been reunited with her two sons? The sad answer is: not yet. I understand Vivian's lawyers have been in negotiation with the Australian Government Solicitor to work out the best possible result for Vivian after four years of emotional and physical pain. Vivian is currently receiving a very high standard of care in Manila but of course wants to return to Australia and her two boys. However, she does not want to be a burden on her children. Vivian is quite ill. When she returns to Australia she will require the ongoing care and support of her sister, who is currently in the Philippines. For this, her sister needs to be granted ongoing visas for both herself and her family. They will require ongoing accommodation and an allowance until final arrangements for Vivian's future are made. On 17 May 2005 Minister Vanstone stated: I want to assure you, as I've said before, through the media to the public, we are determined to make sure that Ms Alvarez is looked after and put in a position she wants to be in. Well, Minister, the position Vivian wants to be in has been made quite clear, and it surely cannot take much effort on the part of the government to meet her needs, especially given the effort which was made to have her deported and to maintain the cover-up. The government needs to quickly agree to a solution which incorporates at a minimum the four simple, uncontroversial and fair things which have been outlined by former Justice Marcus Einfeld: agree to an arbitration if there is no mediated settlement to avoid lengthy and costly court proceedings; admit liability or agree to no contest in the light of the Palmer and Comrie reports, the PM's apology and the ministerial promises of compensation; agree to extend the sixmonth period if there is no determination in that period and pay Vivian a per diem during this time so she is not in poverty without a compensation settlement; and identify and then grant a suitable sibling visa to a chosen relative, whoever it is, as a carer rather than force the proposed carer to ask for one visa after another-or hire a lawyer to do sountil a suitable one is eventually found. This is the least that the government can do; this is the least that Vivian requires and wants. I understand that the government is currently in negotiation with Vivian's lawyers, George Newhouse and Harry Freedman, and I thank them and acknowledge them for the briefings they have provided to me and my parliamentary colleagues. I also understand that these negotiations are moving in a positive manner. As a member of this parliament, as a member of our community and as a mother, I urge the government to move quickly to end this tragic saga for Vivian and her family. They must be able to move forward and be afforded the best possible prospects for their future by the government. Housing Affordability Disability Services",99
167,Mrs DRAPER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Makin) (5.38 pm)Housing affordability has become a major issue in my home state of South Australia. Unless the state government address it now, this will affect our most vulnerable Australians today and future generations to come. In the last five years the cost of housing has dramatically increased. In this period the median house price in Adelaide has almost doubled, from $135,000 to presently nearly twice that amount. These increases have been caused not so much by rises in the cost of construction but rather by rises in the cost of land. Over the last five years the residential land prices have doubled to now represent 50 per cent of the cost of a house and land package. These increases in land prices are due to the shortage of this valuable commodity which is being offered to consumers. Any economist will tell you that a shortage of supply in any commodity means a price hike. Although little is being offered, land is a commodity Australia enjoys an abundance of-so why the inflated prices? In answer, the National President of the Housing Industry Association, Managing Director of Home Australia and local constituent of Makin, Mr Bob Day AO, recently wrote in the Advertiser: Urban containment policies in the form of growth boundaries, zoning and other planning instruments have conspired to stifle land supply and escalate prices. Furthermore, the Howard governmentinitiated Productivity Commission inquiry into first home ownership-its report First Home Ownership was released last yearfound that state taxes, such as stamp duty on mortgages, were major contributors to escalating housing costs and anxiety as far as entering the property market was concerned. When the GST was introduced in 1999, it was to replace nine state and territory taxes, including stamp duty of mortgages. In doing so, the intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and the states was signed. Since that time, all states have received higher revenue than had the GST not been introduced. Despite massive windfalls, state governments, including in my home state of South Australia, procrastinated when they had an opportunity to live up to that agreement and abolish those taxes. This is not unusual in my home state of South Australia, where we are getting used to the current Rann government making a habit of taking with one hand and giving nothing with the other-or taking with the other as well. This shortage of land and entry barriers are causing first home buyers and/or modest income earners to find alternative accommodation, with most looking to rent or to find a Housing Trust home. Some policy makers would suggest that the problem was solved. However, the South Australian housing plan, released in March, showed that 28,000 rental households out of 99,375 are not meeting regular rental payments. Worse still, the waiting list for a Housing Trust home in Modbury, a primary suburb of my federal seat of Makin, showed a waiting list of nearly 75 months. Further stresses will be placed on the housing sector, especially in supported accommodation and departments like the Housing Trust, when the Rann government closes Glenside Hospital. The Rann government believes that mentally ill patients currently using this facility will be better served living in the community. It makes promises that all will be well, but we know that that is not so. This is despite leading psychiatrists admitting that this policy direction over the past 20 years has failed miserably. In closing the hospital, the Rann government will break another key election promise, placing the health of patients and the safety of the community at risk. In addition, since the Rann government's election in 2002 no new government funded supported residential care facilities have opened. Furthermore, privately owned SRFs have been forced to close because of a lack of government support and high property taxes. This has meant that hundreds of residents with mental illnesses have already been forced onto the streets to care for themselves, adding to waiting lists for supported accommodation. As is well known, approximately 25 per cent of people registered with the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program are fleeing from domestic violence. Under the previous Liberal government, South Australians were proud to say that our state had the third highest per capita spending on mental health in Australia. This achievement now seems like a lost dream or a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for the Rann government, which, even after a oneoff $25 million injection this year, still ranks last in terms of national mental health spending and is a decade behind other states in mental health infrastructure, according to the new Director of Mental Health, Dr John Brayley. Since the Rann government's election in 2002, waiting lists for surgery have increased exponentially; patients are being turned away because of a critical shortage of beds for mental health patients; the state's former director of mental health, Mr Jonathan Phillips, has resigned; and key mental health psychiatrists-for example, Dr Shane Gill, one the state's top psychiatrists working out of the Royal Adelaide Hospital-will also step down in September. This is despite an increase of 128 per cent in Australian government funding for mental health. With this in mind, it is fair to say that over the last 18 months South Australia, led by a populist government more concerned about media spin than effective policies, has driven our state's health system, including mental heath and disability support, into the ground. The Rann government's answer to these damning statistics was recently given by the health minister, the Hon. Lea Stevens, who informed us that the South Australian health system, in general, is ‘stuffed'. Hard to believe, I know, but that is what she said. Moreover, funding for the disabled is so poor that a lobby group, Dignity for Disabled, led by Mr David Holst and other concerned parents, has set about a very public campaign to demand their needs be heard on North Terrace. I have stood up in this place before and supported this group and I will continue to do so. Most people would find it difficult to imagine how stressful daily life is for parents who are required to be aroundthe-clock carers. This level of stress is magnified considering that it is needed seven days a week for up to 30 or 40 years or more. The fact of the matter is that, in the four financial years to 2004, the average national expenditure for disability services increased by 6.4 per cent per annum, with the highest in the Northern Territory, with levels as high as 11.3 per cent. According to Dignity for Disabled, only three states featured lower than the national average: Western Australia, at five per cent; Tasmania, at 4.9 per cent; and South Australia, at a measly 1.7 per cent-the bottom of the class by a mile. Yet, when the responsible South Australian minister, the Hon. Jay Weatherill MP, Minister for Disability, was invited to a forum of 60 disabled children, their parents and carers to discuss these issues, he was too busy to attend, despite having been given adequate notice. Even that minister admits that South Australia has the worse record in funding disability services, but he has failed to implement a thorough, effective and comprehensive policy in terms of disability services. Despite the Rann government's head-in-thesand approach, I see these issues as being inextricably linked. I would like at this juncture to congratulate the Adelaide Advertiser on throwing its support behind the ongoing campaign being waged by the Dignity for Disabled forum in South Australia. The editorial in February 2005 stated: Words are cheap. It's easy for State Minister Jay Weatherill to say that the public campaign for greater assistance to disabled people made him feel uncomfortable. It is easy for Mr Weatherill to say change is afoot and that he is committed to assisting the disabled and their families and carers. But words do not relieve the dreadful plight of so many families that have to cope with the financial, physical and mental strain of caring for a disabled person. These people, our most vulnerable in society, are often unable to afford the rising costs associated with buying property. When they turn to the government for supported accommodation, they are put on a waiting list and left in the lurch in their time of need. One only has to look at the Dignity for Disabled web site to immediately see the link. According to them, 74 people are on the Moving On waiting list, a program that provides a day-stay initiative, social interaction and self-development for school leavers, with a further 312 awaiting further support; and 260 people are on the urgent waiting list for residential care, with 70 on the brain impaired waiting list. (Time expired) Telstra",102
168,Mr ADAMS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The grievance of the electorate of Lyons is the unnecessary sale of Telstra. Not only is it unnecessary, it would help regional communities enormously if the profits from this company could be ploughed back into the development of communications infrastructure in the regions. Telecommunications are the backbone of the modern economy. For regional economies, telecommunications can potentially reduce the obstacles of distance and time, which contributes to economic efficiency and indirectly affects the better provision of education, health and social services. It would mean many of these latter services could keep their providers, because they would be attached to the worldwide communications system. But this government has decided that, because there is no real competition out in the country, Telstra should be sold and the marketplace should be allowed to provide these services, despite all the promises of future funds and other such schemes. It is obvious from Telstra's reaction to all of that that after a few years these funds will disappear and there will be no universal access to this form of communications. The way that Telstra's management is presently speaking, you do not have to be Einstein to understand the politics of that. Infrastructure dominates public debate over regional communications. This is because it is the part of Telstra that can be seen-the wires, the lines, the phones, the Telstra vans all over the place. People identify that this is our universal provider of phone services. Infrastructure also visibly illustrates the basic problems of regional telecommunications. The cost to roll out fibre optic cable or wireless relay towers increases with distance from metropolitan centres. At the same time, returns on infrastructure investments decrease as the concentration of potential users decrease further away from regional centres. Australia has a small population in comparison with comparable countries, such as Canada, but that does not mean that it is not needed out there. Our rural wealth is not concentrated around our city areas. Primary industry, forestry, fishing and mining all take place in farflung areas of each state. The argument for telecommunications infrastructure in Tasmania is even more critical as we have about half a million people spread over the old island-68,401 square kilometres to be exact. Compare that with, say, Denmark. It is two-thirds the size of Tasmania but has 12 times the population. That is a much easier proposition to provide services to. But people in regional areas have as much, if not more, need as people concentrated around the coast of mainland Australia and are, after all, our basic wealth providers and the feeders of the nation. There is a high demand in my electorate for ADSL and broadband connections, but people have little hope of getting it as things stand at the moment. Even people in the outer metropolitan area of Hobart, which is within 20 minutes of the GPO, are being told that they are on the wrong exchange, that they have not got a cable nearby or are given various other excuses. Yet the marketers are out there selling their services without knowing whether the chosen customer has a hope in hell of getting connected. I am going to say more about that a little later today. Some of the areas in my patch that have been having trouble with connections are Perth, Brighton, New Norfolk, Cressy, Poatina, Oatlands, Campbell Town, Sheffield, most of the west coast, many of the tourist areas on the east coast, the Tasman Peninsula and most of the Central Highlands. These areas have industries that form the basis of our economy, yet some of them do not even have decent phone coverage, let alone mobile coverage. If they want a computer to function at a similar speed to one in the city, their only alternative is to install a satellite. That has not been properly sorted out yet, and its cost is a little prohibitive for most small businesses and industry in my patch. Perhaps the most crucial region lacking in facilities is that of the Derwent Valley-not far from Hobart. It is in the process of renewing itself from a town whose claim to fame was a large mental institution and a paper mill. The mental institution has now gone. The paper mill is still there, struggling to find enough money to be upgraded. As the town has been changing, more and more people have been looking to this region for investment. Some interesting proposals have been coming to light, including a new college which is well under way to being built and fitted out, especially for overseas students with its surrounding accommodation and other infrastructure that will be needed. The students will also need considerable access to telecommunications. Other developments in the area include local restaurants; a small fruit industry, particularly in cherries; and a tourism industry, including trout fishing on the magnificent Derwent River and the creeks that run into it. These industries will bring good, new jobs to the region, but without the proper infrastructure it will be a struggle. I cannot blame the investors if they take their funds elsewhere, even out of Australia, if the services are not there. Another town that is suffering from a lack of telecommunications infrastructure is Poatina-an old hydro town that has been taken over by a community group to help disadvantaged youth and older people put their lives back together again. They have completely changed this town; it is now a thriving and viable area, and the community want to expand it. They are planning to build a new education and convention facility, which will require most of the Telstra services, but they have been told that it will be difficult. These are good paying customers, and I am sure they would even assist in any moves to enable them to have access to these facilities, yet they are being told that Telstra cannot upgrade the exchange because there are not enough people to use its services. How many does it take? More than a hundred people are there now, plus the farmers of the region who would also like access to modern market technology. Then there is the issue of elderly women living alone in country areas-and there are a lot of them. As families grow up and move to find work, these women are often left behind. They need a reliable up-to-date telecommunications service. Quite a few of these ladies are computer literate and keep in touch with family and friends this way. However, they have problems in getting assistance for their phones, let alone anything else. As I mentioned earlier, the telemarketing that is occurring is immoral. An elderly woman whom I know was rung four times by a telemarketer and told that broadband was available and would she like to sign up. She rang me to see whether it was available. I looked into it and found that, although others were on the same exchange, all the people in her area were not able to receive broadband. When marketers rang this women and she told them that she had found out that she could not have broadband, one marketer just hung up on her. Another was quite insistent that she could get it, and the last one just said, ‘Oh.' I believe that it is wrong that these marketers can ring up people without checking what is available in each area. It was a great disappointment to this woman that she could not get a service. Her current dial-up is very intermittent and is constantly failing-this is all occurring within 20 minutes of the capital of Tasmania. (Time expired) Telstra Eden-Monaro: Defence Project",104
169,Mr NAIRN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (5.58 pm)-In the grievance debate today I also want to talk about the Telstra issue, like the member for Lyons, but probably from a slightly different perspective. A lot has been said in this debate, particularly in recent times. A number of people have made claims about what can and cannot be done in certain areas. There are claims that certain people are getting things done-but I will not go into too much detail about that. I want to get back to a factual debate. The debate has become one based more on emotion than on facts. I have been working very closely with the Telstra Country Wide people who cover my electorate, and we have achieved a huge amount in recent years. When I consider the sorts of telecommunications I had in my electorate when I was first elected, after 13 years of Labor and a fully government owned communications company, who would want a government owned telecommunications company if that is the example of what telecommunications would be like? The situation has improved out of sight in that time. Yes, there is still a lot more to absolutely-but we are doing it. It really tates me when claims are made by people which are not based on any sorts of facts. I appeared on the Stateline program recently in Canberra in relation to this. On that program Senator Kate Lundy, for instance, made a comment that Telstra will not deliver an outcome that fixes everyone's problems. She was claiming that nothing has been done in the ACT and Canberra. I spoke to the local Country Wide manager for this region, and I found that they have spent $50 million to $60 million in the last year alone on upgrades. He acknowledges that there is still more to do, and the plans are there to do it. But it does not help when you have senators making statements like that which are totally false, because has been achieved. Senator Lundy also commented that the government and Telstra were compromised because of the partownership aspect. Some people might raise compromise when they note that Senator Lundy's partner is in fact the chief executive of the Competitive Carriers Coalition, which represents a number of Telstra's competitors-a rather interesting thing to look at. I looked just recently at some of the achievements around my electorate. I meet regularly with Ian Peters, the local Telstra Country Wide regional manager, so that he and his people are aware of any issues coming up. We do forward planning, knowing what is happening in the region. He knows that, as the local member, I have a pretty good idea of what is going on around the region and what things might be needed. I have 77 exchanges in my electorate, and 66 out of the 77 are enabled either for ADSL or for ISDN. So 86 per cent of all the exchanges in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, an area of 30,000 square kilometres, which is the size of Belgium, have either ADSL or do, ISDN. In fact, additional exchanges that will irri- have ADSL by the end of this year include Bredbo, Burra Creek, Captains Flat, Nelligen and Perisher Valley. I should also include Wamboin, which is an interesting one; it will be on in November. Wamboin was raised on the Stateline program about poor coverage. ADSL via Telstra will be available then, but already in the Wamboin area there are other carriers. A company called YLESS4U has gone wireless broadband in that region. Anthony Goonan, who is behind that proposal, saw a market opportunity and is in there. So Telstra will be playing catch-up with respect to ADSL later this year. In addition, before the end of the financial year we will see Numeralla, Delegate and Durras becoming ADSL enabled. So there are a number of a lot additional areas that will be fixed up. That is all part of what we have been planning. This has been happening constantly over the last 9½ years, not only with respect to broadband in more recent years as that technology became the one that everybody wanted but also with respect to mobile phones. With a CDMA car kit and a booster antenna, I can now drive from Queanbeyan to well beyond Cooma and have coverage. There is one gap between Cooma and the coast, at Nimmitabel, which will be filled in later this year. You will then be able to go all the way from Queanbeyan to the coast via Cooma, with coverage. I am also working with Telstra Country Wide to get the gap filled in across Clyde Mountain, which is a very difficult area geographically, and would be assisted if the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service would allow us to stick up a tower in their national park occasionally so that that gap could be filled, and then the coverage would be all the way through to the coast from Canberra via that route as well. A couple of minor ones are currently being worked on along the coast to fill in the gaps. So there has been a huge roll-out of additional technology, and we should be concentrating on what has been achieved rather than on the emotional argument that we seem to boil down to. There is more to do but, in my view, it will only happen once the constraints on Telstra are removed, and the government's legislation will certainly provide the necessary safeguards. The other matter I would like to raise this afternoon is an update on the Defence headquarters to be built between Queanbeyan and Bungendore, a project worth over $300 million. Currently three short-listed tenderers are finalising their tenders. In the meantime some preparatory work has commenced, with the fencing around the site acquired at the Woodlands property. Initial plantings have been done for screening for the project and there are further investigations in relation to water. The final EIS was recently given approval, and Defence will be working with local authorities and the RTA on aspects such as the roads out there and access. It is a superb project for our region. Probably many hundreds of people will be involved in the construction of a project like this, which will start if not later this year then early next We expect the final tenderer to be selected very soon, with the finalisation of the preferred tenderer out of the three short-listed tenderers. Realistically, they will probably start on site early next year. There will still be a completion date which will allow it to be fully operational in 2008, which is the original time span that was provided. Even though some things have fallen a bit behind, they will certainly still be completed on time, based on the tenders that have been provided. That is a big job to achieve with a project this size. It will bring great benefits and a lot more activity to our region. It is the biggest capital works project to occur in this region since the new Parliament House was constructed, so it is great not only for my electorate of Eden-Monaro-the Queanbeyan and Bungendore region-but also for the ACT. I am sure residents of the ACT recognise the importance of that as well. Multiculturalism",106
170,Mr GEORGANAS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise to speak on a matter which has become of great concern to me in recent times. There is a growing conversation in this great country of ours about the rights and freedoms of our people. As we approach Citizenship Day on 17 September, I think it is important to explore what it is that makes Australia the place that it is and Australians the people who we are. For example, I am one of millions of Australians who were born in Australia but whose parents were born overseas and migrated here-in my family's case, from Greece-many years ago. I have learned about my parents' culture, history and language, and I have never felt confused about what it means to be an Australian. I have an affinity with Greece through my many relatives who live there, I am bilingual and I year. would like to think I understand Greek culture and its people. But Australia is my country; it is my home and it is my children's home. Most importantly, it is my children's future. I am Australian, and I would not have it any other way. I am fortunate enough to attend many citi- as a family. zenship ceremonies in the electorate of Hindmarsh and I have to say that it is one of the most enjoyable responsibilities I have. So it is often that I affirm my loyalty to lia by taking the affirmation by oath. Each of us in this place is familiar with what it ‘As an Australian citizen, I affirm my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I uphold and obey.' It is short and simple, but it says a great deal about our country. Australia is about democracy and liberty. When we begin to think about altering our laws so that our rights and liberties are threatened, we are taking steps along a very dangerous path. If we continue to proceed along this path we will draw closer to becoming a nation which forgets about democracy and liberty. We must ensure that this does not happen. Australia has a proud and rich multicultural history, which we must all cherish. I was brought up as an Orthodox Christian. I attended church every week with my mother when I was younger. She was new to Australia and I know it was hard for her sometimes. Australia was a very different place in those days. Communities were closer and, even though my parents tried very hard to be part of the community, there were still difficult times. Some people were wary or scared of them because they spoke a different language and they looked a little different. It is funny to think that people might have been scared of my mother. I was, but that had nothing to do with the fact that she was born in Greece-I think it had more to do with the wooden spoon that lived on top of her cupboard. I still remember when my parents received their citizenship at a ceremony at the Thebarton council chambers, and although I was just a young boy I remember how important we all felt that day In the electorate of Hindmarsh, 23 per cent of people were born overseas. I am very proud to say that 91 per cent of people in AustraHindmarsh are Australian citizens. That compares to 88 per cent nationally, so in says: Hindmarsh a greater number of people who were born overseas decide to become Australian citizens, and I think that is quite significant. Deciding to become a citizen is a little like deciding to get married: sometimes the engagement is brief and sometimes it lasts for many years. In each case a new citizen has made the choice to commit to the Australian way of life, and to join a family of many nations. But becoming an Australian citizen should not mean losing anything. When someone decides to become an Australian citizen they contribute their own culture, religion, history, knowledge and rich experiences to our country Those in Australia who choose to believe that the Australian culture is something derived solely from one culture are choosing to believe in a myth. Each decade there is a new wave of immigrants which brings new challenges to existing Australians. Each generation we must ask ourselves whether we are a nation which can welcome people with open arms-and I believe that is exactly what we are. In the fifties it was the Greeks and Italians, including my parents; in the seventies there was a wave of Asian immibit gration; and now it is people from the Middle East. This time the fear is bigger than ever, because this time it is being argued by some that people who publicly demonstrate their Islamic faith are somehow possibly linked to 9-11 and to the tragedies that have followed far too often since then. Clearly this is an absurd assumption, and it is unfortunate that some people connect the two. When we give into fear, rorists. We risk driving normal, reasonable people closer to extremism. We give people a reason to turn their backs on all that we lieve this country is. Instead we show them our fear and, because of that fear, our intolwas erance. There are two types of people in this world, and they cannot be defined by race or religion: there are the haters, who are driven by fear, and then there those who understand that people share more similarities than differences. Thankfully, most Australians are the latter. Sadly there is still a very small, vocal minority who cannot tolerate external differences, because they are unable to see the similarities between us all. This wonderful country of ours, Australia, was founded on multiculturalism. It is not different or unusual; it is what we are. In 1788 British convicts and settlers came to this land, which had been inhabited by Indigenous Australians for upwards of 60,000 years. By Federation in 1901, Australia was also home to people from French, German, Chinese and Melanesian backgrounds-to name a few. Given that the current concerns are with regard to those from the Middle East, it may be useful to reflect on the role that people from Afghanistan have played in Australia since 1838. About 3,000 Afghan cameleers came to Australia in the midto late-1800s, and they were responsible in large part for opening up inland Australia. The first 18 cameleers arrived in Port Adelaide in South Australia in 1838. Over the coming years many more arrived and, although they carried supplies and helped build railways and the overland telegraph line, they were excluded from life with European Australians. An Adelaide mosque was completed in 1888, and it was a camel trader, Hadji Mulla Merban from Afghanistan, who became the spiritual leader of the Afghan community in we give into terSouth Australia. In the late 1800s the outback South Australian town of Marree was referred to as be- ‘little Asia' because of the number of Afghans living there. Australia in the 1800s not such a different place from Australia in the decades and centuries that followed. Back then, local politicians campaigned against the Afghan camel traders. In 1893 the then member for the South Australian seat of Flinders promised a prohibitive poll tax to stop them arriving in greater numbers. It is interesting to note that, more than one hundred years later, some of the ideas we are hearing are not so different from those that were heard back then. At the moment there are a few vocal people in Australia who are indulging in the myth of a monoculture. It is unfortunate that they are pushing against the reality that multicultural Australia exists and that being an Australian who has links with another nation is about as Australian as you can get. Our local libraries are filled with Australians tracing their family trees, with people sometimes finding out funny things about their background-like the case that one of my constituents told me about of a Cornish greatgreat-grandmother who was in love with an Afghan camel trader. Whether you research your Welsh, Irish, Italian, Greek or Vietnamese heritage, it makes little difference. With the exception of Indigenous Australians, our people have only been in this great country for a few generations. Australia is a community of more than 200 nationalities and yet each generation we identify our newest arrivals as ‘different'. How absurd-200 nationalities, a country built on immigration and yet a few people still look backwards to cultural assimilation. Those of us who have the good fortune to be elected to parliament have a responsibility to protect Australia from the tide of prejudice. When we give into fear, we ourselves turn our backs on Australia. We deny who we are-we deny that we come from all walks of life and from hundreds of nations. We are a great country because there is such strength in diversity. While the rest of the world battles over ancient differences, we look to our future and we believe in the rights and freedoms of every Australian, regardless of religion, language or cultural background. So when I hear someone suggesting that a person should be restrained from practising their religion or their culture or that they should restrict their dress code, I become afraid. I wonder what will be next; I wonder whether we will know when to stop. I am afraid that people's rights may be jeopardised because, instead of focusing our resources on finding and apprehending people who are a real danger to our country and our freedom, we think that we will feel safer if a little girl does wear a headscarf. Make no mistake, there is no room in this country for two sets of laws. People who live here should obey and must uphold our laws. Our laws protect the rights and liberties of all Australians, and they must continue to do so. We are a diverse country and we have become increasingly diverse since the first convict ships arrived in Australia. We are a nation of many religions and races. Those who live here are expected to adhere to the laws of this country, but those laws should never be ones which ignore the richness of the diversity of Australia or which deny our rights and freedoms. Those of us in this place have the unique opportunity and responsibility to ensure that Australia, once again, leads the way in creating a nation based on respect and tolerance. We should not be tricked into believing that multiculturalism and terrorism are somehow one and the same. They are two distinct and separate issues, and commentators who tell us otherwise are destructive forces. Australia's multiculturalism is a model for other nations around the world. It is an advantage that the great majority of us have been here for only a few generations. We do not have ancient hatreds and as such we can live together as one nation. I am alarmed by the suggestion that multiculturalism is not working. It is a part of what this country is, and it has been a part of Australia for the past 200 years. To anyone who thinks that multiculturalism is not a success, I ask: is Australia a success? Clearly the answer is yes. And because Australia and multiculturalism are so thoroughly entwined, it follows that multiculturalism is also a great success. Australian Taxation Office",108
171,Mr RANDALL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Canning) (6.18 pm)This evening I again address the issue of the not deplorable conduct of the Australian Taxation Office. No-one can deny that, over the last five years, there has been a period of unprecedented taxation reform. The GST, key changes to business tax reform, reduced personal rates and increased thresholds have all contributed to focusing our economy on growth, stability and taking best advantage of the many opportunities both in our region and beyond. With that in mind, it is all the more galling that, despite persistent efforts of a number of members of this House, including me, we still suffer the running sore of taxation disputes that should have been brought to a close years ago. These disputes are not about people who have refused to pay tax, they are not about judges who refuse to respond to ATO notices and they are not about senior members of the legal profession who have refused to lodge tax returns or others who have manipulated bankruptcy laws, or even the Family Law Act, to avoid paying their fair share. They are about the ATO saving face. It is as plain and simple as that. All huff and puff of the commissioner of the ATO, and his staff, when they talk about taxpayers with respect to mass marketed or employee benefit arrangements or retirement villages is designed to do only one thingthat is, cover up the fact that, over a period of several years, his office has failed to make clear determinations, failed to adequately respond to trends in the community, failed to inform taxpayers of his changing views and failed to implement those changes in a fair and equitable manner. Thanks to that, plus the failure of the Inspector-General of Taxation to be an effective mechanism for resolution, we continue to have individual and business taxpayers kept under the blowtorch of the ATO's punitive powers, and this will not change unless members in this House say, ‘Enough is enough,' and bring that position to an end. We have had chances in the past but have failed to grasp those opportunities. Had we been able to exercise our role as representatives of our constituents, this would not have been an issue in the last two federal elections. Many MPs have stood up for their constituents and called into question the standard answers trotted out by the commissioner. For example, the member for Kalgoorlie has spoken out on the matter many times in party forums. The member for Curtin has been a strong advocate on these matters from the very beginning. The member for Moore has arranged to have the Minister for Finance and Administration meet with affected taxpayers and hear their personal side of the story. Many other government members and senators have also corresponded with the ATO and the government to have the threatening attitude of the ATO exposed for what it is: bullying tactics to get its own way, no matter what the facts. Other measures have the also been taken. We went to the 2001 election with the PM's commitment to an Inspector-General of Taxation. However, this turned out to be ineffective as the legislation was weakened so much that any recommendations are still subject to the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation. As the 2004 election loomed, we were still awaiting the first report from the Inspector General of Taxation, the IGT. Although the IGT reported that the ATO's actions were inconsistent and unfair, the ATO decided to implement yet another administrative whitewash. Incredibly, in his letter to the minister dated 4 August the IGT stated that the commissioner's response was ‘contrary to my findings'. Yet after Mr Carmody personally visited the IGT in his Sydney office, we find the IGT telling everybody that he is happy with the commissioner's response-surprise; talk about standover tactics. Finally, or what I thought would be finally, the Treasurer released the Treasury's report into the review of self-assessment, or the ROSA report, and the government agreed to implement all recommendations via either legislation or administrative policy. As I read the key recommendations, I thought, ‘Here's a solution; at last common sense has broken out.' Here are two of Treasury's recommendations for legislation. Recommendation No. 1 states: Taxpayers who reasonably rely on Tax Office advice should receive a level of protection as follows: - For all legally binding advice, taxpayers will be protected from amendments raising additional primary tax penalties and interest charges. - For all other written advice (unless that advice is clearly labelled non-binding), and oral advice provided by formal enquiry centres, taxpayers will be protected from penalty and interest charges. It could not be clearer. It goes on: - No penalties or interest will apply where taxpayers follow long standing Tax Office administrative practice. That is great. Recommendation No. 6 states: Where the Tax Office changes a public interpretation or long standing practice to the detriment taxpayers, that change should become effective prospectively and, where necessary, from a future date that allows affected taxpayers reasonable time to become aware of, and act upon, the new interpretation. Another great recommendation, which the Treasurer said that they would adopt as government. As I said in my speech here on 10 February: The report has identified significant flaws in the self-assessment process and mended the introduction of legislation to taxpayers from wrongful administration ATO. Even the language of the report clearly indicated that the past conduct of the ATO was wrong-it should not have permitted this to happen-and that this legislation was the way to rectify the past and prevent these things happening again in the future. However, when the legislation surfaced, we saw that a decision had been made for revenue purposes only: to withhold the remedy from the very people whose plight brought the review about in the first place. No matter which way this decision is considered, it is plain wrong. This legislation should be retrospective. It should provide redress for those who have lost their homes, marriages and families and, in the worse cases, even their lives over the treatment they have received from the ATO. Despite a Senate committee inquiry, ROSA bill No. 1 was pushed through at the end of the autumn session. The result is not fairness and equity for all, not the remedies that the Treasury report alluded to, but rather two different rates of interest for taxpayers for the next six years. In fact, 2.3 million taxpayers will be charged the old, inequitable, unfair and uncommercial rate of interest between now and 2011. In short, the blind of refusal to fully rectify these ongoing problems has resulted in the ATO's cruel muffups being perpetuated rather than rectified. I am not going to stand by while thousands of taxpayers continue to suffer this abuse and while 2.3 million more people are lined up for the same treatment. In my speech on 29 November last year, I advised this House that a number of MPs proposed a private member's bill to resolve these outstanding tax disputes. While the introduction serious of a private member's bill remains an option, recom- I hope it will not become necessary. In light protect of the proposed introduction of the Tax Laws by the Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 2) 2005, due in this spring session, a number of senators, MPs and I intend to seek amendments to the draft legislation which will correct the deficiencies and ensure that the people whose predicament prompted the Treasury review will receive the remedies to which they are entitled. Let me make one point crystal clear: I am not arguing for one minute that the commissioner should not have addressed the massive growth in these products. It is the manner in which he went about it that is against everything we stand for in this place in relation to the rights of the individual. We tend to place great importance on protecting the rights of criminals and even terrorists but do not have the same safeguards for our taxpayers. The average citizen is accused, convicted and penalised by the taxation commissioner without constraint. Furthermore, the taxpayer is guilty until proven innocent, whereas the criminal or terrorist is innocent until proven guilty. The solution to these disputes can no longer be left with Mr Carmody, the Ombudsman or the Inspector-General of Taxation. Remember this: every step towards the resolution of these disputes in the past has been as a result of the influence of external bodies to the ATO. For example, the reduction in the interest rates for mass marketed schemes, or MMSs, and the announcement of the Budplan test case-this happened because the Prime Minister visited Kalgoorlie at the request of the member for Kalgoorlie; the MMS settlement proposal in 2002 was because of the Senate inquiry; what has become the lame duck review of EBA interest rates was because of the IGT's investigations; and the change in approach to retirement village taxpayers was because of the overwhelming taxpayer complaints to MPs over the repeated threats and intimidation. None of these developments were initiated by the ATO, and Mr Carmody cannot claim any credit for the easing of this position. Simply put, were it not for constituents and members of parliament offended by this activity and prepared to do something about it there would be no settlements, no individual consideration, no test cases, no IGT and no ROSA legislation. Now it is time for us to take up these disputes and bring them to an end finally. I urge all members of this House to support this initiative and to amend the Taxation Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 2) 2005 and bring an end to this episode in the Australian tax administration that will be a black mark on our standards of fairness and equity for many years to come.

172,Ms OWENS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Parramatta) (6.28 pm)The member for Hindmarsh and I are of like mind today: I also rise to condemn the statements made by the member for Mackellar and the member for Indi on the banning of headscarves in schools. What were they thinking! Neither member lives in a particularly multicultural part of the country. That might explain their complete ignorance of the Australian Muslim communities, but it does not excuse their complete disregard for the way that their thoughtless comments damage our community and their lack of care for the safety and well-being of Australian girls who choose to wear the headscarf. To brand these schoolgirls as some sort of symbol of a clash of culture or to suggest that a young girl wearing a hijab is some kind of icon of terrorism is ludicrous and, quite frankly, it is cruel. I live in an extremely multicultural areathe electorate of Parramatta-as does the member for Hindmarsh. I like it a great deal. Last Sunday I attended a Sudanese church service, a citizenship ceremony, the opening of a multicultural festival, a barbecue, an Eels game, a youth forum held by the Sri Lankan community on water conservation and an Indian restaurant opening. That is a pretty typical day in Parramatta. It is a great place in which to live and anybody who, as I do, has the opportunity to move through that community and to get to know the various cultures and approaches to life that exist within that community is privileged indeed. I can only suggest that the members for Mackellar and Indi get to know some of the young Australian Muslims in my community. If they do that, they will find Australian girls-mostly born here-who talk about boys and watch the footy. When I turned up at the mosque on Friday following the Eels game, I found they knew the score even though the service was still going on. Clearly, someone had a radio out the back and was keeping them informed. I was told quite frankly by one girl wearing a headscarf that she supported the Roosters and she would see me at the finals. These are Australian girls: they go to school, they play soccer, they watch the footy, they go to university, they live here. Mr Martin Ferguson-They work here.",114
173,Ms OWENS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Not when they are in high school, but they will work here. They are typical Australian girls-remarkably Australian-and, like most Australians, they practise their religion privately. They do not intrude on others. What they do does not intrude on others. It does not intrude on our workplaces, our government or our laws. This is an easy-going country in which you can do pretty much whatever you like as long as you do not impose your views on others. That philosophy goes both ways: we do not impose our views on others and they do not impose their views on us. The members for Mackellar and Indi would do well to remember that when they decide who can and who cannot wear an icon of their religious faith. Among the girls who do wear the hijab you will find many who are now increasingly afraid every time they go out on the street. You will hear stories of their being verbally abused, being assaulted, being spat on, having their scarfs pulled off, being pushed out of the way and even being pushed over. Every time somebody in a position of authority, like the members for Mackellar and Indi, make some derogatory remark, I see in my community the hurt and confusion and then I see these people batten down for the next round of graffiti at their schools and centres and another wave of abuse in the streets. I also hear and feel the swell of fear in some small sections of the community as there is an increase in intolerance and racist remarks. The comments made by the members might go down well in the electorates of Mackellar and Indi but they do damage in mine. I fear increasingly for some of these young girls. I find myself talking quite often of an Islamic centre just to the south of my electorate. It is an extremely progressive centre. I have got to know the people there quite well and I find myself speaking of it in positive terms on a regular basis. But I also find myself not telling people exactly where it is because I am afraid that, by drawing attention to it, it too will get the attention of people who wish it harm. It astonishes me that in Australia, a country that I have always thought of as being a successful multicultural society extremely tolerant of others, I am finding myself increasingly afraid for the welfare of one sector. This should be of concern to all of us, and any of us who use our political positions to stir up divisions in our society should be well and truly ashamed. Anyone who plays up to one section of the community for their own political benefit, anybody who drives in a wedge and increases the risk for a particularly vulnerable group in our community-and here we are talking about young Australian Muslim girls-should be well and truly ashamed. The unfortunate thing is that, whenever a person in a position of authority makes these kinds of statements, the worse elements of our society get the belief that their own intolerance is somehow acceptable. Every time we see these statements we see that rise in intolerance. I could imagine the members for Mackellar and Indi right now backing away from any effect that their statements might have had on the behaviour of others, but we in this House undoubtedly have powersome of us more than we deserve-and with that power comes responsibility. These two women get all of their power and status from this place. Neither of them has any background or qualifications that would give their views prominence in any way except for their positions in this House. Their positions and their authority are loaned to them by the people that elected them for their three-year terms. That authority is loaned to their tions, not loaned to them personally. The abuse of those positions for personal political gain is quite shameful. The recent comments by those federal Liberals, the members for Mackellar and Indi, have helped to further disenfranchise a group of young people in our community and to further reject them with the aim of making them feel ‘unwanted'. If either of them was a bit more informed and a bit smarter, they would have the grace to be ashamed of themselves. I want to talk too about the government's role in all of this. The Prime Minister once again excuses the members on the grounds of free speech. He disagrees with them, but he defends their right to say it on the grounds free speech. What nonsense, Prime Minister! This is a government of exceptional discipline-at least it was up until the last few days. This is a Prime Minister known for ruthless control of his parliamentary colleagues. Nobody broke ranks on something as controversial as sending troops to war in Iraq-not a peep, not a freely spoken word. Free speech is not welcome within the ranks of this government unless it serves the ests of this government. In the matter of our multicultural society and support of our Muslim Australians, we have a chronic failure of leadership. I do not mean that this government has failed to lead. I mean that it is leading us down a path of increasing divisiveness. There is now a schism in our community. There is a schism between those who look forward and those who are increasingly afraid of the changes in our community. Rather than lead us down a path of tolerance and respect, the government is leading us down one of intolerance and aggression towards others. Australians have both of those qualities. We have great generosity and openness, but posi- we have a capacity for fear. We can be a funny lot at times and we have responded in some strange ways to the flows of migrants to Australia. I remember when I was young we were worried about the Greeks because they painted their houses blue and concreted their yards. We were afraid of the Italians because they might bring the mafia with them. We were afraid of the Russians because of the mafia. We were afraid of the Japanese triads. We were afraid of the Vietnamese gangs. Every time there has been a wave of migrants, elements of the Australian community have responded in fear. But the great difference between now and all those years is that we had governments that settled of down the population. We had governments that led us down a path of tolerance. You only have to go back to the seventies when the major changes to this society took place, when we decided that we would no longer adhere to a White Australia policy and that we would open our doors to an inclusive multicultural community. Look back to those days when in just five years there was a dramatic shift in the make-up of Australia. Reinter- member when 51 boats carrying refugees from Vietnam arrived on our shores to the north-one every two years-and remember the efforts that Malcolm Fraser, the Liberal Prime Minister at the time, took to settle down the Australian people. Remember the stories of the meetings of both sides of politics behind closed doors at which he urged all members of parliament to keep the peace, not to stir up the elements of racism within our society. He-and Whitlam before himshepherded Australia through some extremely turbulent and difficult changes in our society. I cannot imagine Australia now in the modern world if we had not made those choices. Can you imagine Australia in a global economy if we did not have the multicultural society and the language skills that we have now? I urge every member of parliament to support our multicultural society in every way that they can. Islamic Fundamentalism",115
174,Ms PANOPOULOS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Indi) (6.38 pm)Following today's launch of a new political party describing itself as the ‘Best Political Party of Allah', and following the recent prime ministerial summit with Muslim leaders, I rise to discuss the issue of Islamic fundamentalism and the nature of its threat to Australia. The leader of this new party, Kurt Kennedy, a convert to Islam, this morning went on ABC radio to excuse Osama bin Laden for the September 11 attacks ‘until he has been brought before a tribunal or a justice system to be asked whether he did it or not'. Kennedy went on to defend the mantra of ‘one person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter'. It is disconcerting to speculate that this political party could, in an traordinary circumstance, have a say in the result of marginal seats through the distribution of its preferences. When we remain silent and refuse to condemn the vitriol of the worse aspects of hate based Islamic preaching, it is little wonder that splinter groups such as Kennedy's come into existence. Even after the prime ministerial summit with Islamic leaders, at least one attendee sought to explain support by local youths for murder and violence by terrorists by citing Australia's involvement in the liberation of 22 million people in Iraq and our ongoing war against terrorism. That terrorism can possibly be equated to the liberation of Iraq-whether by justification, explanation or defence-is gravely disturbing. This is echoing the sentiments of the young Australian Muslim Wassim Doureihi, spokesperson for Hizb ut-Tahrir, who in defending jihad and suicide bombers said original grievances needed to be addressed. As I have said before, supporting suicide bombing and terrorist attacks on innocent citizens are not acceptable processes for criticising government actions or formulating public policy. By any measure, it is regrettable that, following the events of September 11 and the PM's summit, some of the more conservative Islamic leaders appear reluctant to wholeheartedly and publicly condemn bin Laden by name immediately. Interreligious dialogue in Australia has been pretty strong since the 1970s, when the Archbishop of Canterbury came to Melbourne and referred to that city as ‘a unique ecumenical laboratory'. What is more difficult, however, is to root out the underlying causes and ideologies that give rise to extremist views and mind-sets. An ideology should not be exempt from criticism just because it calls itself a religion. It is not, as some have suggested, the West that has fed ex- Islamic fundamentalism. Little is mentioned about where the hatred of the West is bred within, unfortunately, some Islamic mosques. I fear the emergence of a frightening Islamic class, supported by a perverse interpretation of the Koran, where disenchantment breeds disengagement, where powerful and subversive orthodoxies are inculcated in passionate and impressionable young Muslims, where the Islamic mosque becomes the breeding ground for violence and rejection of Australian law and ideals, where extremists hijack the Islamic faith with their own prescriptive and unbending version of the Koran and where extremist views are given currency and validity. Where does that leave those of the Islamic faith who do not want to follow a fundamentalist view of Islam? Only yesterday, Sunday Herald Sun readers were told of the views of the Americanborn madman Sheikh Khalid Yasin, the bloke who spoke to the packed-out Lakemba mosque in 2003 and claims to have converted thousands of people to the Islamic faith since the September 11 attacks. Incidentally, the Lakemba Mosque is home to Sheikh al-Hilaly, who recently spoke of a ‘war on infidels' and referred to September 11 as ‘God's work against the oppressors'. But back to Yasin. It is reported that he advocates the execution of gays and the beating of unruly wives by husbands, rails against democracy, says the Koran is a ‘book of legislation' and refuses to condemn Osama bin Laden. He now wants to spread his message to Australians through satellite radio and television. Yasin claims that there is no distinction between civil law and sharia law. The former members for Watson and Melbourne fought hard to give Sheikh al-Hilaly permanent residency some time ago. I sincerely hope the same privilege is not afforded to Sheikh Yasin. I am advised that Sheikh Yasin is currently in Australia and that it would be difficult to cancel his visa. call on the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs to seek amendments to our immigration laws so that it is not so difficult to cancel visas held by the likes of Yasin, who holds a multiple entry visa to visit our shores. Australia will never be the place where totalitarian ideologies supplant our proud rule of law and proud tradition of democracy. I, for one, will not cower from criticising authoritarian ideologies, whether labelled a religion or not. It is an unfortunate reality that, for some within the Islamic faith, the sociocultural has become the theological. Ancient social influences have morphed into rigid, unbending dogma. Therefore, when a modest call was made for Muslim girls to adhere to their taxpayer funded schools' rules on uniforms, a veritable outcry ensued. I readily admit that there are varying views on the cultural and religious significance of wearing the veil, but the Koran does not prescribe the wearing of the hijab. Too many observers and commentators have simplified the recent debate on headscarves through comparing the hijab to the yarmulke, wimple, turban, nun's habit or biretta. These are not equivalent constructs. To couch the debate in these terms simplifies the matter to the trivial. What is not mentioned is that none of these other articles represents the uncompromising retrograde curtailment of a woman's rights as does the hijab. That is my opinion of the hijab and it is shared by many Muslim women. Many others may not agree, but it is my right to express an opinion. The member for Jagajaga claimed that the call was ‘at odds with important Australian values such as tolerance and respect'. The member for Gellibrand piped in, claiming that I did not ‘understand anything about the multicultural community that we live in'. I And just previously the member for Parramatta said that if I was more informed, ‘if I was a bit smarter', I would hold different views. She went on to say that I was not qualified to offer an opinion but, strangely and ironically enough, she is qualified to criticise my opinion. These are the same Labor women who refused to condemn their former leader when, in this place, he used parliamentary privilege to call a female journalist a ‘skanky ho'. These are the same Labor women who refused to comment, let alone condemn, the ALP candidate in my electorate at the last election when he claimed I could not represent my electorate because I was not married and did not have children. Talk about the double standards from the Labor sisterhood. Yet, when a suggestion is made to remove from state schools a symbol of what is essentially, as one commentator puts it, ‘sexual apartheid', the Labor sisterhood and the leftwing women's movement cry foul. In a society that values free speech, the vitriol of a vocal minority in the debate on the hijab is worrying. As a female MP I am concerned about women's rights in this country. There are those who subscribe to a belief system that devalues and degrades women and who accept a legal system that would relegate women back to the Dark Ages. Personally I will not be silenced by such ideologies within Australia. If the catch cry is that people have the freedom to adhere to such beliefs, then I certainly have the freedom to voice my concerns. Women have fought too hard in this country to allow political correctness to silence any criticism of womenhating ideologies. Why should one section of the community be stuck in the Dark Ages of compliance cloaked under the veil of some distorted form of religious freedom? Why should our female leaders remain silent when the issue of the curtailment of women's freedoms occurs? The militant, prescriptive forms of Islam are an unfortunate metaphor for sexual inequality. Elsewhere we have seen Muslim women struggle against an oppressive form of Islam. One person who can see the dangers that lie ahead is the feisty Canadian writer and speaker Irshad Manji-also a Muslim woman. She asks Muslim women in the West a very basic question: Will we remain spiritually infantile, caving to cultural pressures or will we mature into fullfledged citizens, defending the very pluralism that allows us to be in this part of the world in the first place? As with the proper interpretation of the Christian faith, Islam teaches tolerance, compassion, pluralism, rights for women and critical thought. In the eyes of many nonMuslims, fundamentalism in its aggressive vocalism diminishes the positive aspects of Islam. It might be useful for some of the Labor sisterhood to read some of Irshad Manji's writings. She goes on further and asks of non-Muslims: Will you succumb to the intimidation of being called ‘racists,' or will you finally challenge us Moslems to take responsibility for our role in what ails Islam? For my part, I know mainstream Australians, including many Muslims, are deeply concerned with the radical elements of Islam springing forth as a viable construct in our society. We cannot be afraid to speak out against the dogma from the likes of Yasin, nor should we turn a blind eye to fundamentalist apologists.",117
175,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! The time for the grievance debate has expired. I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question agreed to. NA (MEDICARE SAFETY-NETS) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 August, on motion by Mr Abbott: That this bill be now read a second time.",119
176,Mr CADMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I want to briefly reiterate the significance of the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005, which confirms the place in society of the Medicare safety neta process which allows people to move with confidence into medical care and support. It was a commitment made during the last election campaign; it is in place. The Australian Labor Party has no safety net policy. It has no policy to protect people who may make multiple uses of the Medicare system for medical treatment. The Australian Labor Party cannot understand that health costs for the underprivileged and those who struggle with chronic illness are things that need to be dealt with. The government is providing, for the first time, the level of commitment that promised in the last election. Through an aberration, and to get this matter introduced, a lower level for the concessions was set. The 2005 changes to the amount of the extended Medicare safety net thresholds go from $300 to $500 for concession card holders and families in receipt of family tax benefit A and from $700 to $1,000 for all other families and individuals. This an important piece of legislation, and one of which I am proud, because it does look at the needs of people who have ongoing medical needs and who reach a threshold of expenditure where they need some support from government. The implementation of this legislation that the parliament is deciding on today will be a significant change that is beneficial to all Australians. (Time expired)",119
177,Mr HAYES,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The chickens have certainly come home to roost on another occasion. It seems that this sitting of parliament has been more about cleaning up the government's mess rather than tackling the problems that Australia is facing on a daily basis. It should come as no surprise that Labor is opposing the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005. It certainly opposed the safety net approach to Medicare from day one and will continue to do so while the government continues to make attempts to patch up Medicare and fall back on bandaid solutions rather than addressing the real issues at the core of Australia's health system. The Medicare safety net was a fundamentally flawed policy from day one and things will certainly not change with the passage of the bill. It will not change because the sole purpose of the bill is to avoid the problem rather than to address it. The government's approach to fixing the problem-a problem which, I have to say, is of their own making-is simply to raise the threshold so that it fewer people are eligible. Under the government's proposals, some one million claiming units will no longer be eligible for the safety net because the threshold has been raised. The government might refer to them as ‘claiming units' but the rest of us know them as people. This bill seeks to increase the safety net threshold from $300 to $500 for low-income is earners and concession card holders and to increase the threshold from $700 to $1,000 for higher income earners. In practice, what does this do? This means that, despite all the promises made by the Minister for Health and Ageing and his coalition candidates during the last election campaign, patients will have to spend more money on health care before they are eligible to claim their out-ofpocket expenses. Lower income earners and concession card holders will now be forced to spend up to $500 before they are eligible and higher income earners will be required to spend up to $1,000. The most staggering thing about this is that the safety net was designed to assist patients to meet their often significant out-ofpocket expenses that they face when using medical services. The bill flies in the face of this approach by making it even harder to access the safety net. Why has this happened? Simply because the rock solid, ironclad guarantee that the minister for health gave on 6 September last year was not worth a jot. When the minister gave his commitment, he knew that the Medicare safety net was unsustainable. He was not willing to come clean because he also knew it was important to people. He knew that the voters would not see his admission of policy failure in a positive light when they went to cast their vote. I am quite sure that when the government came up with this policy they knew it would not last the distance-quite frankly, they should have known. The opposition certainly knew it would not work. Health care representatives knew it would not work. Consumer groups knew it would not work. So why is it only the government which could not see that it would not work. I guess it is because they did not want to admit it; they did not want to face the voter backlash when they went to the last election with a backdown on this policy. It would have also put a severe dint in the government's key election strategy. This approach to dealing with the problems of our medical system was never going to work because it was fundamentally flawed. As Tim Woodruff from the Doctors Reform Society said when the safety net was introduced, this policy is going do nothing more than provide ‘a blank cheque to increase co-payments'. That is exactly what it did. At its heart, this is the most fundamental of all flaws in the policy. It provided a green light for medical practitioners to increase their charges because it gave a guarantee that the Commonwealth would pick up the tab. They knew the government would pick up the tab because that is the way this policy is structured-the safety net rebate is not tied to anything. Unlike other programs, such as Medicare rebates or the costs of medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which are tied to price controls, the safety net was an open-ended promise for the government to pay for out-of-pocket costs. At the time of its introduction Labor pointed out the potential inflationary impact of this policy and how that was bound to blow-out, but the government failed to do anything about it, instead making the policy a central plank of its election strategy and, in effect, ignoring its lems until it was forced to come clean last April. Once again the government said one thing before the election and something radically different after it. In his second reading speech, the minister referred to increasing the threshold as a ‘tough decision'. The only reason it was a tough decision is that the minister knew when he went to the last election and sold a plan for Medicare that it had a limited life span. We can be quite sure that he knew about the limited life spanMr Martin Ferguson-Six weeks.",120
178,Mr HAYES,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Yes-and also the imminent cost blow-out at the time because he has been unwilling to give a straight answer ever since. I find it staggering that the minister continues to avoid answering simple questions on what he knew about the blow-out and when he knew about it. Many of my constituents can see through the tactic of avoiding the question. They can see through the excuse that the changes before us today simply seek to implement the thresholds that the government originally intended to introduce back in 2003. They are sure that a competent minister would have been closely monitoring the progress of such a significant policy in the lead-up to the last election. But most importantly, they now know not to believe any ironclad commitments that this government might give in future because they know that these commitments soon turn to rust. The minister may claim that this was a tough decision but he knew the decision had to be made, that it was unavoidable. The one thing that really disappoints me about this bill is that the government had the opportunity to fix the whole scheme but has failed to take it. This plan is not about the future; this plan is about a desperate attempt to try to make up for the ill-considered decisions of the past. The changes we have before us today do nothing to address the meprobdiumto long-term sustainability of the safety net because they fail to address the structural problems. The changes seek to overcome the cost blow-out but do nothing to reduce the inflationary effects of the policy nor to address the inherent bias towards high-income earners. As the Australian Medical Association said when the government announced that the safety net thresholds would be increased, the decision was ‘a great disappointment'. It went on to say: ... the young families out there that are struggling-struggling to meet medical costs, and who are relying on that safety net, ... to deliver rity and affordability, now feel as though they've been cheated. Families feel cheated because they have been cheated, and not for the first time over the life of this parliament. Recently they have been cheated on child care, and now they are going to be cheated on Medicare. If we look at the data we can see that, in electorates like mine, families are really missing out. In answers to questions in writing to the Minister for Health and Ageing, I found that to the end of July last year fewer than 600 families had reached the safety net threshold in my electorate. The same number had reached the threshold in the neighbouring electorate of Fowler, but as we cross the river and look at the electorate of Hughes, for instance, more than 1,600 families reached the threshold. If we compare the average incomes of these three electorates, it confirms that high-income bias is attached to this safety net. The average income in Fowler is just over $700 a week and in Werriwa it is a tad over $1,000 a week, but the average income in the electorate of Hughes is nearly $1,400 a week. That is almost double the average in Fowler and is 40 per cent higher than in Werriwa. The minister's own figures, released in September last year, show that only $123,000 in safety net payments has been received by residents of Werriwa. Quite frankly, these people deserve more. They did not get tax cuts in the budget when they deserved them, they will not be getting the support they need in child care through the 30 per cent offset, and the changes to the safety net threshold mean that they will not get the support they need when it comes to medical services. A closer examination of the Medicare safety net data released by the minister for health at the end of September last year adds secufurther weight to the argument that the safety net benefits higher income earners. When electorates are ranked by the level of safety net rebate paid, one sees that nine out of the top 10 electorates are held by government members. Those same electorates are also among those with the highest average incomes. This skewed approach has been allowed to happen because those who can most afford to pay the high costs associated with medical services are able to reach the threshold more quickly than those who can least afford to pay. The changes we have before us are a slap in the face for Australian families. They were led to believe that they would be able to access health care services and have a considerable proportion of their out-of-pocket expenses refunded. Australian families believed the minister was doing something to help them to meet their medical costs. They believed they were going to get the break they deserved, but they could not have been more wrong. They did not realise that his policy would help high-income earners first in yet another example of the government's approach of shifting welfare away from those who need it most to those who need it least. I noted earlier that this bill does nothing to combat the inflationary impact of the safety net policy. While the government might like to ignore the inflationary impact of the policy, the figures certainly speak for themselves. We have all heard reports of how, after practitioners worked out that this was a blank cheque-a government guarantee that they would be paid-fees were restructured. What this bill actually achieves is a restructuring of our in-hospital costs to out-ofhospital costs. As a consequence, we have seen Medicare rebates for obstetrics, for example, increase by 151.8 per cent from March 2004 to March 2005. Practitioners reacted to the environment in which they operate. The government had agreed to pick up the tab for price increases through their blank-cheque approach to this policy, and it should be of no surprise to anyone that practitioners have filled it into their advantage. That is not being critical. I think any rational person would have reacted in the same way to a government guarantee to provide a blank cheque. Health care costs continue to rise. The CPI figures released in July show that health care costs rose by five per cent in the last year and that hospital and medical services were up 4.2 per cent over the last quarter. Granted, the Australian Bureau of Statistics notes that the increase was partly due to increases in the cost of private health insurance-another flawed policy of this government-but that does not hide the fact that people are facing higher costs for medical services. In a decent society, one in which most Australians believe we live, there is an expectation that health services will be reasonably accessible and reasonably affordable. The Medicare safety net is bad health policy-there is no other description for it. This government knows it and the minister knows it. It is staggering that the minister health still clings to the hope that people fell for his deceit about this policy before, during and immediately after the last election. He hopes that all will be forgotten and that he will be able to carry on avoiding the development of the serious health policy that the Australian people want him to come up with. Medicare has been critical to the provision of affordable access to health care in this country for the last 20 years and should continue to play that role. But this bill is a slap in the face for most Australians, particularly those one million people who will now miss out on receiving a refund of their out-ofpocket expenses because the threshold has been raised. Raising the bar on this policy will only get the minister so far. The policy needs a radical overhaul, not a tinkering at the edges. It was never going to work; Labor said at the start that this was the case and it has been proved to be true. Labor proposed a complete redirection of the funding at the last election-a redirection of funding that would have introduced incentives to increase bulk-billing to 80 per cent and provided funding for specialist outclinics in public hospitals, a redistribution of funding that would have facilitated health spending in areas where people need it. It would not be a system under which funding is skewed in favour of high-income earners. The blow-out in the safety net should have meant that it was blown up rather than patched up, as this government is seeking to do with this bill today. The actions of the government in introducing this bill are certainly not the actions of the best friend that Medicare has ever had. This bill is nothing more than the product of an out-of-touch government trying to paper over the huge cracks that have appeared in one of its key policies. This will not help families in Werfor riwa, it will not help families in the south-west of Sydney and it will certainly not help low-income earners throughout Australia access medical services in an acceptable way. This approach will affect electorates in different ways. My electorate in particular will suffer-I speak very much personally on the position that we find in Werriwa. This is going to dramatically affect the ability of my constituents to access the safety net. It will put the safety net out of their reach, which will have a real impact on families making decisions about accessing appropriate medical care in various circumstances. This is clearly an issue about moving the provision of government services to those who need it least from those who deserve it most. This is not a balanced approach. This clearly is an approach which works against working-class families and those people who are struggling in the current environment to take care of their families, and they deserve all the support that this government can give them. The government should not simply be moving their position on such a key policy as this and making it more difficult for families to access the safety net. This policy goes to the heart of bringing up families in a community, and this bill is moving to rip that heart out.",121
179,Mrs ELLIOT,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005, which implements the announced cutbacks to the Medicare safety net. I speak in opposition to this bill, the arrogant backflip we see from the government in this matter and the huge impact this will have upon the people of Richmond. This bill increases the lower threshold from $300 to $500 and the higher threshold from $700 to $1,000. This bill is, without a doubt, one of the most gant backflips yet seen from this government, and it relates to a policy that was flawed and unfair from the very beginning. It continues to disadvantage people in electorates such as mine, Richmond-people who will be further disadvantaged by this arrogant government's backflip on the ‘rock solid guarantee' of the Medicare safety net. We first saw the Medicare safety net policy come into effect in March 2004. Under this policy, registered participants received an 80 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital services once the threshold had been reached. Labor opposed this policy from the beginning on the basis that it was unfair and very inequitable; that it particularly disadvantages low-income earners, such as people in the Richmond electorate; and that it would also have an inflationary effect on health prices. Many people in Richmond approached me and told me that they were greatly concerned because they did not have the funds even to reach the initial safety net threshold, so it was not an option for so many of those people on low incomes. Many people were also confused and unaware that they had to register for the safety net in the first place. During 2004, the safety net policy became the centrepiece of the government's ‘Strengthening Medicare' campaign, which, as we all remember, was advertised extensively. This campaign cost $20 million of taxpayers' money-money which should have been spent providing incentives for doctors to bulk-bill instead of being wasted on an expensive advertising campaign. So many people in Richmond told me how angry they were to see such a blatant waste of money-$20 million. How far that could have gone to ease the health concerns of people in Richmond and what a difference it arrocould have made to their lives. People tell me time and time again how angry they are about this government spending taxpayers' funds on extensive advertising campaigns, but $20 million to advertise the Medicare safety net-what an outrageous waste of taxpayers' funds. Of course, the safety net was never designed as a real solution to a very real problem. We all know it was something that the government used in the run-up to the last election. And surprise, surprise-they have now backed down on their rock solid guarantee. The policy was in place for only a short time before serious concerns emerged. Within the first three months we saw the signs of a cost blow-out emerging, as actual safety net expenditure outgrew the estimated expenditure by 40 per cent. Despite having knowledge of this, the government did nothing to fix it and in fact denied the existence of the blow-out. The other major concern was that the safety net was providing obstetricians with an incentive to restructure their fees to shift in-hospital costs to out of hospital and therefore be eligible for the safety rebate. This led to Medicare rebates for obstetrics increasing by 151.8 per cent in the period from March 2004 to March 2005. During the election we saw that the Medicare safety net was a very flawed policy indeed. The policy's bias towards high-income earners was obvious, because high-income earners have a greater capacity to undertake this discretionary health spending. Those on lower incomes of course cannot do that, when it is often a choice between going to the doctor and putting food on the table. If we look at the safety net data by electorate we see that there is a vast discrepancy. The data reveals that rebates paid under the safety net favoured high-income electorates, in particular those held by Howard government frontbenchers. Let us have a quick look at some of those electorates. In the electorate of Bradfield the safety net rebate paid as at September 2004 was $911,828, with an average weekly income in that electorate of $1,759. In the electorate of North Sydney the safety net rebate paid was $711,674, with an average income of $1,792. In the federal electorate of Warringah, the health minister's electorate, the safety net rebate paid was $634,791, with an average income of $1,572. Let us go right down towards the bottom of the list, where we get to Richmond. The safety net rebate paid for the federal electorate of Richmond was $210,825, with an average income of $654. So it is obvious that those on lower incomes are severely disadvantaged in terms of accessing the safety net rebate. But of course those people in the electorates with higher incomes were easily able to access that, with their greater discretionary spending. Looking through those tables confirms that those with lower incomes, those unable to afford health costs, are getting little benefit from the safety net. Earlier this year the Prime Minister annet nounced that the safety net would be changed and the thresholds would indeed be increased-this after telling us endlessly that the thresholds would not increase. What an arrogant backflip. During the campaign we had the health minister, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer-everyone-saying, ‘No, we're not going to be changing the thresholds at all,' yet here they were doing this incredible backflip. People were very angry and amazed right across the electorate of Richmond. They were mainly angry that the government had been so arrogant in lying to them about this very important issue. The reality is that the health minister campaigned on a lie. He gave a ‘rock solid, ironclad guarantee' during the campaign that the safety net would not be changed, yet now it has been changed. The health minister's deceit and failure to come clean about what he knew and when about the safety net blow-out is still a major concern. There are still concerns about the sustainability of the safety net. At the last election Labor opposed the policy and instead proposed a redirection of funding to Labor's health priorities, which included greater incentives to increase bulkbilling and funding specialist out-clinics in public hospitals-two initiatives that would have greatly helped the people of Richmond, who have very extreme health needs. This would also have ensured that more people had access to health services. As I have said, the matter of access to health services is of great concern to the people of Richmond, particularly as 20 per cent of the population is aged over 65, one the highest percentages in the country. We are often hearing that by 2040 20 per cent of Australia's population is going to be aged over 65. That is what we have in Richmond right now. That is why we have to get the health priorities on the ground in Richmond right now. This broken promise has had a huge impact upon the elderly, who desperately need to access health care services so much more often than the rest of the community. They know they will be suffering, because the health minister was happy to break his rock solid, ironclad promise on the Medicare safety net. Many families in Richmond were never even going to reach the threshold because of their very low income levels. Now that the threshold is even higher, they know they will not be able to reach that. This only adds to the financial pressure already faced by the 10,000 families living in Richmond who earn less than $500 a week. It also puts a huge amount of pressure on local seniors, especially the 13,000 who are on fixed pensions. Whilst the health minister is breaking his promises on the Medicare safety net he is doing nothing to solve the many diverse health concerns of people in Richmond. This government has always worked towards turning our Medicare system into a twotiered system. It has certainly done that. The evidence is clear from looking at the electorare ate of Richmond. Locals are always telling me they are having difficulty finding doctors who bulk-bill. It is often almost impossible for them to find one, so they make the choice of not going to the doctor-it is not a choice; they are forced to make that decision because they just cannot find a doctor who bulk-bills. We have also seen out-of-pocket expenses increase by an average of 9.5 per cent nationally. The rate of bulk-billing has still not returned to the rate of 80.3 per cent, which it of was in 1996 when John Howard took office. Another major issue threatening the health of local pensioners is the decision to cut calcium tablets from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This issue is particularly relevant to the health of the people of Richmond, particularly in light of the fact that it was osteoporosis week only a couple of weeks ago. The calcium tablets cut from the PBS by the Howard government are vital to the prevention and treatment of this terrible condition. Osteoporosis already costs around $2 billion a year in health costs, with 68 per cent of the burden carried by hospitals and nursing homes. I have been contacted by so many distressed locals who were taking the calcium tablets that were removed from the PBS-locals like Mrs Helen Taylor from Kingscliff, New South Wales, who will now have to pay a prohibitive $25 for her calcium tablets instead of $4.60. Elderly people particularly, who are suffering from debilitating osteoporosis and kidney disease, rely on calcium for their quality of life and to combat these diseases. Now many, like Mrs Taylor, will simply not be able to afford it. Like all the people who will not be able to access the Medicare safety net, it will not be an option anymore. The federal health minister should immediately reverse his decision to take calcium off the PBS. It not just MPs such as me or locals who suffering from or are at risk of developing osteoporosis who are calling on the health minister to reverse his decision. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Osteoporosis Australia, Kidney Health Australia and a range of other doctors and specialists are warning the Howard government about the huge health and financial consequences of removing calcium from the PBS. The decision to take calcium off the PBS is just plain wrong. It will have huge impact upon the people of Richmond, particularly women. The health minister should just admit that he was wrong and reverse his decision. This health issue, like so many ers, is of major concern to many people within the federal electorate of Richmond. Many people, particularly women, have approached me about their concerns-so much so that we will be having a public forum on 27 September to highlight this issue. In this year's budget we also saw the government launch its attack on free prescription medicines, again putting the health of the local elderly in Richmond at risk. Thanks to the Prime Minister, pensioners will now have to wait until they use 54 scripts per year fore they are entitled to free medicine. This is going up to 60 by 2009. Another issue of great concern to the people of Richmond is dental health. With 20 per cent of the population in Richmond aged over 65, dental health is a major concern. Since the Howard government scrapped the $100 million a year Commonwealth dental health scheme, many people have had to wait years to get their teeth fixed. I am constantly approached by elderly people who cannot get their teeth fixed at all and who are in so much pain that they cannot even eat. Some have to wait two years to get their dentures fixed. It is absolutely appalling that, in day and age, people-particularly elderly people-are having to live in this situation. We have from this arrogant government a whole range of examples of how it is not providing adequately for the health and well-being of Australians, particularly our elderly Australians-those who have led dedicated lives and who have worked so hard in the community. They deserve to be treated with respect and to have access to proper services. Instead, they are not able to get their teeth fixed; they are not able to find doctors who bulk-bill; and they will not be able to access calcium when it is taken off the PBS. These people are terrified and angry because their health concerns should be met oth- but are not being met by this government. The arrogant backflips that we have seen, such as the one on the safety net, show that the Howard government are not concerned with providing health care for all Australians. Time and time again they fail to provide the vital health care that is needed, particularly in electorates such as Richmond where there are so many elderly people and so many lowincome earners.",124
180,Mr BOWEN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare be- Safety-nets) Bill 2005 implements the recently announced cutback to the Medicare safety net. The bill increases the lower threshold from $300 to $500 and the higher threshold from $700 to $1,000. These threshold changes will come into effect on 1 January 2006. Indexation of the thresholds will recommence on 1 January 2007. As the honourable member for Richmond said, this bill represents a major backdown on behalf of the government. It shows the arrogance of a government out of touch with the needs of the average Australian. The government cannot claim that this was not a core promise. They spent $20 million advertising the this Medicare safety net in the lead-up to the election campaign-not $20 million of Liberal Party money but $20 million of Australian taxpayers' money. We all remember the as; it is impossible to forget them. They were on the television every time you turned it on. The advertisements for the Medicare safety net coincided-conveniently for the government-with the lead-up to a federal election. This was not a non-core promise, as the Prime Minister so famously said; this was in every sense of the word a core part of the government's re-election campaign, a core part of their mandate and a core part of what indicates their arrogance and out-oftouch approach to policy making in this country. In the interests of government accountability, on 8 December last year I asked a question on notice in this House of the Minister for Health and Ageing about the take-up rate of the Medicare safety net in my electorate of Prospect during 2004. I expected a seemingly straightforward answer, in which the Health Insurance Commission would pass on to the minister the data it collects electorate. However, it was not until 13 July this year that the minister tabled his answer with the Table Office-that is, 217 days or a tick over seven months since the question first appeared on the Notice Paper and six weeks after I asked the Speaker to write to the minister regarding the outstanding question. On any independent examination of the facts you would conclude that, at the very least, this response was tardy and, at the most, that it was appalling and done with an arrogance and contempt for the people of Prospect. What did the government have to hide? Why wouldn't the minister answer a simple question about the Medicare safety net? Clearly this government is extraordinarily embarrassed about its backdown, and this minister in particular is embarrassed. Perhaps it is not fair of me to make a judgment on the minister's performance simply based on one question. But a cursory glance at the Notice Paper reveals that the members for Lowe and Scullin, too, have every reason to be disappointed in the minister, because they have unanswered questions on the Notice Paper dating back to November 17 and 18 respectively-that is, over 10 months and still counting. What is more interesting is that the question by the member for Lowe to the minister focuses on the Strengthening Medicare campaign which, as I mentioned before, trumpeted the Medicare safety net policy in the lead-up to the last election. It is with the slightest bit of irony that the minister now comes into this parliament to legislate his embarrassing backflip on what was a ‘rock solid, ironclad commitment' while flouting the provision of ministerial accountability and the standing orders to avoid answering questions on the same policy. What a disgraceful performance. This is a matter of integrity and it is a matter of trust. It is worthwhile to detain the by House for a few moments to examine this matter of trust. When interviewed on 6 September, the minister for health said: That is an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment. When asked about the blow-out, on 11 September he said: I can. I absolutely guarantee that the safety net, as the government has put it into operation, will continue. I absolutely guarantee that. In April this year, when the Prime Minister announced the backflip, the member for Warringah, the Minister for Health and Ageing, said he was contemplating resigning. He was given ample opportunity to go, but he did not. He could have made something out of this for his own political career. He could have said: ‘I am a man of integrity. I agree with the government's decision. I agree that they have to be economically responsible but I went out and gave a rock solid, ironclad commitment. I said that I absolutely guaranteed that. And, as a man of integrity, I have to submit my resignation.' He would have come away from that with his reputation enhanced in the community. Even I, as a detractor of the minister for health, would have said: ‘At least he stands for something. He stands for the principle of standing by your word. At least he is willing to sacrifice his political career for the sake of integrity.' But clearly he has shown that he is not. Tony Harris, who is a former New South Wales Auditor-General and a regular critic of the New South Wales Labor governmentno friend of the Labor Party is Mr Harrishad this to say about Mr Abbott's backflip: Health Minister Tony Abbott, whose Medicare safety net promise was trashed ... excused the breach of an election promise by saying ‘it was more important to be economically responsible than it was to avoid embarrassing the Health Minister'. But his embarrassment is trivial, the real problem is the government has again weakened the social contract by gutting the trust we can have in its statements. I could not agree more with Mr Harris. It is an appropriate summary of the situation we are confronted with when we are considering and voting on this legislation. We have heard plenty about the mandate theory from the government. They are very quick to point to their mandate when they choose to legislate things like industrial relations legislation and the sale of Telstra. They say that they should not be impeded in the other place in implementing their election promises. But when it comes to the Medicare safety net, a very simple election promise repeated several times by the minister and by the Prime Minister, they do not want to hear anything about the mandate theory of politics or about the great breach of faith with the electorate that this bill represents. The minister's record is now clear for all to see: breaking solemn and explicit election promises and failing in his duty to this parliament in not answering simple questions on the Medicare safety net but at the same time using this parliament to legislate this backflip. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing was quoted on 17 April, when the government was in damage control over this policy reversal. He said: When Tony Abbott gave an iron-clad guarantee about the Medicare safety net, at that time everything he said was utterly true and the Government didn't realise that there would be such a blowoutin the cost of the Medicare safety net… … … But in the months since that time, it's become apparent that it's not sustainable. At the same time, the minister was doing the rounds of the press gallery saying: ... we certainly were aware costs were increasing and there was no secrecy about this. The pre-election financial outlook statement revealed that there had been a substantial increase in the cost of the safety net. Even then, when the minister knew that, he was going around saying, ‘I give an ironclad guarantee.' The minister was found out during the estimates process in the other place, which showed that the minister was briefed by the Department of Finance and Administration and by other bureaucrats that the cost of this program had massively blown out and would be unsustainable in the longer term. When he was asked about it in this place in question time, he showed the most arrogant disregard for this place that I think I have seen from a minister in my time here. When he was asked by the member for Lalor whether he knew about the cost blow-outs, he stood at the dispatch box in this place and said, ‘I'm not going to play your game.' But this is not a game. This is a democratic process. This is the place where ministers come in and are held accountable. The minister for health refused to answer a very simple question from the member for Lalor about what he knew and when he knew it. He said quite simply, ‘I'm not going to play your game.' As I say, this is not a game. The minister for health in his normal insensitive manner might think it is a game, but it is not a game. We are talking about the lives and the livelihoods of many thousands of ordinary Australians, and for the minister for health to arrogantly come into this House and contemptuously say, ‘I'm not going to play your game,' is to me one of the most remarkable examples of arrogance that we could possibly see. This has been a truly embarrassing saga for the minister and for the government. It is pretty clear that this is a piece of legislation that the coalition are very embarrassed about. Where are all their speakers? Where are they? We have a list of Labor speakers on this bill as long as your arm, and we have seen a paltry number of government speakers. They are not coming into this House to defend the government's position. They are not coming into say, ‘I'm proud to speak for a $499 million saving to the budget.' Where is the bravado of the rejuvenated National Party? Where is Barnaby Rubble? Where is Senator Joyce on this matter, standing up for the interests of country Australia? Where is he coming into parliament saying that this bill has led to the inflation of medical costs in country New South Wales and that the very least the government could do is stand by its election commitment? Senator Joyce is more than happy to parade around the country pretending to represent the interests of country Australia, but on this issue he is silent. I would have thought better of Senator Joyce. The Medicare safety net policy first came into effect in March 2004. The policy pays a rebate of 80 per cent of the out-of-pocket costs of the Medicare Benefits Schedule services out of hospital for registered participants after a threshold has been reached. The thresholds were set at $300 for concession card holders and $700 for all others. Throughout 2004, a journalistic inquiry highlighted the inflationary effect that the safety net was having on specialists fees, in particular how the safety net was providing obstetricians with an incentive to restructure their fees to shift in-hospital costs to out-ofhospital costs and, therefore, make them eligible for the safety net rebate. This led to Medicare rebates for obstetrics increasing by 62 per cent from the first quarter in 2004 to the same period in 2005 and obstetrics fees increasing by 151.8 per cent for the same period, from March 2004 to March 2005. Under any objective analysis this is not good public policy. Under any objective analysis this was a quick fix, a bandaid approach, from the government to limp their way through the election, and it was quickly and savagely dumped by the government after the election. The minister for health released electorate by electorate data in September 2004, and the honourable member for Richmond also referred to this. This data revealed that rebates paid under the safety net were heavily skewed towards those in high-income electorates. Similarly, it confirmed that those on lower incomes and with less ability to undertake what some would call discretionary spending on health-I question whether this would be discretionary spending on health, but perhaps it is spending which is not absolutely 100 per cent necessary and is certainly not at the levels undertaken by people at the higher end of the income spectrum-were getting little benefit from the safety net. Not surprisingly, the data showed that the largest number of safety net rebates were paid to those with the highest average incomes, those included in the electorates of the minister for health and the Treasurer. In terms of the safety net rebate paid out, 10 of the top 11 electorates were Liberal Party electorates and my electorate of Prospect came in 70th. I do not think you could mount the case that people in my electorate are not entitled to the same level of support as people in the electorates of the minister for health and the Treasurer. I do not think you could mount the case that people in the 69 electorates ahead of Prospect are so much less healthy than the people of Prospect that the people of Prospect do not need the support of the Medicare safety net. The government's initial cost estimate was $440 million over four years. It is now more than $1 billion. These increases to the safety net thresholds appeared in the 2005-06 budget as a savings measure worth $499 million. This government claimed to be a good economic manager, but this is the mother of all cost blow-outs. If this happened in a state Labor government, the Liberal opposition in any particular state would be wandering around that state saying: ‘These guys need to be thrown out; they are appalling economic managers. They can't even manage a project like this. It's blown out by half a billion lars.' But of course this government thinks it will get away with it. Despite its promises in the lead-up to the last election to quarantine health spending-not to mention its promises on the Medicare safety net more specifically-the coalition government has broken its covenant with the Australian people in a way which will further alienate the electorate and make the task of rebuilding people's faith in the political process that much more difficult. Of course we saw, as I said earlier, the massive advertising campaign at taxpayers' expense which was undertaken before the last election. That advertising campaign was designed to put people's minds at rest about the decline in bulk-billing. It is in that text that the coalition government presented MedicarePlus last year. Explanations about the decline of bulk-billing have tended to centre around two views: one focuses on the level of the Medicare rebate to doctors and the other focuses on the geographical distribution of general practitioners. Medical practitioners have argued, particularly through the Australian Medical Association, that GPs are increasingly charging patients more than the Medicare rebate for consultations because the schedule of fees against which that rebate is set does not provide sufficient recompense for those providing the consultations. While this is no doubt true, the government originally sought to cover the growing amount of out-of-pocket costs experienced by patients by introducing the safety net. The net effect has been an increase in specialist fees, as I said, particularly in the area of obstetrics. Alternatively, Labor's approach to address the decline in bulk-billing is to provide direct financial incentives to GPs to meet bulk-billing targets and ease the out-ofpocket costs by increasing the rebate of bulkdolbilled GP consultations to 100 per cent of the scheduled fee. I would like to deal with the matter of work force shortage, which the government points to as being one of the reasons for the decline in bulk-billing. The federal government has argued that the decline in bulkbilling rates in an area is a consequence of the undersupply of medical practitioners in that area, and it has implemented certain work force strategies like the Outer Metropolitan Registrars Program to address this issue. It is true that the government has done this; it has implemented the Outer Metropolitan Registrars Program, and other programs, to encourage general practitioners into areas which are not well served. However, this con- scheme does not deal adequately with the disincentives for general practitioners to work in these areas. There are significant difficulties in attracting general practitioners to outer metropolitan areas of Sydney, let alone the bush. In my electorate, for example, I have been running a campaign for a general practitioner to be based in the rural part of my electorate, Horsley Park. I have written to the Fairfield division of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and all the general practitioners in the electorate, advertising benefits of moving their practice to Horsley Park. I am also posting community as in the September editions of the Australian Medical Association's NSW Doctor and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' Australian Family Physician. One general practitioner has replied to my letter, saying he would like to open a surgery in Horsley Park but the $30,000 Commonwealth government grant would do little to cover the $100,000 cost of opening a new surgery. That is as it may be, but the other point I want to make is that the federal government provides incentives for existing GPs to relocate their practice from one part of this country to another, but it provides no incentives for new general practitioners-be they overseas doctors or young GPs just out of training-to establish new surgeries in areas of need. If we have got a situation where a new GP, fresh out of hospital training, is willing to go into an area to open a general practice, they should be able to receive similar incentives to general practitioners who are closing down one practice and opening another. This bill represents a massive breach of faith with the Australian people on the part of this government. It represents an act of arrogance which this government has become famous for. It represents a break of an election promise, which this government set the tone for very early in its administration. It was in 1996 that the Prime Minister said, ‘We have kept all our core promises.' He was wrong then, but he is even more wrong now. The government has abandoned this promise, which in any sense of the word was a ‘core' promise. It was ‘an ironclad commitment', ‘a rock solid guarantee'. The minister, as I said, would have massively increased his reputation with the Australian population if he had done the right thing and come into this House and resigned. the He has not done that. This government has shown its hallmark symbols of arrogance in its approach to this issue. But, more importantly and more sadly, it has shown just how out of touch it is with the needs of the average working Australian when it comes to health care in this country.",127
181,Mr TANNER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Melbourne) (7.43 pm)The legislation before the parliament tonight, the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005, deals with an outrageous breach of faith by the Howard government regarding the Australian electorate and the commitments that it made to the electorate during the course of the 2004 election. It also deals with appallingly bad health policy, regressive health expenditure and an overall policy position that is bad for Australia. It represents an enormous breach of faith with the Australian community. The Medicare safety net scandal is one of the key stories in the wake of the 2004 election: the government's breach of its promise-famously described by the then health minister as ‘an ironclad guarantee'-that all Australians who qualified would have access to 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses in the medical sector being reimbursed, with a threshold of $300 for health care card holders and recipients of family tax benefit B, and a threshold of $700 for the remainder. That was the promise-the commitmentthat was made by the government and central to its health policy strategy. It was not some marginal issue on the side; it was not some minor throwaway policy position or some cheap grab during an election campaign. This was a central commitment during 2004 that was absolutely at the heart of the government's health policy. Labor correctly opposed it. Firstly, the policy was inflationary-it was guaranteed to drive up provider costs and feed directly into producer incomes, particularly in terms of the better off and the well-paid professional producers in the health sector. Secondly, it was inequitable-it was guaranteed to deliver more money to health consumers who could most afford to carry the costs of providing for their own treatment or making a contribution to their treatment. In a sense, the experience with the Medicare safety net has reinforced all of the underlying logic that was at the heart of the original Medicare system. It has shown why the concept of Medicare and the structure of Medicare are absolutely correct and why the kinds of policies that you saw under the Fraser government and, in more recent times, under the Howard government are both inflationary, in that they tend to push up health costs by delivering excessive returns to the higher paid providers in the health system, and inequitable, in that too much public money is going into the pockets of the better off. But, most importantly of all, this represents an outrageous breach of trust by the government on a couple of fronts-not just the fact that a promise was breached and that the government went to the election promising that its policy would stay in place but also the fact that it went to the election knowing that the cost of this policy had blown out enormously and that it did not disclose that until it was effectively forced and when it was too late to have any significant influence on the electoral outcome. The Medicare safety net policy was central to the government's $20 million public advertising campaign-funded by the taxpayer-called ‘Strengthening Medicare'. This was one of a number of advertising campaigns, undertaken by the Howard government during 2004, designed to improve the electoral prospects of the Liberal and National parties. In the statistics for government advertising you can see a very clear pattern that reflects the electoral cycle. The closer you get to an election, the more money is spent on advertising government programs, and the message is very clear and very simple-that is, vote for the conservatives; vote for the coalition. It is not that blatant, but it is almost that blatant, and this campaign was central to that strategy. It became apparent to the government in approximately July last year that the cost of the ill-conceived Medicare safety net program was blowing out. It is absolutely clear that well before the election both the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Minister for Health and Ageing were well aware of what was happening with the cost of the program. It was originally costed at several hundred million dollars but it was rapidly blowing out. To their disgrace, both of those ministers said and did nothing. The cost was blowing out and it was known that it was blowing out, but they said and did nothing. It was also apparent at that time that the cost blow-out was being driven by substantial increases in fees paid to specialists in particular. Providers had their snouts in the trough, precisely as Labor predicted, pushing the cost of the whole program ever further upwards as a result of people engaging in dubious practices, such as obstetricians deliberately shifting their services out of the to hospital context in order to take advantage of the new program. The end result was a massive increase in fees being paid to obstetricians and similar outcomes in other areas. By September it had become clear-as a result of data that the government was forced to release-that the Medicare safety net program overwhelmingly favoured people in higher income and predominantly safe Liberal electorates. On the list of spending for this program, which is broken up into the 150 electorates across Australia, there is a very strong correlation between higher income electorates-particularly in Sydneyand safe Liberal electorates, and high spending on the Medicare safety net. In other words, the money is going to those who are most able to make a contribution to their own health costs and who are most able to make a contribution to the gap between what Medicare pays and what the total cost is. So not only are the better off being favoured specifically by the policy, as a result of viders being able to bid up their services to take advantage of the fact that there is a limpects itless pool of money-from the Commonwealth taxpayer-sitting there waiting to pay them, but also the people who are getting the reimbursement, who are effectively having their health costs underpinned, are better off as well. So at both ends, higher income earners do better and the ordinary lower and middle-income health consumer, in effect, loses out. Finally, in October, on the day before the election, it was revealed that the cost of the Medicare safety net had blown out to something like $1.3 billion from an original ing point of only about $300 million. So there had been a huge increase in the anticipated costs of the Medicare safety net for precisely the reasons that Labor identified. April the government announced that it was going to trash its promise-the ironclad guarantee from the health minister-and the budget contained an estimate of approximately $500 million to be cut from the forward estimates with respect to the Medicare safety net by making the thresholds $500 and $1,000 respectively rather than the previous thresholds of $300 and $700. In order to deal with a crisis of its own making as a result of its own duplicity, the government has created an ineffective, inequitable and inflationary scheme to try to fix the underlying weakness that has crept into Medicare as a result of its failing to sustain Medicare. The government hid the massive blow-out in the cost to the government which arose from this ill-conceived strategy. The government deceived the Australian people in the election twice: first, by promising that the scheme would continue unamended and, second, by failing to adequately disclose the extent of the cost blow-out. In addition, it proused $20 million worth of taxpayers' money to advertise the scheme to improve its prosof re-election on a crucial policy front where the government had been vulnerable. Instead of fixing the problem, instead of living up to its promise, the government decided to break that promise-to trash the ironclad guarantee, to renege on its commitment to the Australian people-and reduce the expenditure to follow through with what I suppose cynics would say is an inevitable change consequent upon where its previous decisions had led it. This raises a broader question. The Charter of Budget Honesty is caught up in this startprocess of the Medicare safety net and is central to the question of whether or not we in this country will be able to get some kind of genuine honesty in parties' promises and In genuine transparency and scrutiny where those promises involve large amounts of money. The Charter of Budget Honesty was introduced by the government in order to prevent the kinds of things that have just occurred and that I have just described. The whole idea behind the Charter of Budget Honesty was that it would make these kinds of things impossible. It would mean that parties, be they government or opposition, would be thoroughly scrutinised-that is, they would be exposed to the kind of scrutiny that is necessary for people in the general community to make their decisions about who to vote for. Here we see in all its tawdry glory the true nature of the Charter Budget Honesty. A policy that was introduced and dealt with supposedly under the auspices of the Charter of Budget Honesty, which is supposed to keep government and opposition honest and which is supposed to ensure that promises are genuine and will be kept, has manifestly failed. It is worth considering how the Charter of Budget Honesty actually functioned during 2004 to demonstrate how appalling the charter now is-how much it has been maligned, impugned and undermined in practice-and how outrageous this legislation before the parliament this evening is. To begin with, under the Charter of Budget Honesty the opposition has the opportunity during an election campaign to have the treasury and finance departments scrutinise its election promises and provide costing assessments of whether or not the opposition's costings are valid. However, the opposition has no opportunity to consult with that source of advice and has no opportunity to present policy proposals and get them costed by Treasury and Finance outside an election campaign. In fact, during 2004 we tried and were repudiated on at least one issue. On the other hand, the government of the day can do this at any time and its secrecy is always maintained. The government does not have to have its policies out in the public domain until such time as it chooses to do so. It can engage in an iterative process where it goes back and forth asking for costing assessments on a range of options and the like. So there is a gross imbalance between opposition and government to start with. In the example that I just alluded to, Labor sought to get a Treasury and Finance costing of a set of policy proposals to produce savings in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The government responded by saying that the savings proposals were not feasible, and of then during the election campaign it announced its own savings proposals for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which looked remarkably similar to Labor's-after having advised us that the proposals were not feasible. On several occasions during the Charter of Budget Honesty process the opposition were effectively ambushed by the use of unpublished data by the departments of finance and treasury, as we did not have an opportunity to get access to the detail behind the data or to question the assumptions that underpinned that data. In other words, on issues such as higher education and health and some of the other policy areas that are central to any election campaign the opposition were relying on the latest published data. However, when our policies were presented for costing, these policies were challenged on the basis of data that was not previously published and that the opposition had no access to and where the opposition were denied the ability to genuinely engage with and challenge the assumptions underpinning the approach concerned. In Labor's higher education policy prior to the last election, it got to the point where Labor was relying on data provided to Senate estimates by the Department of Education, Science and Training. That data was the most recent available public data relevant to the proposals being put forward. But when Labor put that policy to the department of finance to be costed, the figures were rejected. In other words, one government department repudiated the figures provided by another. A similar experience occurred with paid maternity leave, where once again Labor's proposals were subject to ambush by unpublished data that Labor had no access to at the time. I have raised this to give the context in which these issues need to be consideredthat is, what has happened with the Medicare safety net and what is in the legislation before the parliament this evening. On the one hand, Labor is forced to deal with a situation where its only capacity to get any kind of costing assessment by the departments of finance and treasury of its policy proposals occurs during an election campaign, where there is no opportunity for genuine modification-for example, if there are more up-todate figures that have not yet been made public-and where there is no ability or indeed desire for there to be a genuine dialogue with respect to the assumptions and the data on which those policies are built. On the other hand, the government is able to so manipulate its incumbency that an outrageous blow-out is occurring in one of its key policy positions, a new policy development that is costed at several hundred million dollars, and it goes to the election, under the banner of the Charter of Budget Honesty with all of the rhetoric of 1996 still ringing in our ears, ing, ‘We are committed to this policy; it is iron clad, there is an iron-clad guarantee,' knowing full well that the cost has blown out and is treble or quadruple what was originally estimated, knowing full well that if it is re-elected it will have to deal with that and knowing full well that that will mean that it will have to break its promise and restructure the program to the disadvantage of health consumers. On the one hand, the Charter of Budget Honesty imposes an enormous straitjacket on an opposition that seeks to do the right thing but cannot get fair play and cannot get an independent genuine costing on a reasonable basis of its policies. On the other hand, the government that invented the Charter of Budget Honesty, in a great fanfare of response to the alleged sins of the former Labor government, does not have to comply with anything and can get away with this outrageous nonsense whereby a huge blowout occurs in one of its key policy areas that is going to require it to renege on its promise and it does not have to disclose that blowout. Labor believes that there is a need for fundamental reform of the Charter of Budget Honesty in order to ensure that there is a genuine level playing field across the political spectrum, that parties, be they in government or opposition, have the ability to get a genuinely independent costing of major policy proposals and that that costing is done without fear or favour by people who are ultimately accountable to the parliament, rather than the government, in the same way that the Auditor-General is accountable to the parliament rather than the government. We can draw on various models around the developed world in this respect. The United Kingdom has the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the United States has the Congressional sayBudget Office and in New Zealand there is the parliamentary Finance and Expenditure Committee, which is able to draw on consultants and actually has a budget to get consultants to undertake this kind of work. The fair and accurate costing of parties' promises is fundamental to informed debate in the democratic process. Labor believe there is a need for comprehensive reform of the rorted, distorted, tricky and maligned charter of budget honesty that we now have before us. We support the idea of genuine public scrutiny of promises and election commitments by government and opposition. We want to see a genuine charter of budget honesty that is fair to all. We are committed to genuine budget transparency. We are committed to ensuring that all Australians who seek information, whether it be about political promises, government spending programs or revenue, will be able to get genuine access to it. What we have seen with this particular tawdry episode is another in a long line of gradual unravelling of the Howard government's standards. Whether it is about secrecy and the ever-increasing use or misuse of ‘commercial-in-confidence' as a device to preclude scrutiny; whether it is about the gradual rorting of the budget papers under the guise of the introduction of accrual accounting in order to minimise access to information that people can obtain; whether it is about using conclusive certificates under FOI to preclude journalists, the general public and the opposition from getting access to basic data that is relevant to a whole lot of debates such as that on the first home owners grant; whether it is simply lying to the Australian people through such outrageous acts as the ‘kids overboard' scandal; or whether it is about ministerial scandals including what we have just dealt with in the parliament today with the Minister for Health and Ageing-the minister in charge of mental health issues and the national suicide prevention strategy-making appalling comments about the former New South Wales Liberal Party leader and not being required to resign, you essentially have got to commit murder in order to get sacked in the Howard government. That is what today's conclusion will lead you to.",132
182,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,The member will withdraw that statement about committing murder to be sacked.,137
183,Mr TANNER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"It was meant metaphorically, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was not intending to accuse anybody of actually committing murder, but I will withdraw it in order to facilitate your chairing.",137
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,Thank you.,137
185,Mr TANNER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,So this is just another episode in a long line of episodes of abuse of standards by a government that came to office trumpeting its commitment to high standards in public office. (Time expired),137
186,Mr CREAN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Labor opposes the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005 because it is a dishonest bill, it is founded on a false premise and it is being perpetrated by a deceitful government. We oppose it because ‘a Medicare safety net' is a tautology. Medicare is the safety net. If Medicare were functioning properly and if it were funded properly, there would not be a need for a safety net. Day after day the Minister for Health and Ageing comes in here repeating his Goebbels chant: John Howard is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. If the Howard government is the best friend that it has got, there are a lot of friends missing in action in this debate because there is only one member of the government benches listed for this evening's debate and I do not think that person has attended. One is to conclude the debate. The seriousness of this debate is demonstrated by the extent to which Labor is participating in it. Nothing could be further from the truth than the assertion that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. In fact, Labor built Medicare and its predecessor, Medibank. Only Labor believes in Medicare. Only Labor is committed to Medicare. Try as it might, the government cannot scrap it, because it is good policy, but Medicare can be undermined and this bill is part of that undermining. It is important to remind this House that, while Labor built Medicare, it was the hard working men and women of this country that paid for it initially through a salary sacrifice-wages forgone as part of the very first accord. They continue to pay for it through the Medicare levy, but what this government wants to do is charge them a third time. Not content with requiring people to pay once or twice, it wants to slug them a third time. The reality is that health is a public good, but government is driving a user-pays approach and, as a result, forcing on people higher and higher out-of-pocket expenses. The truth is not only does Labor stand by its record on Medicare but also that, if it had not been for Labor during the last term of office of this government, this government would have let Medicare wither on the vine. It would have let Medicare die, because in essence that is what it really would like to happen. Labor's campaign around saving Medicare resulted in the second largest petition ever presented in this parliament. It forced the government's hand. They were committed, and required, to fork over $1.7 billion over four years, not because they believed in it but because it was becoming a huge issue and an election was looming. The size of the spend, of course, at that time reflected the real extent of the neglect of the system that the government had allowed to occur over the previous eight to nine years. The Medicare safety net is a step along the road to private health in Australia. Getting into hospital will not depend on how sick you are and getting treatment will not depend on how much you need the treatment; it will depend on the size of your bank balance and the size of your credit card limit. And, if your card is maxed out, tough luck. Labor believes in Medicare as a central pillar of our policies of social justice, fairness and a decent life for a people. This bill shows up the Howard government for what it is: a government of deceit, hypocrisy and unfairness. The history of this bill is another example of that deceit. The so-called safety net is a falsehood. It is also an admission of failure. The safety net was the centrepiece of the so called Strengthening Medicare campaign of this government. The safety net, in fact, weakens Medicare. The so-called Strengthening Medicare campaign followed the govthis ernment's so-called A Fairer Medicare package. That package, I remind the House, was manifestly unfair. Why? Because it improved bulk-billing only for concession card holders. It undermined the universality of Medicare. How can that be fair? Medicare is about universal access to medical services, paid for through a fair and equitable tax system. Undermine that and you undermine Medicare itself. Here we have Animal Farm again: black is white, unfair is fair and weakness is strength. That is why I refer to the Goebbels chant. It is also the case that this safety net is bad policy. Why? Because it is expensive, inequitable and inefficient. On the cost issue, the government completely misjudged the takeup of the safety net; they got it completely wrong. Within the first three months, actual safety net expenditure outgrew the estimated expenditure by 40 per cent. The Department of Health and Ageing knew of this cost blow-out by mid-July 2004; the variation was up to 60 per cent by late July and 70 per cent in August. Senate estimates hearings have revealed that on 29 August, prior to the caretaker period and before the government called the election, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Finance and Administration were both aware of the cost blow-out. So they knew, but they failed to act and they said nothing. It is also very revealing that the carefully worded answer to a question on notice to the Department of Finance and Administration by Senator Sherry does not deny this. The department said: By late August 2004remember that the election was called on 29 Augustthe Department of Finance and Administration was aware that the estimates for the Medicare Safety Net would need to be revised significantly. However, the full extent of the revision to the estimates was not apparent ... Those are careful words, and I repeat them: the full extent was not apparent. Apparently, the department decided that the partial extent was not sufficient to advise the minister. They might have been 95 per cent certain but, because they were not 100 per cent certain, they did not have the full extent. They go on to say: ... until revised estimates were finalised temberwe are now into the electionas part of preparing the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2004. By this time, the caretaker period had commenced and it would not have been appropriate to brief the Minister. It is unfortunate that the public servants did not feel able to brief the minister until the full extent of the revision to the estimates was known. By the time the full extent was known, it was 29 August-too late to brief the minister. It would not have been appropriate. To cover the cost blow-out, the government of course resorted to deceit. Shortly after the election was called, on 6 September the minister for health committed to keeping the Medicare safety net at its existing level. I know that this commitment has been referred to many times, but it is worth quoting the context for it because the minister could not have been under any doubt or misapprehension. On Four Corners, in answer to the question, ‘Will this government commit to keeping the Medicare Plus safety net, as it is now, in place after the election?' Tony Abbott replied, ‘Yes.' The interviewer, Ticky Fullerton, persisted: ‘That's a cast-iron commitment?' Tony Abbott replied: ‘Castiron commitment. Absolutely.' Ticky Fullerton persisted again: ‘Eighty per cent of outof-pocket expenses rebateable over $300, over $700?' Tony Abbott then said: ‘That is an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment.' We have been reminded many times of this rock solid commitment, but the minister made that statement not once but three times in the same interview. In life, a crucial value is that your word is your bond. In politics, if you debase that value you debase the currency of politics. The minister for health trashed that value in his statement and his subsequent fessing up. We heard a censure in Sepmotion against him today calling on him to resign, but the fact is that he should have resigned then. He had misled the Australian people. He had repeated the commitment that there would be no change. He had given an ironclad, rock solid guarantee. He could not deliver in the cabinet room. The only decent thing for him to do would have been to resign. As a consequence, he does not have a shred of credibility or a shred of decency. On the question of the efficiency of this measure, there are serious structural problems with the Medicare safety net. While these proposed increases in thresholds will help to rein in expenditures in the short term, the longer term effects are less certain. The problem fundamentally is that expenditures on the safety net are effectively openended-they are uncapped; they are unrestricted. Once the threshold is reached, 80 per cent of medical costs are reimbursed. That is what the government has to do, but there are no built-in price controls in this system. Safety net benefits are not tied to Medicare schedule fees and are entirely dependent on the fee charged by the practitioner. It is one of the reasons that costs blow out in the scheme. But this bill is bad policy for a further son: it is inequitable; it favours wealthy people who can afford to pay high specialists fees. After all, it is by paying the high fees that they are put over the threshold in the first place, and you have to have the money up front to qualify for the rebate. If you cannot afford to pay you do not get a benefit. The extent of this inequity is demonstrated by figures released by the minister in September of last year. They showed that rebates are heavily skewed in favour of high-income electorates. Let us take the minister's electorate, the electorate of Warringah, where the rebates paid were $635,000. You should look at what was paid in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin. Warringah was not the top scorer by a long shot. That dubious privilege went to the member for Bradfield, Dr Nelson, where the payment was almost $1 million. By contrast, in my electorate of Hotham-and I urge members to do their own comparisons-the payment was much less: $280,000. And Hotham is only about halfway down the list. Let us look at the electorate of a good friend of mine, Warren Snowdon-Lingiari in the Northern Territory. You would have to say by any analysis, regrettably, that there are serious health issues in the Northern Territory. I was up there last week and have been reminded of it again. How much did the electorate of Lingiari receive in these September 2004 figures? Just $22,000. So it is a policy that is not just bad, with uncapped and uncontrolled expenditures, but manifestly unfair. So this whole sorry saga of Medicare: A Fairer Medicare, Strengthening Medicare and John Howard is the best friend of Medicare provides an interesting and instructive case study in the operation of the Howard government's Charter of Budget Honesty-a matter that the member for Melbourne was reareferring to just before this speech of mine. The Howard government has not built a fairer Medicare or a stronger Medicare, Mr Howard is not Medicare's best friend and the Charter of Budget Honesty is not honest. The performance of the minister for health in the name of the Charter of Budget Honesty has further discredited that process. It is not a process of honesty; it is a process of dishonesty. It is no longer a process of openness and disclosure; it is a process of concealment. Even though the government knew that there was a cost blow-out, the Minister for Finance and Administration went on ABC radio on 2 September to say there was no cost blow-out. The Senate estimates say that he knew; he was asked the question and he did not tell the truth. Even though the government knew there was a cost blow-out, there was no costing by Treasury during the election campaign. Why? Because there was no requirement on the government to submit their proposal for revision. Labor had to submit all of its proposals to Treasury for costing, but not the government. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: what is honest about that? There are different rules for the government and the opposition. That is not honesty but dishonesty. And the Charter of Budget Honesty as a consequence has become a sham. It is used by the government as a shield to hide the cost blowouts, to hide its incompetence. It applies only in the election period and it is used to shackle and attack the opposition during the campaign. Outside of the campaign, in the three years leading up to an election, the opposition has no access to the resources of Treasury and Finance. This is a very important point, and the member for Melbourne was alluding to it, because during the last parliament and well before the election campaign we sought on numerous occasions to utilise the Charter of Budget Honesty processes. For example, we put forward savings proposals in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as well as to the disability support pension. The member for Melbourne mentioned some other aspects. Those requests were rejected by the government. During the caretaker period we were able to negotiate with the secretaries of Treasury and Finance a framework for establishing a dialogue and confidentiality with their officials to explain our costings and our assumptions. It worked; it can be done. So what is needed is the ability for the opposition, outside of the caretaker period, to work with Treasury and Finance confidentially to help develop and cost our policy options. We must improve the process by ensuring it offers the opposition a genuine opportunity to work with Treasury and Finance in developing policies, particularly costings. This would require the opposition to have confidential access to Treasury and Finance officials outside of the caretaker period to discuss costing proposals on the basis of the true state of program costings and not outdated, publicly available costings. It would also mean access to a dedicated unit which reports only to the opposition and is not required to inform the government. If Treasury resources are not available for all sorts of government priorities then we should be funded to have access to outside costers. If the purpose of this is to put our policies under scrutiny, we have to be able to do it unfettered during the term of opposition so that we are in a position to release it at a of our choosing and to know that it can be dealt with confidentially. We know from the officials that it can be done because we experienced it in the last two elections. I have been involved on both occasions and I say with the utmost confidence that I do not question the integrity of the officials in the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration. I have the greatest respect for them because they did their job. They reported back to us, as well as publicly, as they were required to do. That is what should apply in the non-caretaker period. Labor are not opposed to having our policies costed; it is just that we want it done on a fair and equitable basis. My view is that, if the conditions of the charter are not changed, there is no point in Labor seeking to comply. I say that on the basis of the experience we went through not just in terms of our own costings but in what surrounds this bill-the basis for it. It is bad policy; it is deceitful. The government knew it was deceitful. The government covered up and was never required to submit anything under the Charter of Budget Honesty. It is a sham. It should be exposed for what it is and, unless it is corrected, there should not be participation in it. (Time expired)",137
187,Mr GIBBONS,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I am delighted to follow my good friend and colleague the member for Hotham in this very important debate. The Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005 implements the previously announced cutbacks to the Medicare safety net. The bill increases the lower threshold from $300 to $500 and the higher threshold from $700 to $1,000. These threshold changes will come into effect from 1 January 2006. Indexation of these thresholds will recommence from 1 January 2007. This bill makes two amendments which put into place changes to the time thresholds for the Medicare safety net which will come into effect from 1 January 2006. These changes to the threshold will have the effect of excluding one million claiming units from being eligible for this particular safety net. The Medicare safety net policy first came into effect in March 2004. The policy pays a rebate of 80 per cent of out-of-pockets costs for out-of-hospital services for registered participants, after a threshold has been reached. The level at which the thresholds were set became the subject of a series of protracted discussions between the Minister for Health and Ageing and the minor party senators, who successfully negotiated the thresholds to be set at $300 for concession card holders and FTB recipients and $700 for all others. Labor opposed the policy on the grounds that it was inequitable and would have an inflationary effect on health prices. During 2004, the policy became the centrepiece of the government's Strengthening Medicare campaign, which involved extensive advertising across all media from March to June. This campaign, which built on the previous minister's A Fairer Medicare package, cost Australian taxpayers $20 million dollars. When the Howard-Costello government announced this backflip policy of increasing the threshold for claiming the Medicare safety net, it added to an ever increasing list of broken promises since the 2004 federal election. These changes to the threshold will have the effect of excluding one million claiming units from being eligible for this particular safety net. The average central Victorian family budget has received yet another substantial hit since the October federal election because of the government's backflip over its absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment to keep the Medicare safety net in its original form. The backflip is bad enough but, in what can only be described as criminal, the government spent a massive $20 million of tax payers' money in a media blitz in the up to the federal election telling us how its Medicare safety net policy was carefully crafted and fully costed. This latest example of this dishonest government's willingness to say and do anything to get through an election campaign completes the sorry picture of deceit and broken promises since that October election. At the same time the Howard-Costello government approved massive increases in health insurance premiums of between eight per cent and 19 per cent, after promising that their policy of the 30 per cent Medicare rebate would drive down health insurance costs. And now we have the increases in the Medicare safety net threshold, after the Prime Minister said during the election campaign, with regard to keeping the Medicare safety net in its original form, ‘Well, I commit to keeping it in place.' That was the Prime Minister at a press conference in Sydney on 8 October 2004. In an interview on 6 September 2004 the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, said ‘That is an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment.' This arrogant government has clearly shown nothing but contempt for the Australian political process and the Australian people. The policy was in place for only a short term before serious concerns emerged. Within the first three-month period, the cumulative number of families and singles which had registered for the safety net had reached half a million, while the first signs of a cost blow-out emerged as actual safety net expenditure outgrew the estimated expenditure by some 40 per cent. Although monthly expenditure data was not available to the Department of Health and Ageing until the following month, Senate estimates hearings have confirmed that the department, which was regularly briefing the minister, would have known of this blow-out by mid-July. run- This pattern continued until the commencement of the caretaker period, when the election was called on 29 August 2004. Indeed, the variation between estimated expenditure and actual expenditure reached 60 per cent in July and then 70 per cent in August 2004. Senate estimates hearings have revealed that, prior to the caretaker period, the Minisple ter for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Finance and Administration were both aware of the cost blow-out in the safety net, but failed to act to address the issue prior the election. Throughout 2004, a number of investigative journalists also highlighted the emerging problems with the Medicare safety net. In particular, they highlighted the inflaate tionary effect that the safety net was having on specialist fees and, in particular, how the safety net was providing obstetricians with an incentive to restructure their fees to shift in-hospital costs to out-of-hospital costs and therefore become eligible for the safety net rebate. This led to Medicare rebates for obstetric services increasing by 62 per cent from the first quarter in 2004 to the same period in 2005, and obstetric fees increasing by 151.8 per cent in the period from March 2004 to March 2005. Throughout this period Minister Abbott, along with other senior ministers, denied the existence of a blow-out in the cost of the safety net and, throughout the election period, this denial continued. During the election campaign, two incidents confirmed that the Medicare safety net was flawed policy. The first occurred on 16 September 2004 when the minister conducted a doorstop interview to release the safety net data by torate. This data revealed that rebates paid under the safety net were heavily skewed in favour of high-income electorates and, in particular, those held by Howard government frontbenchers. It also confirmed that those with lower incomes and less ability to undertake discretionary spending in health were getting little benefit from the safety net. This has major ramifications for central Victoria and, in particular, my electorate of Bendigo. Bendigo is the second poorest federal electorate in Victoria and the 11th poorest in Australia. There are some 15,500 peoliving below the poverty line. This represents 13.3 per cent of the population and is three times greater than the Treasurer's electorate of Higgins, for example. Statistics to from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that Bendigo has a median weekly family income of just $736 per week. This contrasts decisively with the Prime Minister's electorof Bennelong at $1,300, the Treasurer's electorate of Higgins at $1,570 and the health minister's electorate of Warringah at $1,572. The average family income in the electorate of the health minister is more than double the average family income in the Bendigo electorate. The health minister represents one of the wealthiest electorates in Australia. It is not surprising that the federal government's Medicare safety net changes clearly favour families from the wealthy metropolitan suburbs at the expense of rural and regional Australia. In case anyone has any doubts that the government's new Medicare safety net policy favours the wealthy suburbs in the metropolitan areas, just look at the following statistics. In my electorate of Bendigo, the figure for Medicare safety net payments since the policy's introduction until September 2004 was a miserable $119,212, yet in the following senior government ministers' elecelectorates the contrast is staggering. In Bradfield, the electorate of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the safety net rebate payments were $911,828. In Warringah, the health minister's electorate, the payments were $634,791. In Higgins, the Treasurer's electorate, they were $523,556. In Bennelong, the Prime Minister's electorate, they were $419,895. However, in Bendigo in central Victoria the actual money paid for the Medicare safety net was a miserable $119,212. The health minister's electorate of Warringah, one of the wealthiest electorates in Australia, has received five times the amount for Medicare safety net payments than my electorate of Bendigo. Is it any wonder the minister keeps chanting that the Howard government is the best friend Medicare has ever had? He should tell the truth and say that, under the Howard government, Medicare is the best friend that wealthy Australians have ever had. If anyone had any doubts that the Howard government is not the slightest bit interested in those who desperately need assistance, such as less wealthy Australians, this policy exposes the totally biased philosophy that this government has shown in the past nine years. Economically disadvantaged communities like Maryborough in central Victoria will be hammered by the bias in the government's Medicare safety net changes. The Penney and Lang abattoirs at Carisbrook near Maryborough have closed, resulting in the loss of 100 jobs-jobs that the Maryborough community can ill afford to lose. This will place considerable additional pressure on the retrenched workers, their families and this already depressed region's economy. Maryborough already has one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia. Adding to the difficulties that this region experiences is the fact that residents have to travel to Bendigo or Ballarat to conduct Medicare transactions because there is nowhere in Maryborough that can provide an appropriate service. This imposes a major inconvenience and expense to most people throughout the region. Recently I wrote to the Health Insurance Commission and the federal Minister for Health and Ageing requesting the establishment of a Medicare transaction centre for Maryborough. The lack of a Medicare transaction centre was an issue during the election campaign, but the Liberal government has so far refused to consider the proposal. Maryborough's population would not sustain a stand-alone Medicare office, but a Medicare transaction centre, located at an existing Commonwealth centre such as Centrelink or the Post Office, should be considered. It may be feasible to locate a Medicare presence at a private health services provider such as a chemist, for example. It is just unacceptable that a city of the size of Maryborough does not have a Medicare presence, something other communities take for granted. Last week I received a letter from the Health Insurance Commission stating that there are no plans to establish an effective Medicare transaction centre in Maryborough. This is unacceptable, and I will continue to lobby the federal government until there is a Medicare transaction centre established in Maryborough. There is little understanding and no worthwhile policies designed to reduce poverty from the Howard government, who usually try to deny there is a problem and therefore a need for action. In fact, the Howard government's Medicare safety net policies add to the ever-increasing poverty levels outside the leafy metropolitan suburbs of our capital cities. A future Labor government would be accountable for the level of poverty in all our communities. We are prepared to measure our efforts to tackle this problem. Labor committed to develop a comprehensive set of poverty reduction targets across all areas of government, but particularly health. The targets concern living standards, income poverty and income inequality; unemployment, long-term unemployment and employment security; skill and educational participation, attainment and competence; health status and, in particular, access to health services; access to affordable housing; and available and affordable child care, aged care and disability services. A future Labor government will ensure that Australians gain an equal share of health benefits, including a fairer distribution of Medicare payments and, again, will make a significant investment in services that assist in tackling poverty in the health area. For example, prior to the last federal election Labor announced $1.9 billion in funding for health to boost Medicare and increase bulkbilling rates and some $300 million for a Commonwealth dental scheme to provide up to 1.3 million additional dental procedures for people on low incomes. Affordable and accessible health care is essential ing poverty. For this reason Labor is determined to lift the bulk-billing rate to 80 per cent so that every Australian can afford to see a doctor when they are sick. Poor dental health can cause other medical complications and strips the unemployed of work opportunities and dignity. Labor's national dental scheme would have ensured that people on low incomes did not miss out on basic dental health care. The release of the up-to-date costing of the policy under the Charter of Budget Honesty process was requested by Labor as a result of nominating the policy as a saving to redirect to Labor's own health priorities. This document revealed that the cost of the policy for the four-year forward estimates, from 2004-05 to 2007-08, had almost doubled from $650 million to $1.2 billion. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and other coalition members-and, indeed, the many media apologists for the Howard governmentare constantly bleating about these fiscal geniuses' superb management of this nation's economy, yet the so-called Medicare safety net policy, calculated from the years 2004-05 to 2007-08, had almost doubled from $650 million to a massive $1.2 billion. Now we have this bill, which attempts to repair the damage caused by this government's incompetence or dishonesty-or, as I believe, both incompetence and dishonesty. The government has been under pressure to address the policy's sustainability and prior to the budget this year there was further speculation that the safety net would be cut. In April 2004 the Prime Minister announced that the safety net would be cut. During that time, Minister Abbott was away on leave and was not able to respond to the criticisms that he had campaigned on a lie, particularly after giving a ‘rock solid ironclad guarantee' during the election campaign that the safety net in addresswould not be changed. This measure subsequently appeared in the 2005-06 budget as a savings measure worth $499 million. Concerns about the sustainability of the safety net remain, while Medicare rebate data continues to grow and the minister's office and his department maintain that the cost of the safety net is in line with the Charter of Budget Honesty costing. Labor opposed the policy at the last election and redirected funding to Labor's health priorities, which included incentives to increase bulk-billing to 80 per cent and funding for specialist out-clinics in public hospitals.  deed an honour to follow the honourable member for Bendigo and his contribution to the debate on the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005. He reminds me that in question time when the Minister for Health and Ageing is at the dispatch box talking about Medicare the constant refrain is that John Howard is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. If that is true, it is surprising that there is such a deafening silence from those on the government side and such a lack of coalition members who want to contribute to the debate on this bill. We have had Labor speaker after Labor speaker, but the government's backbench, who are invoked to say that John Howard is the best friend that Medicare has ever had, are deaf, dumb and mute. They do not contribute, which is a very interesting paradox. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Bendigo raised a couple of issues in his contribution that I also want to pick up on. I thought it was a very good contribution. The member for Bendigo said he wanted to establish a Medicare office at Maryborough. I support that I think that is an excellent idea-but I do not come to this House without ambitions of my own in relation to Medicare offices. At Mount Druitt we used to have one of the busiest Medicare offices until John Howard closed it. We were told: ‘Look, it's okay. The people who frequent the Medicare office won't be inconvenienced if they go to Blacktown or if they go to Penrith.' That is not the view that constituents in my electorate have. That is not the view that the people of Mount Druitt have. In fact, it is not even the view of the people of St Clair who used to frequent that same office. I have put a question on the Notice Paper about the Medicare office. I suppose what really added insult to injury was receiving a letter on 1 June. It was signed by Mr Tony Abbott, who is the member for Warringah and the Minister for Health and Ageing, and it was signed by Mr Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney and the Minister for Human Services. This is the question I put on notice to the Minister for Health and Ageing: In respect of his letter received in my office June 2005 concerning organ donationand it was a very good letter and one that I am happy to supportand the ability to register consent in the local Medicare office in my electorate, can he say which Medicare office in my electorate he had in mind. I think that is a perfectly reasonable question to put to the minister on the Notice Paper. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I know you have been here a long time and you have observed in a very impartial way the proceedings of this parliament, but I have not had a reply. I suspect the reason I have not had a reply is that there is absolutely no Medicare office in my electorate. The best friend that Medicare has ever had has not had a Medicare office in my electorate. I have had two Commonwealth ministersministers of the Crown-writing to me, telling my constituents that they should go to their local Medicare office in my electorate. It is non-existent. The Howard government closed it down. I think that says a lot about what this bill is all about. The bill is all about another broken promise. This bill exposes the Howard government as one of the most deceitful and mischievous in Australian history. The Medicare safety net sham is yet another in a long line of broken promises from this government, and the Australian people, in my humble opinion-and, I trust, in yours, Mr Deputy Speaker-deserve better. This bill should serve as a reminder to the Australian people of the untrustworthiness of this government and a demonstration of the depths to which it is prepared to sink in order to remain in power. It will do anything and it will say anything to stay in power. There was ample evidence of a mammoth budget blow-out at least four months prior to on 1 the last election, yet the minister for health, the member for North Sydney, the Prime Minister and their coalition colleagues, including the minister at the table, Minister Dutton, promised to keep the existing thresholds in place. Mr Howard has never attempted to disguise his desire to destroy Medicare as we know it and replace it with an American style user-pays system. This bill is yet another attempt to pull it right apart, as the PM promised to do while Leader of the Opposition in the 1980s. Only the lack of a majority in the Senate stopped him doing so in the last parliament. There is every reason to believe that this is but the first instalment in this parliament. This government will deceive the Australian public if it suits its political needs. In lead-up to the 2004 election the government deceived the Australian public in order to get itself elected. It made a promise to Australian families that it was well aware it could not keep-it was not made in ignorance; it knew. It promised that, if the coalition was re-elected, the Medicare safety net would be maintained at pre-election levels-that is, $300 for low-income earners and $700 for high-income earners. I know the Minister for Health and Ageing has been subjected to questioning by the opposition, and indeed a censure motion today, about other matters. But I am sure every member of this House will recall that the Minister for Health and Ageing gave a rock solid, ironclad commitment to maintain those thresholds-$300 for low-income earners and $700 for high-income earners. What does a rock solid, ironclad commitment mean? I think you would be safe to assume that, if it were anyone else uttering these words, it was not going to be broken. On 16 September last year the minister gave a doorstop in Canberra proclaiming: ‘I absolutely guarantee that the safety net that the government has put into operation will continue. I absolutely guarantee that.' Wouldn't you feel fairly confident that these safety nets would continue? And he was not alone. The Treasurer and prime ministerial aspirant, Mr Costello, absent from parliament for most of this week, said on 2 September last year that ‘the parameters of the safety net will not change'. I think ordinary people in my electorate would have said that the $300 limit for low-income earners and the $700 limit for high-income earners would stay. With a ‘rock solid guarantee' and a promise that ‘the parameters of the safety net will not change', wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that this is what the government would be abiding by? Yet, surthe prise surprise, once the election was out of the way and the government had been returned, the government's promise was broken-it abandoned its position and more than a million of our fellow Australians will now miss out on the Medicare safety net. Rather than retain the thresholds at $300 for low-income earners and $700 for highincome earners, this bill will increase it for low-income earners by $400; it is now $700. High-income earners do not get such a big increase-their threshold goes from $700 to $1,000. Again, it is an example of lowincome earners being punished a little more severely than others. The package was flawed from the startLabor saw it, health experts saw it; why didn't the government see it? As soon as the government's Strengthening Medicare package was released both Labor and health experts saw it for what it was: a seriously flawed piece of policy that would have an inflationary effect on health pricing. The first signs of a blow-out were evident in the first half of last year. Only a few months after the government's policy came into effect, the number of people who had registered for the safety net had well and truly outstripped expectations. I would like to continue on from where the member for Bendigo left off, and that is to say that the people who are benefiting from the safety net are not the people of Chifley. Yes, people do benefit. I am not quibbling about those people who are able to take advantage of the safety net. But what are the figures for Chifley? In Chifley the average weekly income is just $1 under $900. The average income for Warringah, the electorate of the Minister for Health and Ageing, is $1,572. Wouldn't you think an electorate that has an average income of $900-people on modest and middle incomes-would be able to benefit more from a safety net than those people on high incomes? What is the situation in the electorate of the member for Warringah? The safety net rebate paid as of September 2004 in Warringah was $634,791. I will repeat that figure because you were probably disbelieving, Mr Deputy Speaker: $634,791. In Chifley, how did we benefit from the Medicare safety net? How did we benefit from the fact that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had? As of September 2004, the net rebate paid in Chifley was $170,018. I will repeat those two figures: in the minister's electorate, which includes the North Shore-a pretty well-off and reasonably wealthy area-the net rebate paid was $634,791; in the electorate of Chifley, it was $170,018. Surely, when it comes to health, we should not be a society that says you will get adequate health care you are rich enough, but if you are poor, tling or working class-that is, you go to work for a living-you will get a secondclass health system. That is exactly what these figures demonstrate. The Howard government is most concerned about people in New South Wales who are on higher incomes, such as those who live on the North Shore. But people who live in Western Sydney or in Newcastle and the Hunter region-I see the honourable member for Shortland is in the Housewould be no different from those living in Chifley. They are hard working people, proud of the work they do and often working a couple of jobs, but not getting as much out of the safety net as the Minister for Health and Ageing. It is an utter disgrace, a distortion of priorities, but this is what the Howard government is all about. The higher your income, the more likely it is that you will have a high expenditure on health. It stands to reason then that Australians who live in working-class, outer metropolitan areas such as Chifley and regional areas in the electorates of Hunter, Shortland and Throsby, in Wollongong and in rural and regional areas, are more likely to miss out as a result of this bill. It does not look after them; it looks after the people in the eastern suburbs and those on the North Shore. The new safety net is skewed to benefit those in blue-ribbon Liberal seats. It is for the benefit not of middle Australia, working Australia, but the blue-ribbon set. Can Minister Dutton, who is seated at the table, or the Minister for Health and Ageing outline to the House how many people will miss out as a result of the increased threshold in the safety net? How many people in each electorate? I know the minister comes from Queensland. How many people in Queensland will miss out because of the increases in this bill? Can if the minister provide the House with a breakbatdown of the number of Australians who will miss out under each threshold? How many of those will be concessional card holders? How many of those will have chronic illnesses? What a tragedy to have a chronic illness that requires you to frequently seek medical attention. No-one would wish that on their worse enemy. If you suffer from a chronic illness, you suffer a lot-not only in terms of doctors' and specialists' bills but also in terms of chemists' bills. How will the chronically ill fare under this legislation? In conclusion, the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005 is another broken promise. It was supposed to be an ironclad promise by the Minister for Health and Ageing, a rolled-gold promise-a promise supported by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. But what happened to it after the election? It has gone away. For those on low incomes, the safety net has been increased from $300 by $400 to $700. For those on high incomes, it has gone from $700-not by $400 but by $300-to $1,000. One thing we know is that one million Australians will miss out because of this change. More than one million Australians will feel betrayed by this dishonesty. They will feel betrayed by the deceit of the government. How many people will suffer as a result of this? How many people might not seek medical attention because of the changes to the safety net? It is becoming an increasing problem. We used to talk about overservicing-and overservicing may still be a problem-but a growing problem is that Australians are increasingly not seeking medical attention. This legislation will not provide any incentive for them or their children. I will conclude on this point: why should any Australian trust the Howard government after such a blatant deception? Mr Tuckey interjecting O'Connor is in the House. I say to the member for O'Connor: if the Howard government are the best friend Medicare has ever had, why aren't coalition members getting to their feet and supporting this bill? They know, like I do, that this bill represents a betrayal of Australian people. This bill represents the most grievous deceit at the last election by the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Treasurer. The people of Australia were told: ‘These safety nets will hold. We will not change them. They are guaranteed.' What happened? As soon as the government were elected, they changed them; they lifted them. Member for O'Connor, you have broken your word. Why aren't you speaking in the debate to support this deception by the government? Ms Hall-You can't defend the indefensible.  fensible, as the member for Shortland has said so rightly. I oppose deceit, and I oppose this bill. I oppose the lack of transparency and honesty that it represents; therefore I oppose it. I am very confident that every member of the opposition will oppose the legislation. When we go to the Australian people with an election commitment, let us be decent and honest and not mislead them.",141
188,Ms HALL,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005 is yet another example of the Howard government rewarding the Australian people for the trust they placed in them. Prior to the 2004 election, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, gave a rock solid, ironclad guarantee to the Australian people that the Medicare safety net would not be increased after the election. Debate interrupted. NA Mr Hawker-Order! It being 9 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Telemarketing",149
189,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT,"That was a very short speech by the member for the Shortland. I would like to talk tonight about something that is driving all of our constituents nuts, something that is bugging them to death. Dr Southcott-Their local member?",149
190,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT,"No, it is not their local member. It is something that all our constituents are calling to complain about. What am I talking about? Unwanted phone calls from the $14.7 billion a year telemarketing industry, which have become the biggest source of complaints to the New South Wales Office of Fair Trading and, I dare say, to every other office of fair trading across the states. So time that the government acted to create a national do not call list to protect people's precious time at home from being disturbed by unwanted and invasive calls. A recent kit I have promoted in my electorate to assist people to opt out of unwanted calls has resulted in an avalanche of requests. In excess of 500 people called for the kit in the first week and, whilst I only advertised locally, I have had calls from across Australia. One woman was so excited about getting her peace back at home she nearly ran off the road, trying to get the details of how to get hold of the kit when she heard me mention it on the radio. Whilst the kit is a start, it is a limited tion. The bizarre thing at the moment is that it is the industry driving the push to establish a do not call register. The Australian Direct Marketing Association has created a do not call register amongst its 500 members. The number of people wanting to be on this list is growing exponentially, with about 400,000 people currently registered and 10,000 being added each month. I can certainly attest that my office and my kit are adding considerably to their workload. The trouble is that the list will not stop all the calls, only those from ADMA members, and ADMA believes that it is not their members who are guilty of abusing telemarketing. The community is outraged by the intrusive nature of telemarketing. The calls always come at that time when you really could do without them. Without fail it is when you are cooking tea, when you are putting the kids in the bath or in that rare precious moment when you finally have peace and you can stop and enjoy the quiet of your life that, yes, you get that phone call: ‘Good evening, Mrs Burke, would you like to buy?' I always get slightly suspicious when someone calls me Mrs Burke, and I know that it is it is obviously one of these people. I, probably like many in this place, have a silent number, and still they get through and annoy you. They are driving us nuts. I certainly know that my constituents, and the constituents from all of your electorates who are ringing, are saying, ‘Enough is enough. Why doesn't the government act now?' A lot of people feel that they cannot be rude, like I am when I politely tell people that I am just not interested. A lot of elderly people feel incredibly frightened and feel that their privacy has been invaded. One caller requesting the kit said that they had had 13 calls in one afternoon-evening period. They were driven ballistic by these invasive opcalls. Many of the calls are now coming from overseas, predominately from India, Ireland and Singapore, and this obviously means that we must have regulation federally. Companies can now also place you on call waiting so that you are queued-you actually answer a queued call and you wait for someone to telemarket you something. I find this incredibly amazing. No longer is your home your castle; it is a telemarketing paradise. Individuals need to be able to say: ‘No, I deserve my privacy and my peace at home. I don't want you to call.' In the United States 87 million households, or about 70 per cent of all homes, are now on a do not call register set up by the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. If the States can regulate the telemarketers, why can we not do so here? The government should act now to restore peace to households. Let people say, ‘I don't want to be bugged at home.' The Labor Party has a policy to adopt a do not call register, which could be administered by the ACCC. Labor would reform existing rules to ensure that telemarketers do not call people on public holidays or on Sundays. The federal Privacy Commissioner has called on the government to develop a do not call list. The community is demanding a do not call list, and for once the government should listen and adopt a policy which will significantly improve family time and would be a real barbecue stopper. The government has regulated against spam, so why not against telemarketers? Why not protect people's complete privacy? I call on the government to adopt Labor's policy of a do not call register to turn people's homes back into castles, not shopping centres. Hurricane Katrina",149
191,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I would be one of the few, if not the only person, in this House to have ever suffered a cyclone, as we know them, or a hurricane, as the Americans know them, of the intensity that hit the area of New Orleans, Mississippi and Louisiana, known as Katrina. I am probably one of the few who has had to participate as a public official in the role of evacuating a town during a high-level flood, one that was 30 miles wide and surrounded the town of Carnarvon. I have strong recollections of how those particular circumstances evolved. In the case of the flood we evacuated nearly all of our people in that town. There was only one difference to my mind between the experience of this small town and that which we have read of in the newspapers in recent days-that is, the size of the population. There were probably about 5,000 people in Carnarvon, and there are many millions in the United States. The issue I want to refer to tonight relates to the commentary that one might have from observing the events and how similar they were, notwithstanding that my examples were in the early 1960s and we are here in 2005. Cyclones and floods, even in the sixties, were reasonably predictable. It was certainly not as good as it is today but people knew when this flood was coming, and we people who had the responsibility for the town knew that we must get our citizens out of the town, just as it appears the administrators did in New Orleans. So what was a mob of Australians doing there? Were they local residents? Were they tourists? Were they tourists with travel insurance? Why did they have international roaming on their mobiles? Why was the woman who was quoted by the Leader of the Opposition today so insistent not that the Prime Minister get her out of her problems but that the Australian taxpayer get her out of her problems when, in fact, from all the warnings we heard here in Australia it was unwise to stay? I think it is a question we should ask before we blame everybody but ourselves-as we certainly would not have done in my time in Carnarvon. I ran around my hotel, watching the entire roof tear off, trying to get people out of their bedrooms. Every time. I opened a door, the ceiling blew in. We were taking people off the street. I know what it is like. I know that, if I got a warning and I was in New Orleans, as an Australian national I would get out of the place. Furthermore, it is the federal system of government at work. Who got the blame? In America, it was President Bush. Yet, of course, the mayor-a very well-dressed one, I might add-of New Orleans hires and controls the police force. How many did he leave in this big arena, where people were put to save their lives from the wind? I do not know. I cannot find out where he was. I can tell you what happened in Carnarvon. The mayor was there, filling sandbags with us. And I have never even heard of the state governor. This is the process, isn't it? In America the city is responsible for the police force and the state-as in Australia-is responsible for the services of roads and levy banks. And, of course, if you are the President, you are responsible for the defence forces. But a media who hates President Bush-and hates John Howard-wants to try and lay all of the blame on him. I find it rageous and illogical. It is about time people woke up and looked back to the sixties. I think the only federal contact we had in Carnarvon was when Malcolm Fraser came for a visit. We certainly did not expect the Commonwealth to step in and deal with our local problems. (Time expired) Make Poverty History",151
192,Mr GARRETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to reaffirm in this House the importance of, and to encourage members on both sides to embrace, the Make Poverty History campaign, which many Australians would be aware of through the Live 8 concerts of July, held in London, Berlin, Rome, Tokyo and Johannesburg, and also through activities currently taking place in churches and workplaces around Australia. In fact, campaigners were present in the forecourt of the parliament this very evening. That campaign, the focus of which is now the United Nations Millennium Plus 5 Summit taking place next week in New York, will see one of the most important international gatherings of the decade, drawing together world leaders and non-government organisations working on aid and development. Expectations are high. Some 150,000 Australians have been involved in the campaign, notable for its white wristband symbol and a concerted postcard campaign urging the Prime Minister to attend-he and the shadow minister for foreign affairs will, I understand, be present. The Make Poverty History campaign has at its core a demand for the wealthy nations of the world, of which Australia is one, to commit sufficient overseas aid to address the unacceptably high level of poverty holding back the developmentmaterial, social and political-of countries in Africa, the Asian region and beyond. This campaign builds on the moderate out- achievements of the forgiveness of debt campaign which occurred under the debt relief banner during the 1990s. By 2000 there was sufficient international momentum to see Australia sign onto the UN Millennium Declaration. Yet, since then, we have had no specific, targeted program to address the Millennium Development Goals. These goals included the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability, amongst others. In fact, aid levels have not sufficiently increased and priority areas like water sanitation still remain underfunded. While recent moderate increases in aid are acknowledged up to this point, if the Millennium Development Goals are to be reached it will require a genuine, increased and continuing commitment by Australia, with a specific plan in place, to reach the goals. Regrettably, at the present, this is not the case. The United Nations Secretary-General has requested all donor nations to increase aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2009 and up to 0.7 per cent by 2015. At present, our figure languishes at 0.28 per cent in the 2005-06 projection. Australian aid as a proportion of gross national income had dropped significantly until quite recently. Even now it sits at only 1996 levels. This is clearly inadequate and falls well short of the global goal set by the Secretary-General which will be necessary to make a real impact on poverty. This is not to say that the people endorse the government's policy as reflected in these poor figures. It turns out that private citizens' donations to aid and development nongovernment organisations have increased by nearly 10 per cent per annum since 2000-a terrific commitment by the Australian public. Nor, as it is sometimes claimed, is Australia's overseas aid equivalent to the OECD average. What is clear is that Australians consistently show they are willing to help those less well off who live in adverse circumstances, but they would be disappointed if they knew where we rated in overseas aid. We rate at 16 out of 22-the bottom of the scale of OECD countries. Yes, the government has begun to address the issue of targeted assistance, governance and particularly the recurrent problems of some Pacific island states, but the bottom line is that the government still tends to exaggerate the level of its support. Critically, we are not delivering aid to the levels that (a) we can afford, (b) are comparable to other nations of our economic strength or (c) are desperately needed-especially in our neighbourhood of the Asian region. Make Poverty History is a campaign that goes to the very core of what it means to be a global citizen in the 21st century, and in the next week the Prime Minister will have the opportunity to show that Australia is more than willing to play a constructive role. There are tangible, reasonable and profound improvements for the well-being-in many cases, the survival-of most of our close neighbours if we choose to increase our commitment to aid. The need is great and the call is loud. The call is to the Prime Minister: it is time to listen up and make poverty history. Gold Coast Electorate: Kokoda Challenge",152
193,Mrs MAY,ADJOURNMENT,"I have spoken before in this chamber about the Gold Coast Kokoda Challenge: a fourperson, intense, cross-country bushwalking team event over 96 kilometres. It is an event that had to be completed in 39 hours to honour the 39th Militia Battalion, the first of our Australian troops to arrive at Kokoda, on 15 July 1942. The inaugural event took place over the weekend of 16 and 17 July and what a success the event was. In fact, the event will now become an annual event that pits teams against the elements, an event that will challenge the mental and physical capacity of all entrants. The event consisted of 72 teams and they commenced the walk at the Mudgeeraba showground at 7 am on 16 July. The sun broke through a cloud-covered cold morning and, with the formalities over and the last post played, the teams set off. And what a sight! I walked the first five kilometres with the teams, and what a diverse range of teams there was. They included an Army parachute training school team from HMAS Albatross in Nowra; two teams from the Canungra Army Barracks; three teams from the health services battalion at Enoggera, which included medics, doctors and nurses; local teams, including the Rambo Ambos, comprising four paramedics from Southport; two teams from the Sunland property group; and three teams from Adapt Fitness at Burpengary. Currumbin and Nerang RSL clubs also fielded teams. Everyone who walked had to dig deep to complete the difficult course. Some did not finish but still had a go. It took mental and physical toughness, in the harsh terrain and the Gold Coast cold winter night, to get through-and of course there was no sleep and very little rest. The support teams and the army of volunteers played a crucial role in ensuring the participants were looked after and encouraged throughout the night. There is no doubt that the spirit of lia, which was born at Gallipoli and held fast at Kokoda-the spirit of endurance, sacrifice, courage and mateship-was displayed that weekend. There were tears and there were blisters. There were sore feet and chafed privates, bruised shins and bloodied knees. There were pulled muscles and muscles that just ached from the constant walk. But above all, there was a sense of pride and achievement. The finish line saw some very tired and very sore men and women, but they had met the challenge and completed a very difficult course. In many cases, individuals surprised themselves with their courage and endurance, and we applauded them all and saluted their courage. The first team home, in 19 hours and five minutes, was the ASICS team: George Takis, Glen Thompson, David Russell and Anthony Heartly-a great result for a very fit team. The first mixed team home, in 23 hours and 34 minutes, was the Kagi team: Phillip Hay, Sharyn Taylor, Adam Smith and Matthew Prowd. The first women's team home, in 24 hours and 45 minutes, was the HSB 1 team, with team members Sarah Althanus, Dorelle Hegarty, Astrid Theirry and Sue Newberry. A special award, the Spirit of Kokoda Award, went to the Ashmore Assassins: Neil Tahi, John Sherrin, Craig Farr and Peter Russell. Their mateship and endurance really shone through. At the final checkpoint, one of the team had eight toenails that were lifting or had been removed, but the team decided to push on. They supported and carried the team-mate to finish the walk together. It was a courageous effort and an incredible display of mateship by the whole team. There were also two mateship awards. One went to the Battery Sharks: Damyn Burridge, Chris Slocombe, Alexander Howe and Matt Cameron. They took on an additional team member-a young schoolboy from MiAustraami High, Matthew Clarke-who had lost the other members of his team. The Sharks adopted Matthew and finished the course as a team. The other award went to the CSI team: Dale Smekel, James Arnold, James Treaner and John Anthony Holdgen. One member of their team literally walked backwards down the very steep Hellfire Pass as his knees were close to popping, but he never gave up and the team finished together, with another adopted member from the Eastern Quolls-a great display of determination. There are many people to pay tribute to for the success of the event: Doug Henderson and Jo Wright from my own office, the SES personnel who manned the checkpoints and helped carry out the wounded, the ambulance officers, the members of the Gold Coast Bushwalking Club, the Army personnel, the support crews, the families and friends who stayed by the phones and manned the checkpoints, and Nerang RSL who gave so much to ensure the success of the event. His Excellency the Governor General and Mrs Jeffery were special guests at the Kokoda Challenge ball the following week. The night was a fitting tribute to all those who participated, and we were honoured to have the Governor General present the inaugural awards. The Kokoda Youth Leadership Program was launched that evening and 13 Aussie kids have just completed walking the Kokoda Track as part of the leadership program. The dream has become a reality. Teams have already registered for next year. The spirit of Kokoda will not be forgotten on the Gold Coast. Social Welfare",153
194,Ms HALL,ADJOURNMENT,"In question time today, the Minister for Human Services spoke about the new marketing campaign that he and the Minister for Workforce Participation had launched. This campaign is designed to catch people who seek to defraud Centrelink-something that I and all Australians oppose. Welfare fraud is equally as obnoxious as corporate fraud, and it is beholden on Centrelink and the government to ensure that only those people entitled to welfare support receive that support. But I am worried that this government is going too far in ensuring that there is no welfare fraud. I recently learnt about the fraud investigation unit, and I must say that its powers are quite frightening and open to abuse. I have been advised that this unit has the ability to inquire into the most intimate details of people's private lives, to hire private investigaThese tors and to use cameras and recording devices. That is hardly the Australian way and it is very intrusive. I would like to demonstrate the powers of the review unit by sharing with the House the experience of a constituent. This constituent and her partner became a couple and advised their local Centrelink office that were a couple. They were together for two years and they purchased a house. Unfortunately, they started to have problems, so they separated. He moved to Sydney and she remained in the house. Centrelink did not believe that they were not living together, despite the fact that he was living in Sydney and paying rent in Sydney-something that Centrelink has to date not checked-whilst at the same time they were trying to get their relationship back together because they feel it is worth saving. The degree to which this investigation has gone is quite horrendous. The employer of the male partner has received a letter from Centrelink telling the employer they wish to update his Centrelink file. I might add that this person has never in his entire life received any money from Centrelink, yet his employer received a letter saying that they wanted to update his Centrelink file. He was absolutely horrified by that. He had to explain to his employer that it had absolutely nothing to do with him and that he felt it was to do with his ex-partner. The school that her children attended received a request from Centrelink asking the school to name the people on the enrolment form that were contacts for her children. Her ex-partner's name was not on there, but the simple fact that Centrelink had the ability to go to such lengths I think is really frightening. They contacted the post office, they contacted his employer and they checked every car that her ex-partner had ever owned. two people have had a freedom of information request, so they know all the information that Centrelink has been able to obtain. Nothing in that information points to the fact that these two people have been involved in defrauding Centrelink. They said to me that they have never tried to hide anything. They have spoken to Centrelink and they have been told that they will receive no feedback on the progress of the inquiry. They have been told that they will not know when the investigation ends and will not know where the investigation is at. They feel very much that they are guilty until proven innocent. I do not like this situation and I do not think any member of this House should accept it. Fraud is appalling and we should not sanction it in any shape or form, but I do not think that we should make the lives of Australian people that rely on this governmentor any government-for welfare a misery. That is what this legislation is doing: pursuing people and saying that they are guilty until they are proved innocent. (Time expired) Boothby Electorate: School Capital Works",154
195,Dr SOUTHCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to formally announce funding from the Australian government for a school in my electorate. Bellevue Heights Primary School has been successful in gaining $800,000 to upgrade its facilities. This includes the provision of a new administration building, student toilets and a canteen. This is an important project for the school community and the decision to fund it is something which I am proud to have fought for. Last year I met with the school and the principal, Mr Michael Papps, to discuss plans for an upgrade to the school. Bellevue Heights Primary was built in 1977, yet last year there were still no permanent buildings. More recently the school has increased its numbers from 100 to 300, including a very strong new arrivals program. In fact, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs launched a school kit for refugees there in June. Growing numbers were putting pressure on the school facilities. The school's library, admin block and assembly hall were all demountables. The response of the state government to increasing numbers was just to put up another D-MAC. The school community had a plan to build a new permanent administration building to free up some of these D-MACs. I wrote to the Minister for Education, Science and Training and also personally lobbied him to support this upgrade. The minister, I am happy to report, saw the merit of the application and wrote to the state Minister for Education and Children's Services saying that the Australian government would be pleased to approve Commonwealth funding if the state government would recommend it to him. I am pleased to report that I have received a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Pat Farmer, stating that the Australian government is funding the entire $800,000 project. So I was surprised to find that the Rann Labor state government had announced this project in May. I have uncovered a newsletter from the state Department of Education and Children's Services, complete with a message from the minister, which makes claims about how much they are spending on upgrading schools. This publication includes, for example, a claim that $100,000 has been provided to the Bellevue Heights Primary School-a total project of $800,000-to provide a new administration building, student toilets and canteen. This sounds remarkably similar to the same project which has been funded by the Commonwealth. On the one hand we have here a document claiming that the state government has allocated $100,000 in the forthcoming financial year towards the $800,000 project-no mention of any Commonwealth government funding-and on the other hand I have a document with an $800,000 project, $800,000 of Australian government money. In fact, this project at Bellevue Heights Primary School is funded entirely by the Australian government. There is not one brick funded by the local state government-not one square metre, not one classroom provided by the state government. Its only contribution has been to erect a sign. Two years ago I thought that the Coromandel Valley Primary School in my electorate was the first state government school ever to have a capital works project funded entirely by the Australian government. I have just found a second one. The Rann Labor government is being slippery with the facts by implying that it is funding the Bellevue Heights Primary School upgrade. First, the department's newsletter claims how much it is providing for school capital works. Then it outlines a list of projects to be funded. Any fair-minded person would assume-it being a state government document and a state government budget-that it is funding the lot. That is not so. Given the Bellevue Heights figures were so misleading, I asked that other school funding outlined in the document also be examined. Surprise, surprise! What did we find? While a number of Commonwealth funding applications were still pending, we found seven schools in the state minister's list which had received considerable funding from the Commonwealth, none of it revealed or forecast in the state government's newsletter. Seven projects in the newsletter were estimated to cost a total of $13.9 million. But I discovered that the Australian government is pitching in $8.74 million, which is nearly 63 per cent or almost two-thirds of the total cost. So for every three classrooms which are being built in South Australia two are being funded by the Australian government. What is happening here is that the state Labor government is claiming credit, either directly or by implication, for funding millions of dollars in school upgrades.",155
