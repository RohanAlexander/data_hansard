2,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) will be absent from question time for the remainder of this week. He is attending meetings in the United States en route to the APEC meeting in Vancouver. The MinisterÂ·for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will be acting Minister for Trade for 18 and 19 November and will answer questions on his behalf. I also inform the House that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) will be absent from question time today. He is addressing the first plenary session of the International Hospital Federation conference in Melbourne. The Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) will answer on his behalf. Finally, the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay) will be absent from question time today as he is attending the funeral of his brother. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) will answer on his behalf. NA Dunn, Mr Robert 'Dolly'",13
3,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and concerns the revelation that Australian authorities knew of the whereabouts of Mr Robert 'Dolly' Dunn from at least January of this year. Is it not a fact that Australia's then ambassador to Mexico, Mr Richard Broinowski, reported repeatedly to your government on the preparedness of the Honduran authorities to assist in bringing Mr Dunn to justice. Exactly why did your government fail to act? Why won't you commission an exhaustive and independent inquiry to establish why this notorious fugitive was allowed to remain at large for the last 11 months?",13
4,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister. Mr Crean-No, it was to the Prime Minister.",13
5,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham!,13
6,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can certainly answer the question in relation to the reports in today's newspapers concerning the activities of the former Australian ambassador to Mexico who was accredited to Honduras, Mr Broinowski. Mr Broinowski was tasked by my department on 3 March this year to provide information on the extradition and deportation arrangements in Honduras. I can inform the House that the tasking note did not allege or claim that Mr Dunn was certainly in Honduras, although it alluded to the fact that, first of all, his whereabouts was unknown and, secondly, that it was possible he was in Honduras. Mr Broinowski subsequently on 17 March reported his assessment as a result of discussions he had had and the arrangements that existed for extradition and deportation from Honduras. That information was reported in a cable of 17 March which was sent back to Canberra. That cable was passed to the Attorney-General's Department. Subsequent late to that, the matter was in the hands of the Attorney-General's Department, not in the hands of my department.",13
7,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is why we asked the Prime Minister!,13
8,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Denison!,13
9,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My department was not subsequently tasked. I am advised that my department was not subsequently tasked on this matter. Telstra,13
10,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that 92 per cent of Telstra staff took up the employee share scheme in the Telstra float? Can the Prime Minister advise the House of the benefits for employees by taking up these shares?,13
11,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can certainly confirm to the honourable member for Bowman that, even though the leader of the Labor opposition is sad about yesterday'S Telstra triumph, 92 per cent of the employees of Telstra are delirious about the float. There is this magnificent front page showing two Telstra employees. It was a happy day for Rebecca Trichter and Kylie Neal. Rebecca Trichter is a Telstra employee from Campbelltown in the western suburbs of Sydney. She is delighted. Kim is sad; she is happy. She lives in the electorate of the member for Werriwa who has a bit of form on the sale of public assets. You actually favour it, don't you? You actually think our policy is right. If you were an employee of Telstra, you would be one of the 92 per cent. Mr Speaker, I cannot think of a bigger majority than 92 per cent. I think it is a thumping endorsement from 92 per cent of the workers, many of them. I am sure are traditional Labor Party voters and many of them would shake their heads. Look at the happy, excited faces! They absolutely radiate the enthusiastic embrace! But what do you get from the fellow opposite? 'Oh, I'm sad. I'm sad.' I will tell you what, Kim: Rebecca is not sad. The other 92 per cent of the Telstra employees are not sad, the 600,000 Australians who bought shares for the first time are not sad either and the 1.8 million Australians who own shares in Telstra are not sad. I remind the House that once again the coalition has over-delivered. We have not just delivered on what we promised. We said we would sell a third. The coalition promised in the election campaign that two per cent would be reserved for Telstra employees. We delivered a 100 per cent improvement on thatfour per cent of Telstra has been sold to the workers, to the battlers, to the people who normally regarded you people opposite as their friends, but no longer. This marvellous photograph-the excited, enthusiastic, hopeful and confident look which is radiated by this photograph-is another reminder of just how out of touch you are with the traditional people whom you once took for granted. Telstra has been a huge triumph. It is a good news story for the Australian economy. It is a good news story for the employees of Telstra. It is a good news story for the future of Australia. As this is the first question time that he has been present at since this very successful float, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating my outstanding Minister for Finance and Administration-the Mr Telstra of the government-on the absolutely fantastic job he has done. All of those people who have enthusiastically embraced the Telstra float should be very grateful for the skill and professionalism that John Fahey has brought to the discharge of his responsibilities. In other words, I think it is a good result. Dunn, Mr Robert 'Dolly'",14
12,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Is it not a fact that the Australian Federal Police knew that Mr Robert Dunn was resident in Honduras from at least last January when Ambassador Broinowski was sent there to report on bringing him back to face criminal prosecution in Australia? When precisely did you learn of Mr Dunn's whereabouts and what steps did you take to ensure his return to face justice? Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We are just having trouble hearing the speakers up here. I wonder whether the sound system can be turned up.",14
13,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do you want to hear my last answer again? Mr Hockey-If the Telstra answer could be repeated, that would be a great help.",14
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister did seem to be coming through loud and clear, but I will make an indicative gesture to SAVO and I am sure they will adjust the sound system as appropriate.",14
15,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I invite the opposition not to go off half-cocked on this. We are talking about serious criminal charges which have not been before a court. We are talking about operational matters on which parliamentary questions do not normally receive complete and full answers.,14
16,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But you can answer my question.,15
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Kingsford-Smith has asked the question.,15
18,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The AFP was advised in or about January or February that it was possible that Mr Dunn was in Honduras. Following that, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated, the ambassador accredited to Honduras was invited to go to Honduras and find out what the extradition proceedings were. At the same time, steps were put in train through usual police channels to endeavour to confirm that Mr Dunn was in fact in Honduras. That process involves the use of Interpol. Honourable members should bear in mind that we are dealing with a set of charges under New South Wales law here but it is the AFP that is principally responsible. There is not only no ambassador in Honduras but there is no AFP liaison officer either. The normal processes were followed. In fact, there was no confirmation of Mr Dunn's location in Honduras until the 60 Minutes team found him. Mr Bevis-You are joking! Mr Tanner-No wonder it is a high rating program.",15
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Brisbane! The member for Melbourne!,15
20,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Just listen to the answer. The 60 Minutes team took a punt. They did not know he was there when they went. It is not normal police practice to follow up an allegation of a sighting by sending police have no powers outside their own jurisdiction. The normal processes were followed.,15
21,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You should resign! That is what you should do. This is a disgrace.,15
22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,15
23,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is a disgrace!,15
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Kingsford-Smith.,15
25,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The result was that Mr Dunn was arrested. As far as the operational details are concerned, I am not going to say any more. Bear in mind that there are extradition proceedings in train, and we will not be commenting on those either. Telstra",15
26,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance and Administration. At the outset, I join the Prime Minister in congratulating him on the outstanding success of yesterday's float.",15
27,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Move quickly to your question.,15
28,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the minister aware of reports suggesting that the government has sold one-third of Telstra at too Iowa price? Is there any validity in the claims that, because of initial strong interest in the aftermarket for Telstra shares, the government should have pushed the price it set higher than the institutional price of $3.40? Mr FAHEYI thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. I can indicate to the House that I have seen some reports suggesting that perhaps Telstra was sold at too low a price. In fact, I said at a press conference 20 minutes after the share listed yesterday at 12.30 p.m. that I had no doubt that the Democrats would be preparing a press release saying that we sold it too cheaply. It is fairly obvious that the Democrats do not have the slightest idea of what the process is about. They have indicated from the very beginning that they were not the slightest bit interested in assisting with the sale of one-third of Telstra to give the Australian people a chance to purchase those shares, and they were aided and abetted by police. The Labor in that process. I would have thought that 1.9 million applications yesterday would have clearly demonstrated to the Labor Party and to the Democrats that the Australian people wanted to invest in this telecommunications company, and they did so in the manner in which they put their applications up. I believe that Senator Allison from the Democrats yesterday in the Senate quoted one 'Peter' Gottliebsen as the person who suggested that the value of the shares was $4! My research indicated that four or five weeks ago one Robert Gottliebsen and the BRW suggestedthat the shares were worth $4 each. That was long before we saw that market correction. We know what happened during that market correction period about three weeks ago. We had the Democrats saying, 'You're going to lose $9 billion, pull the float.' We had the Labor Party running out there saying, 'Take it off the market; you can't afford to keep going at this point in time.' What I can say is company. this: throughout that period and in the lead-up to the actual listing, what occurred was that we saw unparalleled demand for the shares both here and abroad. Just to give some details of that Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. On a number of occasions those of us on this side of the House have chosen to hold up newspaper articles to highlight the government's incompetence on matters such as nursing homes",15
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Fitzgibbon-But the member for Lindsay has consistently,16
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have no point of order. Resume your seat! Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting,16
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hunter!,16
32,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Some of your constituents have bought those shares. Throughout this process, the demand remained constant both in volume and in price-notwithstanding the correction that occurred on the market. On an examination of the book during the course of last week, it became clear that that demand, particularly from Australian price leadership, was above the upper end of the retail rangethat is, $3.30. We had to test that demand in the interests of the taxpayers. I announced on Thursday morning that the range for institutional bidders, the upper end, would be $3.40. We had the best possible advice available anywhere in the world. The Democrats have absolutely no idea of how this process works. They were interested in scuttling; they were only interested in trying to take some cheap point on the subject. I can say that when it came to listing at $3.40 there was an expected spike simply because we h<.tvehad an overdemand and we were uÂ·nable to allocate the shares that were being sought, particularly by the institutions. In fact, the institutions were scaled back to something like 20 per cent .of what they wanted. They went into the market yesterday and they were clearly prepared to pay for this great Australian I think what we have to see out of all of this is the fact that when we went to the Australian people before the last election we made it clear to them that we were interested in selling one-third of Telstra, that we were interested in giving the Australian people an opportunity to invest in their future in this country-and 1.9 million applicants made it abundantly clear. The other aspect which is very important in all of this is that, in the course of this period, our market has gone down seven percent over the past few weeks. I can say it went down less than other markets. In fact, it performed as well, if not better, than any other market anywhere in the world. The reason is that this government has the fundamentals right. We made it abundantly clear to the world that the stability of the Australian economy is there for all to see. That is why the investors continue to come for Telstra, and they continue to come from Australia and elsewhere. I cannot give any better ringing endorsement than the one that was given last night in New York when the share was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. One point nine million Australians endorsed the policies of this government on the economy. But last night the chief executive and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, Robert Grasso, said at the listing of Telstra on the N ew York Stock Exchange: . .. recent market events in South-East Asia and around the globe have reinforced my high regard for Australia. Mr Howard's responsible leadership, combined with steady improvement in Australia's economic fundamentals, gives us confidence in Australia's future as a good friend and successful partner in the continued growth of the Asia-Pacific region. Let me conclude by informing those members of the Labor Party opposite who bought shares in Telstra that just before I came into question time it was trading at $2.50. Dunn, Mr Robert 'Dolly'",16
33,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, now that you have heard the revelations of your ministers in question time today, will you now answer my first question to you? Why did your government fail to act and bring Dunn to justice? Why won't you commission an exhaustive and independent inquiry to establish why this notorious fugitive was allowed to remain at large for the last 11 months?",17
34,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My understanding is that this particular accused person has been a fugitive from justice for some time. Perhaps one of my colleagues can give me the exact date. I say to the honourable gentleman that, on the basis of what has been said by the Attorney-General and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I do not believe that what you have called for is required. But I can say to you, I can say to the House and I can say to the Australian public that if, after further discussions, anything arises which would warrant that, of course. I also say to the honourable member who sits opposite that it is very easy to score a cheap point on something like this-very easy indeed. I also think it is very important to say-and I say this very deliberately; and I say it, if it is worth my while doing so, appealing to your own sense of responsibility, and I know that is a bit hard-that you must understand there are extradition proceedings on foot. You know the vagaries of the working of the legal systems of other countries. You know what happened to people like Robert Trimbole. You know what happened, in the vagaries of the legal system, to people like Ronald Biggs. In the name of getting this person who has been accused of the most appalling crime back to Australia, the last thing anybody should do is, by taking a cheap political point, perhaps prejudice the extradiout tion proceedings. Environment: Natural Heritage Trust  the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer to the highly successful Telstra share float and the consequential fulfilment of the coalition's commitment to establish the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust fund. I ask the minister: what progress has been made by the government in achieving the environmental and sustainable natural resource management objectives of the Natural Heritage Trust? What will be the benefits for Australians?",17
35,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The short answer is a great deal-$190 million worth of funding in this first year of the establishment and bringing into being of the Natural Heritage Trust arrangements. We put them in place ahead of the promised sale of one-third of Telstra for a very important reason, and that is that the money is needed. That funding is now starting to flow. The round is now well through in terms of its announcement phase and $130 million has been announced, with another $60 million or so to come in this first year. In relation to South Australia, for example, around $16 million out of an estimated total of $24 million has been announced for 309 projects, including 239 from community groups. In the honourable member's own home state the situation is that $23Yz million out of an estimated total of at least $30 million was announced on 16 October for 336 projects. As the honourable member would know, many of those will go to securing some of that state's most valuable and productive grain producing country. The member for O'Connor is conscious of how important that is as well. A salinity action plan has been drawn up. That can now flow into action. It could never have flowed into action under those opposite. The reality is that under us it is. In the case of Victoria $24 million out of an estimated total of $33 million was announced on 24 October for 416 projects. In New South Wales $37 million was announced of an estimated total of $43 million for the 642 projects. For 375 projects in Queensland there is so far about $23 million, and there is around $7 million for Tasmania, with more to come. It is not just that this is very important terms of the environment and sustainable agriculture. There is another very important point that needs to be made. It was not just on the partial privatisation of Telstra that those opposite opposed us, and opposed us vehemently, and still express their sadness over what was done. What needs to be understood is that in that case what was done by the government, with full credit to the Minister for Finance, has been overwhelmingly and enthusiastically-even passionatelyembraced by the Australian people. The point is that exactly the same applies to the Natural Heritage Trust: they opposed it. At every tum they and their affiliates, the Australian Democrats, opposed us, right down to the line. They said they did not want a bar of it; they did not want to be part of the most significant environmental rescue package that this country has ever seen. What was the result when we succeeded in our objective? Exactly the same as with the float: overwhelming endorsement from the Australian people. Six thousand community groups-a record-applied for funding for various projects around Australia on the basis that they live in those communities, they know what needs to be done and they recognise the value of what we have put in place for securing sustainable agriculture and an environmental future for the next generation of Australians. Native Title",17
36,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in towns in my electorate such as Kununurra, Kalgoorlie and Karratha native title claims have meant that there is simply no land available for expansion. As a result this is forcing the price of available land extremely high. Inevitably this will seriously impact on small business and new home owners. As Prime Minister, are you concerned about this and can you advise whether your government's weak and wishy-washy Wik plan can ameliorate the problem? Furthermore, since the Keating government's legislation completely extinguishe native title on leases that would otherwise have been invalid, in and since no-one objected at the time and Mr Pearson, among others, endorsed the 1993 Keating act and Dennis Rose QC advised the NFF that extinguishment was complete, how can anyone now say that the 1O-point Wik plan is in any way illegal, as it does not go as far as Labor's act? In conclusion, Prime Minister, can you say whether you think that the posturing of Messrs Carnly, Hollingsworth and Brennan had more to do with Leon Trotsky than with Jesus Christ?",18
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The second part of the question I rule out of order. I invite the Prime Minister to address the first portion.,18
38,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not hear what you ruled out of order, sir, so I will not dispute your ruling. Can I say in response to the member for Kalgoorlie that I do not know all of the background to the question but, if the circumstances claimed by the member do in fact exist, this legislation certainly will provide a degree of predictability and certainty that is completely absent in the present law. Whatever views one may hold about the government's legislation, of one thing one can be absolutely certain: the proposition that in some way the existing law can be left as it is and the idea that you just sit there and do absolutely nothing is simply not an option. In answering the question raised by the honourable member I take the opportunity not only to confirm that the purpose of the legislation is to give certainty where there is now uncertainty and to give predictability where there is now unpredictability, but also to brand as completely misleading one or two of the general criticisms that are made of the government's native title proposals. There was an attempt made at the weekend, and it has been repeated in this parliament, to brand the legislation as in some way overturning the principles of the Mabo decision. It does not. The legislation leaves intact the principles laid down in the Mabo decision of the High Court of Australia. There is also a claim made by the critics of the legislation that the legislation extinguishes the common law rights of indigenous people as enunciated in the Mabo and Wik decisions. Once again, that allegation is untrue. In fact the very basis of the criticism of the legislation as being inadequate from some people on the government side of politics was that it did not go far enough in responding to . the principles enunciated by the High Court in the Wik decision. The whole basis of the bill is to confirm the common law of Australia as defined by the High Court in the Wik decision and the Mabo decision, but to do it in a way that provides a less expensive, less cumbersome, more predictable and more balanced procedural set-up. One of the most argued issues in relation to the legislation is the right to negotiate. One of those things for which the government has been most trenchantly criticised in relation to the bill is that we propose to take away the right to negotiate concerning pastoral leases. I remind those people who make that criticism that the right to negotiate is not a common law right. The right to negotiate was not laid down as part of the common law of Australia or the Anglo-Australian common law by the High Court in the Mabo case. The right to negotiate was a special arrangement entered into by the former government in relation to the formation of its native title bill. Those people who run around Australia, including those who sit opposite, saying that the right to negotiate is in some way a common law right are wrong. No other section of the community has a right to negotiate. I remind those people who are critics of the legislation that under the legislation it is still possible for the indigenous people of this country to make claims over 79 per cent of the landmass of Australia. We have a land acquisition fund of $1.3 billion. There are also large tracts of the Northern Territory which are in Aboriginal ownership as a result of the Northern Territory land rights legislation. On top of that, like any other Australian citizen, indigenous people have the right to own freehold land. Yet, in the face of all of that, the critics of the government would dare to say that this is unfair, racially based legislation. It is not unfair, racially based legislation. is an honest, fair, balanced attempt by the government to grapple with a very serious problem-a problem that we inherited from the Keating government and a problem that we said we would solve when we went to the last election. Those who conduct this dishonest campaign to smear decent Australians who are endeavouring to find a solution to this very difficult problem do the Australian community a great disservice. Charter of Budget Honesty",18
39,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the importance of budget repair measures to the health and stability of the Australian economy and the importance of transparency in the management of the nation's finances?,19
40,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. Mr Martin Ferguson-The charter of budget dishonesty.,19
41,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He would be aware, as the sensitive souls on the Labor front-bench are from their interjections, that, when this government inherited Labor's dismal, pathetic fiscal position and when this government became aware of the length of the deception to which the Keating government had gone to try to hide it, this government announced that we would be enacting a charter of budget honesty to ensure that no government ever again tried to get away with the level of deception practised by the Keating henchmen before the last election. That level of deception was led by none other than the then finance minister, Mr Beazley. He told the Age on 1 February 1996: We're in a position where we've got no plans to increase taxes. Why would we? We're operating in surplus ... He said: We're operating in surplus, and our projections are for surpluses in the future. The Australian budget was then $10,000 million in deficit-$10,000 million, and he said, 'We're operating in surplus.' We thought it was important as a government to make sure that nobody ever tried to practice that It kind of deception again. We brought in the charter of budget honesty, which would be a legislative brake on our government or any future Labor government so that that kind of behaviour could not be engaged in. What do we find with our charter of budget honesty? We find that a party that had not the wit or the inclination for 13 years to do anything about this gets up in the Senate with these amendments-which it says will improve the legislation; after 13 years-which are a cover to defeat this bill so that they can continue to repeat the trick of the last election. I say this: we will not be accepting any amendments from the Senate in relation to this bill. This bill will go back in three months time and it will fulfil the requirements of the Australian constitution. Mrs Crosio-Let's have it back now.",19
42,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Prospect!,20
43,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The charter of budget honesty also requires governments that engage in wanton fiscal irresponsibility to announce how they will unwind it. Listen to this: in 1991 Commonwealth net debt was $16.6 billion. After five more years of Keating government it went from $16.6 billion to $93.2 billion-5.6 times higher over five years, with no end in sight. The thing about these people is that not only were they wantonly irresponsible then; these people are recidivists-they want to do it again. They are out there opposing the Telstra sale because they do not want to retire debt. They are out there opposing measures to bring the budget back into balance because they want to drive it back into deficit again. They have no plan to fix the position and they want to stop a government that does. As I said yesterday in relation to Telstra, first of all they tried to prevent the government from fulfilling its election mandate. When they could not do that, they tried to talk down the sale process. When the people of Australia had the most magnificent participation in the Telstra privatisation, they went around with huge long faces today saying how terrible it was. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition this morning said: ... let's spare a thought today for the more 17 million Australians, a great many of whom couldn't afford to buy shares, and whose ownership has been diminished as a result of the sell down. Let us spare a thought for all those. people who used to own the Commonwealth Bank of Australia whose ownership was diminished as a result of the sell-down. Let us spare a thought for all those people of Qantas whose ownership was diminished as a result. He is nodding his head! '",20
44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Gareth is nodding.,20
45,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is sparing a thought for them. Here we have an Australian Labor Party who has in its objectives-listen to this; this is the objective of the Australian Labor Party-'the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange'. Mr Gareth Evans-That is the Old Testament.",20
46,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He interjects. He says, 'That's the Old Testament.' Mr Gareth Evans-You should read the New Testament.",20
47,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No wonder we love you! They are true to the Old Testament when it comes to Telstra; they are true to the New Testament when it comes to the Commonwealth Bank. Is that the position? They are true to another testament again when it comes to Qantas. There is one great test for the Australian Labor Party. It is this: when they go to their conference to rewrite their platform, will they be following Tony Blair and taking that clause out of it? Will they be taking out of their platform 'the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange'? Here is a test of leadership for the Leader of the Opposition. Will you be taking out from your platform your desire-the Australian Labor Party's long-held objective-to have 'democratic socialisation of industry, production ... and exchange'? That was the first step that Tony Blair took. Let us see whether you can take one small step in following him down that path. Drugs: Higher Charges",20
48,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the than Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his claim of 14 May that the government's higher drug charges would only apply to 'drugs of equal clinical value'? If so, can he explain to the House the recent comments by Stuart Montgomery, Professor of Psychiatry at the Imperial College of Medicine in London and former adviser to the World Health Organisation on mental health drugs?",20
49,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, I'm worried!",21
50,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You will like what he said: . .. the Therapeutic Group Premium policy to allow substitution of SSRIs [like Prozac] at best will weaken the ability of physicians to offer the best treatment for the individual but is also potentially dangerous. Prime Minister, in the light of this compelling evidence, will you now abandon your unfair and dangerous higher drug charges and save yourself the embarrassment of having to back down later?",21
51,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I tell you what I do stand by. I stand by the accuracy of a transcript of a comment made by the person who has just asked the question. The member for Dobell said: It is important to remember that four years ago this country allocated $500m from taxpayers' money to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In the last financial year the allocation was more than $1 billion; in three years' time it will be more $2 billion. And one can imagine how much we will be spending on subsidising the cost of drugs for our community by the tum of the century-a massive sum of money ... Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is on relevance. This is a quote about generic drugs. The Prime Minister was asked: do you stand by your claim that it only affects drugs of equal clinical value? That is the question.",21
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat!,21
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He went on to say this: And one can imagine how much we will be spending on subsidising the cost of drugs for our community by the tum of the century-a massive sum of money, if there is no change in the meantime. As I said, there has been a massive growth in the cost of pharmaceuticals, so the Government has had to take some action. Doctors should be trained to prescribe a family of drugs and not a particular brand. They were the words of the member for Dobell. You have no credibility, sir, on this matter at all.",21
54,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask a supplementary question, Mr Speaker. Does the Prime Minister stand by his claim that this only affects drugs of equal clinical value? He has not answered that question.",21
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order. Youth: Education and Training,21
56,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs inform the House how the government's policies have increased opportunities for education and training for young Australians? Is the minister aware of any misleading comments that have been made about these policies? What is the government's response?",21
57,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dickson for his question. The government is committed to providing for all young Australians the best quality education and training. The key aims of the government are to exthan pand the number of places in education and training for young people and to improve the quality of that education to a standard which is equal to the best in the world, and I am very pleased to say that the government is succeeding in achieving these objectives. In the past 20 months the government has already established a proud record of increasing opportunities in education and training. According to the latest estimates, the number of undergraduates in Australian universities this year is up some 17,000 over last year. There are some 55,000 extra places in TAFE this year, of which 43,000 are Commonwealth funded. In 1996-97 we anticipate that there will be some 98,000 apprenticeship and trainees hip opportunities coming into existence, a 20 per cent increase on the previous year. Not surprisingly, in the face of all this good news, the government is being subjected to a continuing campaign of disinformation and untruth by the Labor Party and by none more so than the member for Werriwa. On 17 August this year on Channel lO's Meet the Press program, the member for Werriwa claimed 'the government's denying choice when it abolishes 21,000 student places in our universities' and he repeated that lie in the House again last night. Mr Latham-Oh! You are saying that!",21
58,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr Speaker!,22
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will withdraw the comment.,22
60,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I withdraw.,22
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is withdrawn.,22
62,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This repeated misrepresentation of the facts is known by the member for Werriwa to be false. The Labor Party claims that places have diminished by 21,000 when the fact is that the number of undergraduate places is up by 17,000. The member for Werriwa claimed on the same program that the Labor Party was 'the possessor of the mandate of the working people of Australia. ' We know who represents the employees of Telstra: we obtained 92 per cent support from the employees of Telstra, I think. What the member for Werriwa cannot stomach is that Labor's narrow, ideological education policies locked tens of thousands of qualified Australian students out of Australian universities, while admitting students from overseas. It has taken this government to put into place the policies that are opening the doors to these students. Tens of thousands of Australian students were locked out because you would not permit them to invest in their own education. Because the government has permitted that, we now know that in my home state of Victoria alone there have been some 10,000 applications from young Australians to take up these places, and there have been tens of thousands of applications in other states as well. The net consequence",22
63,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For 100,000 bucks a yearwhat a privilege!",22
64,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is something you have never understood. What the Leader of the Opposition is demonstrating again and again is just how ideologically blind the Labor Party is. They believe that, if you prevent Australians from having the chance to invest in their own education, that is somehow fair. It is all right to give young people from overseas the right to invest. It is not all right to give Australian students the right to invest. It is very likely that the students .who purchase those places will very likely, in the great majority of cases, be vacating their second preference place for their first preference place, thus expanding quite significantly the total number of places in Australian universities. The West committee, whose report was released last week, made the point that there has been virtually no change in the social composition of the students in Australian universities over the last 10 years. That was under Labor's policies, which gave privileged access to those who had been to certain schools. Obviously, it was the students from",22
65,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. From their side of the House they asked a set of specific questions. Dr Kemp is now going around to canvass Labor policy in order to defend his policy of $100,000 a pop for a worker.",22
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition! There is no point of order.,22
67,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is what you are doing and-',22
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Leader of the Opposition.,22
69,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This has stung the Labor Party, because what they cannot face up to is the fact that there are more places and better funded universities under our policies than under theirs. They need to face up to the fact that the banner of educational equity has passed to this side of the House. It is the coalition that stands for expanded opportunity within universities, TAFEs, apprenticeships and traineeships. The reason the social composition of the universities did not change in the last 10 years under your policies was that you kicked the ladder out from under apprenticeships. You refused to allow the students from battling families in this country to climb up the apprenticeship ladder, to build up their qualifications, to move on to diplomas and degrees. That is why you narrowed educational opportunity. This government has faced up to the realities. We are standing up for fairness in education and we are producing the places that show the success of that policy. Drugs: Higher Charges",22
70,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the third time, I ask the Prime Minister: does he stand by his claim in this House on 14 May that his higher drug charges only affect drugs of equal clinical value? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. From the lips of the member's own mouth, this is not only the second but the third time that this question has been asked. It has been asked and fully answered. I ask that you rule it out of order.",23
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Parramatta. I admire the honourable member for Dobell's persistence in this matter and, while I am listening very carefully to your unfinished question, I remind you to address it precisely and succinctly.",23
72,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I also ask the Prime Minister whether he stands by the Treasurer's claims that the drugs affected were like Kellogg's cornflakes and No Name cornflakes. Is it not the case, Prime Minister, that your own government's expert advisers have found that one of the drugs in the calcium channel blocker group for treating high blood pressure may be safer in patients with cardiac failure? How can you say that this drug is the same as the cheaper drugs? Are you not in fact forcing patients to either pay more or be at greater risk of a heart attack?",23
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I might say, in response to the member for Dobell, that this is another example of 'whatever it takes'. You take a position in government and when you get into opposition you completely ignore the position you took in government. It is a practice you have relentlessly applied. The member for Dobell is the member who, when he was a member of the Keating government, was asking everybody to understand the massive problem the then government had in controlling the explosion of PBS. Now he is in opposition any kind of cheap, dishonest scare campaign will do. Whatever it takes-it does not matter what you say, it does not matter how insubstantial your allegations are, you will just run a cheap, dishonest scare campaign. I say to the honourable member: I do not accept at face value the attributions that you have made of remarks by me and by the Treasurer. I have long learned in this place to go away and check the Hansard before accepting your attributions. But I want to make it perfectly clear that I regard this policy as a fair, responsible one, and one that you have completely dishonestly-and this is typical of your behaviour in oppositionmisrepresented. Bougainville",23
74,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister inform the House whether or not Australia will be participating in a truce monitoring group for Bougainville? What efforts is Australia making to encourage progress in the Bougainville peace talks? Will the government be hosting peace talks in Cairns?,23
75,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question and recognise the great interest she has in promoting peace in Bougainville and, indeed, around the Asia Pacific region. Mr Adams-And she is a member of the South Australian Liberal Party.",23
76,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And, indeed, as the honourable member interjects, she is a member of the South Australian Liberal Party and that is very much to her credit. They make a very fine team here in this parliament, by contrast to the South Australian Labor Party. How many members does it have in this House? There is one over there and there is one other, I think, and that's about it. Not much of a show. On a serious point, I am pleased to be able to confirm that, at the request of all the parties to the Bougainville dispute, Australia expects to host the next round of peace talks in Cairns. Our expectation is that the talks will begin on Thursday and I shall be travelling to Cairns and speaking with the participants. The Australian government, in particular with the assistance of the Australian Defence Force, will be transporting all the delegates to these talks. The Cairns meeting is expected to bring together around 50 representatives of all the parties to the Bougainville peace process. Its main purpose will be to prepare the way for a leaders meeting, which was agreed to at the October meeting in Burnham. That leaders meeting is expected to take place at the end of January next year. Australia is proud to have been able to play a very constructive and important role in bringing forward the Bougainville peace process, particularly after the regrettable Sandline incident earlier this year. We have, though-patiently and working closely, as members well know, with New Zealand and, above all, the Papua New Guinea government-been able to encourage this peace process to proceed. And, whilst my judgment is that it will take a very long truce has already been declared and the peace process continues to marcY on. In the context of the tmce, the Australian government has been asked by the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister, Mr Skate, to participate in a truce monitoring group for Bougainville. The Papua New Guinea government has indicated that the truce monitoring group should number around 150 in totalalthough, in the end, it may be somewhat larger than that. The group will be deployed in four locations on the island, comprising two elements: some truce monitors and a sizeable support and logistics element, and they will be made up of both military and civilian officers. It is likely to include not only participants from Australia and New Zealand but also participants from several Pacific island countries. The Australian government is proud to have been able to contribute to the Bougainville peace process, but I have always said that we are not going to get anywhere towards peace on Bougainville if Australia or, for that matter, New Zealand lays down a blueprint and demands that that blueprint be adhered to. At the end of the day, this is a matter that has to be resolved by the peoples of Bougainville and Papua New Guinea. They have to work this process through together and understand that peace is going to be to their advantage. With that in mind, the Australian government has offered a very generous reconstruction program on Bougainville to assist with the peace effort. When we first came to government, we said that we wanted to see peace in Bougainville. We have, of course, worked very hard at that. We have had our ups and downs, I concede, in that process, but I am delighted to say that the process is now moving forward constructively. Nursing Homes",23
77,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall saying on the Ray Martin show that 'the house remains part of the assets test'? Prime Minister, is this still correct: does the family home remain part of the nursing home time, at least a assets test?",24
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is correct is that the family home is utterly safe. Public Sector: Freedom of Association Laws,24
79,Mr ROSS CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Can the minister inform the House of the impact on the Australian Public Service of the government's freedom of association laws since their introduction? Can the minister further outline the impact on both the Australian Public Service and business of the abolition of those laws as has been proposed?,24
80,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Parramatta. Mr Tanner-No worker will be better off. Have a look at what has happened to Australia National.,24
81,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am looking at Telstra and I'll tell you what-the workers there are a hell of a lot better off. What is interesting is that your policy, released last week, said that you were going to encourage share ownership but, of course, not for the people in Telstra. They well know which government is interested in the well-being of Telstra employees, and it is pretty obvious today-you only have to look at the papers. But thank you for the interjection. The government's reforms which came into operation on 1 January this year contained a whole series of important measures. One of the most important measures it contained was to give peopleMr Crean-You're just a mess.",24
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham!,25
83,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We could work our way down the front row, Mr Speaker, and give them all suggestions. We had one yesterday who has taken his own hair dye. I do not know what we would do for you, Simon. It will be a complete face job by the time we get further down. Abolishing compulsory unionism is one of the great reforms of this government. When it comes to the Australian Public Service, not only have we introduced laws which protect the right of people to join a union or not to join a union but we have also written to people in the Australian Public Service and made it quite clear that, from our perspective as the employer, this must be a real choice. It is not just a choice which is legislated but a real choice in the options that people have. So we wrote to members of the Australian Public Service and said, 'If you want to be in the union and you want the government to deduct the union fee from your wage packet, we will do so-no questions asked. Give us an authority and we will do so. If you do not wish to do so then of course we will not deduct from your pay.' I have reported on this before to the House, but since I last reported we have seen a further number of members of the Australian Public Service decide not to take advantage of the payroll deduction service for union dues. Mr Tanner-Have you ever heard of direct debit of bank accounts?",25
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne!,25
85,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is interesting how many have taken up this option. Is it 10 per cent? No, it is not 10 per cent. Is it 20 per cent? No, it is not. Is it 30 per cent? It was just over 30 per cent when I last reported but today, on the latest figures, nearly 40 per cent of all members of the Australian Public Service who are members of unions have decided to no longer avail themselves of the automatic payroll deduction. The exact number is 38.5 per cent and the actual number of employees affected is 12,961. It is an incredible collapse of support for the union movement that the number has fallen from 33,619 to 20,658 in October. There are proposals about to effectively repeal the changes that we made to the Workplace Relations Act. For example, the Labor Party are proposing the abolition of the office of employment advocate. The practical consequences of that would be to remove from employees an opportunity to have in force their rights as to whether or not they join a union. That is the implication of the abolition of th(! office of employment advocate, which was actually established to give real force and effect to the protections under our law to people who wish to exercise choice. The Labor Party's policy also proposes that development of representative organisations should be fostered. That is code for a special deal for the trade union organisations; in fact, a particular deal to prop up organisations which otherwise are not able to attract members by the quality of services. They also propose that: A reasonable right of entry should be allowed for union officials to workplaces for the purposes, of organisation recruitment and assistance to workers. There are already, within the law, reasonable provisions to allow right of entry. This is code for allowing union people to get into businesses where they are not invited by the employees. It is the key for some union official to get into every small business in this country to bludgeon people into the trade union movement. The trade union movement today is losing members because it is unable to provide the services that rank and file people are looking for. If you look at the Australian work force, one of the glaring facts of the Australian work force is that employees have been deciding not to join unions. Employees have been deciding to leave unions. Yet Labor's policy is to introduce a series of measures which are designed to prop up a union movement increasingly out of touch with the reality of a modem Australia. They are out of touch with employees in Telstra and they are out of touch with rank and file right across the union movement. Nursing Homes",25
86,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Jeff Kennett has just been finding out all about that.,26
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Move quickly to your question.,26
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. In announcing his alternative to the up-front fee, the annual fee of up to $10,000, the Prime Minister said: We are going to make arrangements with financial institutions to lend them that money. Was the minister aware that this fundamental plank of the policy backflip was made without any prior consultation with banks to determine their attitude to the plan?",26
89,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Not correct.,26
90,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the minister aware that the banks have been most unreceptive to and highly critical of the Prime Minister's approach? Is the minister aware that the Australian Bankers Association described the plan as disastrous and accused the Prime Minister of: ... just trying to shift responsibility for munity service onto the banks? It is the government's responsibility to look after the aged. It just reeks of shifting the responsibility down the corridor. Minister, does this not sum up your government's approach to aged care: no care, no responsibility?",26
91,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question from the Leader of the Opposition raises in my mind real questions about the source of his information. There have been discussions by the government and, in due course, the matters will be revealed. I did have an answer to a question yesterday that indicated that the concept of reverse mortgages, as they are described, has been the subject of discussions between myself and others in the marketplace. It will put in place an option that has been the feature of aged care policy in other countries around the world. I do not know whom you were quoting from within the banking sectorMs Macklin-The Bankers Association.",26
92,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Quite clearly it is someone who is uninformed. If I want to pursue a detailed national policy and develop a plan for aged care, that is obviously one group I will not go and speak to. The Bankers Association do not offer services; they represent banks. What is important here is to talk to the institutions that have the capacity to deal with these matters and to put in place, as I said yesterday, plans that help consumers. That is what we are concerned about. What you clearly are not concerned about are the needs of aged care. It is quite interesting, is it not, that at the major meeting I held last week with all the consumers and all the aged care sector they agreed with the process that I am now developing in conjunction with my colleagues. The only people who are trying to hang on to the remnants of a scare campaign are you. Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service Mr mCKS-My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Will the minister advise the House what a combenefits are flowing from the government's meat inspection reform program to the Australian meat industry? Will these benefits assist the industry to maintain and further increase its domestic and international competi ti veness?",26
93,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. When we came to government, it was not only the nation's books that were in a mess-so were the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service's books. The member for Hotham, when he was minister, had left the thing in a state that could appropriately be described as technically insolvent. Mr Fahey-It was absolutely disgraceful.",26
94,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Minister for Finance said, it was an absolute mess. The man who followed him as minister did absolutely nothing in that area, which was reflective of what he did just about everywhere else. In the red meat sector alone, we had a unit that was charging industry outrageously at the same time as taxpayers were propping it up with a massive subsidy. And it was still losing money hand over fist. We set about a far-reaching and ambitious reform process. We put a substantial financial commitment into that and we have made good progress. Not only have we got rid of the taxpayers' subsidy in the first 18 months but also we got the total cost to industry down from $62 million to $55 million.",26
95,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And you wrecked our trade with the United States in the process.,27
96,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to that, thank you. I am very glad that the Leader of the Opposition so responsibly claims that we wrecked our trade with the United States. Thank you very much. I will come to that in a moment. We achieved all this at the same time as we reduced the cost to industry and improved our meat quality and safety record. Today, in conjunction with industry, I announced further major changes. The first is a series of technical reforms which will reduce the cost to industry by about $12 million or $13 million a year and which have been very widely welcomed by industry. The second achievement that we announced-and I am very proud of this, if I can say so to Mr Reith-is in the area of workplace reform: the first certified agreement to be ratified for the Commonwealth Public Service. It will reduce cost to industry by a further $5 million a year. It will deliver further substantial reductions administration and. processing costs by providing more flexible employment arrangements for meat inspectors, and it will harmonise AQIS and industry working hours, which is something that you could never do and are incapable of doing. Thirdly-and this is why I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition, this proud Australian who is so keen to promote our export performance in the United States, has raised the American issue and trade there-we have just succeeded in a major review of 18 of our plants by the United States' review teams. For the first time ever, every single one passed without a hitch. In addition to that, for the first nine months of this year, the figures show that US inspectors have accepted 99.77 per cent of Australia's meat, which is the highest acceptance rate for any of the countries that export to the United States.",27
97,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It sounds like a Telstra employee.,27
98,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it does. A very happy Telstra employee. In relation to project two, the fact is that-contrary to what my opposite number is claiming-it has not been rejected. All they have said is that they want to defer the consultations about an excellent procedure which, from a technical point of view, they acknowledge produces better outcomes",27
99,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Technical!,27
100,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whose side are you on? You are not on the side of the Australian meat exporters. He is not on the side of Australian trade or the people in the industry. He is one of these people, like his trade union mates, who wants to talk down our great rural export industries. He wants to talk them down. The Americans have said they want to talk to us about how we would monitor it on an ongoing basis, but do you know what industry leadership said today? They have said that government is absolutely right in pursuing this avenue, that they are 100 per cent with us, that it is the way of the future, that it produces better outcomes and guarantees jobs in the future-the very antithesis of everything that my opposite number said in his press release the other day, which shows in that he does not understand a thing about this. The Leader of the Opposition ought to note this. The point that really embarrassed him was that his predecessor, Bob Collins, had acknowledged that what we were doing was the appropriate way forward. Now back to the future. You are absolutely unbelievable. I conclude by saying this: the thing that delighted me today was that peak industry leadership lined up for this announcement. They joined me at the press conference and they made it very plain that our reforms are delivering to their bottom lines, that they are helping to boost our export performance and secure Australian jobs. That is something you never achieved in this area. Nursing Homes",27
101,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister .for Finance and Administration. Minister, what is your present assessment of the amount of capital which will be raised by the latest version of the Prime Minister's nursing home entry charge? How far short does it fall of the capital proposed to be raised by your first version of the policy? How far short does it fall of the $500 million which you cut from nursing home funding in the 1996 budget?",28
102,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, they would never get to their feet unless they could put through some misrepresentation in the course of asking a question. I can indicate very clearly to the House that theÂ· government is still very much moving towards ensuring that we achieve the outcome of a capital injection into the nursing home stock in Australia. Ms Macklin-Where are you going to get it from-from people's homes!",28
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Jagajaga,",28
104,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Your own report from Professor Gregory demonstrated very clearly that there were many hundreds of millions of dollars to be injected into that capital stock. You had ignored it for 13 years. The conditions in relation to nursing homes,28
105,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order: the questions asked were for the present assessment of the amount of capital which will be raised by the latest version, how far short it fell of the amount of capital to be raised by the first version of the policy and how far short is it of the $500 million cut from the budget. I would describe those as very specific questions to which he is giving a very general answer.",28
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is addressing the question.,28
107,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What this government inherited in respect of nursing homes was an absolute disgrace. Mr Crean-How much short?,28
108,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You just be patient. You put on your long face after the Telstra sale, sit there and squirm and listen patiently . We had to tackle the problem like so many .other problems in respect of it. Quite clearly, we set about putting in place a policy that would achieve that objective, that would give the necessary injection into the improvement of these facilities that had been neglected for so long, and I can assure you we are still on",28
109,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I go to relevance again. It was a specific set of questions about how much was expected to be raised; where the shortfall is, if there is one, and how much it is short of the $500 million. He clearly does not know, though he is the finance minister. He should simply say it.",28
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am listening to the answer. There is no point of order. The question is in order. Resume your seat.,28
111,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Don't let that man talk to me about shortfall. I have spent 19 months worrying about the shortfalls that you brought into this House. I tell the Leader of the Opposition: with the nursing home policy which the Minister for Family Services is finetuning at this present time there will be no shortfall.,28
112,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. If the minister does not know the answer, will he come back tomorrow and provide the information?",28
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order. I remind the member for Canberra about frivolous supplementary questions. Women,28
114,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for the Status of Women. Given the government's commitment to greater opportunities and choice for Australian women, could the minister please advise the House what the government has achieved for women since coming into office?",28
115,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hughes for her question. I know she has a particular interest in the women in her electorate. This government is committed to policies of substance which act in the interests of women, rather than the high spending policies and the hollow rhetoric which were a feature of Labor during its term of administration. Our government's commitment is reflected in tangible measures which will improve the lives of women and their families in this country.Â· As a government, we recognise the need to balance sound economic policy with pressing social policy improvement in this country. Make no mistake about it: even the young mums in the less affluent areas of my electorate understood this principle-that is, to balance economic measures and social policy measures-as I doorknocked before the last election. Many of them were former Labor voters, who did not need an economics degree to realise that we as a nation were spending more than we earned. These women feared for their future and the future of their children and grandchildren under the policies of the Labor Party. They recognised that Labor's policies were designed purely for two things: one was for short-term gain and the other was for political expediency. That is all they were concerned about, not the long-term improvement of our policies for the future of Australia's women and children. For tangible evidence of our government's commitment to women, we need only to cast our eye around the benches in this place and in the other place to see the record number of women the coalition has in the federal parliament. These women are making a significant contribution to shaping the policies that will affect the lives of women and their families right around this country, and nowhere has this involvement been more apparent than in the contribution that the women on our benches have made to ensuring the safety of women in Australia. One of the major issues raised by women for some time now is their safety, and particularly domestic violence. This government has listened to their concerns. We have delivered. We have delivered what no other country in the world has delivered, and that is to put in place stringent, uniform gun control laws, something that women in other countries have only dreamed of. One woman from the United States commented to me, 'Your Prime Minister is courageous. If only we could have achieved gun controls in our country. If only we could achieve that.' For the first time in this country's history, we have a Prime Minister whose leadership has brought together heads of government and business leaders to form a partnership against domestic violence, with a special focus on women in rural and regional Australia, who have the added problem of geographical and social isolation. This includes indigenous women, who also have the added problem of social and geographical isolation. One of the other key issues that have concerned women",28
116,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is clearly a ministerial statement, not an answer to a question. More than that, it is a debating political speech from the minister. It is a straight abuse of question time-apart from looking like one of those confessions from a Stalin show trial when you get up to praise your executor.",29
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You will resume your seat. The minister, I am sure, is in the position of concluding her answer.",29
118,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have recognised the tension for women in balancing workplace and family responsibilities by providing greater flexibility in our Workplace Relations Act and giving a commitment to ensuring equal opportunity for women and equal pay for work of equal value. Our child-care policies have been put into place to counteract the unplanned, unchecked policies of the former Labor government and have provided sustainability of child-care services in our community. We will provide 83,000 new places in child care, and we will ensure that 70,000 families benefit from our outside school hours care. For the most neglected group in our community-not only the women who are working in the paid work force and who are caring for their children but also those who are caring for the nation's sick, the chronically ill, the aged and those with a disability; the carers-we have implemented a national respite for carers plan, including respite and resource centres right across this country, and have ensured that they got a pay rise to adequately help them to carry out their caring role. We are proud of our government's achievements and our clear and unequivocal support for Australian women.

119,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his comments in the House yesterday that the coalition was defending 'jobs in regional Australia' and sticking up for Hanson. 'jobs of Australian miners'. Is the Prime Minister aware of comments by representatives of the Northern Territory Mount Todd goldmine, linking the mine's weekend closure with the loss of 225 jobs to the poor sentiment for gold which followed the Treasurer's comments on the Reserve Bank sell-off in July? Mr Costello-Oh! Why don't you ask me!",30
120,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Prime Minister recall saying at the time of the selloff that it was all the gold producers' fault and the Treasurer asserting indifference to the consequences of the sell-off on the basis that people still wore gold jewellery? Prime Minister, how is this defending regional jobs and sticking up for Australian miners?",30
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen the full context of those remarks. Although it is always an enormous risk to do so, let us for a moment assume that perhaps on this occasion a member of the Labor Party front-bench may have correctly quoted in part what somebody said. Judging by the reaction of my colleague the Treasurer, I do not think that is likely. I gather that a search is now being undertaken for the full text. We will be very happy to facilitate an addition to the answer that I am going to give. I say to the member for Perth that the decision that was taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia to sell gold was fully in accord with well developed international practice in relation to gold. In other words, what the Reserve Bank did on that occasion was what you will never do: that is, look after the Australian national interest. What the Reserve Bank did on that occasion was to ensure the proper investment of the assets held by the Reserve Bank. It was clearly in the interests of the Reserve Bank and clearly in Australia's interests that there be some change in gold holdings into other currencies. It is a practice that has been followed for years, but you allow me once again to draw the House's attention to the fact that all the time over the last six months that we have been defending Australia's national interest overseas you have been denigrating our efforts. Mr Latham-Overseas ! You tell us about",30
122,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As we have tried to defend the jobs of Australians in the mining industry, you have been sneering at those attempts. Mr Latham-Tell us about Hanson and .. our overseas reputation.",30
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Werriwa! Mr Latham-You tell us about Hanson and our overseas reputation.,30
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Werriwa.,30
125,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As we have been pointing out the deleterious effect of your policies on the mining industry of Australia, instead of marching arm in arm with us to defend the miners of Australia, what you have been trying to do is do them in the eye. You have not been defending the interests of Australian workers. Just as you are out of touch with 92 per cent of Telstra workers, so you ate out of touch with the fact that our policy on greenhouse has won more plaudits in the member for Cunningham's electorate, more plaudits in the member for Charlton's electorate and more plaudits in the member for Hunter's electorate. That exhausts your coal mining seats; now let me start on my side of the House. Mr Fitzgibbon-A point of order!",30
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister will resume his seat. Taking due heed to my earlier comments, the honourable member for Hunter on a point of order. Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I wish to point out that the Prime Minister is misleading the House.",31
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order? Mr Fitzgibbon-By opposing arbitration he is wrecking jobs in the coal mining industry in the Hunter.,31
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for Hunter.,31
129,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have let the miners down on this. Mr Fitzgibbon-You've got no idea.,31
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hunter. Mr Fitzgibbon-You have no idea.,31
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I name the member for Hunter. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I move that the member be",31
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question is that the motion be agreed to. All those in favour say aye, to the contrary no. Mr Crean-He hasn't moved it!",31

137,Mr NAIRN,NOES,"My question is to the Treasurer. Mr Tanner-Oh, is it about gold sales?",32
138,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Melbourne!,32
139,Mr NAIRN,NOES,Has the Treasurer seen recent comments about gold sales and the effect on the Australian goldmining industry? What are international developments in relation to gold sales?,32
140,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"Yes, I have seen recent comments about gold sales. Sometimes in this business people are wrong and sometimes you come across slimy little squirts and I am afraid the member for Perth is in the latter category . Yesterday he issued a ment unreported in any newspaper in Australia. Mr Gareth Evans-I raise a point of order. Was that expression parliamentary in its application to the member for Perth?",32
141,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Is the honourable member for Perth unhappy?,32
142,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"I withdraw it, Mr Speaker.",32
143,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,The Treasurer on reflection has withdrawn the statement.,32
144,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"I will describe him differently: a man who got his start in life as a staffer to Paul Keating-much worse. He put out a statement yesterday-17 November 1997-unreported by any newspaper in Australia which says: Now, as a consequence of the Treasurer's lamentable conduct ... the Australian gold industry is badly placed ... following the recent announcement by the Swiss of a bank gold sell off ... I am now responsible for the Swiss, am I? Mr Stephen Smith-You ruined the sentiment for gold.",32
145,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"He also said there was speculation of a German Bundesbank gold sell-off. I am running the Bundesbank, am I? I am running the Swiss government and the German Bundesbank. The Australian Reserve Bank, which had been wanting to rationalise its gold sales for a long time, sold 167 tonnes. The gold price was affected on Friday, 24 Gold October when a group of experts from the Swiss Central Bank and Finance ministry",32
146,Unknown,NOES,Opposition members interjecting,32
147,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"Wait for it. The Australian Reserve Bank sold 167 tonnes. In April 1987 a group of experts was set up. It reported on Friday, 24 October, recommending Swiss gold sales of 1,400 tonnes, taking the Swiss gold price to a 12-year low. Here we have the Australian Labor Party running around saying that the Australian government is responsible for the Swiss development.",32
148,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The question went to the particular circumstances that the opposition spokesman mentioned. If the Treasurer wants to get up and prate on the ball that he started rolling, media state- that is all right by us.",32
149,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! We are not debating the issue. Resume your seat.,32
150,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"That interjection brings me to an article by Terry MCCrann which appeared in the Herald-Sun on 28 October. Seeing that he interjected, the headline is 'Kim's hypocrisy revealed by Reserve's gold coup'. Listen to this, Mr Speaker.",32
151,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,And what does it say?,32
152,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"No wonder he is interjecting. Why don't you listen to this. Listen to what he is trying to drown out now with his interjections, Mr Speaker. Terry MCCrann, on 28 October 1997, said: The once just hypocritical Kim Beazley is developing into a pathetic figure. The 'new' Beazley, though, that has emerged since Paul Keating opted for the political 'big sleep' seems to almost pursue the tag 'hippo'. As I wrote in July, wouldn't our Reserve look a real goose if other central banks got wise and sold the gold price down, and it was still sitting on its hands? This was confirmed in spades with the reaction to Friday's announcement that the Swiss were moving to sell 1400 tonnes of gold-nearly nine times the amount sold by the Reserve. Our Reserve sold at $US350 an oz. Yesterday the gold price was $US308. We should be falling over ourselves to congratulate the Reserve for its action. Yet, there was 'Hippo' trying to argue that somehow the fall in the gold price---even the Swiss decision-was all the fault of our Reserve's decision to sell. And in the most twisted of logic, he even tried to have it both ways: that it was 'good' decision by the Reserve but was disastrous and should have been stopped by Treasurer Peter Costello. Mr Speaker, do you know why the Reserve Bank had not sold gold during Labor's period?",32
153,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,We stopped them.,33
154,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"You did not stop them at all because the Australian Labor Party would have confiscated the profits. That is why. The Reserve Bank was worried that the Australian Labor Party would have confiscated the profits. Here are a group of people-a group of economic illiteratesMr Latham-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the question was short and simply asked whether the Treasurer had seen comments about gold sales. Surely now, on a matter of relevance, he has gone way, way beyond any reasonable answer to that very short and precise question.",33
155,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"There is no point of order. The Treasurer's response is in order. Mr Latham-When he said yes, he could have sat down.",33
156,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Resume your seat.,33
157,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"Here is a group of . economic illiterates whose policy is this: the Australian Reserve Bank should sell when the price is low rather than when it is high. That is their argument. Here is a group of economic illiterates who say that the Australian Reserve Bank is responsible for Swiss bank decisions. Here is a group of economic illiterates who say that the Reserve Bank of Australia is responsible for the decisions of the Bundesbank. Here are a group of economic illiterates who wander around and try to putout any falsehood. In the words of former Senator Graham Richardson, who summed up the moral turpitude of the Australian Labor Party, whatever it takes, whatever the allegation is, however great the dishonesty, make the allegation and heaven help the consequences.",33

162,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Proceed quickly.,33
163,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,In two answers this afternoon the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) quoted from comments I made years ago in support of common pricing for generic drugs which are of equal clinical value. He also claimed that these comments demonstrated that I was hypocritical in now opposing his higher charges for his five therapeutic groups of drugs which involve drugs which are not of equal clinical value. The Prime Minister's claim simply demonstrates that he does not yet understand the difference between generic groups and drugs that are of different clinical value. NA,33
164,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I rise on a matter of privilege. In response to your advice in a letter dated 28 October that the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund should consider whether substantial interference with the committee's work had occurred in cases of unauthorised disclosure of proceedings or documents, this response was agreed by the committee at a private meeting on Monday, 17 October 1997. Recently, there have been apparent disclosures of information relating the committee's inquiry into the Native Title Amendment Bi111997 and the associated 10th report without authorisation by the committee. In summary, these are as follows: (1) The apparent press boxing or passing to journalists of some or all of the contents of the minority report at about 10 a.m. on Monday, 27 October. Individual memberssenators Abetz and Ferris and Entsch-of the committee have had this confirmed to them by journalists. (2) The apparent disclosure of some or all of the contents of the minority report at a media conference held by Senator Bolkus and Mr Melham, which was broadcast live on channel 12 within Parliament House at 4 p.m. on October 27. (3) The disclosure of some of the contents of the minority report in the Financial Review on 25 October in a report entitled 'Wik accord signals Senate impasse' on page 4, and in the Canberra Times on 27 October in a report entitled 'Wik law to halt work worth millions: report' on page 2. (4) The apparent disclosure to Ms Margo Kingston of the Sydney Morning Herald and other journalists of correspondence to the committee from the Kimberley Language Resource Centre on 13 October and from Mr Peter Yu on 24 October and the replies from the committee secretary to both on 27 October, as advised to the committee by the chair. (5) The apparent disclosure to Ms Margo Kingston of the Sydney Morning Herald and to other journalists of the first draft of the chair's report on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, as advised to the committee by the chair. (6) The disclosure at page 21 of the minority report on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 of the voting on the committee decision in relation to the ALRC, which took place at a private meeting. The committee believes that the disclosures referred to in items (1) to (3) above, both separately and taken together, constitute a substantial interference with its work because they provide the basis upon which a totally one-sided view of it activities is presented to to the public. Such disclosures give an unfair and unconscionable advantage to those members of the committee who provide these materials before they are agreed to be published. It denies the recipients of the selected information the opportunity to assist the whole of the committee's deliberations in context. Therefore, there tends to be biased reporting of the operations of the committee being presented to the public. The committee believes that the disclosures have certainly damaged the committee arid have made it much less likely that our work can be completed in a cooperative atmosphere. This has exacerbated the partisan atmosphere that has unfortunately entered recent deliberations and it has diminished the prospects of building mutual trust and respect between committee members. The disclosures referred to in item (4) have allowed the media to suggest that the committee is trying to suppress evidence provided to it by the Aboriginal people. This in turn has the potential to create an atmosphere of hostility towards the committee by nonEnglish speaking Aboriginal people. Given the nature of the committee's statutory duties, any perception in the Aboriginal community that the committee does not deal fairly with the evidence clearly constitutes a substantial interference with its work. In circumstances where the committee was not provided with advance notice of the giving of evidence in languages other than English, apart from four cases, no translations were offered on the day and, therefore, no questions could be asked. Hansard does not provide a translation service to committees. The committee dealt with the request in a timely fashion and has sought further clarification and advice. The disclosures referred to in item (5) constitute a substantial interference with the committee's work because it exposes the internal working and preliminary thinking of the committee to public comment and pressure in inappropriate ways. It undermines the confidence that private deliberations will remain confidential. This severely impairs the workings of the committee, especially in its private deliberations. Because the Financial Review, the Canberra Times and the Sydney Morning Herald had already run articles, the value of the committee's report had been downgraded and, consequently, the committee's report was not given the prominence in those papers which the committee might otherwise have expected. There is also the concern that the inability to prevent these disclosures or to take action against the people who have so damaged the committee may spill over and affect the work of other committees. The disclosure of the matter referred to in item (6) also constitutes substantial interference in that it purports to present a private deliberation of the committee into the public domain without the committee authorising such disclosure or explaining the circumstances surrounding the particular resolution. This has done damage to the reputation of the committee. Any recurrence will lead to the committee system needing a Hansard for its private proceedings so that all considerations taken into account in supporting or defeating a motion can be properly weighed up. Finally, the committee believes that the accumulative effect of these apparent unauthorised disclosures constitutes a substantial and serious interference with the work of the committee in that it creates a perception that the committee cannot maintain confidentiality and is unable to appropriately conduct its affairs, particularly in relation to sensitive issues such as the matters dealt with in this inquiry. The committee accordingly considers that a prima facie case of substantial interference has been established and requests that a motion to refer this matter be accorded precedence. I have other documents here which I would also like to present as evidence in this matter.",34
165,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! As is the custom in these circumstances, I give the honourable member for Banks an opportunity to respond. But I do encourage him to make his comments brief because I can anticipate that I will take the matter on notice.",35
166,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"I do seek your indulgence on the same matter and I also seek to put a number of questions to you in relation to the matter. The member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) raises a number of matters of some consequence and it is vital for you, Mr Speaker, to be assured that appropriate and proper procedure has been followed before making any decision. The procedural matters I would request you consider before proceeding with the substantive matter are as follows: (1) Were all meetings to consider the matter validly constituted under the standing orders practice and convention? In particular, I am concerned about the validity of a purported meeting that took place on Monday, 27 October 1997 at about 5 p.m. Mr Speaker, I hand up to you a copy of a note.dated 28 October 1997 in relation to that meeting, together with a copy of a faxed notice of that meeting. I have received permission of the author of the note to release it. Mr Speaker, in short, that note reveals that a ring around of members was made, commencing at 4.52 p.m. and completing at 4.58 p.m., for a 5 p.m. meeting. Mr Dondas was not phoned at that time. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order is this: in recent times there was a matter of privilege before the chair and one of my ministerial colleagues sought indulgence to place matters before the chair that related specifically to the allegations of breach of privilege. It does appear from what the member for Banks has so far said that he is raising other matters relating to the conduct of this particular committee. The conduct of the committee is not the issue before you, Mr Speaker. The issue is whether or not there has been a breach of privilege by the release of information prior to the publication of the report. If he has problems about how the committee operated, there are other forms by which that can be progressed, but it is not appropriate for him to try to set up a smokescreen tions about the committee. He should be required to observe the spirit of the indulgence that you have given him.",35
167,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"As I indicated to the honourable member for Banks as he rose, I wish him to address his points very quickly and succinctly, which I am sure he is endeavouring to do. I will allow the honourable member to continue, taking due heed of my words.",36
168,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I hand to you a copy of the note, together with a faxed copy. My questions are: (a) What constitutes valid notice? What constitutes adequate notice? (b) Were the quorum requirements met and what evidence can be provided to demonstrate that they were met? (c) Were motions validly determined and what evidence is available to the House that this so? (2) Has it been established that those who took part in proceedings of any meetings were not advised in relation to placing matters before any meetings or making purported decisions? Should all members who have an interest in the matter disqualify themselves from decisions on the matter? Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Now what he is attempting to do is impugn the circumstances, motives or otherwise of other members of the committee under the guise of asking questions. Mr Speaker, quite frankly, it is quite outrageous for this member to do so. It is giving him a very generous indulgence to place matters before you that go to the facts so that you can given him. make a decision. He is not doing that. You know that; I know that. What he is doing is making allegations unrelated to the matter before the chair. That is quite wrong and quite beyond the precedence of recent times and should not be allowed.",36
169,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"This is a very serious and complex issue which I will be most anxious to finalise as quickly as I can. The honourable member for Banks has been encouraged to address the points that he wants to raise, quickly and succinctly. I urge him to conclude of other allegahis remarks quickly.",36
170,Mr MEL HAM,PRIVILEGE,"In particular, should members or senators against whom allegations are made vote at such meetings and should members or senators who have demonstrated bias participate and vote in such meetings? I hand up to you a press release dated 27 October, together with a copy of an adjournment speech dated Monday, 27 October 1997. Is it appropriate that specific allegations",36
171,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Keep your comments germane to the points raised by the member for Leichhardt.,36
172,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"Thank you. Is it appropriate that specific allegations into the conduct of any member and any evidence relied upon be given to the member and, if so, should those allegations and evidence be made known in advanceMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of is order. My point of order is that you gave indulgence to this member in respect of the privilege matter before you. This has nothing to do with the privilege matter. Under the guise of questions, this is an attack on another member of the committee-an attack which this member has already run publicly. He has grossly abused the indulgence you have given him. It is a breach of all precedence of this place. He is not entitled to make allegations against other members unless he follows the proper forms of the House. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to withdraw this indulgence. If he is bona fide wishing to put matters to you, he should write to you. This member is clearly breaching the trust that you have placed in him to observe the indulgence that you have",36
173,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Whilst I have listened very carefully to what the minister has said, I reiterate I would want the honourable member for Banks to very quickly conclude his comments so that I can take this very complex issue on notice and, as I said earlier, report to the House at the earliest opportunity. There will be ample opportunity for you to address me in the privacy of my chambers as appropriate.",36
174,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,I appreciate that. The member for Leichhardt has asked for precedence to be given to a motion. The points I raise go directly to the point as to whether this meeting has been properly constituted before precedence should be given.,37
175,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Move on quickly.,37
176,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"Should members be given adequate time and opportunity to respond to such allegations and evidence and, if so, what constitutes adequate time and opportunity? (4) What, if anything, is required from a committee to demonstrate to you that it has given proper consideration concerning any alleged action it says has constituted real and further. substantial interference to the committee's work? (5) What is required from the committee to demonstrate that it has properly and validly considered such an allegation and properly and validly passed such a resolution? A meeting of the committee was initially called for 5.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 October 1997. At that time. I was involved in the committee stage debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 in the House of Representatives. Fortunately, that meeting was subsequently cancelled. A meeting of the committee was called for 11 a.m. on Monday, 17 November 1997, at a time when the Labor Party shadow cabinet holds its regular meeting. Is it appropriate that meetings are called at a time when it is known that members of the committee about whom allegations will be made will be unable to attend? Finally, Mr Speaker, I assure you the full committee of which the member is the chair is far from unanimous on this matter and it would not be appropriate to come to any decision unless and until such answers to the questions I have posed are provided.",37
177,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourable member for Banks. As I intimated earlier, I will take the whole issue on notice and make the necessary analysis and evaluation and report back to the House at a later date. Mr Reith-On indulgence, Mr Speaker: I ask of you that we have a clearer set of guidelines as to what matters can be placed before the chair after a request has been sought for precedence to be given to a motion. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that what we have just had from the member for Banks is a gross abuse of the forms of this House. I ask that, given the matter has arisen, further consideration be given to it.",37
178,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the Leader of the House. I will take due cognisance of the points you have raised and report back happily to the House at a later date. Mr Crean-On the same point, Mr Speaker",37
179,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I have answered the point; I do not think we need to continue any Mr Crean-It rings hollow from the person,37
180,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Resume your seat. Mr Crean interjecting,37
181,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Resume your seat! Mr Crean interjecting,37

183,Mr SPEAKER,TRAVELLING ALLOWANCE,"I present a progress report from KPMG, the Department of House Representatives' internal auditor, on their audit of members' travelling allowance for 1995-96. The progress report relates to the 1995-96 period of the 1995-97 audit. It describes the methodology used in the data matching and reports on preliminary findings to date. There were 9,357 individual travel allowance claims matched against the then Department of Administrative Services and other travel records. As of today, 9,339 claims or 99.8 per cent have been reconciled, leaving 18 remaining. Of these 18 claims, 14 were not able to be reconciled because information was not available from former members, and KPMG is continuing the reconciliation process for the remaining four. As a result of the audit checking process, it is currently anticipated that net repayments to the department will total around $11,670. This amount represents 0.8 per cent of expenditure on travel allowance by the Department of the House of Representatives for 1995-96. The overall outcome of the audit to date is, in my view, very positive both for members and for the Department of the House of Representatives' administration.",37
184,Mr MARTIN,TRAVELLING ALLOWANCE,"Cunningham) (4.04 p.m.)Mr Speaker, as you have indicated, this is a report which you have tabled today which is looking at part of the entire audit process. I wonder whether you are in a position to advise the House as to when the second part of that audit process is likely to be completed and when KPMG will be able to furnish to all members of this place hopefully a similar sort of report to the one that you have just tabled now.",38
185,Mr SPEAKER,TRAVELLING ALLOWANCE,I thank the honourable member for Cunningham. I know that the audit is continuing. The indications that I have had to date are that the report will be finalised in the early part of 1998.

189,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I am pleased to table the government's response to the Simons committee's review of Australia's overseas aid program. In doing this I am outlining future directions for Australia's overseas aid and fulfilling my requirement to make an annual report to parliament on the aid program. Mass poverty is the single most important economic and social issue on our planet today. Some 1.3 billion people, nearly a quarter of the world's population, continue to live in extreme poverty, trying to survive on less than $1 a day. Over half of these poor are in the Asia-Pacific. Even in countries which have been developing rapidly, the vast majority of people are incomparably worse off than ourselves. The average income of people living in Indonesia is a mere six per cent of that in Australia, people in China earn only three per cent of what we do. The enduring challenge for most of these countries is to provide their people with such basics as food, clean water and education for their children. Meeting this challenge has proven to' be no easy task. If there were any doubts about the fragility of the development process and the need for Australia to provide effective assistance, these would have been dispelled over the past two months. Recent events such as the severe drought in Papua New Guinea, forest fires in Indonesia and the South-East Asian currency realignments bring home the diverse and urgent problems faced by our nearest neighbours. On my most recent visit to Papua New Guinea, earlier this month, I saw at first hand the devastating effects of the worse drought in perhaps 100 years. Expert assessmentsfunded by Australia's aid program-show that as many as half a million people, in a population of only four million, are affected. With my colleagues, the Minister for Defence, Mr MCLachlan, and my parliamentary secretary, Kathy Sullivan, I flew by RAAF Caribou to Pumani in Milne Bay Province. We wanted to see for ourselves the work funded by our aid program. Stowed in the aircraft were 150 sacks of rice. When we set down, the plight of the people of Papua New Guinea was clear. These people had not seen rain in many months. There was no fruit on the trees. Vines were brown and withered. The soil had turned to dust. Water supplies were a long distance from homes, and were polluted. Children had the distended bellies we know is a sign of malnutrition. Australia has reacted rapidly and generously to the prospect of this human suffering on our doorstep. Ten Australian Defence Force aircraft are now ferrying essential foods into the most inaccessible areas of Papua New Guinea to feed the worse affected people. Several Australian NGOs are also assisting with drought relief. Both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and I have reassured the government and the people of Papua New Guinea that Australia will stand by them in their hour of need. If the rains fail, and the next growing season is lost, that need will be immense. The Australian aid program has played a vital role in nearly every major humanitarian emergency in the world over the last 30 years. But by far the greatest focus of our aid efforts has been on the basic building blocks of sustainable development. Since the establishment of the Colombo Plan in the early 1950s, our aid program has touched the lives of millions of people in developing countries, many of whom are our immediate neighbours. This is a record of which Australia can be proud. It is a record I am committed to continuing. For some time. I have been concerned that the aid program has been in danger of losing focus on its core developmental role. For this reason, an independent review of Australia's aid program was foreshadowed in our pre-election platform, known as A Confident Australia-and in June last year I instituted such a review. The review committee, headed by Paul Simons and including Gaye Hart and Cliff Walsh, all of whom are in the House today, produced an excellent report. This report, and the public comments on its recommendations, have played a key role in determining the future directions of Australia's aid program. Objective of the Aid Program The Simons committee confirmed my concern that the aid program had become burdened by a range of competing interests. A clear development objective for the aid program is needed. The aid program cannot and should not be a vehicle for other purposes, such as short-term commercial goals. The Government has determined that the objective of the Australian overseas aid program will be 'to advance Australia's national interest by assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development'. This objective is consistent with the course set in the government's white paper on foreign and trade policy. I know that some people in the community think that there is a choice between dealing with problems at home or providing assistance overseas. This is a misunderstanding and it is self-defeating. The promotion of sustainable development overseas and the pursuit of Australia's long-term national interest are inextricably linked. Those who say Australia should not have an overseas aid program are nothing more than political opportunists whose world view extends no further than their front gate. Let remember, it was the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) who called for Australia to disband its aid program and then almost immediately after called for increased support for the people of North Korea. She cannot have it both ways. The fact is the provision of welltargeted aid gives Australia another strong means of playing a leading role in our developing region. Economic growth and rising incomes in developing countries foster stability and expand trade and investment opportunities for Australia. The aid program generates considerable goodwill in the region and provides an important foundation for broader bilateral relations. The aid program is an important instrument for addressing the non-military threats to Australian security. The effects of poverty extend beyond national boundaries. Pandemics, illegal migration, refugee flows, global environment problems, narcotics and transnational crime are often directly related to poverty. Our aid program, by promoting human rights and addressing the needs of the world's most disadvantaged, is a clear statement of Australian values. I have great faith in the generosity of Australians and our commitment to giving others much worse off than ourselves a fair go. We are a country founded on equality and opportunity; we are strengthened by our cldtural diversity. These principles extend beyond our shores and will be clearly reflected in our aid program. Principles of Our Aid Program In addition to the objective, six key principles will underpin Australia's aid program. First, our aid will be focused on partnerships. Our program will be determined and implemented in partnership with developing countries. This will guarantee that it remains focused on meeting their priority needs. Second, we will be responsive to urgent needs and development trends. Our aid program will provide rapid relief to victims of natural disasters and emergencies and take account of changing pressures in developing countries. Third, our aid will provide practical assistus ance. It will be realistic in assessing what can and cannot be achieved and will concentrate on practical efforts that can alleviate poverty and promote sustainable development. Fourth, there will be greater targeting. Australia's aid program cannot afford to be all things to all people-greater definition and targeting is essential. Clear priorities have been identified, and our efforts will be assessed against these priorities. Fifth, our aid program will remain identifiably Australian-it is a reflection of Australian values and is a projection of these values abroad. Finally, the program will be outward looking. It will be open to new ideas and approaches. It will seek to draw on the best ideas in Australia and overseas. Priorities for Australia's Aid Each one of these principles is designed to bring about a more relevant, higher quality aid program. Using the principlesÂ· and new objective as a guide, I have developed a set of core priorities for Australia's aid program. Partnerships with Developing Countries Our partnerships with developing countries form the backbone of Australia's aid program. Detailed country strategies will be prepared for all major programs. These strategies will detail how our aid will alleviate poverty and address sustainable development in each country. Efforts will focus on promoting economic growth, investing in human capital and protecting the most vulnerable groups in society. Sectoral Priorities Our aid will concentrate on five key sectors-health, education, infrastructure, rural development and governance-which have been identified as crucial for sustainable development. They are also sectors in which Australia is well placed to assist. Australia's aid program has been operating effectively in four of the five sectors for many years. We will continue to ensure that our assistance is well targeted and effective. Governance will be a new focus for the aid program. Effective governance means competent management of a country's resources in a manner that is open, transparent, accountable, equitable and responsive to people's needs. We will have a particular focus on ensuring that sound fiscal monetary and trade policies are instituted to create an environment for private sector development. I have asked AusAID to develop a policy paper on promoting private sector development through our aid program. We will also undertake practical activities to promote civil and political rights in developing countries. Economies will not achieve their potential unless government is transparent, legal systems are fair and information flows freely. Cross-cutting Issues Australia's aid program will place a strong emphasis on ensuring that men and women have equal access to resources and opportunities. Women's needs and perspectives will be considered in the planning and delivery of all Australian aid activities. The aid program will also ensure that the possible impact on the environment is considered in the design and implementation of all projects. We will also playa role in addressing global environment issues such as climate change and biodiversity, which have strong links to the alleviation of poverty. Geographic Focus Australia's aid program will continue to concentrate on the Asia-Pacific region. Papua New Guinea, the Pacific and east Asia will all be high priorities for Australian assistance. Australia will also continue to concentrate selectively on development needs in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In order for the program to maximise its impact, Australian aid dollars will have a focus on the poorest regions in the countries of the Asia Pacific, for example in eastern Indonesia and the southern Philippines. Australia will also respond flexibly to humanitarian and emergency relief situations-wherever they arise. International and Community Partners While programs delivered directly from Australia to partner countries will remain the focus of Australia's aid program, we will also playa key role in fostering links with Australian community organisations and be involved in multilateral efforts to tackle poverty. Nongovernment organisations and multilateral institutions play a vital role in development. They complement Australia's bilateral aid efforts by extending the reach and efficiency of the program. They will continue to receive significant support. However, consistent with a more targeted aid program, the government is taking a more strategic approach to their funding. Future support for multilateral agencies will take account of the extent to which each agency's mandate contributes to the meeting of Australia's aid objective and of the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency. NGOs will be expected to demonstrate tangible community support for their development activities. The government now requires NGOs seeking funding from AusAID to have a recognised development expenditure of at least $30,000 annually. This is part of a rigorous accreditation process to ensure government funds are channelled through NGOs that have substantial community support and are of sufficient size and professionalism to be able to deliver aid programs overseas. The appropriateness of the $30,000 threshold will be kept under review, in consultation with the NGO community. Grants and Loans The Australian aid program currently provides bilateral assistance only in the form of grants, regardless of the country, sector and project involved. Grants are not the only way to deliver aid. I believe that, if introduced, right sort of soft loans would be a useful instrument for aid delivery. Such loans should not be an imitation of Labor's discredited DIFF scheme, which the Simons committee considered flawed as both aid and industry assistance. I notice that even the Labor Party, which made such a fuss at the time of its abolition, has now decided that a DIFF-style scheme should not be part of the aid program. I congratulate the Labor Party on seeing some sense. Loans should be driven by recipient needs rather than Australian industry wishes. They should be integrated with our bilateral aid efforts, not run as a separate scheme. They should require competitive tendering, not be driven by individual company proposals. The loan projects should also be designed, monitored and evaluated to ensure development quality. Any decision to introduce a loan scheme would, however, have significant funding implications. While recognising their advantages, soft loans should not squeeze out other high-priority aid activities. Consequently, introducing soft loans into the program will depend on future aid budget outcomes. Refocusing Aid Management A permanent advisory committee will be established shortly to advise me on aid and development issues. Such a committee will enable me to hear directly from the broader community about Australia's aid efforts. AusAID is undertaking a major review of its operations and structures. Significant reforms will be introduced shortly, which focus on improving aid quality. Australian Identity Australia's aid program must be identifiably Australian. The simplest and most effective method of guaranteeing this is to use Australians in the delivery of the aid program. Approximately one-third of Australia's aid program is currently tied to Australian goods and services. Nevertheless, around three-quarters of the total aid program is in fact spent on Australian goods and services. While we will make some minor adjustments to the current tying arrangements to increase the the quality of the aid program, it is essential that it remain identifiably Australian. Conclusion The volume of aid spending will always be a difficult issue. Australia provides significant amounts of overseas aid, consistently spending more than the international donor average. Future levels of aid funding, like all aspects of government expenditure, will be subject to budget considerations. We will continue to provide support for the UN's 0.7 per cent ODA-GNP target and we will endeavour to maintain our aid at the highest level, consistent with the needs of partner countries and our own economic circumstances and capacity to assist. And while there will always be debates over the size of the aid program, it is important that we make the most of the aid dollar. With over $1.4 billion invested annually in Australia's aid efforts, the Australian community and our developing country partners have the right to demand excellence in our aid program. I believe that Australians can be proud of our development efforts. The new principles and priorities outlined today will result in a better-targeted and focused aid program and a more productive world around us. In conclusion, I would like to add a word of thanks to the three members of the Simons committee-Paul Simons, the chairman, and Gaye Hart and Professor Cliff Walsh-for the outstanding work they did. They put a vast amount of time into this exercise. I know they found it invigorating and intellectually fascibasic nating, but there are not all that many Australians who would be prepared to put as much time and effort voluntarily into such an exercise. I speak on behalf not just of myself but of the Australian government and probably on behalf of the whole Australian parliament in thanking them for the excellent job they did. I present the following papers: Australia's Development Cooperation Program7th annual report; Better Aid for a Better Future-Ministerial Statement, J8 November J997.",39
190,Mr BRERETON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak on Australia's overseas aid program. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has just tabled the government's response to the Simon's committee report to review Australia's overseas aid program, commissioned in May last year and presented to the foreign minister 12 months later. Today we have heard the government's response. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has rightly identified the existence of mass poverty as single most important economic and social issue on our planet today. Eliminating the disparities between the world's rich and poor is one of the critical international challenges of our time. There is no doubt that the overall success of development in recent decades has been very significant. Many more people live longer, fewer mothers die in childbirth and fewer infants die from preventable diseases, but the numbers living in poverty have continued to grow. Too many people-indeed 1.3 billion too many as the minister has notedlive in extreme poverty, denied their basic rights to health, decent shelter, clean water supplies, sanitation and education. Global inequality has increased. It is a salutary fact that the poorest fifth of the world's population have seen their share of global income fall to less than two per cent while the richest fifth, by contrast, have seen their share rise to 85 per cent. Such inequality is grotesque when one considers the fact that the combined net income of the seven richest individuals in theÂ· world would easily cover the estimated $80 billion cost of achieving social services for everyone currently living in absolute poverty and would get them out of income poverty. Eliminating poverty is affordable and achievable. The major UN conferences of recent years have drawn together a broad framework for cooperation that should deliver sustained progress, but to succeed we clearly need to mobilise greater political will across the international community. Both altruism and self-interest require that Australia embrace its responsibility to actively assist the economic and social advancement of people in developing countries, especially the poorest countries and communities. In the first instance, the provision of development assistance by countries such as Australia does reflect a basic and fundamental obligation-an obligation deeply embedded in our core national values. It is our duty to care about other people, in particular those less well off than ourselves. We have a moral duty to reach out to the poor and the needy. We also owe it to our children and our grandchildren to address these issues as a the matter of urgency. If we do not do so, there is a real danger that, by the middle of the next century, the world may simply not be sustainable. It could certainly be dangerously unstable. Global poverty is unquestionably a leading source of international insecurity with high levels of poverty linked to political and economic instability, human rights abuses, unrest and war, uncontrolled migration and population growth, and environmental degradation. If we are to pass on a safe world to the next generation, we must eradicate these massive levels of poverty from the world. This is a problem that Australia cannot ignore and cannot leave to others. Five hundred million of the world's 800 million most needy people live in the Asia-Pacific region: that is, they live in our region. The problem of global poverty and injustice is right here on Australia's doorstep and we cannot shirk this responsibility. When the foreign minister announced the establishment of the review headed by Mr Paul Simons, he rightly said that Australia has an overseas aid program of which all Australians can be proud. In his press release on 28 May last year, he put the following on the record: Australia has an aid program it can be proud of. Millions of people around the world are now better off thanks to the help they've received from Australia. Our aid program, administered by AusAID and delivered by Australian companies, individuals, non-government organisations and academic institutions is highly effective. Eighteen months on, I think it is worth noting the very large degree of continuity in approach manifested both in the Simons committee report and in the government's broad acceptance of its recommendations today. The introduction to the report states: We do not advocate revolutionary change. The basic arrangement of the aid program is sound. The design and management of the program should continue to be the responsibility of a single, independent agency. The countries of East Asia and the Pacific should continue to be the primary Similarly, the minister's statement today is not a statement signalling dramatic change. It is essentially a further step in the ongoing evolution of our overseas aid program-a program which enjoys strong bipartisan support. For our part, the Labor opposition welcomed the establishment of the Simons review. In ever changing international circumstances, the continued review of Australia's overseas aid program is critically important for maximising its effectiveness and for making sure that we maintain its primary focus of contributing to lasting poverty reduction while advancing Australia's national interests. Although many individual Australian aid programs and projects have been subject to internal and external review down through the years, it has been some years since the Jackson report on Australia's overseas aid program. As a consequence, I had no hesitation in welcoming the Simons review as anÂ· appropriate and timely initiative in last year's International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. I should also acknowledge today that the Simons report and many submissions by NGOs to the review committee and to the government in response to the report itself have made very useful contributions to the Labor Party's review of our own approach to overseas aid issues in the run-up to our next national conference in the coming January. Against that background, I would like to take this opportunity to comment briefly on some of the major recommendations of the Simons report and to make some remarks about our overall approach to these vital issues. The primary recommendation of the Simons report is that there should be one clear, development focused objective for Australia's overseas aid program. The government have accepted this recommendation and determined that the objective of the aid program will be to: ... advance Australia's national interest by assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and to achieve sustainable development. The minister has, from time to time, sought to make something of a political point by focus. suggesting that our overseas aid program has come to be characterised by a confusion of goals and objectives under the former Labor government. He can make that point, as he has, when he wishes, but it is not one that we accept. For my part today, I would like to welcome, on a bipartisan basis, the adoption of a single, development focused objective as being very positive indeed. Such an objective is fully consistent with and supportive of Australia's long-term security and economic interest. While the provision of development assistance may also support immediate foreign policy objectives, the pursuit of short-term diplomatic and trade interests can easily undermine the effectiveness of our aid program and should not determine development assistance priorities. The challenge for the government will now be to give practical effect to this new objective and to maintain that focus amidst the inevitable diplomatic and economic pressure on our overseas aid program. To do that will require real commitment, and the opposition will keep a close watch on the government's performance. In the course of his statement today, the minister has also set out a number of key principles to underpin Australia's aid programs, primarily through a by no means exclusive concentration on development assistance activities in the Asia-Pacific. For the record, I would like to take this opportunidations ty to spell out some of the elements of Labor's approach, as recently approved by the national security and trade policy committee, for consideration by our forthcoming national conference. Australia's overseas aid program should, in cooperative partnership with developing countries and peoples, assist in building foundations for broadly based, equitably distributed and sustainable economic growth. We should encourage responsible national economic policies, including support for the development of efficient, accountable and fair government administration. Our aid program should give priority to breaking down barriers to the participation by the poor in economic and social development, and especially support activities which enable women to contribute and benefit from development. We should also seek to increase the productivity of the poor by facilitating access by them to productive assets and credit, and access to supporting activities including health care, education and training, and appropriate agricultural technology. In broad terms, these are the goals which find expression in the Simons report. In a number of respects, however, the report and the government's response to it fall short of what we might have hoped for. One of these is in the issue of human rights. Aid to reduce poverty must be based on fundamental human rights principles, including the right to development opment. The Simons report is unquestionably weak in the human rights area. It speaks loosely of support for good governance and there is clearly scope to see a much greater recognition of the international human rights framework as a framework for aid policy programs. It is significant that the Simons report does not have a single recommendation on human rights, and the government's response is little better. For our. part, Labor is determined to give high priority to support for and enhancement of the full range of human rights for people in developing countries. To do so is a central and integrating element of our approach to overseas aid. In the time available, and I accept that it is brief, I would like to take up two recommenin the Simons report which have not been accepted by the government. The first of these relates to the issue of tied aid. At present, Australia requires approximately 44.4 per cent of our aid to. be used to buy Australian goods and services. That is twice the OECD average of 22.2 per cent. There is certainly a case, from a development point of view, that whatever goods and services can be sourced at reasonable prices in a developing country should be. That way, multiplier effects of aid within the country are greater, and skills and capabilities are developed. At the same time there is good reason, in terms of accountability, economic interest and national profile, for Australia's aid programs to utilise Australian suppliers. This is clearly a difficult issue. I am aware of the considerable support within theNGOs for the report's recommendations that AusAID move towards greater untying of the aid program and that it untie aid totally for the poorest countries, particularly untying bilateral aid programs elsewhere. Here the government has accepted the Simons recommendations only in part, encouraging a greater participation of recipient country personnel in the delivery of aid while continuing to maintain a strong Australian identity for our aid program. The Labor opposition concurs with this broad approach. The final issue I want to take up is that of the overall level of Australia's overseas develassistance. As the minister has noted, the volume of aid spending will always be a difficult issue. The opposition welcomes the government's expressed commitment to support the United Nations 0.7 per cent ODA-GNP ratio target. As the Simons report makes clear, such a commitment has little credibility unless a realistic framework is set for Australia to work towards that ultimate goal. As we stand, thanks to the last two years of real budget cuts, Australia's level of overseas development assistance is at an all-time low at 0.27 per cent of GNP. Australia's aid level now rates 13th out of 21 OECD countries-a drop from ninth in the previous year. In that context, it is no surprise that the government has declined to set any interim target whatsoever. Ultimately, however, overseas aid is about practical outcomes and the allocation of real resources. Commissioning reports and reviews is no substitute for real political commitment to deliver the goods and to be held accountable for one's performance. As I said earlier in my remarks, we clearly need to mobilise greater political will across the international community if the world is to successfully meet the challenge of global poverty. For our part, I anticipate that at our national conference next January Labor will undertake to ensure that Australia's overseas aid as a percentage of GNP is not further reduced and will commit us to working towards an interim development assistance target of 0.4 per cent of GNP by the year 2005. This is, I believe, a realistic and achievable goal. With an overseas aid level of 0.2 per cent, Australia not merely failing to give leadership on this vital global issue, we are dragging the chain. In conclusion, I note that the title of the minister's speech today was Better Aid for a Better Future. What he did not say was that the Howard government is still thinking of doing less with less overseas aid. In doing so, the government continues to fail in its responsibilities, and it sells Australia's national interests short. Motion (by Mrs Sullivan) proposed: That the House take note of the papers. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned. NA Greenhouse Gases",43
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Brand (Mr Beazley) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The reduction by the government of industry, scientific and environmental programs supportive of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the failure to develop a credible international negotiating position for Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",46
192,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Th- Prime Minister (Mr Howard) at CHOGM proclaimed what he called 'differentiation in our time'. It is a peculiarly apposite reference, for all its connotations of ignorance, naivety and, most importantly, impending doom. We have to have a far more ambitious point of reference to deal with this problem than that of Neville Chamberlain in 1938. As with so much else, this government is incapable of offering the leadership to provide one. Greenhouse is a defining challenge for political leadership. It does not respect national borders, it resists easy solutions and it requires energy, unity, purpose and courage. With all the information that is available to . is our Prime' Minister and with his capacity to analyse the effects that this could conceivably have on the Australian economy, on the Australian environment and on our social life, his contribution to this over the last 18 months has been not only to preside over the removal of very substantial programs that were in place to deal with greenhouse gas emission problems in this country which were to make a contribution to the international reduction of greenhouse gas emissions but also to eliminate $100 million of direct expenditure and another $300 million of expenditure that related to the environment. My colleague, our spokesman on the environment, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) will deal with details of all of this a bit later. The Prime Minister's contribution was to eliminate all of that. He then wandersÂ· around the globe like Orphan Annie, desperateiy trying to find somebody who will agree that Australia should not be flogged. He stands up and says that in this process he is defending the Australian national interest. Competence in diplomacy is what defends the Australian national interest, and we have not had that from the Prime Minister. Instead, when anybody moves away from a negotiatbutes. ing position which they have put down, we have these pathetic claims that other they were influenced by Australia to that position, that they arrived at that concluthe sion because at last they got the idea that Australia should be left alone in these proand cesses. The obvious point to make is this: there is a whole range of people out there in the international community taking different negotiating positions to Kyoto, expressing those positions vehemently and being ready at the end of the day to compromise them in relation to targets, the level of mandatory warming. application and what will be .acceptable practices in the international community to meet a set of targets, if they are set. The problem with all of the Prime Miniscountry ter's approaches is this: everybody else operating on the assumption that, if not Kyoto then at least at some point subsequent1981 ly, international targets will be met. There will be an international consensus about what ought to be done. The Prime Minister, in the various statements he has been making-and remember that now, 18 months on, we are the only two weeks away from Kyoto-has dealt himself persistently out of any international consensus. He knows that that has potential economic consequences for this country, as evidenced by the fact that there is leaking from the foreign minister's department about defensive positions being prepared by us the WTO to evade the position of mandatory targets produce mandatory sanctions?' As far as that is concerned, the oppoexample sition shares the concern of those bureaucrats that that may well be what eventuates. Underlying all of this is the militant refusal of the Prime Minister to say we have a area problem. It may be said in parentheses and footnotes but never directly. The fundamental issue here is that there is a greenhouse gas . problem. While there are differences among scientists as to what it constitutes, there are no differences among scientists as to whether or not there is one. It is merely gradations now. All scientific opinion of any reliability now assumes that there is a substantial greenhouse problem, to which Australia contriSome 1.4 per cent of greenhouse gas is generated from Australia-by 0.3 per cent of somehow or the world's population. The Prime Minister says that, if we accept sorts of targets the Americans or the Europeans put up, 90,000 jobs will be lost 70c per litre will be added to the cost of our petrol. The Prime Minister has advice but he does not share it with the community. That is one set of his economic statistics. None emerge on what the consequences would be were we to confront over the next 50 years what the scientists, either moderately or in extremity, say would be the effects of global It is not as though we do not have experience of variations in climate in our agricultural industries. It is not as though we in this do not know of the potential damage is of drought and flood. Droughts cost the at Australian economy $3.5 billion between and 1983, and $4 billion between 1992 and 1995. Between 1970 and 1993, floods cost us over $4.7 billion. If there is a set of effects out there that is going to increase the rate of drought and flood over the course of next 50 years, those are figures to conjure with. Where are they in the estimates? If the scientists are right and we face the prospect of substantial increases in sea levels, what are we, as a nation that lives largely on the coast, going to experience in damage? Where are the figures? There ought to be at estimates available to the government on 'should these matters. Where are they? The Prime Minister likes to mention as an Kwinana, a potentially disbenefited area by any set of targets, in my electorate. In Kwinana, one of the principal issues is gas emissions. Emissions from industry in the is a very substantial worry to the population living there, and featuring in debate is whether or not there ought to be additional industry in Kwinana or whether it should be located elsewhere because Kwinana is already taking its fair share. That is an issue in Kwinana, I do agree. Also in my constituency-I will take it as an example because I happen to have a coastal constituency-are the citizens in Rockingham and the citizens in Mandurah. If there is a oneto two-metre lift in sea levels over the next 30 to 40 years, what will the consequence be? Of course, the consequence to the people would be quite severe. The problem with this government is that it is dealing itself out of an international consensus. In doing so, it is dealing itself out of a capacity to play a role in determining the way in which targets are calculated and what are acceptable practices of countriesincluding countries that claim a need for differentiation in their experience-to get themselves into a position where they are doing things that are acceptable to the international community for meeting the targets which may be set with various levels of mandatory underpinning to them. Out there is a set of propositions with which we must argue. We have the well known position put forward by the Europeans. We do not believe that Australia should support the EU proposal. It is self-serving and it is unfair to us. Bill Clinton has just announced that the United States will sign up to a target of 1990 emission levels by 2008 to 2012. Everyone knows that Kyoto will not produce a consensus less stringent than this one, particularly the other majors-Japan and the European Union-are pushing stricter targets still. Labor believes that Australia should go to Kyoto with a starting negotiating position which accepts an international target, to which we could agree, of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2010. To do this, we need a unique package of measures to suit our unique situation. The opposition has said all along that differentiation is a fair argument for Australia. Similarly, we have said that it cannot be the only argument. Even differentiation cannot stand up if it does not actually have a target to argue for. Why do we need a target? Why do we need to be on board at Kyoto? If we are not on board, we will be able to only watch as an international regime is locked into place which does not reflect our interests. The Minchins of it will benefit those countries which were prepared to play ball and we will have lost out because we were not. What are some of the dimensions that we need? We need-there is no-one else to advocate it-the inclusion of carbon sinks in the global abatement equation. We must have the opportunity to address our target with reafforestation programs-like Labor's one billion trees program-and with programs which can also provide valuable employment, opportunities for our young unemployed, control of soil erosion, and a relief of pressure on our native forests by providing an expanded timber resource stream to ensure continuing opportunity for our forestry and timber industries. Only Australia is going to argue for the concept of a carbon sink. The Europeans could not give a damn. They are not going to do any reafforestation. It is out of the ken of the way in which the Americans see the world. The developing countries are not going to argue too heavily for it, given their propensity to deforest themselves. Therefore, Australia, if we are going to be able to produce an outcome which gets anywhere near any targets which anybody expects of us, will have to put that in the ledger, will have to put that in the pot, will have to come to some as conclusions on that. Are they going to take a damn bit of notice of us if we are not signed up to any particular set of propositions as far as international targets are concerned? There is no use for global agreement-this is another point that we should argue forwhich does not include developing countries. They can be brought in by allowing joint implementation of greenhouse reduction measures in developing countries funded by developed countries, such as Australia, where we can claim recognition against our greenhouse gas reduction targets for undertaking those. measures. We also need credit for our highly efficient production processes, particularly in energy intensive industries, such as aluminium smelting-locating this kind of activity here and using efficient processes rather than offshore and using less efficient processes. We should get credit for the global emissions that we save. There is a lot of interesting international opinion out there about exchange credits. There is a lot of interesting international opinion out there about people who will utilise energy intensive processes efficiently and in an environmentally clean manner. These are tradeable propositions. It is in Australia's interests to argue for international regime which enables joint implementation of greenhouse reduction measures in developing countries, for example, funded by developing countries, which can claim recognition against their greenhouse gas reduction targets for the measures. It is also in our interests that an international regime credits us for our highly efficient processes. But will we get it without these propositions? Will we get that position adopted at Kyoto? Will we get it recognised if we are standing out as Orphan Annie at this particular conference? It would not be Orphan Annie at the conference; it would be Banquo's ghost. We would be Banquo's ghost at the banquet. We would be wandering around the edges of it, asking people to see the Australian chimera and to r-cognise our poverty Â·stricken state and the dreadful position that we find ourselves in. But, by the way, let us make no intellectual contribution,Â· let us make no statements about where we think the global community ought to sign up and what we think the global community ought to accept in meeting those particular targets. This is a very substantial challenge for the government. The government has decided to go there, however, effectively disarmed. It has decided to go there with the great Australian contribution to its own effort: a restoration the $100 million worth of programs cut out, rebadged-restoration perhaps, to some degree, of the $400 million on top of that cut out, rebadged. That will be the government's contribution. The government will demand international respect. With the reputation that we have had for cutting our very good scientific programs, into which a whole lot of other people have intersected over the course of the last few years, other countries have noted the fact that we have disappeared off the board with them. Those who have had us in focus as a result of us making a lot of noise, without much light, over the course of the last 12 months have noted that. These nations are going to be called upon to respect that paltry contribution. They will not. That is all there is to it. Perhaps in recognition of that fact, the an government as it approaches this position is not turning up well armed. It would be unusual for me to say that the Prime Minister turning up would constitute armament at any point, but it might at least indicate some seriousness of intent. What we are going to get is Mr Hill. He is the only person who will be appearing from the government side in these discussions; discussions which the Prime Minister says may produce outcomes devastating to the Australian economy. It was the same sort of speech of the problems that we confront which presaged his non-appearance at New York. He chose Lords as his location instead of New York when this issue was last taken up. We have it again here. We do not know whether Kyoto is going to produce any outcomes. It mayor it may not. There are a lot of people there who are determined to produce those outcomes. What we know is this: if there are any outcomes produced, there has to be an Australian stamp on them. If there is not an Australian stamp on them, this is a country in some considerable degree of trouble. (Time expired)",46
193,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What is alarming about the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is that he has done no homework on this issue whatsoever-none. I could quote chapter and verse the errors in his of speech, but let me start with the premise of his argument. The premise of his argument was that the government has produced no scientific information whatsoever on climate change. This is false. A few weeks ago we published an issues paper Australia and Climate Change Negotiations, which clearly the Leader of the Opposition has neither heard of nor read. The Leader of the Opposition has picked up the alarmist rhetoric that some of the mental groups use in claiming that science shows that by the year 2010 sea levels could rise between one and two metres. If you hold a senior position in government or in opposition, you should mount your argument based on some sort of fact. The simple fact is that the science that has been done internationally on this issue by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows that, unlike the Leader of the Opposition's claim, by the year 2010 sea levels are likely to rise between 15 and 95 centimetres, with an average of 50 centimetres. Where does the Leader of the Opposition get his facts from? He says that we do not produce facts, but there they are on page 24 of the document that we published. It is not right that a major political party should go around arguing a scare campaign on the basis of no facts whatsoever. Where this oneto two-metre figure came from goodness only knows! From the vivid imagination of the Left of the Australian Labor Party. What is also revealing is the ignorance of the Leader of the Opposition, and presumably the opposition as a whole, on the government's position on this issue. I assume that ignorance is borne out of the fact that standing this issue requires doing a certain amount of work-not lounging around in the rooms out the back having cups of coffee and bemoaning being in opposition but sitting down and doing a bit of intellectual work. Not only has the Leader of the Opposition failed to do any intellectual work on this issue; but apparently so have his advisers, his staff and the Labor apparatchiks. The Leader of the Opposition said that the government should look at imaginative ideas such as sinks and tradeable permits. We have not just looked at sinks and tradeable permits; we have been arguing for months in favour of sinks and tradeable permits. It has been in the water. newspapers, it is in published documents; it is readily available information. If you cared about these things, you might ask some questions in question time and find out whether we support sinks and tradeable permits. We have made many speeches and statements and have published a number of documents which environhave plenty to say about that issue. What I think is particularly extraordinary about the Labor Party's position, and what I believe in the long term will do the Labor Party immense damage, is that it has simply snapped out of the air a target for Australia. Its target for Australia is stabilisation between 1990 and 2010. Those of you in the Labor Party might think you can get away with a figure like that, but the problem you have is that you have never bothered to examine the economic costs of such a proposition. Let me ask some questions that in the end you will have to answer. Firstly, what policies are you going to introduce to achieve stabilisation by 201O? Secondly, by how much will you increase fuel excise-70c a litre? Thirdly, how much will the carbon tax be that you will impose? The Labor Party has not done the work. You do not even know what the government's position is. You do not even know the state of the international negotiations on this issue. Why would you bother to examine the economic costs when you cannot even do the basic homework on this issue? Let me tum to the ABARE model. The ABARE model was originally set up under your government. You can discredit people in under- ABARE, you can argue that people in ABARE are apparently not objective, but the fact is that they served you very well and you were very happy with the service they provided until 20 months ago. It was you who began putting together the ABARE model. What ABARE shows-and you will now have to work to explain this to the Australian people-is that your proposal will affect Australia's gross national earnings by the year 2010 by 2V2 per cent. You will reduce Australian production by 1.5 per cent and the' adverse terms of trade impacts could further reduce Australia's welfare by one per cent.",49
194,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The bits that are left above the,50
195,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The opposition spokesman says, 'The bits that are left above the water.' That is the quality of the intellectual argument coming from the Labor Party. It is an utterly disgraceful scare campaign. What is more, it is totally unintellectual and anti-intellectual, and that summarises the state of the Australian Labor Party today. You have read nothing; you have learnt nothing about this issue. Not even your staff understand the issue or have bothered to do any work on the issue. If you are reduced to running around suggesting that Australia is going to disappear under the sea by 2010, then that sums up the Labor Party. The Labor Party has to understand why it is proposing to reduce Australia's gross national expenditure by 2- per cent by the year 2010. You are going to have to explain to the Australian people why you are going to reduce Australia's welfare by as much as the expected benefits of the Uruguay Round. You are going to have to explain to the Australian people why, in net present value terms, the welfare of each Australian under your proposal could fall by around $US6,500. That is what you are going to have to explain to the Australian people. If you wish to attempt to disabuse the ABARE model-the Megabare model-then you are disabusing yourselves because it was originally established under your government, by your government, according to the guidelines laid down by your government. We have done a number of different analyses on what is now the Labor proposition. Another of those analyses shows that, in the energy intensive sector alone, projects valued at around $68 billion would be placed at risk by your proposal. Let us have a look at the regional impact of this. In regional terms, the people whom the Labor Party are going to strike at are the people overwhelmingly represented by the Labor Party. You think you can take your blue-collar workers in safe Labor seats completely for granted. How are you going to explain that the regions of Australia that will be most directly affected by your proposals will be places like the Illawarra and the Hunter in New South Wales, the Bowen Basin and Gladstone in Queensland, Geelong and Latrobe Valley in Victoria, the Iron Triangle in South Australia and, as the Leader of the Opposition himself readily concedes, the Kwinana region in Western Australia. When the electors of Grey in South Australia find out that what the Labor party is planning to do is put people out of work in Grey because of some concoction of a greenhouse policy which is unintellectually based, which is just a populist bunch of sloganeering-nothing more and nothing less-those people will desert the Australian Labor Party in droves. What is the sectoral impact of the proposal the Labor Party is putting forward? Let me tell you-not according to me but according to those officials who loyally served the Labor Party in government and loyally serve the coalition, and they do so with the greatest objectivity. Those officials say that the sectors that would be hardest hit in Australia include the non-ferrous metals industry whose output, it is estimated, will be 50 per cent lower in 2010 than it would otherwise have been. So you are happy to reduce the output of the non-ferrous metal industry sector by 50 per cent. The output of the iron and steel industries, under Labor's proposals, will be an estimated 20 per cent lower by 2010. Labor Party members-not the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who is at the table, not that sort of a member, but members such as the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown)--claim to be the champions of the coal mining industry and of the coal unions.",50
196,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,They are.,51
197,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You say you are. If you are, why is the Australian Labor PartyMr Kerr interjecting",51
198,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You will get your chance to speak and, when you speak, you answer this question: why is the Australian Labor Party putting forward a proposal that would reduce the coal industry in 2010 by 20 per cent below what it would otherwise have been or the oil and gas sectors by between five and 10 per cent? The member opposite can snigger, but he has done no homework on this issue. Even the Leader of the Opposition, a man one would expect to have greater intellectual credibility than the member opposite, has not even heard of a publicly available published document which contains a vast amount of information, including a vast amount of science and economic information. If even the apparatchiks of the Labor Party have not heard of the research, what hope is there for the pathetic member for Denison? Let me say that it comes as a surprise to the coalition that the Australian Labor Party should come up with a proposal such as this when of course in government they never did support these types of propositions. It does come as a surprise that the Labor Party has simply chucked out everything it has ever learnt and has decided just to run on the basis of populist sloganeering. Let us take one final point: the Labor Party says it supports the government's position on differentiation. Well, it sort of supports the government's position, but it says, 'But if differentiation does not get up we will sign up anyway. We don't know what we will sign up to, but we will sign up anyway, no matter what.' What sort of a negotiating position is that: that you would come into the House of Representatives and say that your position is stabilisation, you will support differentiation, but the main thing is not to get offside with the rest of the world; you will sign up no matter what? It is simply oppositionist politics; it is nothing of any intellectual it has precisely no credibility. The simple fact is that the Australian government's position is a strong position based on a hard-headed analysis of our national interest but also based on a commitment to making a contribution to solving the greenhouse problem. We do not go around throwing exaggerated figures at the Australian community, pretending that the sea level is going to rise between one and two metres between now and the year 2010. We do not do that but we accept that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. As a consequence, we are addressing it and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will be making a statement in the next day or two outlining some initiatives that the Australian government is taking. When the European Union allows countries like Portugal to increase its emissions by 40 per cent, Greece by 30 per cent, Spain by 17 per cent, Ireland by 15 per cent and Sweden by five per cent-get the Hansard and then you will be able to look at some of the things that have been going on in this area-when the European Union is out arguing that case and saying that Australia should reduce its emissions to 15 per cent below the level they were in 1990, it is not surprising that Australia takes a very vigorous stand on this issue. We think that the European Union is right in one respect-that there should be equitable burden sharing. The Australian Labor Party thinks that Australia should carry a heavier burden than almost any other country in annex 1. That is what the Labor Party is arguing. There is no evidence, no backup and no research in Labor's position but a slogan. Labor's position is that we should bear a burden greater than almost any other industrialised country in the world. They can stick with that position because our position is that Australia will bear its fair share of the burden. We will do a fair job, but we will not take a disproportionate share of that burden. The Labor Party has now had a shadow cabinet meeting on this issue and has come out with a position. Its position is intellectually incredible. In the end, it will be politically unsaleable. It is childish politicking at its worse.",51
199,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The merit and Howard government speak often about intergenerational equity. They talk about the need to ensure that we do not leave an unsustainable burden on future generations. That is true for all kinds of debt. We must leave our children an environment that will enable continuing economic prosperity for future generations without enormous ramifications to repair our environmental damage or to restore our international reputation. The reality is that greenhouse is an indisputable scientific truth. There may be some people around who still put forward the proposition that there are doubts about the degree to which our future climate will be affected. But there are few, if any, who would join up with those on the fringes of science, for example, who would say that smoking is still good for you. If you look at the CSIRO documentation, it shows that carbon dioxide concentration in ice core samples in Antarctica now goes beyond all levels ever recorded in the period of historic research-over 150,000 years ago-and it is growing exponentially. It is an international problem that requires an intemational response. As President Clinton said of this issue: There is ample evidence that human activities are already disrupting the global climate, and that if we stay on the current course, the average global temperatures may rise 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit during the next century. To put that in some context, the difference in average temperature between the last Ice Age-which was 10,000 to 12,000 years ago-and today, is about 9 degrees Fahrenheit. So we could have two-thirds of that change in 100 years unless we do something. That means being part of an international process. We ourselves will suffer as a country if there is no international consensus. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has set out some of the impacts that will affect us. The IPPC's top range estimate for what is the likely consequence in Australia is a 95-centimetre sea level rise by the year 2100. The likely impact of that, which we have had modelled, would be that the wheat industry alone, which is worth $3.4 billion to the Australian economy in Western Australiathey have already seen average rainfall fall 22 per cent since the 1930s-will be severely hit. Can we afford it? Can we afford the Victorian economy's threats to agriculture and forest production, which is worth $4 billion each year? Could the $1.2 billion Queensland sugar industry afford an increase in water table salinity from higher sea levels? Can the health of Australians and their families afford an increased risk of malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, Ross River fever, encephalitis and gastroenteritis from a warmer climate? In short, doing nothing is not an option. Continual threats to walk away from the process and to set no realistic target for Australian efforts is not acting in good faith. They are only likely to leave Australians isolated internationally and vulnerable domestically. The Kyoto conference is just days away now, but Australia has precious few good faith measures to show in greenhouse abatement and we have no target to announce, even though the whole strategy of differentiation is presumably based on some target somewhere. If the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will not provide leadership, the opposition will. The Australian Labor Party says to the Australian people that we must get realistic about this debate. We saw a report in yesterday'S or today's Financial Review that the Prime Minister's Thursday statement will still not name a target for Kyoto. Australia ought to be going to Kyoto with a position that our starting point for a negotiating position would be one where we would accept an international target with which we could agree of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2010. We have been criticised by people saying, 'How can you do it? Is this responsible?' Of course it is responsible. Just look at electricity generation alone. The New South Wales Sustainable Energy Development Authority has produced estimates of the abatement effects of measures already planned in that state. The measures include co-generation with gas, harvesting methane from coal seams for generation and improved efficiencies in generation technologies. SEDA has shown that companies are returning at least 20 per cent on their investments in implementing such changes, but the abatement potential is even more startling. SEDA estimates that just the current committed and proposed projects are estimated to save around seven million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent in New South Wales alone within the next five years. Extrapolated for the rest of Australia, that figure could be at least 30 million tonnes just on current projects. If you were to try to estimate the figure for potential as well as actual proposed projects all around Australia, you could triple the figure, and that is just from the electricity industry. Look at business efficiency measures and the greenhouse challenge program. Last week we saw some reports claiming that the very large voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by industry would have occurred as part of normal business procedures. That is precisely the point. Greenhouse gas abatement by industry can be both good environmentalism and good economics. When we put the program in place we intended to create a role for government and for leadership to show where you can get good economic and good environmental results together. We were happy to bequeath that idea to the current government, but it must be seized with real energy and vigour and the gains put towards a target. We hear about the costs of innovation, but what about the opportunities? There is room to make substantial improvements in energy efficiency, and it is not restricted to industry. There is a whole range of things in the domestic sector that can be appropriate. Certainly we should be moving to restore the funds that were cut from our research programs. We should be developing, researching and commercialising new energy technologies. We should be improving incentives for the use of less carbon intensive energy sources. We should be developing and implementing comprehensive residential, commercial, industrial and transport energy efficiency standards. We want accelerated reform of energy markets, particularly the gas industry. We want an expansion of consumer education programs, product standards and energy efficiency labelling and an expansion of energy auditing processes. We also want Australia to advocate and have accepted the process of establishing sinks where we can lock together the interests of reafforestation and the need to protect our natural environment with a commitment to a greenhouse gas reduction target. Another interesting option has developed on the international stage. It has been developed by an Australian working at one of the world's most prestigious research institutions-the Brooking Institute-Professor Warwick MCKibbin. Professor MCKibbin proposes the development in each country of a domestic system of tradeable emission credits designed to encourage the most economically efficient developments to meet internationally determined greenhouse reduction targets. The volume of credits issued in each country would be determined initially, and over future years, within each country but would clearly need to be within the parameters set by the international community. If mandatory targets are set at Kyoto, it is important that we have a considered economically credible and environmentally sustainable method of achieving that goal. We are not endorsing every element of the ideas put forward by Professor MCKibbin, but we need to examine ideas of that kind rigorously. We do not want to be put off by the fearmongering and the scare tactics of the government, which throws figures into the air and then accuses us of scaremongering. Taken together, those and other measures of the kind that we had in place when we were in government are a clear indication that we could save hundreds of millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. That is the order of magnitude of the task. There are no exact figures-the government has them-but we know the figure is not tens of millions of tonnes and we know that it is not thousands of millions of tonnes. We need to reduce hundreds of millions of tonnes to reach the stabilisation target of 1990 by 2010. Australia can get to that ballpark. There are innovative measures that can put people to work, beautify our land and reduce the blight of pollution in our cities. I will now come back to where I startedintergenerational equity. What do we bequeath to future generations-and not just the future generations of Australians? Unless the world can come together and find some constructive way to deal with this globally then what the IPCC says will come to pass and our globe will be degraded, our environment compromised and the health and economic benefit of our future generations harmed because of this government's failure. The failure of political leadership of this government will be sheeted home by future generations. This leadership has shown that it is simply not up to it. It is a diminished and dwarfed Australian leadership that cannot command its place on the international stage. The Leader of the Opposition has said where we should begin our negotiation process in Kyoto. It is an honourable position that this opposition is proud to articulate and announce.",52
200,Mr FORREST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It has been fascinating, after four years in opposition and watching the then government, to sit here and see the way the opposition performs now. It is unbelievable hypocrisy and symbolism. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his contribution-and, I have to say, it was a real disappointment because I came down early to listen, in fairness, to if he had something reasonable to saysummed up his contribution with his own words when he said something about making a lot of noise without much weight. It was a real disappointment to have this emotive suggestion from someone with a comprehensive scientific background that Australia will be inundated by a massive increase in sea level. I thought the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) was a little measured-at least he quoted some scientific support-but I think members of this House need to think very seriously about what a 950-millimetre increase of water across the oceans of this massive globe constitutes. The seas of this globe cover two-thirds of its surface. The member for Denison set out to allege that the government has not responded to the serious threat that greenhouse constitutes. That is an untruth. Yes, there is sufficient recognition and, yes, there is ongoing scientific assessment and proper modelling, but no-one from the government side has ever said that this is not a serious issue for this nation, along with all the other nations in the world, to address. So let us put paid to the. emotive suggestion that the government is not interested in greenhouse and the suggestion that, just because we have taken a stance on the setting of one fixed standard around the world for everybody to sign, we do not recognise the serious threat that greenhouse represents. Australia has made it very clear, government and through the statements of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), that we take a responsible and proactive role in the international negotiation on climate change. This has been a focus of the debate leading up to the Kyoto conference in a few weeks time. What we have said is that we as a government are committed to a fair and effective international outcome that does not disadvantage Australia and to developing a credible and effective greenhouse response. Let us get real on this and work together. The European Union's idea of differential targets for its own continent suggests that we should be committed to the same level of see universal target as the top seven emitters-the US, the Russian Federation, China, Japan, Brazil, Germany and India, which account for 60 per cent of the global emissions whereas Australia's is 1.4. The US and the EU respectively account for 22 per cent and 15 per cent of global emissions. Here we are in Australia at 1.4. Look at the break-up of the European Union, which have denied Australia's right to talk about negotiating differential outcomes. It is suggested that the emissions for Portugal would be 40 per cent, Greece 30 per cent, Spain 17 per cent, Ireland 15 per cent, Sweden five per cent and that France, the world's fourth largest economy, would be entitled to stabilise its emissions at 1990 levels, at zero, as is the case for Finland, when Australia, as the 14th largest economy, would have to accept emission cuts of 15 per cent. If you think there is justice in that and we do not have a right to argue on behalf of the Australian constituency we each represent, I think you are sadly misguided. There was a suggestion that we would have to cope with a human rights clause in our trade agreement with the EU. I witnessed the position the Australian Labor Party took when Australia was involved in those trade negotiations. Australia took a principled stand and said that there were enough problems with trade agreements without introducing others that would give some countries an excuse to manipulate. Taking that stand resulted in a through its successful outcome. In any form of negotiation I would not show all my cards to the other side and say what I was prepared to agree to before I entered an agreement. I have never operated in that kind of business environment. The Labor Party does not know what the government might ultimately agree to, but there is some encouragement in some nations' comments. The Leader of the Opposition says they are hardly noteworthy and not as a result of the principled position Australia has adopted, but it is at least pleasing to see that the US Undersecretary for Global Affairs, Tim Worth, the US's chief climate change negotiator, believes now that differentiation, to use his words, 'has a lot of currency'. That has had some impact on the stance that this government has taken on behalf of the nation. The member for Denison might regard our position as scaremongering, but introducing massive increases in the cost of fuel in a nation like ours-with its tyranny of distance and 18 million people spread over our huge continent where transport produces a higher share of total energy emissions than anywhere else (except in perhaps the US, but it has 250 million people to share the cost of that) and which is so dependent on transport-and willy-nilly entering into international agreements without adopting a principled position is not the position this government has chosen to adopt. I, representing a rural electorate, support most strenuously the argument for a better position in terms of differentiation. The opposition suffers from the frustration of opposition. I am sorry about that, but I do hope there are many more years of ongoing frustration in that regard. Being in opposition means no longer having access to the big levers and information. There is supposed to be a 950-millimetre rise iT' ;he ocean. That is a lot of water. I think tfl;1t, when the Prime Minister makes shortly his announcement in respect of these issues, it will be the opposition who will be blown out of the water. The opposition also suffers from a frustration that this government has clearly established its environmental credentials. Particularly the successful float of Telstra in the last few days and the funds that will go into the Natural Heritage Trust increase their frustration. From day one of the election campaign and right throughout it, weren't they a clanging cymbal of how this was all going to collapse? Now we have the proposition that we will get realistic outcomes for carbon sinks from the $350 million bushcare program. The government is also making great achievements with respect to electricity market reform with new competition in the national electricity market. All these initiatives will contribute to Australia's reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in a responsible way that does not cause serious harm to the sensitive electorates that we represent, especially those in rural areas. I am particularly disappointed in the opposition's contribution today. It was based on emotion and certainly not on justifiable science. I support the government's approach in the lead-up to Kyoto. The government is quite intent on ensuring that there is an outcome and that it does not disadvantage Australia, that it does not cost jobs and that this nation's growth can continue to cause ongoing prosperity for our nation.",54

202,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On a personal explanation, I have inadvertently misled the House, and I want to correct my misleading of the House. In my remarks I talked about a oneto two-metre rise and the potential impact that would have on various coastal areas of my constituency. The federal parliamentary library research paper on which we rely that went to these things talked about a temperature increase of 3.5 degrees Celsius producing a sea level rise of 0.95 of a metre--effectively a metre. So the one to two metres was, in that sense, an exaggeration. Based on that parliamentary research, a rise of effectively one metre, or 0.95 of a metre, would indeed have a very substantial impact, as I outlined. NA Public Accounts Committee Membership",56

206,Mr LEE,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"I indicate at the outset that the opposition will be opposing the National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997 and the National Transmission Network Sale (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997. I am sure that is no surprise to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile), who is at the table, or to the government. I will briefly explain why the opposition will be voting against these particular measures. These measures seek to sell the assets that are currently contained within the National Transmission Agency. The National Transmission Agency is one of the world's largest broadcasting facilities. ItÂ· includes 1,197 transmitters used to broadcast the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Special Broadcasting Service's radio and result television services right around the Australian continent. The NTA facilities also accommodate 503 transmitters belonging to licensed broadcasters and more than 1,000 radio communications transmitters. The NTA is a very important organisation that has performed its role more than admirably over the last few decades. I will outline in a few minutes some of the improved and more efficient performances and achievements which the NTA has clocked up in the last few years. We believe that, because of the NTA's excellent performance in recent days, there is no argument for the government to be bringing these measures before the parliament to seek to flog off the National Transmission Agency. I make it clear that the opposition has not been provided with a copy of the scoping study which has been ordered by the government and provided to the government. That scoping study certainly would have provided the opposition with a great deal more financial information and more information about whether the government is proceeding down the best route in maximising the return to taxpayers and seeking to protect the public interest. . Although the bill guarantees access to the NTA facilities for the ABC and SBS for the next five years, there is very little information as to what will happen after those five years. You can imagine the difficulty that the national broadcasters will be in in seeking to negotiate with a company or a series of companies which will have a clear monopoly over the transmission facilities and the transmission network. The bill also. contains. no guarantees regarding maintenance of services in rural and regional areas. While the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) in his second reading speech made certain claims that the contract with the purchaser of the network would look after these matters, this guarantee should appear in the bill if this parliament is to have any faith that the government and the new owner will meet these obligations of looking after the bush. There is also nothing in the bill that guarantees that the current policy ,objectives of the NTA will be maintained. While the bill does contain some limited community service obligations, these are much more constrained than those which are currently in existence. Finally, the government claims that it will draw up a compact with SBS and the ABC which will seek to spell out what the coverage and quality expectations will be for the new owner. In return, the government claims it will be covering the cost of the transmission contracts for the next five years. But, when you look at the fine detail, Madam Deputy Speaker, you see that there are a number of questions which are left up in the air. They are the reasons why the opposition remains concerned about the impact of this particular bill and they are the reasons why the opposition believes the government has not made the case for privati sing and selling off the National Transmission Agency's assets. We believe that the ABC and SBS should continue to be able to use the facilities of an organisation which is owned and controlled by the Commonwealth of Australia. Let me go through our reasons for saying this. I think it is very difficult for anyone to claim that the NTA today is an inefficient organisation. The NTA has over the last few years dramatically expanded its network. In June 1992 the NTA's predecessor was looking after 862 transmitters broadcasting the national services. By June 1997 there were 1,197. We can see that there has been a dramatic expansion in the NTA's network, which required a substantial injection of capital from the former federal government, in which I had the honour of serving for part of the time as Minister for Communications and the Arts. That expansion of services, for example, has seen national radio and television services extended to a further 1.3 million Australians. In particular, I know you, Madam Speaker Kelly, as a keen Triple J listener, would welcome the fact that ABC services have been extended to a further 468,000 Australians. I am not sure whether there are any in your electorate. I imagine there are some. Mr Hardgrave interjecting",58
207,Mr LEE,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"I know that the member who is interjecting should listen. From the contributions he makes in this chamber, he obviously has a need to listen to more Triple J if the quality of his speeches is to improve. He needs to get into more contact with the needs of new and emerging Australian artists and their need for greater sympathy from this government for the Australian music industry. But let me return to the matter before the House. The expansion of services has also seen SBS television provided to another 453,000 Australians. So the NTA has dramatically extended its network, particularly in rural and regional areas, where under the former government there was a dramatic expansion in the provision of radio services to Australians living in the bush. The most important of these of course was the expan;.. sion of Triple J. That expansion has revolutionised Triple J. So it has been good not only for the many Triple J listeners in the bush but also for the nature of the service which Triple J provides to its listeners in capital cities. Triple J's series of 'Unearthed' concerts its series of Unearthed CDs have allowed city people to have better access to the great Australian music out there in rural and regional areas. There has been almost a two-way conversation carried out through Triple J between people who live in the bush and people in our urban areas and that has been very important to young Australians right around the country. Madam Deputy Speaker, for those Australians in your electorate who might not be tuned in every day to Triple J, there has also been a dramatic expansion in the provision of Radio National and Classic FM services and that has also provided a much wider choice to those Australians who live in the bush. That has not been cheap and has required a significant injection of capital under the former government. To be fair to this government, it has also provided some money for a continuation of the former government's program to expand SBS television to electorates around the country. Mr Vaile-It's not in Taree yet.",59
208,Mr LEE,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"It is not yet in Taree, but I am sure that the minister at the table will be popping the champagne when SBS movies are available in his electorate. Anyone who owns a network of this size always has to make sure that the transmitters remain relatively modern and up to date, otherwise the costs of maintenance go through the roof. At the moment the average life of NTA transmitters is about 7Y2 years. The average working life of a transmitter these days is about 15 years, so the NTA is doing pretty well on that score as well. The NTA, under its current general manager, Vic Jones, and through a lot of hard work by it dedicated staff, has been able to make these dramatic expansions in the size and the reach of the network and has been able to spend a lot of money replacing out-of-date equipment, despite dramatic budget cuts being made to that organisation. That might be no surprise, given that the peak of the expansion of the program has passed in recent days, but the NTA, through its program of putting maintenance activities to tender, has implemented some quite significant savings in its and recurrent costs. All that has meant that the NTA is delivering a service not just to the national broadcasters but also to the taxpayer in an efficient manner, one which I think has been very good for the Australian community. The government claims that it has to go through with this privatisation process so that, basically, it can get its hands on the cash. The government believes that, by selling off the National Transmission Agency, the money that it gets from that sale can be used to pay off government debt. We also have the claim that the national broadcasters will be happier little vegemites, according to the government. Let me quote from the speech in this House of the Minister for Family Services, who said: These bills provide the ABC and SBS with a direct commercial relationship with transmission service providers. The ABC and SBS have been seeking such a relationship for many years. The sale of the transmission network will provide . a range of benefits. The ABC and SBS, and other network users, will finally operate in a purchaserprovider relationship with service suppliers. You can almost hear the champagne corks popping at Ultimo, according to the minister's remarks here about how the ABC and SBS 'have been seeking such a relationship for many years'. That is not quite true. For many years the ABC and SBS have wanted to own the NTA. The ABC and SBS have campaigned for many years for these assets to be transferred to the national broadcasters. The ABC and SBS have never, to the best of my knowledge, been arguing for the NTA to be sold off. During the time. I was the Minister for Communications and the Arts, the reason why the ABC and SBS never came to me arguing for the NTA to be sold off is that they knew what was going to happen as a result of this government's ideological obsession with privatisation. The government will try to tell people that services provided in the bush will not be affected by the sale, and it will be wrong. The government will try to argue that the quality of service provider and the reach of the service provided by the ABC and SBS will not be affected, and it will be wrong. The government will try to argue that in five years time, when the initial contract runs out, there will be no impact as all these things are rolled over and, of course, it will again be wrong. There will be a significant and dramatic change once the NTA's assets are sold off, and in some ways it is already starting to happen. My evidence for this has been provided by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), who is not able to speak in this debate tonight because of some events that happened at question time today. On behalf of the member for Hunter and at his request, I would like to explain to the House one matter which has already seen a clear indication that certain promises that have been made and certain actions that were promised and were expected to take place have now been cancelled simply because this government has decided to sell off the Natlonal Transmission Agency. It affects an area called Wollombi on the edge of my electorate. The honourable member for Hunter has worked very hard to look after the constituents that live in this area. I will read from a letter to the honourable member for Hunter written by Graeme Barrow, of the Business Development Unit of the NTA, dated 10 November this year in response to a request from the member for Hunter for background information on the NTA's decision not to proceed with a project to install a translator facility for ABC and SBS television services in the W ollombi area. It goes on to explain that the reason the NTA intended to install the infill translator in the Wollombi area is that the ABC is currently broadcast on Channel 5A in the Newcastle region but, as we all know, at some stage in the future proposals will be put to the government to shut down Channel 3 and Channel 5A on the VHF spectrum. People living in the Hunter area will then be relying on UHF services to continue to receive signals such as ABC television. The letter says: The NTA is aware of several localities in the Newcastle region where reception of UHF services is difficult, chiefly because of the terrain. As indicated, Wollombi is one of these localities. With this in mind, the NT A decided to work towards installing an infill translator facility for the area. The community was consulted about its views on a suitable site for the facility and other possibilities were investigated before the NT A presented two site options desigped to serve the greatest number of people. The Wollombi & Lower Hunter TV Action Group gave support to one of these sites in a letter to the NT A dated 6 March 1996. The agreement of two landowners was required, one for the site itself and the other for the access route for a powerline ... The letter goes on to explain that there was a difficulty in negotiations with one of the landowners about the provision of power. The letter continues: The landowner's decision to deny access was communicated to the NT A by letter dated 11 October 1997. Then comes the crucial sentence: In view of the Government's decision to sell the national transmission network, there was not enough time left for the NT A to recommend an alternative site and, even if successful, to negotiate with the landowner(s) and erect the translator facility before the sale, scheduled to be completed by 30. June 1998. The letter ends: I hope that this information meets your request for background on the Wollombi translator project. The letter is signed by Mr Graeme Barrow. What is quite clear is that, as a result of this government's decision to sell the National Transmission Agency, the people who were hoping that the government would be continuing to fund and install that infill translatorthe residents of Wollombi-have been disappointed. That is now on hold and those residents will not hold their breath waiting for a private sector operator to spend a substantial amount of money to provide ABC and SBS services to a new group of Australians who live in the bush. That raises the general questionMr Hardgrave-Why didn't you fix it? It's your electorate and you were the minister.",60
209,Mr LEE,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"The member for Moreton interjects and asks why I did not fix it. I remind him that on 6 March discussions were still taking place with these residents. Under the former government we were still working to build the translator. The difficulty you have, my friend, is that under your government they have stopped working on building the translator. Mr Hardgrave-You never fixed it.",61
210,Mr LEE,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"The difficulty the honourable member for Moreton has is that his government, through its decision to sell the National Transmission Agency, as evidenced in this letter, is going to deny any opportunities for adequate services to be provided to people who live in places such as Wollombi and to Australians who do not currently receive national broadcaster services. That goes to the nub of the causes for our concerns about the National Transmission Network Sale Bill. We believe that the National Transmission Agency should be kept under pressure and should be required to operate as efficiently as possible. Through the provision of contracting its maintenance, it has certainly lifted its game, but I think it is going to be very hard for the government to argue that privati sing is going to provide significant benefits. The basis for that claim is that, according to the NTA's general manager, Mr Vic Jones, in the draft annual report for 1996-97: The cost to the Government of funding the network has been reduced to the level at which it is hard to discern where other economies might be found or how further savings could be made---except at the cost of reduced coverage or poorer performance. That is the difficulty the government members have in this debate today. Those who are arguing that you can run this operation with less money need to understand that, according to Mr Jones, that can only be achieved at the cost of reduced coverage-that means shutting down some transmitters-or poorer performance. That means that, if lightning strikes a transmitter or some damage is done or some maintenance is required, it will take longer for the services to be restored. For those reasons we quite naturally have concerns about the decision of the government to privatise these things. One of the other difficulties that I think the government members are going to have relates to their claim that the ABC and SBS will be no worse off because the government will fund the initial costs. Currently the ABC and SBS receive a budget to produce their radio and television services. Once the National Transmission Agency is privatised, the ABC and SBS will have to have an additional sum of money to pay the new privati sed owner the recurrent cost of running the services and also, I presume, some additional fee to cover the capital cost-the amount that these companies will tender to purchase the network. The difficulty that I think the ABC and SBS are going to have is that this government promised in the past that the ABC and SBS would have funding maintained in real terms. What that meant in practice was a 10 per cent cut in the funding which this Prime Minister (Mr Howard), this Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and this secretary of the government's backbench committee on communications delivered to our national broadcasters. This is a Prime Minister who crossed his heart, hoped to die and promised not to cut ABC and SBS funding but in practice delivered 10 per cent cuts. He was trusted once and he let down the national broadcasters. I am sure the ABC and SBS are sitting up there full of confidence, knowing that this government will not break its undertakings a second time. But let us give them the benefit of the doubt. Let us assume that this is not another sneaky attempt by the Howard government to cut back funding to the ABC and SBS be-. cause they have an ideological obsession about our national broadcasters. Let us assume that they will keep their promise on the second occasion. In five years time, everything is up for grabs. In five years time, there is no guarantee that the ABC and SBS will have this funding restored. There is no guarantee how much the national broadcasters will be expected to pay in five years time. The new owner or owners of the national network are in the very definition of a monopoly position. The ABC and SBS cannot build an alternative broadcast network from scratch. The minister's bill says it is now open to the ABC to look for alternative methods to those offered by the new NTA owner to deliver ABC services across the country, but you can imagine what it would mean for the ABC and SBS to have to start from scratch and build entirely new networks. It would be extremely expensive and it would mean that the ABC would have to cut back its expenditure on programming by even greater amounts than has been the case to date. The bill says, 'Don't worry. If you're the ABC, SBS or a community broadcaster, the new telecommunications access arrangements will ensure that you get a fair deal.' Senator. Alston says, 'Trust us, have we got a deal for you. We'll have Allan Fels be the policeman who will make sure that you get fair access'-Allan Fels, the man who has delivered to Australis, Foxtel and Optus fair access to their customers over the last couple of weeks! Even if we say that the ACCC will fairly and impartially be brought into arbitrate if there is no agreement between the ABC and the new owner, SBS and the new owner or some local community broadcaster in Hobart and the new owner, we are relying on the ACCC to set some agreement, and I think we are entitled to ask what factors will be taken into account by the ACCC in reaching agreement, in using its arbitration powers. As I am sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, commercial television broadcasters and national broadcasters have more money to spend than local community broadcasters. If local community broadcasters were expected to pay the full market rate for access to broadcasting services, they would simply have to shut down. If local community radio stations and a small number of community television stations are shut down as a result of this government's decision to privatise the National Transmission Agency, then I think that would be a backward step, given the very vibrant role that community broadcasters have played in Australia. In particular, community radio has played an excellent role right across the country in promoting a greater diversity of views and music formats and has given many Australians access to forms of radio that otherwise would not be available. If those local community radio stations were expected to start paying full commercial rates for access to these transmitters, then I think that would mean that many of them would be forced to close down, which would be a tremendous loss. For all of these reasons, let me emphasise the point that the opposition remains concerned about the impact of these changes. We think that the NTA has certainly been able to demonstrate in the last seven years that it has been able to protect the public interest by efficiently spending funding provided by the former federal government in expanding national services for ABC and SBS right across the country. The Australian community will pay a very high price as a result of this government's decision to privatise the National TransmissionÂ· Agency. Those government members who represent rural and provincial seats will .rue the day that their names were recorded in Hansard as having voted to sell off the National Transmission Agency, and we in the Labor Party will continue to remind government members of the consequences of their actions when, unfortunately, they become apparent in future days.",62
211,Mr HARDGRAVE,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"Since coming to office, the Howard government has kept faith with the people of Australia in a number of different ways as we progress along the very difficult road of building a better nation. It certainly takes a deal of time. It takes time to undo the mess that was left by the previous government. It takes time to rebuild the solid financial base that the people of Australia rightly expect the government to do. One of the things that we are doing is keeping faith with the people of Australia when it comes to asset sales. In recent days, it has been very obvious how well we have done that with the partial sale of Telstra. Like any individual in some sort of financial crisis, something can be sold to make your day to day a bit better. The Labor Party used that sort of approach-quite different to the approach that we have taken with the proceeds of any sales of assets. The Labor Party used the approach of simply selling off the family silver, even when they said they would not. Remember back in 1990? 'No sale of Qantas.' They sold 49 per cent, and later the whole lot went. Remember 1993? The Commonwealth Bank-'Never do it.' They sold a bit and then the whole lot went. They have never opened up, never been up-front with the voters. Is it any wonder people are cynical about politicians! We are using asset sales to wipe off the budget deficit, to pay off the national debt. Labor used it to pay for programs-literally selling the family car to pay for fuel or food-while we are retiring debt with sales of assets. The Labor Party are awfully touchy in this place today. We have been lambasted for even daring to partially sell Telstra. We have promised and delivered and 600,000 Australians, for the first time ever, bought shares as a vote of support for this government's approach. They made money in the last day or so-$14 billion also for the nation, and the National Heritage Trust Fund will do well out of it. Eighty-one per cent of Telstra remains owned by Australia and Australians-four per cent in fact by Telstra employees. This is important background to the National Transmission Network Sale Bill and the National Transmission Network Sale (Consequential Amendments) Bill before us today. We have just heard an interesting contribution from the former Minister for Communications and the Arts, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee)-a former minister in the failed Keating government-who tried to talk about ideological obsessions with privatisation and tried to create scare campaigns amongst rural and regional Australians about their access to television and radio transmissions. He tried to create a scare campaign about public radio and public broadcasting access to the National Transmission Agency's network throughout Australia, all because this government is going down yet another one of the paths it promised it would go down and that is the sale of this worthwhile asset to private concerns with a view to trying to return some more money to pay off debt, with a view to trying to get some greater efficiencies within the system and with a view to keeping faith with the ABC and the Special Broadcasting Service by giving them something they wanted-that is, some sort of commercial linkage, some sort of ability to be able to a better network, an even more improved network, than the NTA already offers. We are keeping faith with all of those particular points through the process of this bill being passed here today. To think we sold Telstra so effectively in the background of the most unstable stock market for a decade. To think we did all of that and that so many people took up the prospect of being able to buy Telstra sharesthe shares of a great Australian institutionwith such vigour. Of course, the government reserves its right to perhaps sell more of Telstra at a later stage, but it will only do so after it has been given a mandate to act by the people of Australia, just as we have been given a mandate to act in the sale of the National Transmission Agency's network. It fulfils a pre-election commitment regarding the ABC and SBS and their collective access to transmission infrastructure. The honourable member for Dobell talked about ideological obsessions. Let me quote. from a speech by the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on 24 August 1994, when he told the National Press Club: Privatisation fits in with the Government's broader imperative to create jobs ... Privatisation is not pursued because of a New Right ideology that says government ownership has no benefits and must be relinquished at all costs. The real measure for whether privatisation should occur is whether there will be a net social and economic gain from moving a particular enterprise into private ownership. The 'net gain' may take many forms: potentially better services and lower prices for consumers; stronger enterprises and greater competition for our economy; and, in the broader sense, making government funds available for new policy. All reasonable and fair-minded words. Mr Beazley also said to the National Press Club on that day: Privatisation, for instance, can strengthen the performance of enterprises by allowing private capital injections, as happened with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, and international alliances to be formed, as with the sale of 25 per cent of Qantas to British Airways. It can remove the constraints that are placed by public ownership in terms of freedom to take risks, freedom to borrow, the need to pursue diversification and so on. He used the Commonwealth Serum Laboratogain ries as an example. Mr Beazley also said: And it can expose the enterprises to the full discipline of the capital market, to the rigours of scrutiny by private shareholders and to refinements in management culture that sweep the business community. These last couple of quotes are worthwhile as well: Of course another benefit of privatisation is that it contributes to the Government budget, helping to reduce debt and providing funds for Government programs. The scale of the asset sales process varies from year to year. The Government'she was talking about the then governmentcommitment to the deficit reduction strategy means that a halt to privatisation would result in a direct cut to government programs. That is what you said in government, member for Dobell. I wonder why today we hear a different contribution. Ideological obsession indeed! These bills, the National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997 and National Transmission Network Sale (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 implement the government's decisions announced in the last budget to sell the NTA's network. It will mean private investors will be able to access ownership of a much needed infrastructure with certainty that commercial arrangements between contractors and the contracted offer a return on the investment. I am delighted to hear the member for Dobell talking up the efficiency and the capability of the NTA in his contribution today. I hope that that may contribute, despite perhaps some other curious sidetracks in his contribution, to the actual value of the NTA when it is sold. Some potential investors might say, 'Even the Labor Party thinks it is a commodity worth buying.' These particular bills also keep faith with the pre-election commitmentÂ· to increase the national broadcasters' responsibility for transmission of their own programs. These bills provide the ABC and SBS with a direct commercial relationship with transmission service providers. The ABC and SBS, as has been said in the contribution by the member opposite as well as myself today, have been seeking such a relationship for years. I think the member for Dobell's contribution today was more about the press release sitting on his laser printer in his office here, to be sent to Triple J. He is trying to get Triple J to run his press release to create a scare campaig!1. It is not necessary with this particular bill; after all, the expansion programs and the possibilities of expansion throughout other parts of Australia, including the Taree area; which would be of great interest to the minister at the table, will continue-more likely so because more commercial imperatives will apply. It will not, just simply be a matter of planning and looking at a map and seeing what the coverage is like; it will be a matter of looking and saying, 'The people of W ollombi could not get the member for Dobell and the member for Hunter to get their acts together sufficiently to get the particular transmission they wantecl in their areas.' But the National Transmission Agency sale will put in a commercial operator who will say to the people of Wollombi, if they want those services and they are viable, 'Why wouldn't we want to put those particular services in there?' Those services will be ordered by the ABC and SBS, based on their desire to get into those areas. Apart from realising proceeds to retire debt, the sale of the National Transmission Network will mean the ABC, SBS and other network users will finally operate in a purchaser-provider relationship. It is the same as the way the repatriation general hospitals were sold a few years ago by the former Hawke-Keating government. Those sorts of moves made good sense to the members of the now government parties. Why should we be in the position of owning those sorts of infrastructure if private enterprise wants to take them over? We should be in the business of purchasing the services, which is the situation that will exist as a result of these bills. This transferring of operational activity to the private sector will increase client focus and responsiveness, because it is what happens in normal commercial practice. Down the track, a greater degree of competition in the transmission services market will emerge, especially with the introduction of digital terrestrial broadcasting. The government is not just driven by the bottom line of proceeds to repay public debt. We are not just selling off the silver without ensuring a continuation of the various services the National Transmission Agency provides. The government has acted to ensure important broadcasting and social policy objectives are preserved, despite the change of ownership of infrastructure. In other words, there will maintenance of existing ABC and SBS coverage and of service quality, particularly for regional and remote communities. It is a prerequisite that any purchaser has to meet. I believe improvements to the already extensive infrastructure will come as a consequence of the demands of both the listener and the provider of the services-so Triple J and SBS can expand further. In the medium term, limited competition in the transmission services market is likely to be the case, especially outside major metropolitan centres, but in the longer term better facilities and services should come from the potential competitive demands of various broadcasters on the transmission service providers. I came from the community radio sector, so I understand how important it is for services in that particular area to be maintained and improved upon. Such services will be preserved, including those for network users such as Radio for the Print Handicapped, remote commercial satellite broadcasting services, self-help transmission groups and emergency service operators. Radio for the Print Handicapped in Brisbane, on 4RPH operating on 1296 AM, do a fantastic job in keeping people who are visually impaired well informed of current events. I will be making sure I send them a copy of this speech. While we are encouraging innovation, we are encouraging competition, we are encouraging investors to be part of the new digital world and we are encouraging private enterprise and ordinary Australians to be part of another asset sale so they can share in the profits, we are also demanding maintenance of social policy objectives met by the current National Transmission Agency regime. These bills provide the balance which is needed to maximise the benefits in the overall deal. We are establishing commercial synergies with competitive safeguards, and we will ensure the protection of many other important objectives. The shape of the network ownership arrangements will evolve from the sale. The network effectively will transfer to one or more national transmission companies, and these companies in tum will have agreed be a contracts with the ABC and SBS spelling out transmission requirements. From the viewpoint of the listener or service recipient, there will be a seamless transition as contracts will be in place when these companies are sold to the network purchaser or purchasers. The government will enter into an agreement with both the ABC and SBS to ensure transmission coverage and quality are maintained and improved. We will enforce this agreement by funding the costs of the broadcaster's arrangements for the next five years, providing real certainty for the ABC and SBS. This puts the onus on the ABC, SBS and all other users to enforce their own agreements with the transmission service providers to ensure there is quality as well as coverage. It is an arrangement that the ABC and SBS have been looking for. Others may need to be reassured of their particular position as a result of these changes. These bills also introduce a regulatory framework which will underpin all of these arrangements. This is simply because the government has an eye on the potential on-sale of the network and, in tum, the transfer of assets necessary for the continuation of the ABC, SBS, Radio for the Print Handicapped services and emergency services. We have prepared for this, considered it and thought it through. These bills provide a mechanism for real accountability to this place and to the Australian people and contain provisions requiring ministerial approval before transfer of any assets associated with these nominated services. In this way, the minister will have the role of ensuring any proposed transferee adopts the conditions of the previous contracts with the ABC, SBS and Radio for the Print Handicapped operators in relation to core performance obligations. The bills also allow an assessment of the likely commercial or financial viability of the proposed transferee to further safeguard the continued provision of national broadcasting services. The member for Dobell wants to be Chicken Little on this legislation. We can give him the facts on this matter which are very clear and well laid out in all of the documents associated with the legislation. These bills work to ensure the continuing availability of essential transmission services and facilities and prevent any market failure leading to monopoly prices by establishing an access regime to guard against any imbalance which may come as a result of the negotiating power that this massive organisation would have. This access regime is similar to that put in place for the telecommunications industry for the benefit of certain nominated customers. In simple terms, the access regime guarantees transmission services as they currently exist for the ABC, SBS and Radio for the Print Handicapped, as well as access to existing network infrastructure such as transmission sites and towers for other groups such as community broadcasting, self-help transmission groups, remote commercial satellite broadcasters and emergency services. In the event of any dispute over access terms and conditions, the ACCC is there to arbitrate between negotiating parties. The bills provide a combination of contractual and legislative provisions, giving balance to the terms and conditions which will exist. They will make the new regime a reasonable one for national broadcasters and other users seeking access to services from those with significant market power. In other words, no future transmission network owner will be able to derail the extent of services currently accessed through the NTA. As you would imagine, commercial users of the network can also exercise standard fair trading legal safeguards, including those under section 3A of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The bills also provide a good common sense regime. We are not like those oppositesimply selling off the jewellery without thinking about the consequences-leaving a trail of destruction over the many years they were in government. As a consequence of these new arrangements, a number of technical changes are required to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act, the Special Broadcasting Service Act and the Radiocommunications Act. These changes will allow broadcasters governed by these acts to deal directly with transmission service providers. The ABC and SBS will maintain control over the radiocommunications spectrum used to broadcast their services. The bills also allow and encourage the ABC and SBS to establish their own transmission services, which enables them to pick and choose the areas in which it might well be of more benefit economically for their particular organisation to have a stand-alone facility. Broadcasters will also be empowered to purchase future requirements from other providers, which will provide commercial leverage and introduce contest-bility into the transmission market. The ABC and SBS will be required to report to parliament, through their annual reports, on any significant changes to transmission coverage or quality of national broadcasting services. Likewise, the ABC and SBS will be responsible directly to the public for dealing with any complaints about reception quality and coverage. This could be taken up with a particular service provider if necessary. If a substantial problem appears to exist in changed transmission coverage of a community, the minister will have the option of directing the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate a matter if a suitable and timely response is not provided by the broadcaster. This is what the ABC and SBS have wanted. They have wanted an operating environment, a contractual and legislative package, which provides a direct commercial relationship with the provider of their transmission services. This government has also given the ABC and SBS a degree of flexibility in determining how best to meet their future transmission needs. This government has also delivered to the Australian public a greater confidence of protection for the coverage and signal quality of national broadcasting services. While the great national broadcasters-the ABC and the child of the Fraser Liberal government, SBS-have such flexibility, self-help groups, emergency service operators and remote commercial satellite service providers will also be protected by the access regime established by this legislation. This bill contains a number of other technical requirements to facilitate the sale. Provisions relating to the ownership of fixtures separate to the ownership of the land on which they are located and the power to sever those fixtures from the land is necessary to make it clear and certain to the potential purchasers just what it is the Commonwealth owns and what the Commonwealth is actually selling. The sale proceeds will go back into the 1998-99 budget. They will go back into ensuring that this government fulfils its overall commitment to the people of Australia to build a better country. They will go back into retiring debt and into running the country and the economy in an more efficient manner overall as well as ensuring that people, particularly in regional and rural Australia, who enjoy services from the ABC and SBS will continue to enjoy those services, even though the infrastructure ownership change has occurred.",63
212,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"Mr Quick)Order! I would like to place on record that the honourable member for Hunter was to speak on this bill, but due to a discretion earlier today he was suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours and will be unable to speak on this bill.",68
213,Mr WARWICK SMITH,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"in replyThe member for O'Connor, Mr Tuckey, is also not speaking tonight. I want to sum up on the national transmission legislative package and thank the two contributors to the debate: the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), who has just spoken, and the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). The member for Dobell has a very good understanding of this area, having been the minister for communications in the past government. In my second reading speech, when I introduced these two pieces of legislation, we made it quite clear that we are honouring an election undertaking to take the National Transmission Agency to the marketplace. It will have a profound impact on the ABC and SBS. They finally will have responsibility for their transmission requirements, and they will operate in a purchaser-provider relationship with service suppliers. Indeed, in speaking with ABC representatives only yesterday, they certainly welcomed this change. I can recall when I was active in this area back in 1993 that this was an issue for deep consideration by the prospective incoming government. There has been some delay, but finally the rightness of this policy has been presented to the parliament. Mr Hardgrave-Hear, hear!",68
214,Mr WARWICK SMITH,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"So I thank particularly your good self for the eloquent way in which you addressed the issues. The honourable member for Dobell did raise some issues. As I understand his contribution, fundamentally he was saying that he thought it was performing well and there was no reason to proceed down this path. I would only offer the observation, which I think he would know, that he received a good deal of advice that this in fact would put Australia in a position to be dealing with transmission arrangements that are in keeping with developments in the rest of the world. This is another act of revisionism from the Labor Party, looking backwards rather than looking forwards. But he did raise a few useful comments. Mr Lee-We will bring on a division if you are not careful.",68
215,Mr WARWICK SMITH,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"I know you said you would not divide, and we do appreciate that. There are a few issues that you raised. It is proposed to provide for continuity of transmission services for the ABC, SBS and _Radio for the Print Handicapped and access to sites and facilities for those parties and emergency service organisations, remote commercial licensees and self-help groups by a combination of the contractual obligations, reinforced by statutory projections as are outlined in the second reading speech. The contracts between those groups and the NTC will set out the core performance obligations for continued supply of transmission services until such time as those bodies cease to require those services. It is intended that the contracts will be for five years, with an option for those bodies to renew for a further two terms of five years on terms and conditions to be negotiated. The contracts will be enforceable through contractual remedies, and this will form the basis of the arrangements behind the sale of the National Transmission Agency. The access regime, which I heard my colleague talking about, is important. It will impose an obligation to supply nominated services to nominated customers, on terms either agreed or arbitrated. The access regime could result in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission arbitrating on the terms and conditions of renewal of the five year terms for the ABC, SBS and others in addition to arbitrating on access arrangements for any other nominated customers if the parties cannot reach agreement. I heard the member mention some similarity to the telecommunications legislation. The member for Dobell also expressed a little concern about CSOs. As was outlined in the second reading speech, which I introduced when introducing the legislation, the sale does make provision for an access regime which will give the groups such as I have just mentioned-the emergency services, remote commercial licenses, the self-help groups, community broadcasters, as well as the ABC-access to those services and/or sites and towers. That is the key part. They access. If they cannot agree, then it will be under arbitrated arrangements. We believe that this arrangement will bring to the transmission arrangements in this country a greater degree of certainty. Certainly, the public broadcasters welcome it. It gives them far greater control over a cost centre that they had no control over previously. I know that they would welcome it as well. I do not think there is any point in taking this matter further, other than to say that the level of concern that had been held by public broadcasters is now met. The work that has been done by the department and those who have advised the department has been extensive in this area over a large number of years. I take the opportunity on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, to thank those people for all the work that they have done over a long period of time to bring to fruition the completion of this legislation and thank particularly the advisers in the box today, who have been actively involved in this matter. I thank them for their extensive work as well. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Warwick Smith) proposed: That the bill be now read a third time.",68
216,Mr LEE,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"The opposition will be voting on the voices against the third reading, just as we voted on the voices against the second reading. We will not force the House to a division, but for the record we remain opposed. One thing which the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) did bill not pick up in his response was a. matter which I raised on behalf of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) of the proposed infill translator in Wollombi. Given that no notice was given to the minister about that matter, if he couid reply in writing to the member for Hunter at some future time, we would be will get grateful for that assurance.

Motion (by Mr Warwick Smith) proposed: That the amendments be agreed to.",69
217,Ms MACKLIN,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"I understand that the government has accepted the amendments made by the Senate to the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 to legislate the start date for the changes from 27 April 1998, to provide an exemption from the immunisation requirement where a suitable vaccine is not available, to make the regional allocation of child-care places a disallowable instrument and, finally, to replace the gaol sentence for providing incorrect information with a fine. It is important to remember that we are debating here some very significant changes to child care that follow from some significant cuts that have been made by this government in the child-care area. Some $820 million has been taken out of child care by this budget. In the interests of time, I will not go through all the areas from which that has been taken, except to say that we are now seeing areas in which this is having a very significant effect. I am sure that the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) has seen the results of a major survey that has been underrate taken in New South Wales. People's responses to that child-care survey emphasise the impact that the federal government's cuts have had on staff, services, food and equipment. Many talked about the increase in stress on families that paying the higher fees has brought about. We have seen a large number of community based child-care centres close. Many of these centres have had significant reductions in staff which can only result in a reduction in the quality of care that children in those centres experience. One commentator has said in response to this survey that the government's child-care cuts have created a two-tier system of child care. Those who can afford good quality child care can still go to the long day care centres that receive government subsidies, but those who can no longer afford that sort of child care because of the government's cuts are now being forced into poorer quality backyard care. On average, the fee increase for families around the country is around $20 a week per child. In some places families are facing considerably higher increases in their fees than this. The result of these increases in has been very significant. What families are doing in response to these increases in fees, which are the direct result of the government's withdrawal of $820 million from child care, are that women-and it is mostly women-are changing their working arrangements. Some of them are reducing their hours, some are taking their children out of day care for a day or two a week, some are making arrangements with other people in the neighbourhood and some are trying to fit their day working week into a shorter period or trying to work at home when the children are asleep. These options are not serious options that any parent should have to face. They are options that no parent wants to take up. Families cannot afford to reduce their hours of work. They need to make sure that they continue to participate in the work force. The government needs to recognise that the only way families can do that is if they have decent provision of affordable child care.",71
218,Mr WARWICK SMITH,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"I understand that there is not going to be a division on this. The Senate has sent back amendments and the government accepts those amendments. The bill will now pass with the support of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Child Care Payments Bill will become law. There are concerns that have just been expressed by the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). I hear what she is saying and I have seen the material in New South Wales today. I would reject some of it, and I have addressed that in a press release. But I do not want to prolong the debate. I think that the major point is that the changes to the child-care payments arrangements which will startÂ· after Easter next year-I have changed the date of start-upwill enhance the opportunities for Australians to have a continued, affordable child-care system, enhancing quality right across the country with an additional 83,000 places over the four-year period. The changes that are made go through with fees the support of both sides of the parliament, with the reservations, of course, which I acknowledge, that the shadow minister has made. But the fundamental change has been accepted: a better planning system and a better overall approach to child care. I accept that we need to address some of the matters you have raised. They have been raised by the industry. The draft subordinate legislation is now out with all the child-care sectors for their comments, and I have sought to get their five- comments to make sure that we can address the fine d-tail. I would take the opportunity, if members and the Deputy Speaker do not mind, of thanking those advisers who have been involved in this legislation. There has been a long period of consultation right across the country and all across the political parties to bring us to this day. I thank the advisers for their extensive work. I also want to pay a tribute to my predecessor, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), who worked tirelessly in this area as well. Question resolved in the affirmative.",72
219,Unknown,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"Sitting suspended from 6.33 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. NA NA The following bill was returned from the Senate without amendment or request: Child Care Payments (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997 NA AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING OF NA CHARACTER AND CONDUCT) BILL Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 October, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.",72
220,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"In speaking to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions Relating to Character and Conduct) Bill I foreshadow at the outset that at a later stage I will seek to move a series of amendments. On that basis, I indicate that I have no opposition to those amendments being circulated at the moment. Despite that, can I say that opposition very much accepts and supports the basic stated aims of this bill. The opposiagree tion, in doing so, accepts that, unfortunately, there have been instances where people who are clearly not of good character have been granted visas and have been able to come to Australia, often at considerable cost to the Australian community. I do not believe anyone in the House is of the view that that is the way we ought to be developing the .migration system in Australia. There have also, unfortunately, been credible reports of criminals being able to access visas to come to Australia. On that basis, the opposition endorse-and I endorse it very much-any proposal to keep out criminals or members of criminal gangs. I also agree that those who indulge in racial vilification should not be allowed to come to Australia to spread that poison. Some would argue that is a denial of freedom of speech. Alternatively, I would argue that the strength of democracy and the question of freedom of speech also require people to accept certain responsibilities going with freedom of speech. Thpse who might harass or intimidate Australian residents should not be welcome here. The opposition agrees that a person who has a substantial criminal record, as defined by the bill, may be said to. have failed the character test and should not be allowed to enter this country. I agree that if a person has managed to enter Australia, despite not being of good character, the government should be able to act quickly to remove that person. We accept that if a person has characteristics as set out in the proposed amendment in section 1997 501, he or she can be judged as not being of good character. If, despite these characteristics, he or she wants to be granted a visa, he or she would need to convince the minister or his delegate-or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal-that he or she should be allowed to enter. In essence, despite some reservations, we would accept a reverse onus, the onus now being on the applicant to show that he is of good character in the circumstances set out in the proposed section SOL I have said on many occasions that I do not accept people who rort the system, people the who take advantage of us. Having said that, I agree with the basic principle but I do not with all the methods advanced in this bill. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) is trying to put in place some major changes without making it clear that that is what he is doing. I think that is very fundamental to the debate in the House this evening and will be an issue that is explored to a large extent in detail if we succeed in the Senate in having the bill referred to a committee for further consideration. That is why I have also indicated at the outset that we will be seeking to move a series of amendments. Six of those amendments will be put on the table this evening for consideration. That is mainly because this bill would allow the minister to take decisions about granting a visa without that decision being subject to natural justice requirements. Since I assumed responsibility for this sensitive area, I have indicated on a range of bills going to the issue of migration that natural justice is exceptionally important in our consideration of these issues. That goes to our view that the minister can make decisions that are totally unreasonable; he can make decisions that are potentially biased; he can make decisions that are potentially not based on any evidence; he can ignore available evidence when making these decisions. These are among the main elements of natural justice and the potential concerns that we raise in the debate this evening. I am not saying that the minister would make such decisions but they are issues that we have to consider in a proper and fit way, considering the nature of the bill before the House tonight. If the minister is exempt from the requirements of natural justice he might make such decisions should he want to. That is the real issue. The finger is not being pointed at the minister at the table this evening, it is being pointed at the capacity of a minister to make such decisions. It was in reference to this very area of cancelling a visa without following the requirements of natural justice that the Chief Justice of the High Court, Mr Justice Brennan, said: It is a matter of the gravest constitutional ance to think that the proposition would be advanced on behalf of the minister that this court does not have the jurisdiction to control unlawful acts committed by the minister. That was with regard to the cancellation of the visa of Mr Ervin. The government can propose legislation which allows the minister to act without regard to natural justice-but why do it? If you intend to make decisions which are reasonable, which are based on available evidence and which are not biased, why exclude natural justice? I go to section 501C(1O). This bill proposes to exclude some people from the right of appeal against the decision to refuse to grant them a visa or to cancel an existing visa. There is no indication in this bill which individuals or groups should be excluded, nor is there any indication of what grounds they should be excluded on. That is an issue of concern to the opposition. I suggest that if you feel that some people should not have these rights, at least make it clear who these people are and why you think so. I raise this because I think this is also an issue that should be more properly considered if we succeed in having the bill referred to the Senate committee for further detailed consideration. I think the minister should seriously give consideration to the question I pose with respect to this issue this evening. Otherwise I suggest that you are proposing a very wide power with nothing to fetter such discretion and nothing even apparently to guide it. That is of major concern to the community at large. That is the basis of our contentions on natural justice and that is the basis of our various amendments on the natural justice question. We will also move an amendment on the limitations that the minister is placing on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's processes. We are concerned that 42 days is too constrictive. This subsection compresses the time frame for a person seeking review of a decision to refuse a visa application entry permit to 42 days. If the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has not made a decision within 42 days, the proposed provisions deem the tribunal to have affirmed the decision under review. Assuming that the person takes the allowable seven days to lodge their applicaimporttion, this gives the Administrative Appeals Tribunal a mere 35 days to hear and determine the matter and give a decision. In practical terms, this will have a significant impact on the access to justice of persons denied visas. The current process for all applications to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, not just migration ones, is an average of 45 weeks. According to the 1996-97 annual report, from the filing of the bill, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be under considerable pressure to drop other matters that do not have such statutory time limits in favour of these section 501 applications. In addition, section 501 applications tend to take longer than other applications as the applicants themselves are frequently unrepresented, sometimes in gaol or often in need of an interpreter. That is why we are eager to see adopted our amendment which substitutes 42 days with 90 days. I have proposed that the many dubious aspects of the bill be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee as a result of consideration of these issues within the opposition. In conclusion, I will return to where I started. The Labor opposition supports the stated intentions of this bill. In doing so, I want to ensure that we keep out of Australia those whose behaviour poses a threat to Australia. We do not support those aspects of this bill which would see us behaving not as a democracy but as a dictatorship, allowing people to enter the country, or not, at the whim of the minister. Clearly, the amendments that we are going to seek to move during the consideration in detail stage are aimed at trying to overcome potential difficulties that we have with the bill. They are not aimed at trying to weaken the intent of the government or to frustrate government's endeavours. From our point of view, issues of major concern have to be properly considered in this debate. On that basis, I would clearly indicate that we will seek to move the amendments that I have outlined during the consideration in detail stage of the bill.",73
221,Mr HARDGRAVE,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"The Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill is very important to a lot of people in my electorate. Like a lot of honourable members in this place, we have so many people from so many different countries who have come and settled in our various constituencies. Even in some of the more Anglo-Celtic parts of my electorate, state schools are speaking 60 or more languages as a matter of course in everyday life. Children of all ages, their parents and their grandparents are certainly seeing very obvious signs of new people from various parts of the world coming to live, earn a living and create a life for their family here in Australia. Recently I had the great honour of representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) at the latest installation of Australian citizens at Brisbane City Hall. Mr Ruddock-Keep on going like that and we'll send you to more ceremonies.",75
222,Mr HARDGRA VE,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"Thank you very much, Minister. I will happily fulfil that honour. Roughly every six weeks 600 new Australians take their oath of citizenship at Brisbane City Hall. It is quite exciting and exhilarating to watch people coming here with great expectations and great aspirations. They are very keen to work very hard, be good Australians and realise all of their ambitions. That is really what in so many ways the bill before us provides for. We are, after all, a nation which has been built on immigration. This government has an absolute responsibility to effectively discharge a very fundamental responsibility as far as the integrity of those who come to Australia come to stay and those who come to visit are concerned. It makes very good sense to me and all on the government side-and I am sure those on the other the side share the concern too-that those who have some criminal background or criminal association should not be given easy passage or an easy time when coming to us here in Australia. I have people in my electorate who' have come as refugees from Bosnia, Somalia and the Hom of Africa. I have people who havmigrated as business migrants from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. I have all sorts of people all keen to be good Australians here. They support the sort of measures the minister has placed in this bill. If you want to get an idea of the rapid change Australia is undergoing, you could take a look at the birth and death notices in the daily metropolitan papers. You will see the death notices are probably filled with a lot of Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Celtic names, while the birth notices are filled with a lot of names from every other background, including the Anglos. I submit that this country needs to be able to manage change in a way which provides real confidence to all of our citizenry. Whether you have been here for 150 years like my family or whether you have been here for 150 days, you need to know the government is acting in an open, honest and accountable way to ensure the integrity of those who come to this country. I think it is worth noting some of the urban myths perpetuated around the country have been very effectively put back in the box by a recent release of a series of fact sheets which I have taken the liberty of circulating to service clubs, high schools and other organisations around my electorate to ensure people understand just how good the integrity of migrants coming to this country really is. The area of health checks alone. shows that is a fair point to make. I have made it in this place before, and I know the minister has made it as well. In so many ways, because of the various hoops migrants have to go through to get to this country, their health is arguably better than those who are born here. Mr Ruddock-That's proven.",75
223,Mr HARDGRAVE,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"It is proven. So it makes good sense to me to ensure the character and the conduct of people coming to this country are also beyond reproach and beyond any doubt. To do otherwise destroys the absolute integrity of what is a very important nation building exercise-the ongoing migration and acceptance of people from other parts of the world into this country. I support this bill before us today, especially because I want everybody in my electorate-wherever they have come from or wherever they were born-and everybody in this country to be very satisfied this is a government looking very openly and directly at how quickly the world is changing, how people's movements are increasing, how migration arrangements must be designed to streamline the entry and stay of genuine visitors while filtering out those we do not want here, ensuring those who have substantial criminal backgrounds and criminal associations stay out. We want the visitors. We want the students. We want the business people. We want the permanent residents. We want all the people who want to come to this country to contribute to its overall wealth and its make up in a positive way. We want to make sure we have measures to detect visa applicants with substantial criminal backgrounds. We need to be able to consult law enforcement bodies overseas. We need to be able to ensure noncitizens with a criminal background or criminal associations are refused a visa. That is what this bill is all about. It has come about because existing legislative provisions are totally inadequate for this particular task. This bill is all about protecting the Australian community by strengthening the provisions in the Migration Act 1958 and the various amendments made in 1992 by the previous government which relate to the refusal or cancellation of visas on character grounds. It will enable the government to act more quickly and effectively in dealing with applications made by non-citizens who are not of good character. It will do this in three ways. Firstly, it is effectively going to reverse the onus onto the applicant to prove good character rather than the department, as is the case currently, by standardising the levels of criminal sentences which will attract automatic refusal of a visa application. This will allow the minister to give binding directions to decision makers within the department. Most people recognise the need for these changes, as only last year we had the case of Lorenzo Ervin, a convicted terrorist and hijacker who was able, by courtesy of our own laws, to thumb his nose at all attempts to cancel his visa. The setting of a clear benchmark in respect of criminal behaviour will avoid charges of arbitrary decision making like those levelled in the contribution by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). This means we can send a clear message to intending applicants about the standards of honesty and behaviour Australians expect. It will also send a message to all Australians born here and those who have become citizens since arriving here that standards of honesty and behaviour will be enforced by this government. As the minister said in his own second reading speech, the level of criminal behaviour we are talking about is: Non-citizens who have been convicted to a single sentence of detention of 12 months or more, or where the length of several sentences aggregates to two years or more, will fail the character test. I do not believe any responsible person in this place will disagree with that measure. Since 1992, the decision makers have been required to establish whether or not a person is not of good character before they could refuse a visa application or cancel a visa. If there has ever been any doubt about criminal background or criminal association of a non-citizen, it has tended to be the case that the doubt has been resolved in the non-citizen's favour. Is it any wonder some make great mileage out of matters relating to migration? So this government is doing a lot to put to bed some of the urban myths that have been portrayed, even by people in this place. The second provision contained within this bill gives the minister the authority to decide in exceptional circumstances or emergency circumstances whether a visa should be refused or cancelled or whether a non-citizen should actually be deported. Australia is certainly noted for its social stability. People in my electorate come from all sorts of sides of all sorts of arguments. - have people who come from both sides of the argument in Sri Lanka. I have people who come from the very many sides of the argument from the former Yugoslavia. I have people of Muslim background who have very strong beliefs. In the main, these people leave those arguments at the doorstep. When they become Australian citizens they conduct themselves as Australian citizens shouldwith a broad range of tolerance for a range of views which they may not necessarily agree with but will, in this free democratic society in which we live, listen to providing those views are expressed in a responsible way. New migrants understand there could be viewpoints contrary to their own. This bill means people like Gerry Adams and David Irving, people who have applied to come to this country on various occasions, quite rightly, because they have caused controversy, because they have some interesting backgrounds associated with their conduct, should not be given an automatic right of entry into this country. That is in Australia's national interest. The third provision within this bill relates to confidential information which is passed from Australian and interhationallaw enforcement agencies to immigration decision makers. Information will be given greater protection protocols to prevent unauthorised access or release. This makes perfect sense because anybody who is in the criminal information and related information business realises it crucial, when assessing the criminal background or associations of non-citizen visa applicants and visa holders, such information should be protected. But no-one is going to give us information about a potential migrant or potential visitor to this country if they know information is not necessarily going to be kept confidential. We need greater protection for such material. It will certainly complement the broader national and international strategies needed to counter transnational crime, for instance. So I think in this regard the bill is painting a very sensible measure for consideration. Unlike the contribution of the member for Batman, I submit to this House the bill does I not signal any sort of witch-hunt; nor should its intentions be misinterpreted ,as a call to the people, like perhaps the one made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), to differentiate and discriminate between people born here and newer Australians. It really is one of those unifying acts of this place. It gives all people-as I said, whether they have been here 150 years or 150 days-a great deal of confidence in knowing all who pass the tests and all who pass through the hoops and barriers put in their way and qualify as either Australian citizens or visitors to this country do so because they are people of great integrity. The member for Batman suggests perhaps there should be some provision because there is a problem associated with a sense of natural justice and perhaps detention should be extended to 90 days-all at great cost to the taxpayer. This is one of the matters which have been dealt with in this bill. We are looking at the various review processes necessary to ensure people's integrity or otherwise. We want to streamline those processes. We also want to ensure the time limits which apply are far more reasonable both to the detainee' and to the taxpayer. A great expense is being borne by the Australian taxpayer as we set out determining whether or not people should be allowed to stay. The provision of interpreter services and legal aid, all met by the Australian taxpayer, is a great generosity I think we should continue to is extend, but I must submit there are some in our country who find it difficult to understand. There will also be from time to time emergency cases which - ill involve non-citizens who could be deemed a significant threat to our national sovereignty and our community. These people may be threatening violence or perhaps some other act of destruction, or have a prior history of a serious crime. There is a need to act in an emergency sense, and I think this minister in particular is very capable, very experienced and very able to determine when matters should be dealt with in this way. It is also worth noting the joint standing committee on this particular area is looking into the issue of criminal deportation at the moment. It is good to see some bipartisan discussion taking place in a sensible way. At the end of the day this bill is a very important piece of legislation, because it is all about the nation-building exercise of migration and about the international relationship building exercise we continue to have as good international citizens. It sends a clear and unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian community to all those intending to move here. As well, it sends a message to the Australian community that their government is determined to ensure non-citizens coming to Australia are of good character. That a government will act in this way is an important expectation the Australian people have and it is being met very well by this bill. It is worth noting those who come to this country and choose to stay and are accepted as Australian citizens and take an oath of Australian citizenship do something perhaps people born here never get around to doing: they publicly declare their loyalty and their determination to be good Australians. The minister notes this often in his public addresses at citizenship ceremonies, and I have heard him say it. I think it is worth recording in the Hansard for this place something which all those who are born here should feel very sure about: not only do people who come to this country have to undergo rigorous health checks and, as a result of this bill, even greater character and good conduct tests but also they do so knowing at the end of the day they are out to prove themselves as great Australians. I am happy to say so many of them do. I commend this bill to the House.",76
224,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"These are very substantial provisions that we are debating this evening. There is no question of that. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill fundamentally changes the current character provisions in a number of ways. First, it prescribes a character test which a person cannot pass if they have a substantial criminal record as set out in the act. That includes any person who has been sentenced to imprisonment for more than 12 months at any time and at any age. It further includes any person who has an association with another person or group which the minister reasonably suspects has been involved in criminal conduct regardless of whether that association has in fact affected the person's character. I suppose the second important area is that it removes the rules of natural justice in cases where the minister acting personally decides to refuse or cancel a visa 'in the national interest', which I observe is not defined. Third, it provides a non-reviewable personal power to the minister to refuse or cancel a visa despite an earlier decision by either a delegate or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to either grant or not cancel a visa on the same grounds. That effectively allows the minister to intervene 'in the national interest' and substitute a less favourable decision despite there being no further or other evidence reflecting on the person's character. That certainly does do away with the review process because, even if a person has satisfied an independent tribunal that they should be 'granted a visa or not have their visa cancelled, the minister, without appealing that decision in the Federal Court, can simply substitute another decision which cannot be appealed again to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So we do effectively end up with an arbitrary and non-reviewable power to refuse or cancel visas vesting personally in the minister. It also allows the minister to set aside a decision of his delegate or refuse or cancel a visa which has been appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to substitute a new decision to refuse or cancel under section 501B which is not reviewable, and so effectively ends a person's right to review even though that first decision might still be under consideration by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It effectively replaces the right to an independent and determinative review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with a right in some circumstances to make representations to the minister. It also severely restricts the ability of applicants to present their case by reducing the appeal time to seven days. It restricts the applicant's rights to certain documents. It denies the applicant a statement of reasons for the decision and sets very short time limits on the capacity of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to decide a case. Let us look at that a little further. Clause 21 of this bill inserts, amongst a number of things, proposed section 500(6L), which compresses to 42 days the time frame for a person seeking a review of a decision to refuse a visa application. What it is saying is that, if the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has not made a decision within that 42-day time frame, the proposed provisions deem the tribunal to have affirmed the decision under review-that is to say, the minister's decision is what applies unless the Administrative Appeals Tribunal makes a decision within 42 days. The way this works out is that a person has seven days to lodge an application. That gives the Administrative Appeals Tribunal a mere 35 days to hear and determine the matter and give a decision. This will have a significant impact on the access to justice of persons who are denied visas. It is worth pointing out that the current process for all applications to the AA T-not simply the migration onesaverages 45 weekS, according to the 1996-97 annual report of the AAT, from the filing of the application until the date of hearing. Given the severe compression of the time available proposed by the bill, what you will see is the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under pressure to drop other matters that do not have such statutory time limits in favour of these section 501 applications. In addition, it is worth noting that section 501 applications tend to take longer than other applications. The applicants themselves are frequently unrepresented, sometimes in gaol and often in need of an interpreter. All those factors of course increase the complexity of the hearing process. It is apparent that in certain circumstances the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will not be able to make a decision until 14 days after the minister has been notified of the application for review. It is also worth spending a little time on clause 23, which replaces the existing section 501 with a much more expansive section that greatly increases the minister's powers to refuse to grant a visa or to cancel a visa. That proposed provision will i- effect introduce a two-step test such that the decision by the minister to refuse to grant a visa because the applicant does not pass the character test, which is itself expanded, is reviewable. But then the minister may override that initial decision, still refusing to grant the visa or cancel the visa if the minister 'reasonably suspects' that the applicant does not pass the character test or is satisfied that it is in the national interest to refuse to grant a visa. That second type of decision is not reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The bill expands the character test so as to define what qualifies as a substantial criminal record. If a person has a substantial criminal record, which includes simply having been sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment or two or more terms of imprisonment that add up to two years' imprisonment, then they can be denied a visa or have their visa . cancelled. The minister has a broad discretion to override this, and one would indeed hope that that would be used. If we were referring to a political prisoner or something of that character, it would be quite improper to use this provision to deny people in that circumstance the right to come to Australia. So what we end up with is a situation where the minister has been given extremely broad powers to exclude visa applicants. The opposition has received some pretty strident criticism of the proposals that have been put forward by the government and which we are considering this evening. One piece of correspondence I have from a firm of solicitors states: The bill elevates the Minister to a position of absolute monarch by granting him arbitrary and almost unfettered powers which are not subject to scrutiny by either a tribunal, a court (save possibly the High Court) or Parliament ... the bill vests in the Minister a draconian power to refuse or to cancel a visa ... regardless of how long they have been in Australia if they have at any time in their lives been sentenced to a jail period of 12 months or is a person that has associated with someone who has a criminal history. They point out the possibility that someone like Nelson Mandela could be deemed to be of bad character. The correspondence also says: . . . the bill also gives the Minister the power to refuse or cancel a visa to someone who is associated with criminals, regardless of the nature of the association. I suppose in the most extreme case they raise the issue of criminal lawyers, prison officers, psychologists, church members and so on in the context of association. They also express opposition to the way in which the bill jettisons much of the independent system of merits review and point out that the minister, acting personally, can override a decision made by his own delegate or the AAT without necessarily giving the person the right to know the case against them. I think that is a very important point. They also express concern about the fact that, if someone's visa is cancelled by the minister, under these provisions they are automatically banned for life from returning to Australia. They cannot return even for a short visit, regardless of the length of time that has elapsed since the original decision to cancel the visa, and that ban is imposed regardless of whether the person has Australian citizen children or an Australian citizen spouse. The suggestion is made against that background that the bill might even be unconstitutional, because it vests the executive with functions which are judicial in character. They make reference to a number of factors-the effects of the decision upon the individual, the individual circumstances of the person subject to the decision are not taken into account, it is not subject to effective merits review, and the process precludes natural justice or otherwise limits the ability of the subject of the decision to put their case. Against that background, there is that kind of concern. The previous speaker, the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), says that the existing system of legislation is so unsatisfactory that those who have been concerned about the bill have expressed the view that the minister already has broad powers to refuse or cancel a visa on the basis of character, that extremely few cases taken to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are successful and that the minister always has a right of appeal against such cases. They argue that the bill is unnecessary . As the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) has pointed out, the opposition does accept the basic stated premise of the bill: that people who are not of good character should not be granted visas and that, if they are granted visas, those visas should be able to be cancelled. We are concerned to ensure that criminals or people who are members of criminal gangs do not come to Australia. I also express the view that those who indulge in racial vilification should not be allowed to come to Australia. I have no problem whatsoever with the decision made by successive governments not to allow David Irving into this country; we do not want to see people who are going to intimidate Australian residents.",78
225,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,What about Gerry?,80
226,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"To be candid, the case of Gerry Adams is an open case. I know my predecessor saw this issue differently but I think the British government ought to be negotiating with those concerned. But it ought to be getting something back before we review the case of Mr Adams. The opposition believes that, if a person who has a substantial criminal record has failed the character test, they should not be allowed to enter the country. This is a question of getting the balance right. The member for Batman and I, and other members of the opposition, are sympathetic to the prospect that a minister ought to be able to decide who comes to Australia on character grounds and that, through the minister, the community ought to be able to decide on character grounds who comes to Australia rather than having these things determined by tribunals or courts. Certainly, considering the resources which have been invested in some of the cases which have occurred, there seems to have been a very poor use of scarce resources, and this is something that we would have sympathy with the minister about. Against that, there always need to be some safeguards against the arbitrary use or abuse of that power so that, in extreme cases-I am not suggesting that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who is at the table, would engage in these things-you could not have a situation where the minister says, 'This person happens to be the husband of my former wife and I do not want to see them here,' and uses the character test to prevent them coming to the country. Mr Ruddock interjecting",80
227,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"You have to be able to check these things. Or the minister's office gets an anonymous phone call, saying, 'So-and-so is a member of a triad gang,' - therefore, they are not allowed to come to Australia on the basis of an anonymous phone call rather than on evidence which is more substantiated and more sound. The opposition will endeavour-and we will discuss these things further in consideration in detail-to move a number of amendments which, we feel, soften the less satisfactory features of this legislation but which will still enable the minister to have significant additions to his power to make decisions on character grounds about who will and who will not come into Australia. The number of cases where decisions to refuse visas on character grounds have been overturned is not large but a number of recent high profile cases have captured a good deal of media attention. There was reference made, by way of interjection, to the case of Gerry Adams, and we had legal proceedings concerning that. We also had the full Federal Court upholding the minister's decision concerning a visa to David Irving, and the case of Lorenzo Ervin has been discussed by the shadow minister as well. These sorts of cases do not invariably involve political figures. In the case of Wag v. the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, we had the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirming the minister's decision to reject the applicant's visa application on the grounds of bad character-a case involving family sexual abuse. More recently, in the case of Grandlouis v. the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal set aside the minister's decision concerning an application for a spouse visa. The person involved had been convicted of manslaughter in 1986, was released from prison in 1991, married an Australian citizen in 1993 and had a daughter who was an Australian citizen. It was argued on his behalf that, while he was not of good character when he committed the crime for which he had been sent to prison, he was currently of good character and had not reoffended. Some concern has been expressed about this issue in the context of this bill: that is, the possibility of rehabilitation ought to be understood and accepted by the government and by the broader community. The situation can arise where people are gUilty of quite serious offences when they are young. The possibility of reform and rehabilitation ought to be noted and the government and the minister should respond to that. In the case of Mr Grandlouis, the tribunal concluded: ... the time that has elapsed since Mr Grandlouis' offences, the lack of evidence suggesting a likelihood of his re-offending, and the overwhelming evidence of thorough rehabilitation, make this such a case- . The tribunal was satisfied that he was a person of good character. In noting these kinds of cases and expressing the view that we, as a community, ought to be capable of coming to those conclusions about people's character reforming, I do not want to leave the impression that I am starry-eyed about these things. Recently I had representatives in my office who were appearing on behalf of a person whom the minister is seeking to deport, that person having been convicted of offences involving heroin trafficking and also not being an Australian citizen. I said that in my office we pride ourselves on the standard of service we provide to constituents and on the way in which we try to help people, but that, to be candid, in a case like this I would deport him too if I were the minister. Notwithstanding some of the arguments that are put about family detriment-and let me say a person who is in gaol for eight years does not really function as an effective father to his children-it seems to me that there is much more serious family detriment caused to many other families by those who are involved in heroin trafficking. From my point of view, that kind of conduct is unacceptable and not the kind of conduct we want from anyone in this country. I understand that cases come forward where ministers ought to have the power to determine who will and who will not be in the country. In the case I mentioned, those who came forward pointed to the decision in the Teoh case. I said that if I had been the minister, I would have made the same decision as was made in the Teoh case by the minister. In those circumstances, where you had that background of serious criminal offences, there was a strong case for a minister to make clear who should and who should not be in the country. As I said, the opposition will not be opposing the bill. It is important that the minister have these powers, but in consideration in detail we will be pursuing some of the issues we think can soften some of the bill's less attractive features and create a fairer and better balance all round.",81
228,Mrs ELSON,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I am pleased to speak in strong support of this Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions Relating to Character and Conduct) Bill. We all know Australia is a great place to live. Each year for many thousands of people from nations across the world, it is a great place to visit. We have a reputation as an open and friendly nation, welcoming visitors as well as those who want to make Australia their home. This is something we can be proud of. Indeed, it is crucial, to ensure that our tourism industry continues to expand. This is why we must have an efficient immigration system designed to streamline the entry of genuine visitors and permanent residents while ensuring that people who enter this country are of sound character and background. It is a reasonable expectation that non-citizens who wish to enter Australia must meet certain standards. It is a very strongly held expectation in the Australian community that people who have substantial criminal background or associations will be refused entry to Australia. However, there have been examples in recent years of the inadequacy of the system of checks and balances put in place by the former Labor government. It does not meet these reasonable community expectations. That is why the coalition government has introduced this bill. Like most of our legislation it is a good, common sense approach. It helps ensure that decisive action can be taken to safeguard our national interests. This bill enhances the government's ability to deal with this issue in a number of ways. Firstly, the decision making in routine cases will be improved by changing the onus of proof to require that an applicant shows that they are of good character. Since 1992, the onus has been on the government to prove that someone is not of good character before a visa can be refused. This bill will reverse that situation so that the government can refuse an application in the first instance. It will then be up to applicants to mount a case and prove that they are of good character. Also certain levels of criminal sentencing will lead to an automatic finding that the applicant is not of good character. Basically, non-citizens who have been convicted of a single crime which led to their detention for more than a year, or several sentences which add to more than two years, will automatically fail the character test. This makes sense, and I am sure that most Australians would believe that such a basic test should form the benchmark for the character test. It will streamline the assessment process as well as providing greater certainty about who is able to pass the character test. Also the government will have much greater control over the discretion that is used when deciding whether to refuse an applicant or cancel a visa. The minister will prescribe exactly what factors are to be considered, and those decisions will be binding on all decision makers. The process of appeal will be retained, but there will be strict time limits on it, so that the merits review cannot be used to prolong someone's stay in Australia. Currently someone who is already in Australia and has had their visa cancelled on character grounds can apply for a merits review. On average, it takes about 250 days for a decision to be made, and sometimes longer. During this time, the person, who may have committed a serious crime, is either in gaol, at tralian taxpayer, or, worse, free to roam the country. This must stop. The community expects better, and this bill will ensure that the merits review cannot be used as a stalling tactic. Further, in exceptional circumstances or emergency cases the minister will have the power to overturn decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to cancel visas without prior notice. This is absolutely crucial. It amazes me-and I am sure it amazes most Australians-that we can have situations where the elected government does not have the power to take decisive action to act in the national interest. I am not saying the government has a monopoly on wisdom, but I do believe we are elected to govern, to make decisions and to be judged by the Australian public at the ballot box every three years. I believe most people expect the government to be the highest decision making body in the land. That is surely the basis of democracy. This is why there is growing community anger at situations where the government is hamstrung and unable to act decisively, whether the cause be an obstructionist Senate led by a bitter and destructive opposition or a High Court that rather than merely interpretin ing the law begins to formulate it. It should be entirely within the power of the elected government to have the final say on the laws of this land. That is what we are elected to and that is what our community expects us to do. We can be held to account for those decisions at an election. The High Court is not held to account by the Australian public. It should not have power over the elected government. This government has had to face more and more obstacles in order to get on with the job we were elected to do. We have a bitter and arrogant opposition which time and time again takes a very partisan, negative approach. It refuses to accept that the coalition was elected to govern in the national interest. It tries to block things we were specifically elected to do, such as the recent and highly successful Telstra float which has proved to be very much in the national interest and will see us begin to repay our a cost to the Ausnational debt. I guess we cannot ""expect Labor to recognise that this is in the national interest. They are the ones who have mortgaged our future by running debt from $28 billion to over $170 billion. They left behind a massive $10 billion deficit which they kept telling us was going to be a surplus. I will not go any further into the litany of economic mismanagement which is Labor's record: I could be here all night. It is clear they would not know national interest if they fell over it! But I am pleased to say that this government does-which is why we have introduced this bill. It sends a clear message that, as a nation, we expect that the people coming to our shores should be of good character. It is one step the federal government can take to enhance community safety and security. Crime is a concern for many people. It was the top issue raised by the people of Forde in a survey I conducted before the election and continues to be of paramount concern for many of my constituents. While policing and sentencing are the responsibility of the state government, the federal government has taken decisive action a number of ways. On the matter of sentencing, there is still a long way to go to meet the community's expectation of fairness. There must be truth in sentencing and more do appropriate punishment to fit the crime. The public has a right to ask how someone can be granted bail on sex offences and, while on bail, be under investigation for the murder of two innocent teenagers, as we have tragically seen recently. Put simply, the community deserves better protection. As I said, these are matters for the state government and I will certainly continue to lobby the Queensland state government for tougher sentencing. As a federal government, we are taking action. The bill we are discussing tonight will give us greater powers to refuse entry to criminals from overseas and to send home those who commit crimes while here on visas. Last year the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) acted decisively in response to community concerns to ensure a national approach to gun control. This has seen the banning of semiautomatic weapons and greater consistency in the granting of gun licences. The national approach helps police ensure that only those who have a legitimate use for a gun have one. It has seen the handing in of many thousands of banned weapons, which means fewer guns in the community. In Forde there are many rural residents and recreational and sporting shooters who have had to make adjustments and changes, and I thank them for their cooperation. The Prime Minister acknowledged that some people would be slightly inconvenienced by the changes, but in the interests of the general community uniform gun laws are essential. The new laws, like this bill we are discussing, make sense and reflect community expectations and values. The Howard government has also taken decisive action to tackle the drug problem, from which stems so much misery and crime. The tough on drugs plan, announced a few days ago, is our $87 million plan to catch the pushers and peddlers, educate our children and assist those struggling with addictions. A recent survey found that over 80 per cent of crimes committed in New South Wales last year stemmed from drug usage. As a community, we are all affected by the drug problem. We pay through theft and damage of our property; we pay through increased insurance premiums. Some families suffer the pain of seeing a loved one's life destroyed and, tragically, many hundreds of Australians each year pay the ultimate price-their lives. The tough on drugs plan is an important first step. No-one expects the problem to be solved overnight. Community safety is a priority for this government and we are not going to put crime into the too-hard basket. The changes to the migration legislation we are discussing here tonight will help ensure that the people who are convicted drug dealers do not enter our shores for a holiday or for any other purpose and that the Australian government has direct control over who enters this country and on what basis they are allowed to stay. That is a pretty fundamental role of any government. It reflects the expectations of the community and it is yet another way we can help ensure the safety of all Australians. I am pleased to support this bill on behalf of Forde residents and I commend the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) for taking decisive action to protect Australia's interests.",82
229,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I appreciate the enthusiasm of the previous speaker, the member for Forde (Mrs Elson), to support her government. That is understandable, being on the backbench at a time when those in electorates with small margins are getting a bit vulnerable. Mrs Sullivan-Don't be patronising.",84
230,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I am not being patronising. I have been in that situation. I know exactly what it is like. You do have to stick by even the most unpalatable things. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) will not attack me because I am going to congratulate him on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions Relating to Character and Conduct) Bill in a minute, but I just want to make a couple of observations. Firstly, one of the problems in accepting an argument that the government are being tough on crime is that they have been cutting back on resources for federal law enforcement agencies for so long-not just this government; the former government of the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) did exactly the same thing, and they have to accept responsibility for it. They cut back Customs, they cut back the NCA and they cut back the Australian Federal Police. We had the rather ludicrous situation earlier during this particular parliamentary period when the government sponsored legislation under the mutual assistance legislation which, in effect, prevents Australia-prevents the Attorney-General-from exchanging information in relation to a person who has been arrested and charged with an offence that involves a capital punishment in another country. That may not be an Australian citizen; it could be any citizen. We have the rather ludicrous situation, given that we are going to be hosting the Olympic Games in the year 2000, that were there to be a terrorist arrested in the United States and charged with an offence such as terrorism or murder which may involve a capital offence-particularly in the case of, say, the Oklahoma bombing-that unless the United States has asked for information from Australia that would help lead to that person's conviction and unless the United States government gave an undertaking they would not carry out the penalty, then the Attorney-General is obliged, under the law, not to provide that information. In this region, amongst our neighbouring countries' law enforcement agencies, Australia is called a NATO country-it is not in some way associated with the best aspects of NATO-'No Action; Talk Only'. Australia is seen as a soft place in the detection and arrest aspects. of and in its dealings with hardened drug traffickers. I would support the power being extended to the minister to enable him to prevent those types of people from entering the country. I am going to make a couple of observations about the Victorian police evidence to the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority hearing in Melbourne recently that reflects on the Crown Casino. I am sure the member for Batman would be interested in that. In the case of the gun laws, he mentionedMr Martin Ferguson-You don't think I'm giving Lloyd Williams any money, do you?",84
231,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"No, you are missing the point. That is the trouble with speaking too soon-you do not know what I am going to say. I was going to say that in the end, unfortunately, there was an overreaction to the gun laws. I recollect clearly the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) considering quite openly the concept of crimping and blocking in the case of multiple cartridge shotguns; unfortunately, that was not allowed to come to pass. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the coalition, and particularly the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, for the direction taken in the package of improvements to the nation's migration laws that they have introduced into this parliament over their term of government. I say that because unfortunately, under the previous government, the migration laws were used as a political football. They were corrupted and they were bent. I represent an electorate in which a large number of people are migrants and I can say that, after being a member for almost eight years and having dealt with migration applications almost on a daily basis, many of my constituents were cheated during the period of Labor government. They were told by the v;arious ministers that they were being treated in an equal and fair way but, as evidenced in the statements of the coalition minister, the Labor government blew out one area. of the migration program in order to accommodate its political objectives and made restrictions on the other I had applications from sponsors who were sponsoring people eminently suitable for settlement in this country. In some instances they had jobs, places to live and all sorts of other things. But unfortunately, because the line of the points test was used ruthlessly and objectively in their particular cases, they were dealt with unfairly whilst at the same time, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has pointed out, the former government was blowing out the family preferential category in such a way as to corrupt the migration program. This came several years after Prime Minister Hawke had corrupted the refugee program in one fell swoop. That was after the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. The refugee program, of which Australia could have been immensely proud having contributed in a humanitarian way over a substantial period bf time, was corrupted in one fell swoop by the then Prime Minister who, overcome by emotion, made a unilateral decision that was not even put to cabinet in the first instance. We saw the rather ludicrous situation where the sons and daughters, or nephews and nieces in some instances, of the political links from the People's Republic of China were being considered as somehow likely to suffer repression if they had to return. I believe that, under the circumstances, those people who were in the camps around South-East Asia, participating in the refugee program in good faith, had every reason to feel anguish and anger at the fact that their interests had been abrogated by the then Labor government, acting as it had to support the Prime Minister who was making this unilateral decision on the spot. Despite the great furore over immigration policy in Australia over the last two years, indisputable truth is that our national immigration program was out of control in the last years of the Labor administration. People expect that migration, like almost any other ernment program, should be delivered fairly and with equity and compassion. Fundamentally, though, they also believe that our migration program must operate primarily in our national interest. Their view insists that government implements their wishes, responsibly manages the program and protects society from any problems that may arise. This legislation goes a considerable way towards satisfying public demand for a migration program which protects Australians from undesirables who may seek entry to our country for whatever purpose, and allows the government to act in the public interest and to remove those who may already have entered Australia. In his second reading speech the minister stated that the purpose of the bill was to ensure the government could effectively discharge its fundamental responsibility to prevent the entry and stay in Australia of noncitizens who have a criminal background or who have criminal associations. I am happy to see he also made the important distinction, which we must remember, that the vast majority of non-citizens who come to Australia are law abiding. The Bill's Digest states that the main purpose of the bill is to strengthen those provisions of the Migration Act 1958 which provide for the refusal or cancellation of visas on grounds of character. Both of these ambitions are laudable if the government can put in place the right legislation to achieve these goals whilst protecting both the fairness and the integrity of a nationed al migration scheme. If they do, I think we will have gone a long way towards meeting the expectations of constituents. The minister has told us that this bill seeks to enhance the government's ability to deal with non-citizens who are not of good character in three ways. Firstly, decision making in routine cases will be improved by requiring applicants to show they are of good character by prescribing that certain levels of criminal sentence automatically deem an applicant not to be of good character and allowing the minister to give binding directions to decision the makers. Secondly, it will allow the minister to act personally on matters of visa refusal or cancellation and the removal of non-citizens. Thirdly, information provided by Australian gov- and international law enforcement agencies will be afforded more effective protection so that such agencies can remain confident that information passed to immigration decision makers will be protected. These seem to be important improvements to the current system, provided the government can implement its intentions through the legislation. In the first instance, I think we must have procedures in place which allow for the quick and effective removal of people whose presence in Australia is not in our national interest. I accept that even the best system available is prone to error and people who are not suitable visitors or migrants will arrive here. But I would like to see a mandatory investigation of every step in the process which allowed them to get here, complete with remedial recommendations for the department or minister. One of the problems we face as a nation, as the previous speaker mentioned, is achieving a proper balance between stimulating growth and investment through the tourism industry, which means making travel and access to Australia much easier for a wider group of travellers, and providing adequate background checks on those visitors so as to protect our citizens. I have been interested in the electronic travel authority, ETA, program sponsored by the government for travellers from Japan, North America, Singapore and parts of Europe. The scale of the situation is illustratby the facts. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, John Moore, advises that last year 783,000 people from Japan chose Australia as a travel destination. This number is expected to double by the year 2005. It is vital that we make travel from Japan to Australia as easy as possible if we want to keep or, more importantly, expand our market share. It may be possible, in the case of Japan, for adequate checks to be conducted with the parent government. However, it seems curious that regular allegations of easy access into and out of Australia by Japanese organised crime figures continue and that we, in conjunction with the Japanese authorities, seem unable to restrict the issue of visas to such people. The parliamentary secretary who was at the table earlier, the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), has been a strident critic in the past of the entry of Yakuza gangland figures, particularly into the Gold Coast area. She thought it was extraordinary that they were moving so effectively and with such ease around Australia, from one casino to another, and that they were able to buy property and the like. I recollect that some time ago, but still in recent times, it was quite clear that Australian authorities had limited opportunities in relation to this particular aspect of the entry of gangland figures. I was surprised when a former Chairman of the NCA, Tom Sherman, mentioned that there were only two people in the Australian Federal Police-or maybe it was in the Customs Service-who actually spoke Japanese. That is an example of the lack of resources which I was referring to earlier. It is the sort of thing that most people would assume is straightforward, and I would expect that since then there has been an improvement in the situation. I certainly hope so, particularly under this government, which purports to be working towards improving these types of problems. It is a much more difficult question when Australia must rely on the thoroughness of criminal checks conducted by less reliable parent governments. Minister Ruddock has advised us that by the year 2000 the number of Chinese nationals wanting to come into Australia is going to increase by 500 per cent. He also advises that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has made significant advances in efficiencies and the manner in which it works. He stated that the allocation of resources depends upon assessments made in relation to risk factors. The evidence we received from the Victoria Police, amongst others, in relation to the Crown Casino was of interest. They said that they could not identify suspected senior or major criminal figures who may be coming to the casino to highroll in the highroller room and, they suspect, to launder or tum over drug or criminal related money. This leads me to another situation which I have expounded upon on a number of occasions, and that is where the government has an essential conflict of interest between its role as a beneficiary of, for instance, a casino operation and its responsibilities as the body responsible for making sure that the place is operated according to the expectations of the community. And the Commonwealth government is not able to escape from its share of the blame. At one stage, Tom Sherman, who was then Chairman of the NCA, criticised the federal government for the situation on Christmas Island where people could arrive on Christmas Island without having to get a visa, gamble at the casino and then move on. He said that he considered that to be less than satisfactory until one of the beneficiaries-the West Australian coalition government of the timecomplained about it, and he quickly bit his tongue. There was a similar occurrence back in the 1980s with the Burswood Casino when the then assistant commissioner of crime, Mr Max Marshall, complained that the West Australian Police could not properly oversee junket gamblers arriving in Perth to gamble at the casino. He got dumped on by the then Labor government from a great height and was forced to back off and keep his mouth shut. That is the sort of situation where you see this conflict of interest occurring. I know it is something that the minister at the table would not indulge in because he has acted in .a responsible way, but some of his successors might find themselves in a conflict of interest where, for instance, a person of dubious character who may be on his way to gamble at one of the casinos-which earn so much revenue for some of the state govemments-is prevented entry. I might also say that it is revenue that is absolutely invaluable, given the vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth. But that is another story. Having seen the effects of efficiencies in the Australian Federal Police and the Customs Service, I can only expect that resources are being cut or reallocated from one area to another. When dealing with matters of security, reallocation based on risk assessment means that we are prepared to accept that some unsuitable people will find it easier to enter Australia through low risk sources of entry, and the government is prepared to accept that situation in order to plug a bigger hole somewhere else. I would like the minister to specify the scale and range of resource reallocations that have been made to ensure the task will be completed properly. Members here know my position on illicit drug trafficking. It has been established that some people travelling to Australia and cleared by our visa checking system have been involved in drug tn,ificking. Some of these people have been ;;upported or sponsored by family and business contacts in Australia. I do not wish to see any easing of our already weak barriers to these criminals in order to deal with an increased workload in the department of immigration or the Customs Service. Turning to the character test, I firmly believe that this move to place the onus of proof of good character on an applicant to be a substantial, positive move. Access to Australia should be clearly demonstrated to be a privilege granted by the government on behalf of its citizens and should not become some kind of right that anyone can claim. I would have thought that, in any test of the sovereignty of a government, that is a fundamental right and responsibility on the part of the government, and I applaud the government's decision to apply the principle that the objecstrong tive of protecting the Australian community will take precedence in immigration decision making. Having listened to the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) talking about Gerry Adams, I support the government's rejection of the visa application for David Irving. In my view, irrespective of what one might think of his other writings, some of his more recent writings in relation to Goebbels are offensive. It can be clearly shown by eminent historians that, in some instances, David Irving has indulged in fabrications not only which he knows are offensive but also about which in some instances-in conversations or reported interviews that I have seen-he does not particularly care as to whether they are offensive or not. Quite clearly, the argument that this is an infringement of freedom of speech is ridiculous, given the fact that Irving's materials are quite readily available. His two most recent books are available in the parliamentary library and elsewhere, and I am sure that if one wanted to get hold of David Irving's interviews or videotapes it would be extremely easy to do so. So that argument is not applicable. It is a question of character and, given some of the most recent evidence of his behaviour at some rallies in Germany, there are clear grounds to show that he has behaved extraordinarily in recent timesbehaviour that many Australians would find offensive and unacceptable in a visitor to Australia. So I find the move to have a character test to be the right decision. Finally, may I deal with the amendments proposed by the member for Batman, who is anxious to restrict the powers of the minister in relation to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Given that experiences have led people to feel that the immigration program does not work and that the minister is powerless to intervene in cases where somebody arrives on our shores who is clearly of unsuitable character, I would have thought it necessary to beef up those powers to ensure that the minister is in a position to cancel a visa or detain a person who has arrived in those circumstances. Of course I am a staunch advocate of' a accountability system, but at the end of the day decisive action seems to be what the Australian community is asking for. The Australian community watch these things happening, throw their hands in the air, figuratively, and ask, 'What on earth is the government doing about it?' Often the government is hidebound because of all the extraordinary legal processes through which it has to go. Then the community find out that the people concerned may have access to legal aid in order to be able to participate in that legal process and defend themselves, and again there is this exasperation throughout the community-an exasperation that grew almost intolerable under the previous governmentof 'Why on earth can't the government do something about this?' That is why I have to reject in particular amendment No. 3 of the member for Batman. I think he is trying to tie the minister's hands behind his back at a time when the community is demanding decisive action. The minister is politically accountable for his decisions-like it or not, he is. In the case of David Irving, I cannot see a ground swell of public outrage. If there is a case where the community feels strongly, then you can rest assured that the minister will get to hear about it. Of course, if it is something that is unjustifiable, intolerable or unjust, then I am sure that the minister will suffer the political consequences, and in my view that is a quite strong test in its own right. Therefore, I feel that those amendments ought to be rejected. Once again I congratulate the government on endeavouring to tighten up the migration rules. I look forward to this bill being carried without the amendments proposed by the member for Batman. (Time expired)",85
232,Mr ZAMMIT,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I am very pleased to rise and join this debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997. Before I go into the main thrust of what I would like to say, I want to make reference to some of the comments made by some of the members opposite. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) made reference to Australia being referred to in the Asia-Pacific region as NATO. I think that was the word he used.",89
233,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"No Action; Talk Only, Paul.",89
234,Mr ZAMMIT,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"No Action; Talk Only. He also went on to say that Australia, and by implication the Australian government, is seen by the Asia-Pacific region to be a soft place. Then he mentioned the issue of guns and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). All I can say is that I feel extremely strongly about the specific issue that he has raised. The honourable member for Moore cannot have it both ways: the Prime Minister acted decisively but now all of a sudden the honourable member for Moore says that he has overreacted.",89
235,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I supported him, but he went too far.",89
236,Mr ZAMMIT,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"That is fine, but I do not think that we should be saying that the Australian people and the Australian nation are soft. When tough action is needed, tough action will be put forward. This bill is a very strong indication of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) and the government reading the mood of the Australian community. The honourable member for Moore also made mention of the government cutting back resources",89
237,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,And the previous one.,89
238,Mr ZAMMIT,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"And the previous government-for the NCA and the Federal Police. Obviously I do not have the figures with me, because I did not know what the honourable member for Moore was going to talk about. I cannot tell him exactly what the budget was for the five Australian security organisations but I suspect that it has gone up substantially, especially in view of the fact that the Olympic Games are not so far away. The ASIO budget-I am a member of the parliamentary committee on ASIO-has gone up substantially, and I am very pleased to see that. By and large, I would like to commend the honourable member for Moore for his very strong contribution and his support for the minister and the bill before the House. I refer to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). I must say that I have a lot of time for the honourable member for Wills, especially when he appeared before the fair trading inquiry undertaken by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, of which I am a member. He spoke a lot of sense. But I am not quite sure that I agreed with his sentiments tonight when he said that he thought that the minister for immigration, who is at the table now, may receive an anonymous phone call and, based on that anonymous phone call, the minister may act and take certain steps that may prove to be, in the longer term, not in the best interests of the person involved. I do not believe that any minister of any government, certainly not the minister at the table, would act in such a way. The opposition will be very sorry that they have opposed the major portion of the bill by trying to tie the minister's hands unnecessarily. I do not think that the opposition have read the mood of the Australian community in general. I am a migrant. Admittedly I came to Australia a long time ago. I am very conscious of hearing of crimes being committed. It is something that I feel. I know that others who are of non-English speaking background who have come to Australia as migrants are also conscious of it. As soon as you hear of a major crime being committed, the first thing I ask-it is something that I am used to doing, unfortunately-is what is that person's name. I feel a sense of shameÂ· that anyone would come to Australia and act in a way such as this. As I have said, I do not think that the opposition have read the mood of the Australian community in regard to this very important issue. The feeling out there is that, unless there is a strongly held view that the minister will act quickly and will be able to deport those who are undesirables quickly, the whole migration program is going to be seen as a negative by the Australian community. They say, 'If you can't run a migration program, maybe it is best we cut it down to nothing. If you can't have visitors coming out here who can be properly vetted, then we would rather not have them.' That is a very unfortunate thing. It plays into the hands of those who have the extremist views that have been expressed in public and, by one particular person, in this parliament. There is a very strongly held view in the community that these administrative appeals tribunals have been less than effective in dealing with a lot of the issues that go before them. Quite frankly, if that had not happened, if the delays had not been such that the community was crying out for action to be taken and taken quickly, I do not think we would have such a bill before this parliament. But it just had to be. There is no doubt in my mind that the Australian community has said, 'Enough is enough.' The minister has to have the right to act and to act quickly. I would like to remind these tribunals and the members opposite of the words of Justice Michael Kirby which I read only recently. In 1986 his decision in the New South Wales Supreme Court case known as BLF No. 2 I believe stands as one of the great monuments in Australian constitutional law. I feel so strongly about it that I believe it should be read every morning by those who sit on semijudicial tribunals. Kirby quotes the great constitutional scholar Albert Venn Dicey: There is no legal basis for the theory that judges, as exponents of morality, may overrule acts of parliament. He then quotes Lord Reid: In earlier times many learned lawyers seem to have believed that an act of parliament could be disregarded, in so far as it was contrary to the law of God or the law of nature or natural justice, but since the supremacy of parliament was finally demonstrated by the revolution of 1688, any such idea has become obsolete. The final and most profound words must go to Kirby himself: The unbroken law and tradition has repeatedly reinforced and ultimately respected the democratic will of the people as expressed in parliament. It has reflected political realities in our society and the distribution of power within it. I also [recognise] the dangers which may attend the development by judges of a doctrine of fundamental rights more potent than parliamentary legislation. Such extra-constitutional notions must be viewed with reservation, not only because they lack the legitimacy that attaches to the enactments ultimately sanctioned by the people. But also because, once allowed, there is no logical limit to their ambit. They may undermine the rule of law and invite the only effective substitute, namely the rule of power. If the legislation is clear, and though the judge considers it to be unjust or even oppressive, it is not for him to substitute his opinion for that of the elected representatives in parliament. The situation quite clearly is this: the minister represents the parliament. The minister makes decisions and the minister lives or dies by these decisions. If the members opposite feel that the minister has made a judgment in a particular case that was ill advised, they have the right to take the matter up and try to embarrass the minister if that is what they think needs to be done. I think it is absolutely vital that the minister be given the discretionpeople ary power to keep people out of Australia who are of bad character and to remove those who are already here who are of ill repute. The bill remedies the situation in three ways. Firstly, applicants will be required to show that they meet the good character requirements of the act. Secondly, give enhanced powers to the minister, such as overturning decisions of the AAT and enabling the cancellation of visas, so that he is able to act decisively in urgent decisions. Thirdly, the bill allows the minister the keep material received from overseas law enforcement agencies strictly confidential. Such information is vital for an effective criminal screen and should not be bandied about willy nilly. Section 51 of the constitution gives the parliament the right to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Australia with respect to immigration and emigration and the influx of criminals. At the present time, that right is being whittled away by unelected, unaccountable, unrepresentative tribunals, and the bill corrects the imbalance. I commend the minister for the courage he has shown in introducing the bill in the face of opposition by some of those opposite. I believe this is a much needed bill. It corrects the faults left to us by the previous Labor government. I very strongly support the bill before the House.",89
239,Ms HANSON,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"For too long Australian taxpayers have borne the cost and embarrassment of assessing the character of people who are simply criminals. It is well past time for the government to speed up and streamline procedures to refuse entry to persons of bad character and to deport all criminals who are not Australian citizens. The Australian people are suffering terribly from the mismanagement of past and present governments and are tired of the intolerable waste of public money on foreign miscreants and parasites who, in many cases, receive better clothing, food, housing and legal aid than the law abiding taxpayers footing the bills. As the following examples demonstrate, the good nature and generosity of the Australian have been shamelessly exploited by criminals and the legal vultures whose profiteering makes a mockery of our immigration and legal system. Australian taxpayers recently funded an action by a convicted sex offender to win the right to stay in Australia permanently on the grounds that he was a the bill will person of good character. Mr Le Geng Jia, a Chinese national, was sentenced in February 1995 to 6Y2 years gaol for sexual penetration without consent, withholding a person's liberty, and threatening to assault and kill. When Mr Le Geng Jia appealed the sentence, the Western Australian court of criminal appeal upheld the sentence, describing it as 'lenient'. When Mr Le Geng Jia was refused residency on the basis of his criminal record, he went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Could any Australian honestly believe that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal not only found in his favour and granted him permanent resident status but also claimed he was of good character? A convicted and gaoled sex offender of good character! By what criteria do the lunatics at the AAT make that assessment? I must applaud the actions of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, who fairly quickly moved in and overturned the stupidity of the AAT ruling. Mr Le Geng Jia has now ta.k the minister's cancellation to the Federal Court and, thanks to the Western Australian Legal Aid Commission, is spending taxpayers' money in his bid to still call Australia home. This animal, who could only be vaguely referred to as a human, not only had the gall to claim to be of good character but, while enjoying the relative luxury of an Australian gaol, has had the misplaced funding of legal aid right from the very start. Australian citizens, particularly in Western Australia, must wonder why they cannot access legal aid as easily as imported rubbish like Le Geng Jia. Under One Nation's policy this visitor, who defiled his invitation to study in this country, would have been immediately deported under treaty to serve his sentence in his own country and his record stamped 'Never to return'. Currently, a convicted Canadian murderer is trying to immigrate to Australia after the Administrative Appeals Tribunal overturned a federal government decision to ban him because of his serious criminal history. Once again, I must question the dubious decisions of the AAT, who consistently prove themselves to be a bunch of incompetent dunderheads. In 1986, Mr David Grandlouis received a lO-year prison term for slitting a man's throat in a fight over drugs. After being paroled he was returned to prison following a car chase with police. Following this further assault on decent Australians by the never vigilant Administrative Appeals Tribunal, we will all be left wondering whether this two-time loser will make his third attack on an unsuspecting Australian public at some stage in the future. Surely, the only people to benefit from admitting David Grandlouis to Australia are in fact the people of Canada who, I am sure, have plenty of other killers they will be happily sending our way. Chinese immigrant Duncan Lam is reportedly Australia's largest heroin importer and a Vietnamese refugee Duong Van Is is believed by the police to be Australia's largest heroin distributor. The police further report about 90 per cent of Australia's heroin importations are conducted by Chinese drug gangs. Are we expected to believe these Asian gangsters came to Australia as decent, honest, law abiding human beings who somehow just fell into a life of crime and then managed to climb to the top of their heinous profession on the backs of their young Australian victims? Are we seriously expected to believe these purveyors of depravity and despair were not criminals before coming to Australia? How on earth did these people get into our country in the first place? Let's face it, low lifes like these have slipped through the net, and it has to stop. Under the proposed legislation the minister can revoke or refuse a visa on character grounds, but this decision can be overridden if the person applies for a protection visa in accordance with the United Nations refugee convention. Once again, we see how the power of the United Nations has the potential to endanger the Australian population, in this case by allowing the possibility of international gangsters to fight their way into Australia under the guise of refugee status. Australians, through the government and the minister, should have the sovereign right to determine the type of person and the number of people vie let into Australia, not the United Nations or any other international body. With the time restriction of 42 days for the AAT appeals being introduced by this proposed legislation and other options to prolong stay in Australia being cut off, it is probable that even more people will lodge claims for protection visas. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs does not keep formal records which allow the linking of refusal of visas on character grounds with the later application for a protection visa. Citizenship status is also no longer public information. The Australian people have had enough. Under One Nation's policies you would not be eligible for Australian citizenship until you had been a permanent resident for five years. Committing any offence bringing about a sentence of more than 12 months would result in immediate deportation under our international criminal treaty plan. Further to this, we would investigate the means to revoke citizenship in the case of those who commit serious crimes such as rape, murder, drug trafficking and paedophilia, with the criminal assets to be sold to defray costs and compensate victims. In no case would legal aid be granted to anyone other than Australian citizens. This bill is a start but, as with much of this government's legislation, it does not even come close to satisfying the needs of the Australian people.",91
240,Mr RANDALL,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I am very pleased to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill. The main purpose of this bill is to strengthen those provisions in the Migration Act 1958 which provide for the refusal or cancellation of visas on character grounds. I believe this is great legislation which tidies up a lot of anomalies and certainly addresses the concerns of many of the Australian pUblic. My interest in this bill is largely attributable to a number of my constituents who contacted me earlier this year expressing concern about a man who was granted a permanent visa to this country on the basis of his good character. In fact, I received a petition from many of the residents in my electorate of Swan regarding this matter and I was able to tell them that I would be speaking on this matter and that the government was addressing this legislation in the House. The particular person I am referring to is Jia Le Geng. He was granted a permanent visa to this country on the basis of his good character. This is the same man who did not even serve half of his 6Y2-year sentence for offences including sexual penetration without consent, assault occasioning bodily harm, unlawful detention and threatening to do unlawful harm. Believe it or not, in a bizarre twist, this man's victim, also a former Asian student of Perth, had her application for permanent Australian residency rejected by the immigration department. The victim became a victim in more than one way. It is a frightening state of affairs when our Migration Act can deem people like this to be of good character. I must say, though, that close inspection of Jia Le Geng's case does indicate that there were some unusual circumstances surrounding his behaviour. It certainly appeared that he may have acted out of character. Nevertheless, within the definitions of the law, a person must fit or not fit into the definition of good character; otherwise we simply have no point at which to make decisions about their suitability to remain as temporary or permanent residents of Australia. The Jia Le Geng case does of course demonstrate some of the problems this government faces with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which has the power to overturn some vital decisions and to make some very vital decisions. Sometimes they are perceived as extraordinary mistakes. I acknowledge, though, that the AAT has upheld some of the minister's decisions. So it does not get it wrong all the time. However, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is not the subject of debate here, so I will not dwell on it. Suffice to say that this government has taken steps to address some aspects of that body's administration quite independently of this bill. The Migration Act was amended in 1992 in order to improve the government's ability to deal with visa applicants and visa holders who had a substantial criminal background. The legislative amendments were clearly not tight enough though because we have since seen many instances of people with criminal records either for crimes committed prior to entering Australia or crimes committed once inside Australia attempting to stay here. As has already been outlined, this bill will enable the government to identify an act against those not of good character in the three following ways: firstly, the application . of a character test; secondly, by giving the minister, acting personally, powers in exceptional or emergency circumstances to act decisively on matters of visa refusal, cancellation and removal of non-citizens; and, thirdly, by allowing for the provision of information by law enforcement agencies to immigration decision makers. Let us address the character test. The amendments proposed in this bill introduce the concept of a character test, as we have said. There have been many high profile cases of people attempting to gain legitimate entry and visitation to Australia through our existing Migration Act which, until this bill is passed, is just not tight enough. I have already mentioned the case in my own state of Western Australia where a student had been gaoled for violent crimes and was deemed to have been of good character, unbelievably. In fact, there was outcry locally and in the media. It was in my electorate. This student attended Curtin University, and it was something that I certainly had to take on board. We also know of the case of Lorenzo Ervin who in 1969 was convicted of air piracy, hijacking-he was a member of the Black Panthers-and kidnapping in the United States. Clearly, such a person is outside the accepted definition of good character. We need to have provisions which will allow for a refusal to grant a visa or immediately cancel a visa in the national interest in instances such as this. We know the kerfuffle that occurred around Lorenzo Ervin and his supporters. This bill does provide for this. Presently in Western Australia we have a situation where the immigration department is seeking to deport a man who raped his stepdaughter and is wanted by the police over a shooting incident. This man is not in Australia by virtue of legal visas but as a result of an illegal visa gained when he entered Australia from the Philippines in 1981. Nevertheless, it brings to light an area in which the character test will assist the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs by reducing the number of deportees. With the strengthening of the character the obvious result will be that fewer people who are not deemed to be of good character will not be given legal residential status in Australia in the first place and fewer will need to be deported once their crimes have coine to light here. This not only alleviates the pressure on the resources of the department of immigration but goes some way to safeguarding the integrity of our immigration laws. Whereas the 1992 amendments to the act meant that decision makers were required to establish that a person was not of good conduct before they could refuse or cancel a visa, the government's amendments before us today quite rightly place the onus on the applicant to prove that they meet the criteria of the character test and that they are of good character. So the onus has changed, which is quite sensible. Clear benchmarks through this character test will determine whether someone is of good character. Convictions of single sentences of detention of 12 months or more, or where the length of several sentences combine to two years or more, will lead to a failure of the character test. As I mentioned earlier in the Jia Le Geng case, there were some circumstances in his particular case which raised questions about whether he was not of good character. As I also suggested, we do need to have benchmarks or we will have no framework by which to make these decisions. This is also what these amendments do. This concept is obviously designed to provide more certainty as to who is able to pass the character test. I think this will help the Australian people generally to understand why a person has or has not been granted entry to this country, particularly in those controversial cases such as those we have seen in the past year or more. That would certainly address some public outcry, particularly in those cases where the public is not informed of the detail. In relation to ministerial decisions, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997, which strengthens character and conduct, enables the minister to have the ultimate authority to set aside an unfatest, vourable original decision of a delegate or applicant even while that decision is subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The ministerial decision would not be reviewable by the AAT, so giving the minister ultimate authority in these matters, which again I believe is quite right. The minister will remain thoroughly accountable as the bill provides that, should the minister revoke a decision under proposed section 501(3) or 501A(3), they must notify each house of parliament within 15 days of the revocation. With regard to intelligence, presently the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has difficulty obtaining and utilising vital intelligence on certain applicants due to the possibility that information might become disclosed and breach privacy. This bill increases the level of protection of this type of sensitive information which will give greater confidence to international Australian intelligence agencies. This will assist those in the department who are making decisions about the eligibility of people to remain temporarily or permanently in Australia. One of the arguments that arises on this particular aspect of the bill is that the provision to refuse visas or cancel such visas without notice is an infringement of civil liberties. I understand this is an aspect of the legislation the opposition does not support. Their 'no natural justice' claim does not hold up in comparison with the sentiments of the Australian people who do not support the idea of violent and dangerous people who have been convicted of crimes being allowed to stay in Australia. Often this is about perceptions. The Australian people, quite rightly, believe they should have greater protection from those sorts of people. Gerry Adams, for example, has been refused a visa by not only this government but also previous governments on the basis of his political alliances with the IRA, which is notorious for using violence, threats, intimidainformation tion and murder as a means of bringing attention to their political cause in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. People who are so openly associated with organisations which employ these tactics are, without doubt, not the kinds of people we could just let into Australia and assume they can have the types of freedoms we afford to people of good standing and good character. After all, Australians like their way of life and do not want to be intimated or feel threatened. I understand the opposition is also not supporting our amendment which provides that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal must complete its review of decisions made under section 501 within 42 days of the day on which the applicant was advised of the decision. Essentially, if the AAT has not completed its review in this time, the subsection deems the AAT to have affirmed the original decision. I understand the opposition is seeking to extend this to 90 days, which the government thinks is unnecessary. Currently, such reviews are taking on average 200 days. In fact, the 1996-97 Administrative Appeals Tribunal annual report states that the average time of a review is 45 weeks-not too short of an entire year. This bill, quite sensibly, addresses the ridiculous time reviews are taking. Clearly this process needs to be streamlined to provide some certainty for those applicants awaiting the outcomes and those Australians concerned with the outcomes, not to mention because of the costs of such lengthy delayswe know what it costs to keep somebody in detention. The opposition should be supporting the government, on humanitarian grounds alone, considering the applicant will, in most cases, be in detention pending the outcome of the decision. Forty-two days is a far cry from 45 weeks in detention-a point that should be understood. Unfortunately, the review process has also been used in many cases around the country as a way for applicants to extend their time in Australia. The government's amendment balances the expedition of review of character decisions against the need to ensure that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has relevant and sufficient time to properly review a particular decision. Once a decision has been made on the basis of an applicant not being of good character, the applicant will not be able to use the review process as a mechanism to prolong their stay. This is in a similar vein to the boat people who decided some time ago that they would congregate on our northern shores and use every mechanism in the legal framework to extend their stay here. They not only exhausted every appeal mechanism but also used the resources of Australia-the legal aid system and the framework of the legal system which are meant to provide support for good Australians looking for similar support. As we know, some of these people were held in detention camps at Port Hedland, but they overflowed into the Curtin air base because so many of them were able to manipulate the system to stay for a long time, and many of them used that opportunity to escape or sue the Australian government. Many wanted to sue the Australian government because they had been in detention for too long. Some even resorted to diving head first off the roof of the Port Hedland Detention Centre to injure themselves and claim compensation and extend their stay in Australia. This is the sort of rorting of the current system, as it exists under the Migration Act, that the Australian people abhor. I know the opposition abhor it. Senator Jim MCKiernan was vociferous in his criticism of this sort of delay and manipulation of the system. Mr Ruddock-He is slipping a bit now.",92
241,Mr RANDALL,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I certainly know Senator Jim MCKiernan is on the record as having a prolonged and sustained criticism of the manipulation of this process. I could go on and give many more case studies, but I would find that hard to do after some of the ones that have gone before me. In conclusion, this legislation importantly addresses the aspects of the Australian immigration laws which have not been amended since 1992. This is just another example of the coalition government acting to improve the integrity of the decision making in relation to immigration-something the general Australian public has been crying out for for a long time, and it took a coalition government to do it. The government, with this bill, wishes to ensure that people overseas know there is a strict character requirement in country. By limiting the number of dangerous criminals within our country, we are therefore improving the security of all Australians. When I go to citizenship ceremonies and when I move around my electorate I see the number of people who want to come to Australia quite legitimately. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who is at the table, would know, we are trying to assist enormous numbers of people to come to Australia. For example, in Belgrade 10,000 people who would like to come to Australia are on the waiting list but only about 250 are accepted per year. These people want to come to this country for the great benefits that it brings. They want to come here legally, and they want to make a contribution. Also, as outlined by the new amendments that the very good current minister has put in place regarding the type of people whom we want to bring into this country, it is very important that we scrutinise the character of those people who come here and make sure those who are not of good character, or those who come here and then decide they do not want to become Australian citizens but decide to flout our law and basically treat this try in a similar way to the way they would treat the country from which they may have come, do not get that opportunity. It is just not on. I commend the minister for these amendments, and I commend the bill to this House.",96
242,Mr RUDDOCK,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"in reply-I would like to take the opportunity of thanking the honourable members who have participated in the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997. I might commence with the honourable member for Swan (Mr Randall) as he is the only one remaining to hear the comments that I am about to make. But I do offer some supportive observations to the comments from the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), the honourable member for Forde (Mrs Elson) and the honourable member for Lowe (Mr this Zammit); from the Independent members who spoke, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson); and from the opposition members who spoke, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). I will take the opportunity tonight to reiterate some of the observations that I have made in relation to character issues generally, and I will take the opportunity of responding to each of the amendments that have been proposed and why I believe that it is not in this country's interests that they be supported. The member for Batman, in his remarks earlier this evening, made it clear that the opposition supports the thrust of the proposals that the government is bringing forward and recognised that there is a need for legislation to deal with long standing issues of concern. I have not sought in this to put too much blame on the opposition when it was in government for some of the difficulties that have been occasioned, but I think it is important to note that at various times when the opposition was in government and sought our cooperation on character issues it had that cooperation and legislation that was in the counnational interest was supported by the then opposition. I assume that the extent to which the character provisions were weakened, as they were, by the former government was not a deliberate intention on their part to do so. I have given them the benefit of the doubt in relation to that. But let me make it very clear what is being proposed here tonight by way of amendments: this is a considered view, presumably, of the opposition. The provisions that they are seeking to amend will water down very considerably, as I will explain, the capacity of the government to deal with character issues. Members will see it as clearly not a matter of any inadvertence when I have explained to them the nature of the measures that are proposed, the evil that they are intended to address and why they have been drafted as they have. I would like to make some observations about the quality of ministers in whom a great deal of trust has been reposed over a long period in relation to immigration matters. I have known ministers over 20 years, and I would not criticise anyone of them for the way they have exercised the responsibilities that have been reposed in them in the national interest. I have known something like seven or eight Labor ministers, and the powers that we are seeking here will undoubtedly be powers that will go into the hands of a Labor minister at some future time and they will be accountable, as any minister from this side will be, for the way in which those powers are exercised. But there are very clear public policy reasons why the interests of this country need to be protected and why we need to have powers to act quite quickly and sensibly in certain circumstances. This is an expectation that the community has of its government. The fact is that there has been a considerable weakening in recent years of the way in which our provisions operate. I would like to say to the member for Wills, who has now joined us, that one of the reasons that we have a concern is not the large numbers of cases in which ministerial decisions and departmental decisions have been overturned by the AAT. I recognise that the cases where the AAT have acted to effectively degrade the quality of decision making have occurred not because of the numbers but because essentially of their precedential character. Every decision that is made by an AAT member, every decision that have been made at that level, becomes a basis upon which officers of my department when they seek then to apply the law are bound to take into account. They have not been made by the parliament; they have not been made by a minister. Essentially the framework of law under which character decisions are reached are degraded because AAT members are substituting their own jUdgment at times for that of a minister elected by the people. It is the view of the government that in these matters the final responsibility rests with the government of the day, not with unelected officials, to determine who shall be able to come and remain here permanently or temporarily in Australia. There are certain principles that the government accepts. We should be very positive in relation to immigration and the benefits that it can bring. We should have a program which is non-discriminatory. It is one that we need to maintain public confidence in. We need to ensure that people of character concern can be removed. We need to be able to ensure that the government has the power to regulate entry and to remove non-citizens quickly from Australia. We need to ensure that we do not abrogate our responsibility in providing for the security and well-being of Australian citizens. One of the fundamental aspects of government responsibility is in having the power to regulate the entry and presence of non-citizens in Australia who have shown by their conduct that they are not of good character. The community expects that the government will be in the driving seat in these areas because of the potential harm that can be caused to the Australian community. The changes that I am about are to restore that public confidence. I want to remind the House that the coalition did make it clear in its policy that it would act as necessary to guarantee confidence in our screening and assessment procedures. Statistics have shown-it has been brought out tonight-that the majority of non-citizens who come to live here are very law abiding. Many demonstrate a total commitment by becoming Australian citizens. However, there is a small percentage-and I stress it is only small-who breach our trust and obviously breach the trust of the Australian community as a whole by their actions. The community expects that, as a consequence of people's failure to obey Australian law or by their conduct before they come to Australia, if they commit offences or indulge in conduct which is unacceptable to us, they have forgone their right to remain here and should be removed. I have previously indicated that the changes . this bill makes provide a very clear message, and I want to reiterate what that message is. The community does not want non-citizens who are not of good character to be granted visas or be able to stay here. The bill ensures that those who have abused the privilege given to them by the Australian community by committing crimes here are removed. I would like to comment on the opposition amendments. The first seeks to restore section 37 of the AAT Act which by this bill is made inoperative. The reason it is made inoperative is that the section deals with providing a statement of reasons in decisions and serving it on the individual. Under the proposed section 501 G, those notification provisions founded in section 37 of the AAT Act are intended to be replaced to ensure that a person is properly notified at the time when the government takes its action to deal with the character issue. So potential AAT applicants would, if the opposition's amendment were carried, have double the advice-the advice that is required to be provided under the new section 501G as well as that which is provided under section 37. Clearly, this opposition proposal is simply a nonsense. Let us go on to the question of the time for decisions. My colleague the member for Swan dealt with this very effectively in his observations tonight. The fact is, and it ought to be understood in the immigration area, that delay is something that very often works to the advantage of a non-citizen and costs the community a great deal. If people are in detention, the delay in decision making means that people are often detained longer than they might otherwise be. We are seeking to ensure that, to, enable. the matter to be dealt with quickly, people have all relevant documentation provided at the' outset of the process. We do not believe there will be additional workload on the AAT. We believe in fact it will be less, because of the other changes that have been made. There is scope for savings. Currently the AAT is averaging 227 days to make a decision on character issues, whereas most of my departmental decision makers require only a day to make a decision once all of the papers are to hand. We do not consider these provisions are at all unreasonable. We consider the amendments that the opposition is proposing will disadvantage the community as a whole. I will just emphasise the cost of detaining people. If they have their visas cancelled, the cost runs to something in the order of $150 a day. The longer you leave people with the opportunity to have matters before the AAT, the greater the cost which the Australian taxpayer is going to have to bear. If the opposition wants to play around with those matters-there are clear disadvantages for the Australian community-I guess we can fiddle at the margin of those questions, if they really want to. The other four matters which relate essentially to the natural justice issues are of far greater consequence. They go to the very heart of decision making in relation to people who are of character concern. Let us understand the situation. I certainly do not believe a minister will make many decisions personally. I have probably personally made. I do not want to be benchmarked on this-four or five decisions in the time that I have been minister. So they are not something that is done as a matter of course. Some of them have been mentioned in the debate tonight. I do not want to canvass them. Where I, as the minister, am making decisions personally, even though I can exclude the AAT, I cannot exclude the role of the courts. Decisions are being challenged where they are taken by the minister personally, because the present regime enables that to happen. Let us understand where the opposition comes from on these matters. There are other sections of the act in which a minister is enabled to make these decisions, where they can do so without notice and where there are no natural justice provisions. That happens in section 128 of the act, which provides for 'cancellation offshore without notice and the right of a non-citizen to make a subsequent submission as to why the cancellation or refusal should be revoked'. That subdivision was inserted in the act in 1992 by your government. So a like provision that I am seeking here to have in the act-which would enable a minister personally and in the national interest where he is accountable to this parliament, to his colleagues and the peopl- of Australia in a case where it is appropriate-is, in my view, deserving of support. Trust ought to be given to ministers, as I believe it has been in the past, to be able to deal with those matters in the national interest. I would like to put to you the sort of situation where I believe something like this is important. We have seen today a very tragic set of events in Egypt and a number of people have lost their lives. It may well have been that all those involved could have lost their lives. We have seen other events in other parts of the world where that has been the case. From time to time criminal investigation organisations and security organisations get intelligence about people who are responsible for actions of that kind. There are terrorist organisations around the world that do have people who have committed acts of that kind. If I as minister were confronted with a situation where I had to be able to deal with a person in such an organisation who sought to enter Australia and we did not receive the information in a timely way and they came to Australia under a visa as a tourist, under the provisions that are being put here-the requirements for natural justice-I would have to inform the individual before I could take any action to cancel the visa of our suspicions of him that had been relayed to us by an international organisation. That may leave at risk a person who could have been an informant. I would be obliged to put that information before that person. While that was being done, that person, who may be posing a very considerable risk to the Australian community, would have to be left at large because I could not send my officers around to take him into detention. They are the sorts of situations where this power is properly needed in the national interest. You have to be prepared to trust ministers in a situation like that. There is a provision where, if there are matters that the persons wants to put after cancellation, they are able to do so. As I say, if a minister is using a power like that in an emergency situation, he is putting at risk his total career, in my view, if he were to make the sort of decision that the honourable member for Wills suggested might be possible, having regard to some selfish personal interest arising out of a family law situation involving a family member or some correspondence that might have come in anonymously. He demeans ministers who have acted in this area and who have powers under the Migration Act now in relation to some areas of responsibility which have been reposed in them with a great deal of confidence by both sides of the House over time. I make these comments seriously tonight because I hope that when these matters go before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee mature and sensible consideration will be given to them. I hope there will not be the sort of silly point scoring that I have seen in relation to some other matters that are before that committee at the moment. It is important to recognise that national interest issues and public interest issues are involved. These words do not always get defined. They do have certain natural meanings. I am invited by members on both sides of the House to act now in circumstances where I would admit people to Australia while exercising what is known as a 'noncompellable discretion'. The public interest is a factor that I have to take into account, and I have to do it now. It is not a term unknown in this area of law. I just want to make it clear that we are seeking here to give the government of the day the power to be able to make decisions which are favourable and decisions which are unfavourable, to be able to make decisions to admit people where the scheme might generally lead to their refusal of entry and to be able to exclude those people where it is in the public interest that we are able to do so and where there is proper and creditable information which cannot always be made known to the other party-to applicants-or even to tribunals or to courts. This scheme is designed to ensure that a minister is in a position to deal with those matters. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Amendments (by Mr Martin Ferguson)by leave-proposed: (1) Schedule 1, item 21, page 7 (lines 19-24), omit proposed subsection 500 (6D).

243,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"We are going to debate as one the half dozen amendments which the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) has moved. The effect of these amendments is to delete the proposed subsection 506D in order to reinstate the right to reasons which that subsection would remove. Secondly, we want to expand the period of time proposed in the bill from 42 days to 90 days. That is against a background of cases presently taking in the order of 45 weeks to resolve. Thirdly, amendments 3, 4, 5 and 6 have the effect of reinstating the natural justice requirements to certain decisions of the minister. We do this against the background that the opposition is not opposing the legislation, which is very substantial legislation by any yardstick. In this legislation there are many and varied provisions which will give the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) additional and enhanced powers. He will not be subject to many of the provisions to which he is presently subject. When the minister comes before the House, as he was suggesting in his summing up in his second reading speech, expressing some concern about our proposals, I do not think that represents his actual position. I think his position is one of being very pleased with the extent of support he is receiving from the opposition. The reason we move these amendments is that we are concerned that, taken as a whole, the provisions will give the minister excessive powers. This is an audacious bill in many respects. The risk of abuse is certainly inherent in giving the minister powers which are not fettered by any requirement to apply natural justice or any requirement to a right to reasons on behalf of those who are affected by ministerial decisions. The minister says, 'You have to trust me, not I am the minister.' That is not the way that our system of rule by law generally works. In most areas of administrative decision making, the right to reasons and the provision for natural justice are there. And they are there for good, long standing reasons to do with the way in which we as a community have seen abuses by ministers of their authority from time to time-not all the time-and have seen individuals who are the victims of bias or unfair process or other things which occur within departments and other places. The minister was suggesting that the examples I gave in the second reading debate might be fanciful or far-fetched. But it is not at all far-fetched to imagine that someone can be the victim of an anonymous tip-off. Places like Taxation and Social Security and so on frequently receive anonymous tip-offs. Some of the tip-offs are well-founded. Others have no foundation and are motivated by malice. There needs to be some safeguard against authorities-whether Taxation, Social Security or the immigration department-acting on the basis of information provided in malice rather than on information which is properly founded. I want to say a few words about the matter of natural justice. In Butterworth's Australian Legal Dictionary it is defined as: The right to be given a fair hearing and the opportunity to present one's case; the right to have a decision made by an unbiased or disinterested decision maker; and the right to have that decision based on logically probative evidence. The dictionary goes on to say that denial of natural justice is a ground of review against an administrative decision in Australia, pursuant to the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act, and that, at common law, denial of natural justice allows a review in circumstances where the administrative decision might affect a person's rights, interests or legitimate expectations. Those rights or interests include personal liberty, status and preservation of livelihood and reputation, as well as proprietary rights and interests. (Time expired)",100
244,Mr RUDDOCK,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I would not ordinarily intervene at this time. I would allow the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) to go on. But I would like him to address his comments to the point I made about subdivision F of the act-section 128, which was inserted into the act in 1992. That section acts in exactly the same way as is proposed here in these provisions. It provides for cancellation without notice of a visa offshore and for the right of a person to make a subsequent submission about why the cancellation or refusal should be revoked. We have modelled the provisions here on exactly the same provisions which you or your colleagues thought should operate offshore. What we are seeking to do is exactly the same thing in relation to people who, because they are here, pose a far greater risk to Australians. The pursuit of so-called 'natural justice issues' in the courts or tribunals can leave those people at large. We know that because of the way in which the natural justice loop operates. We saw it in relation to the Lorenzo Ervin matter. I am not suggesting that that pensioned Black Panther, as one might perhaps describe him, posed such an immediate risk that he was still likely to be out there wanting to hijack an aircraft. But we know that he was sentenced to two life sentences in the United States earlier in his life. There were other matters relating to him that gave rise to concern as well. The point I am making is that what that incident revealed about the nature of our law was that if you did have a person who posed a very significant risk to the community there would be nothing in the law that would enable the cancellation of a visa and the taking of that person into custody while the issues were dealt with over the ensuing few days. The regime that we are proposing would enable that to occur.",101
245,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I was not involved in the debate which occurred in 1992, but let me say that there is considerable concern in the circumstances that we have here where what you are proposing is the removal of natural justice in cases where you decide, or the minister acting personally decides, to refuse or cancel a visa in the national interest and the national interest is nowhere defined, so there is the scope or the opportunity for abuse. I note, when we talk about natural justice, that the Chief Justice of the High Court, Justice Brennan has said: It is a matter of the gravest constitutional importance to think that the proposition would be advanced on behalf of the minister that this court does not have the jurisdiction to control unlawful acts committed by the minister. This is an area where there is considerable concern. It is not one where I think the minister has satisfactorily made out the case for taking away natural justice rights for those who are affected by the minister's decision. I go back to making the observation that, by any yardstick, the powers being given to the minister by the bill generally are very substantial powers, and the things to which the opposition are proposing to agree are very substantial powers. What we are saying, however, is that, in the exercise of those powers, there are circumstances in which natural justice ought to continue to applyand that is the legal framework that the minister inherited from the former government-and circumstances in which there is a right to reasons. The other area I want to move on to relates to the question of time. The government has said that if a decision is not made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal within 42 days, then the decision of the minister will be affirmed. So there is no effective right of review to that. That is something that we believe does not reflect the reality of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal process. There is no doubt that there is occasional scope for reducing the time which is presently being taken. I, and other honourable members, I dare say, have some sympathy for the circumstance where people are putting in application after application, appeal after appeal and review after review and effectively tying the government in knots with reviews of these issues. But the fact is that the average time which the current process involves is of the order of 45 weeks. Given the very severe compression of time available proposed by the bill, there will be pressure on the AA T to drop other matters that do not have such statutory time limits in favour of the section 501 applications. All these things will tend to increase the complexity of the hearing process. As a result, it is highly likely that cases - ould go through with either the Administrative Appeals Tribunal not making a decision at all and the minister's decision being affirmed in circumstances where that might not be the appropriate outcome or, on the other hand, other cases which are quite deserving in their own right not being heard because the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been put under pressure to hear the matter within 35 days. I might add that, in that sort of time, quite possible that there will be cases where justice will not be done because the thing is simply being heard too quickly. For example, section 503A restricts the release of information given in confidence by a gazetted agency. Those restrictions on releasing information are much broader than the public interest limitations encompassed by the For Act. So, while you might still be able to seek access to those documents under that act, you would not get them back within the 42 days allowed for the review. If you have circumstances like that, there is the possibility of injustice. Any ened capacity to determine the merits of an application in a manner that the tribunal sees fit could go to its independence. In proposing 90 days, we are saying that we do not support an open-ended arrangement. (Time expired)",101
246,Mr RUDDOCK,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I will take the time to say that I did give a good deal of thought to the issues relating to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The fact is that there is a very considerable growth occurring in the number of appeals, and I think that that is because of the nature of some of the decisions that have been taken-the precedential nature of them. We are seeing a development of a view. Whereas, before, deportation was thought to be a natural outcome of people committing serious criminal acts in Australia, that may no longer be the case. We have seen situations in which people found to be of good character have raped and cases where parties have kept people in, essentially, a form of false imprisonment. There was another situation involving millions of dollars. There was a person who committed murder. In each of those situations, positive findings have been made. I do have a concern about the way in which that is opening up. I had regard to the capacity of the AAT, and the arguments that you were putting were put. The matters that are before us were very much a compromise. I had in mind some shorter periods again when I first gave consideration to this matter. Certainly, I would think that, in the ordinary course of events, for most matters of character, there will be the opportunity for review and the bill sets out some changes in relation to the way it is in which instructions might be able to be given to departmental officers as to matters that might properly be considered, and the ministerial direction would also guide the AAT. It seems to me that it ought to be possible for the AAT to deal with these matters in the time frame that is proposed in this bill. The matters are important. There is a degree of urgency when we are dealing with people's liberty and a quick decision means that the question of their being free outside of Australlessia can be quickly determined or the issue would be dealt with, if it is dealt with positively, in a way that enabled their release within an Australian context. Debate interrupted. NA",102
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. W orkmates Incorporated",103
248,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in this adjournment debate to bring to the attention of this House an exciting organisation within my electorate of Greenway. This organisation trains and finds jobs for intellectually handicapped young men and women. Called Workmates Inc., it is based at Seven Hills. I believe the title of this group is apt and a true reflection of its approach to its clients-the young people it serves. Workmates deals directly with young intellectually handicapped men and women. Many clients have been diagnosed as having dual disabilities: acquired brain injury; and physical, sensory, psychological and behavioural problems. W orkmates works with these young people and trains them. They then go out and, through a growing network of socially aware employers, find jobs for these young people. Sometimes the jobs are part time and sometimes they are only for work experience to assist the young person's ability to fit in. Many employers are wary of taking on such an employee; they do not want the hassle or to deal with the sometimes time-consuming needs of these young people. However, I am pleased to report that the list of willing employers working with Workmates is growing steadily. Workmates is administered by a small board of loyal, committed and devoted people led by the chairperson, Mr Len Grasso. The equally small team of W orkmates employees is led by Silvano Bevinetto, ably assisted by Denise Cameron, Cathy Windass and John Walker. The commitment of these employees to their young clients has to be seen to be believed. They are, like the poard, loyal, committed and devoted to their task. Members of this House would be moved by the success stories that come out of Workmates, where young people who were seen to be very 'different' to other children are performing real work for real wages and real satisfaction. Stories that can be told by parents, who were at their wits end until they found Workmates, indicate that the successes of these young people flow on to the family itself. These young people, because of their employers and W orkmates, areÂ· becoming confident, articulate and proud of their achievements. They are able to travel to social outings, arranged by themselves and as a group. They are able to conduct client committee meetings and assist Workmates by giving advice on improvements to programs. They are able to travel as a group on long trips to the Snowy and to Canberra to visit parliament. All of these things would not have been possible before they started on this program with W orkmates. The success of Workmates after only five years of operation is quite staggering. Support by willing employers is the key to the success of these young people. Some of these employers have been around for some time, such as the Mount Druitt Hospital and Nu Skin Personal Care Inc. of Castle Hill. Major supporters are the MCDonald's outlets in Quakers Hill, Kings Park, Doonside and Dural. To see young men and women who are now full-time employees of these outlets is very rewarding for all those involved in this program. Other employers who have given great support to Workmates are: Sizzler restaurant, Penrith; Franklins Ltd, Pennant Hills; API, Northmead; Hawkesbury Frame & Truss, Mulgrave; Church Building Site, Doonside; Jewels, Northmead; Holly'S Buffet, BIacktown; Blacktown Hospital; Sterling Services, Prospect; Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, Blacktown; Sydney Hi-Fi, Castle Hill; Grand United, Sydney; and the Diet Factory, Granville. These young men and women perform a variety of tasks: cleaning, catering, gardening, process packaging, food preparation, customer service, trolley collection, retail assistant, crew hand, cook, hostess, factory hand, and maintenance and clerical work. All of these tasks need to be performed and are usually reserved for 'normal' young men and women, but these employees have taken the plunge and are employing intellectually handicapped young people who simply want a fair go. They are getting this and they are responding in a magnificent manner, which is bringing great satisfaction to Workmates and unbelievable joy to their parents. They are now able to have proper and meaningful interaction with like-minded friends and with helpful and understanding fellow workmates. An old cliche is, 'A happy work force is a productive work force.' The young men and women from Workmates make that cliche a reality. I express my great pride in the organisation, its board, its staff, its clients and wonderful employees. Future School: Exporter of the Year",103
249,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"In the 90-second statements in this place last Monday I attempted to detail the achievements of a company in my electorate of Robertson. Unfortunately, time did not permit me to expand on some of those achievements, probably quite fortuitously because those achievements have continued to greater heights today. The company, Future School, situated at West Gosford in my electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast of New South Wales, have already won many significant exporting awards. They won the 1997 Australian-British Export Award and the 1997 New South Wales Premier's Exporter of the Year Award in the information industry category, and they are finalists in the 1997 New York Festival multimedia awards. Most importantly, as I mentioned in the 90-second statement, because they were the 1997 New South Wales Premier's Exporter of the Year Award winners, they then became one of the 42 finalists in the 1997 Exporter of the Year Awards. These awards were announced today by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, at the convention centre at Centrepoint in Sydney. I was privileged to be at that presentation ceremony today and I am very pleased to announce that Future School won the 1997 Australian Exporter of the Year Award in the information industry category. Future School is an example of a local dynamic small enterprise which is taking on the world in a very competitive area and achieving quite remarkable results:.It currently employs 20 full-time and 15 part-time local employees. The judges were impressed by the company's success in a market which has traditionally been dominated by the US content providers, many of them very .large companies. Future School markets English and mathematics education systems, on video and CD-ROM, throughout the world. I believe it is now the largest educator anywhere in the world, with some of the education courses its reaching over 1.5 billion people throughout the world. From a small factory in West Gosford on Award the central coast of New South Wales, this company is really going places. Its primary business is developing and exporting these educational interactive CD-ROMS. I have had the privilege of presenting to the management and staff of Future School a certificate commemorating the fact that it was one of the 42 finalists, and I had the opportunity to look at its operations at West Gosford and at its the CD-ROMs. Future School programs go from kindergarten through to HSC level. For countries where educational facilities are not available, the ability to create a classroom situation via an interactive CD-ROM, where highly trained teachers h,ave been videoed and put down on CD-ROM, is a magnificent achievement for Future School and for Australia's ingenuity. The company is the educational content provider for the United Nations Tradepoint DeVelopment Centre and is a fqundation member of the Virtual Classroom and Electronic Education Network. Future School exported $1.7 million in product in 1997 to Asia, North America, Europe and the Caribbean. Along with the other nine national award winners, they will be in Parliament House tomorrow afternoon at a function in the Mural Hall. I look forward to welcoming the directors of that company to Parliament House to celebrate a magnificent achievement for their company and for the central coast. It highlights the innovative businesses we have on the central coast, which are getting on with the job and showing that Australia is truly a very smart country. (Time expired) Adult Migrant English Education",104
250,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I wish to speak on an important local institution in my electorate and in my region which is under severe threat, the Adult Migrant English Services in Auburn, adjacent to the electorate of Parramatta. In September 1997, the central west region of Sydney had an unemployment rate of 14.6 per cent, seriously in front of the national picture. If we look at that central region more closely, we find that, even within it, there are severe differences in the figures. In the Auburn municipality, unemployment is far higher than 14.6 per cent. The clear reason is the presence of a high proportion of people born in nonEnglish speaking countries. The reality in this economy-and in any economy world wideis that not being able to speak the native tongue which is prevalent in business, commerce, et cetera, has very dire consequences for employment. When we look at the national picture, we find a very serious situation. In ABS figures of people who arrived in Australia before 1981, 190,000 people described themselves as speaking English 'not well' or 'not at all'. If we look at the overall national situation, in the 1996 census, we find that 416,000-plus people put themselves in those categories. There is a very urgent need in this country to ensure that the opportunity is available to people to gain the English skills required for employment in the work force. What we are seeing from this government will not be hidden by the daily bravado performances of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) or by the cynical use of statistics, sleight of hand and hyperbole that he goes on with about university education, nor by the attempts to distort the reductions of TAFE funding. The fact is-and this can be seen very clearly by the Australian electorate-that adult migrant English classes in this country are severely threatened. They face the imminent threat of being put out to tender by this government. It is very interesting that this government, in September 1997, through the Minister for Finance andÂ· Administration (Mr Fahey), decided that a subsidiary of IBM-no minor player in the world economy--could be given a $30 million contract without a formal tender, with the minister for finance justifying it on the basis that 'it had saved the expense of going through a formal tender'. The Adult Migrant English Service is an institution which has operated for decades, is widely regarded as having great credibility and has produced materials that have been sold in the public and private sectors around this country, yet the teachers have to obtain formal tertiary qualifications, while their competitors in the private sector do not. Despite the fact that the minister for finance can decide that IBM should get a $30 million contract without tendering, we are going to see AMES basically cut to ribbons by cheaper prices coming onto the marketplace from institutions that have no credibility whatsoever, and AMES will be smashed to pieces. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) had some useful things to say about this in November 1992. He quoted the then Department of Finance as saying: DIMAthat is, the Department of Immigrationfunding of the Adult Migrant English Service was 38% cheaper than funding through competitive tendering by DEETY A. In areas with high concentrations of people from non-English speaking backgrounds-in northern Melbourne, western Sydney and other regions in this country-regardless of who is in power, unemployment is going to be higher because of people's lack of English. There is a situation where housing prices attract people to regions where people from their comml,mity have already arrived. Once again we are seeing this fairly important institution, this fairly important facility, essentially being hacked to death. A few years ago their whole community, regardless of political affiliations, was united in defence of the continued presence of the AMES in Melbourne. Once again the community must defend the 650 teaching jobs in New South Wales and the development of expertise over many decades that are affected by this situation. Little, Colonel Sydney Kyle",105
251,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to speak about a man from my electorate, who lives in Lawnton, whom I have come to know in the past few months. He is a man whom I have come to admire greatly. His name is Sydney Kyle Little, a retired army colonel and TPI pensioner. He is a man with a fascinating history and career and life-a real Australian hero. He was the first white man to walk across Arnhem Land. He did that with his two Aboriginal trackers, Oondabund and Narlebar, almost losing his life in the process but for the fact that Oondabund was able to walk 60 miles away from where he had broken dOwn with one of the other trackers and obtain water and come back again-a 60-mile round trip. An amazing man is Syd Kyle Little. His adventures of that time-he was working as a patrol officer in the Northern Territory in the late forties-are recounted in a book that he wrote called Whispering Winds: Adventures in Arnhem Land. I commend this book to all honourable members. It is a brilliant expose not only of the situation in Arnhem Land but of some incredible adventures. You talk about Crocodile Dundee: this fellow would leave Crocodile Dundee in a kindergarten with baby crocodiles. Syd Kyle Little has swum the rivers up there, and he has encountered the big crocs, the buffalos and what you. What was even more fascinating about him was his setting up of the Maningrida trading post in Arnhem Land. That in itself was a phenomenal feat. That trading post served as a place where the Aborigines could trade the results of their hunting-crocodile skins and other game and so forth that they hunted. They could then trade that with items that were useful to them. The system worked extremely well. After that he went to Malaya, where he commanded a group of Australian and British soldiers in a state in Malaya. He saw service there, having met the great General Sir Gerald Templar. He recounted to my son and me last Saturday being asked by Sir Gerald Templar to take a message to Mr Menzies, as he then was-this was in the mid fifties-to ask him for an improved government commitment to the Malayan emergency. He told of a flight down to Australia, to Canberra. Mr Menzies at the time was in Perth, and he saw Mr MCEwen. He was told that the matter would have to be referred to parliament. That in fact was done while he was there, and he came back with the news that a greater commitment had been made to the situation in Malaya. He told of some extraordinary feats in Malaya. All the time, I can assure you, Mr Speaker, he was extremely self-effacing. So fascinating is this man that you really have to pry some of the information out of him. I met his lovely wife, Marianne. I also met his son, Simon, and grandson, who is named after one of Syd's trackers, Narlebar. The son, Simon, is still running tours in the Northern Territory, in Arnhem Land, at this moment and also speaks of some incredible situations up there and some treks, particularly the escarpment country in Arnhem Land. I found Syd Kyle Little to have an amazing insight. He said that the situation at Maningrida worked very well until the Whitlam government came along with the sit-down money and with Nugget Coombs. I do not wish this as any great criticism of the late have man himself, but from that time onward the situation at Maningrida deteriorated. Once the sit-down money came, as they called it, it was never the same up there. He was very disappointed with what happened as a result of that. Unfortunately, I believe we are going to see the results of that in years to come with the culture being taken away. I salute this man-a great Australian, a person about whom I need a lot more than five minutes to speak. He is not well at the moment, but he is a man of great courage-a great Australian hero. I commend him to the House. Perth Airport",106
252,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I would like to speak about a matter which is very important to a number of suburbs in my electorate-the utilisation of Perth airport and the difficulties which utilisation of a modem airport can cause for residents living in suburbs close to that airport. In the case of Perth airport, it applies in particular to the suburb of Guildford, to the north of the airport; the suburbs of Midland, Midvale and Bellevue, to the north-east of the airport; the suburb of Beechboro, to the north-west of the airport; and potentially in the future, if the airport is not managed properly, suburbs such as East Perth, Maylands, Bayswater, Ashfield and Bassendean, to the west of the airport along the Swan River. There are a number of issues which go to the management of Perth airport, some of which, in the first instance, fall as a responsiwhom bility to the new privatised owners-Westralia Airports Corporation-and some of which fall to the government. I have been a long standing critic of the failure of this government' to continue the previous government's policy of extending the compensation regime for those residents most seriously adversely affected by aircraft noise, from Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport to Perth airport. That compensation, by way of acquisition of residences or amelioration of airport noise by insulation, is particularly the case so far as the residents of the suburb of Guildford and South Guildford are concerned. So far as the long-term planning of airport is concerned, as many members who have parts of their electorates in or around areas where there are major airports would know, the new owners are required under the legislation to provide a master plan within 12 months of the purchase of the lease. In the case of Perth airport, that is at the end of June next year. One of the issues of contention so far as the proposed master development plan of Perth airport is concerned is the proposed extension of runway 06/24, which is the north-east, south-west runway. Any extension of that runway runs a very considerable and grave risk that suburbs to the west of the airport along the river-East Perth, Maylands, Bassendean, Bayswater and Ashfield-will be subject to airport and aircraft noise which they have never previously had. It is for this reason that I and local government officials and members in relevant areas have been putting the view very strongly both to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) and to the new owners that the master plan ought not to contain a proposal to extend runway 06/24. Indeed, if it does, the minister ought not to approve it. One of the reasons for that is that the current master plan for Perth airport which has been in existence for nearly a decade has always been predicated on the basis of a parallel runway. The long-term land use planning around the airport has proceeded accordingly. Perth is very fortunate in having a number of active local authorities, many of are in my electorate, who comprise the Perth Municipalities Airport Group. Their mission in life is to ensure that the activities of the Perth and Jandakot airports do not unnecessarily adversely affect their residents. In my own electorate, the local authorities of Bassendean, Bayswater and Swan try to be assiduous to ensure that the adverse impacts for their residents are kept to a minimum. One of the key factors in the modem day management of Perth airport is to make sure that there is a much better use of the airspace between Perth airport and the RAAF Pearce air base, which is immediately to the north of Perth airport. Better use of that airspace configuration, better coordination between those two airports and better coordination between RAAF Pearce and Airservices Australia have the potential to dramatically reduce the prospects for adverse aircraft noise, particularly for suburbs to the north of the airport. That applies in particular to the suburb of Beechboro, because the prevailing north or north-easterly winds in the long, hot summer months in Perth force aircraft to take off to the north and then veer to the west over the edge of the suburb of Beechboro. A better configuration and utilisation of airspace between Perth and Pearce would have the potential to eliminate that almost completely so far as Beechboro is concerned. (Time expired) Supermarket to Asia Council",107
253,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"As is the case in most Australian regions today, the focus on exports is seen as one of the major stepping stones for industry success. Exports is the main area for rural regions to compete with their urban counterparts and with the rest of the world. I know in my electorate of Gilmore, now boasting Australia's newest wine growing industry and agribusiness region, businesses are focusing on the benefits of exporting their products which are in great demand not only in the United States and European boutique wine markets but also in many more countries where opportunities, especially for smaller exporters, are rapidly expanding since the launch of the Supermarket to Asia Council by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It has been identified in many industry research papers that small and medium sized enterprises in rural and regional areas often have difficulty getting offshore into the global marketplace because they adopt an individual streak which is so very Australian and so very necessary in a domestic market but at times is detrimental to their efforts to promote efforts overseas. One operator can spend thousands of dollars attending a trade show, promoting a product, getting to know the main players in the potential market, conducting market research and identifying a marketing plan before his product even leaves the shores of Australia. And that goes for every single exporter and potential exporter in this country. That is thousands of dollars for each and every person before they even start getting something back in the form of the export dollars we hear so much about. Yet these small and medium sized businesses can follow the lead of the Australian wine industry in my electorate of Gilmore and join forces and promote the Australian face of industry overseas, thus saving them time and money. This means a group of oyster growers from Greenwell Point on the south coast, for example, can work with oyster growers in Sydney to market Australian oysters overseas-a great initiative. Yet this lack of cooperation is still one of the main impediments to domestic produce hitting foreign markets. It is something which has been identified by the Supermarket to Asia Council, by industry and by the very markets which Australian businesses need to access. Therefore, I believe a scheme which can help bring producers and manufacturers together to jointly promote their export potential deserves the support of this government and this parliament. The Supermarket to Asia Council provides the facility body to ensure Australia is well positioned to take advantage of the ever growing Asian food market. The business side of the scheme-the grassroots-needs proactive and ground level support. Export Illawarra, an initiative of theÂ· Illawarra Regional Economic Development Organisation, is an exciting and innovative approach to develop a regional cluster of businesses in order to facilitate a local export culture amongst regional business. Export Illawarra has been established for nearly two years as a federally funded program which was initiated in response to concerns by local businesses that they needed to develop a clear export focus. Export their Illawarra's project team, made up of key government and industry representatives, has been looking at the challenge of reducing the time frame and cost for small to medium enterprises, especially in the Shoalhaven region, for entering the export market. So far they have identified a range of key objectives, including establishing international business partnerships to reduce export risks for local businesses and developing a regional cluster map to clearly identify export capability for the Shoalhaven region. This will result in businesses sharing the cost of entering a new market and sharing market access and information, and research and development costs associated with promotional activities such as trade missions and trade exhibitions. Export Illawarra has enjoyed strong industry support and is working closely with local education, tourism and agribusiness sectors to identify strategic projects which will help them move into the global market. It has been so successful that the group has been approached by other regions in New South Wales and other states to provide a model to help support their own local industries. Export lllawarra will act as a conduit for local agribusiness, such as the oyster growers at Greenwell Point or the dairy farmers of Berry and Jaspers Brush, to meet the demands of the export market and to develop a local focus for the Australia wide supermarket to Asia program, as has been the case for our Shoalhaven winemakers. I will continue to support such a model as Export Illawarra, which can be a model for the rest of Australia.",108

Sydney Airport Curfew Act-Dispensation 1997 The following answers to questions were circulated: Heroin Importation (Question No. 2081) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Further to the former Minister's answer to question No. 1700 (Hansard, 19 June 1997, page 5957) concerning what percentage of the total amount of heroin imported illegally into Australia is seized, has the Minister's attention being drawn to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence 1995-96 Australian Illicit Drug Report which estimates that only 10% of available heroin in Australia is interdicted; if so, is the estimate reliable; if not, why not. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in 1989 estimated that only 17% of heroin imported for consumption into Australia was being seized; if so, is the estimate reliable; not, why not. (3) Is the Minister able to say why the former Minister did not refer to either of the estimates referred to in parts (1) and (2) in his answer to question No. 1700. (4) If only 10 to 17% of heroin coming into Australia is actually being seized, and 153.1kg of heroin was picked up by the Australian Customs Service (ACS) between 1 July 1996 and 3 June 1997, is it a fact that between 747kg and 1377kg of heroin escaped detection by ACS officials and the Australian Federal Police during that period and is now circulating, or has circulated, around Australia; if not, why not. (5) What is the estimated value of (a) 747kg and (b) 1377kg of heroin. Mr Truss-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, I am aware of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence Report. I am unable to estimate the total amount of heroin imported illegally into Australia and I am therefore unable to comment on the reliability of the estimate in the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence Report. The Report itself acknowledges that no empirical data is available on the percentNA age of heroin seized by law enforcement agencies in Australia. (2) The 1989 Report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority stated that,based on estimates which the Committee derived from surveys carried out for the purposes of the evaluation of the anti-heroin campaign, seizures of importations of heroin may be running at 23 per cent of consumption. The report stresses that the estimates from which this figure is derived shOUld be treated with caution. As indicated in my previous answer, I am unable to estimate the total amount of heroin imported illegally into Australia. I am therefore unable to comment on the reliability of the estimate in the Report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. (3) No. (4) I am unable to estimate the amount of heroin which has not been detected by ACS officials and if the Australian Federal Police at the border during the period in question. (5) A number of factors affect the price of heroin including purity, quantity purchased and the point in the distribution chain at which sale occurs. I am therefore cautious about estimating the values requested by the Honourable Member. However, based on tJ1e wholesale price of a kilogram of heroin in New South Wales for the period April to June 1996, as reported in the Australian Illicit Drug Report 1995-96, the answer to the question is: (a) $179,280,000 (b) $330,480,000 Public Servants: Sick Leave (Question No. 2188) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, upon notice, on 1 September 1997: (1) What is the average number of days sick leave taken per public servant for each year since 1987. (2) What is the average number of days sick leave taken per public servant in management positions for each year since 1987. . (3) How many days sick leave were taken in total for each year since 1987. (4) What was the cost of sick leave referred to in part (3) and how many days sick leave were accounted for by a medical certificate. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(4) There are no centralised records of the information sought by the honourable member. A canvassing of departments by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has indicated that, for a number of reasons, it is unlikely that an accurate, comprehensive answer could be prepared. These reasons are: changes in administrative arrangements with departments being abolished, split, or combined, and staff consequently being transferred between agencies; the authorised disposal of personnel files in accordance with disposal authorities issued by the Australian Archives; and the storage of information in a variety of ways, manually and in changing computer systems. In view of the difficulty and time-consuming nature of the task, for an uncertain result, I am not willing to authorise the use of the resources that would be required in an attempt to compile the information. Regional Labour Market Information: (Question No. 2193) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 2 September 1997: . (1) Has his attention been drawn to significant errors in the Regional Labour Market information released by his Department as part of the request for tender for employment services. (2) Does the profile for West and Inner Melbourne Labour Market Region contain references to clients in Epping. (3) Did the former Minister indicate in her answer to Question No. 2004 (Hansard, 26 August 1997, page 6917) that Epping was part of the East Melbourne Labour Market Region. (4) Can potential tenderers be assured the proposed business levels contained in the documentation have not been distorted by the incorrect allocation of Epping clients to the West and Inner Melbourne Labour Market Region. (5) Do the figures given for East Melbourne in the former Minister's answer to Question No. 2004 contain the same error. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department has not identified any significant errors in the Regional Labour Market Information. (2) Yes. There are two references to Epping in the West and Inner Melbourneregional profile. Epping is in the East Melbourne region on the border with the West and Inner Melbourne region. Epping CES office services a small number of clients (102 as at 30 April 1997) who livein the West and Inner Melbourne region. The two references to Epping in the West and Inner Melbourne regional profile arise from the difference between the region in which these job seekers live as compared with the region in which the Epping CES office-at which they are registered-is located. (3 & 5) The answer to Question No. 2004 correctly stated that Epping was part of the East Melbourne labour market region. (4) There is no error in the data contained in the document, the calculated indicative levels contained in the Tendering Conditions, or any profile data calculated for use in the assessment and allocation processes. This matter has also been raised with the independent Probity Adviser contracted by the Department for the tender process. Following an investigation, the Probity Adviser has determined that tenderers will not be disadvantaged by the minor textual error Errors in the West and Inner Melbourne regional profile. Secondary School Curriculums (Question No. 2263) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Minister representing the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: (1) Does the Commonwealth contribute to the content of curriculums at secondary schools in all States and Territories; if so, what does it contribute. (2) Is funding to the States for schools conditional upon the States meeting certain goals or following certain standards determined by the Commonwealth. . (3) Do secondary schools in all States and Territories follow a standard curriculum; if not, will the Commonwealth coordinate the standardisation of curriculums for secondary schools in all States and Territories. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l)While States and Territories are primarily responsible for the content of curriculum in secondary schools, the Commonwealth does contribute to the key strategy areas of curriculum. For example, the Commonwealth is providing materials in the Discovering Democracy programme to support State and Territory civics and citizenship education. The Commonwealth is also funding a number of projects to develop curriculum resources to support nationally agreed key leaming areas and in the implementation of accredited vocational education and training programmes. (2) The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1996 requires States receiving Commonwealth schools funding to participate in the production of the Annual National report on Schooling (ANR) in Australia. The legislation requires every State to report against agreed framework which is closely linked to the Common and Agreed National Goals for Schooling. A review of the ANR led to the framework for the 1995 and future ANRs having a much greater focus than previously on the outcomes of schooling, including outcomes for school students as a whole and for educationally disadvantaged students. (3) No. The Commonwealth considers the details of curriculum a matter for State and Territory govemments to determine. The Federal Government is committed to ensuring schools are provided with the best resources available to ensure high student outcomes. Badgerys Creek Airport: Noise Impact (Question No. 2271)  the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: (1) Has the Minister's or the Minister's Department's attention been drawn to research concluding that school children attending schools under flight paths suffer educational disadvantage; if so, does the Minister or the Minister's Department support the conclusions.

(5) Has the Minister's Department made a submission on the adverse educational effects on students if Badgerys Creek airport is built; if not, why not. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. However, I am advised that a draft Environmental Impact Statement produced by the Department of Transport and Regional Development will, however, outline some of the research that has been undertaken into the link between overflight noise and educational disadvantage. (2) No. The Department of Transport and Regional Development has advised that an the executive summary of the draft Environmental Impact Statement includes estimates of the numbers of schools that may be affected under the three Badgerys Creek airport options under consideration. The reference to 63 schools that may be affected, is the estimate under Badgerys Creek Option C. There are also other airport options whereby lesser numbers of schools may be affected, Badgerys Creek Option A (a figure of 22 schools) and Badgerys Creek Option B (a figure of 25 schools). No decisions will be made on the development of the Badgerys Creek site until the environmental assessment process is completed.

Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As advised in my response of 20 October 1997 Departments and agencies will continue to be funded at the existing cost levels of the relevant scheme and so the funding for remuneration packages available to current or future employees would not be affected by these changes. New employees (as well as existing employees) will be free to negotiate with their employers (either collectively through a certified agreement or individually by an Australian Workplace Agreement) the level and components of their remuneration package, including employer superannuation contributions.
