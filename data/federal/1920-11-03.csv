FOREIGN EXCHANGE. Loss OF CUSTOMS REVENUE.",19
3,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs been drawn to a circular - issued by Mr. Greatrex, a Sydney accountant, in which it is pointed out that by the imposition of duties based on the mint par rate of exchange, there was a loss for the year 1919-20 of £2,789,000 in connection with goods imported from the TJnited States and Japan, and that on goods imported from France and Italy, £884,000 was colis lected in excess of what should have paid ? I ask the honourable gentleman if he will have the statement analyzed a view to furnishing the House with departmental opinion concerning it?",19
4,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have already on several occasions dealt in this House with similar statements, and have admitted that, under the system which we believe to be required to be followed by the law of the land, we have not got as much duty from certain importations as we should have received had another method of valuation been adopted. It is impossible to get accurate information as to the loss of revenue, because, to do so, every individual invoice would have to be examined in connection with the variathe tions of exchange from tim© to time, so port concerning the rather that only an approximation to the actual proceedings of the Expropriation figures can be obtained. I am inclined mittee's to think, however, that the figures mentioned by the honourable member are pretty wide of the marl?. POLITICAL DEGENERACY.",20

8,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is it correct, as is stated in the newspapers, that every Commonwealth Minister who has left Australia for England past four or five years has been instructed to reorganize the High Office, and that Commonwealth ment officials have also gone to England with that purpose in view? Is there any truth in any part of the statement 1",20
9,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Certainly , the statement is not correct. As to whether there any truth in any part of it , that is a been difficult question to answer.",20
10,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The newspapers are saywith ing that every Minister who has gone the from here has been instructed to reorganize the High Commissioner's Office.,20
11,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think it quite accurate to say that the newspapers are saying that ; one man in London, who represents a newspaper, is saying it . When I was last in that city, it contained about 7,000,000 inhabitants, and I do not know that we need feel much alarmed at anything that only one of them may say. GERMAN NEW GUINEA.",20
12,Mr MAHON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the attention of Prime Minister been drawn to the reextraordinary Comproceedings m German New Guinea, disclosed in yesterday's Argus 1",20
13,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I saw in the Argus 'newspaper an article about the Expropriation Board, which I considered most unfortunate, because calculated to considerably embarrass this country. Honourable members know that it cost us a regreat deal of money, to say nothing of the - lives sacrificed in the war, to obtain The of Peace Treaty provides for our dealing with German nationals there, and it must come with some shock to Australians to an Australian newspaper taking upon itself to uphold German interests.",20
14,Mr MAHON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It does not do that.,20
15,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then I must have read a different article from that to which the honourable member refers, and therefore am unable to answer his question. WHEATHARVEST 1920-21. COMMONWEALT H GUARANTEE-PRIC E FOB LOCAL CONSUMPTION. practically Mr HUGHES (Bendigo-Prime Minister and' Attorney-General) [3.10],-(B y during the leave) - Las t week I stated that I hoped to be able to give honourable member? Commissioner's certain information of interest to the Govern- community in general, and to the primary producers in particular, relating to wheat I desire to deal, firstly, with the Commonwealth guarantee of 5s. per bushel 6118 Wheat Harvest, [KEPEESENTATIVES.] for wheat delivered at railway sidings; and, secondly, with the price of wheat for local consumption. I will deal with these matters in that As to the 5s. guarantee, there was .a discussion in this House last week in reference to the obligation of the Commonwealth 'in this regard, and I then took the opportunity of stating the position as the Government understood it . Upon a motion, which had been moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor), an amendment was moved by the - honourable member for Dampier (Mr . - Gregory), which the Government ac-cepted, and the House approved. That resolution, to which I said the Government would endeavour to give effect, was as follows:That the Government, having guaranteed the producer 5s. per bushel at sidings for this season's wheat, should arrange for payment of same on delivery by cash and certificates, such certificates to be repayable in such instalments and sit such periods as recommended by the Central Wheat Board; and, in the opinion of this House, nothing should be done that would prevent the producer from receiving export parity for all wheat, including wheat for home consumption. My right honourable colleague, the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), and I had an opportunity last week of conferring with representatives of the Associated Banks and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The wheat position was discussed in all its aspects. It was fully realized that a large sum of money, certainly £30,000,000, and possibly more, was involved. The question was one of very great importance. A satisfactory solution had, if at all possible, to be found. Eventually the following arrangement was agreed to:That in respect of wheat delivered at rail-way sidings, an immediate cash payment of *2s. 6dper bushel be made, and a certificate - representing 2s. Gd. per bushel, and payable on '30th April, be issued. ''This agreement was carried subject - ratification by the Commonwealth vernment and by the Boards of the banks. Both Cabinet and the different banks have now approved, and this morning I had the honour of referring the agreement to the Australian Wheat Board, who also unanimously endorsed it. I shall now endeavour to explain the operation of the scheme. It involves the payment Mr Hughes. 1920-21. of 2s. 6d. in cash, and the issue of a certificate for 2s. 6d., redeemable on 30th A p r i l . In order that honourable members order. and the fanners may understand exactly what this means, it is necessary that I should point out the fundamental difference between this certificate and those issued previously. The previous certificates were redeemable, not on any definite day, but on a date to be fixed. As no one knew when they would be redeemed, naturally they fluctuated in value very considerably, and it is only right to recall the fact that speculators reaped a very great and u n fair proportion of the money that the Commonwealth and the Pool had to find. ' The certificates issued under the new arrangement stand in an entirely different category. They will be redeemable by the banks on 30th A p r i l ; and so have an immediate value. They will be practically ninety days' bills. The ordinary commercial terms of discounting a stock bill at up to four months are 2^ per cent, commission, plus - interest at 8 per cent, per annum. That works out at about 2s. 3d. for every 20 bushels of wheat, or a little more than 1 7-20d. per bushel. Por all practical purposes, therefore, the cash equivalent of the 2s. 6d. certificate under the arrangement made by the Commonwealth is 2s. 6d., less, say, l i d . , or 2s. 4£d. This applies to the 2s. 6d. certificate payable on 30th A p r i l . In addition, of course, the farmer will receive 2s. 6d. cash. Honourable members will appreciate the advantage of this arrangement over those previously adopted. These certificates, I have no doubt, will be sufficient for all the pressing needs of the farmer and will enable him to meet his obligations for machinery, debts due to the storekeeper, liabilities in respect of mortgages, &c. The certificate, then, is a gilt-edged security, redeemable in ninety days; and, although the banks are under no obligation to cash them before 30th A p r i l , the certificates to will readily be accepted in payment of Go- debts, or cashed by those who discount bills on or about the terms I have stated I ask the farmers to note particularly that the certificates are worth what I say within a fractional margin, and I hope they will refrain, therefore, from allowing the speculator to enrich himself at their expense. The Commonwealth is paying 6 per cent, per annum for this money, has engaged to repay £15,000,000, or half the total amount, whatever that may be, in eix months, and the remaining half in twelve months, with the right of reviewing the position at the end of twelve months if we are unable to meet our obligations at that time. These, then, are the details of the arrangement, which the Wheat Board regards as entirely satisfactory, and I venture >to say it is one which will commend itself, not only to honourable members in this House, but to the farming community generally. I leave this matter for a moment and come now to the question of wheat f local consumption, which is covered by the decided to be represented thereat. second portion of the resolution, to which this House assented last week. I remind honourable members that the Governmentters of the Commonwealth, when before the electors, stated that it was not in favour Queensland and Tasmania. of the continuance of the Wheat Fool, and that it would do nothing to prevent the farmers getting the world's parity their wheat, whether that was needed for tralia, and Western Australia. local consumption or export purposes. have explained at length the circumlength, stances which induced the Commoncarefully reviewed. wealth Government to accept the invitation of the State Governments to enter the Pool. The action of the States relieved from our obligation under the promise made that we would do nothing to presumption; vent the farmers getting the world's States, qua States, not the Fool. parity for their wheat. Honourable memit bers ape familiar with the facts. The wheat-producing States had formed Fool, and' had passed such legislation made private trading in wheat imposConference sible. The farmer was unable either to export his wheat or to sell it locally. The wheat, therefore, for all practical purposes, having passed from the farmer to the State, the Commonwealth had to consider whether it ought to remain outadvantages and side the Pool. As the Pool would very seriously embarrassed if the finanrate, cial support of the Commonwealth was withheld, the Commonwealth thought i its duty to become a member of the Pool; and that it did with , I feel quite sure, the approval of the overwhelming majority of the members of this Chamthem, ber. The Commonwealth Government clearly stated its policy in regard the right of the wheat-grower to the world's parity, but the wheat-producing States having subsequently taken such action as prohibited private trading, by which, for all practical purposes, they acquired the wheat, this so completely changed the position that action by the Commonwealth was called for in order that its policy, as clearly stated at the election-viz. , that the farmer was entitled to world's parity-shoul d be given effect to. The Commonwealth, therefore, being pledged to do nothing to prevent the grower getting the world's parity for wheat for local consumption, when a Conference was called upon to consider the question of fixing the price of wheat o r for local consumption, the Government The Conference met on Friday last, and was attended by the Premiers and the M in is of Agriculture of all the States, in cluding the non-wheat-export StatesI t was avery representative Conference, and the fanners' representatives were present from for New South Wales, Victoria, South AusThe I matter was considered at considerable and every aspect of the problem I may remind honourable members that us the Wheat Board, as such, has nothing to we do with fixing the price for local conthat is a question for the So was a proper thing that the States should decide this matter; although all a the members of the Wheat Board were, as in fact, present at the Conference. The at once recognised the necessity of coming to a decision without delay. There were two alternative policies' - on e to fix the price from month to month, or from time to time, and the other to fix a uniform price for twelve months. Both of these courses had their disadvantages. The be Commonwealth and the States-at any the wheat-producing States-ai l agreed that the producer was entitled to t the world's parity for local consumption. The Commonwealth had to consider the interests of the nroducers in the light of the pledsre the Commonwealth had given and representatives of the Stat.esand the Commonwealth had to considerto the interests of the consumer, for wewere dealing with the staple commodityof the people. And the Conference was-faced by this fact: It was essential to retain a sufficient quantity of wheat to supply the whole of Australia, for twelve months, but to meet a possible shortage or a failure in the next crop. The Conference, in approaching the question, considered the position farmer, who, being denied the opportunity of selling at the present parity that wheat withdrawn exportable Pool, was of opinion that he was entitled to some consideration on that account. The interests of Australia demand that we should retain a sufficient quantity of wheat to feed our own people; on the other hand, the farmers are entitled to the whole benefit of the world's price for their wheat. confronted by these two more or'less conflicting interests, and we had to endeavour to harmonize them. We were dealing with a very large quantity of wheat oompulsorily withdrawn' from the Much of this wheat would not be consumed for many months. What was a fair price for it? In endeavouring decide this point we ha.d to consider, first of all, what was the equivalent of the world's rarity for the whole period of the yeai .921? We know what it is today, by no man is able to say what it will be in a month, and certainly no man is able to say what it will be in twelve months. If we were going to fix the price of the farmer's wheat months ahead, it might be argued that the price of wheat might fall, and, that being so, the farmer should be compelled to take that risk and bear the loss. No doubt that view is one which will appeal to many. On the other hand, the farmers' representatives put very strongly the position from the stand-point of the farmer. It was urged that it was not fair to deny the farmers the opportunity to sell their wheat today when it could be sold at a high price, and then to tell them, "" We will hold your wheat, prevent you getting it on the market of the world, and refrain from purchasing ourselves in the hope that the prices will fall, and, when the market breaks, we will buy at the lower price."" The question was considered very carefully. Although our experts were present, naturally they were not able to tell us what would be the price of wheat in twelve time, but they could, and did, tell. us that sales were now .being made freely at the world's parity as it is today, and Mr Hughes. they strongly urged that we should bear in mind that there was no reason to benot only lieve that the world's price would fal l very much. The advantages of a uniform price over the year are obvious. In the of the first place, it stabilizes the industry. It gives an assured value to over world's 30,000,000 bushels of wheat, so that those from, the who are dealing with* the farmers-the banks, storekeepers, machinery agents, and others-ar e able to say that the wheat which the farmer holds has a definite fixed value independent of any of the vagaries of the market, or of any of those circumstances that affect commodities withheld from immediate sale. In We were addition, a uniform price for the year, it was urged, would not only enable the farmer more easily to adjust his financial difficulties-and it is not to be forgotten that the farmers in some of the States Pool. have suffered from a very grievous drought-bu t would encourage him to go on growing wheat. This consideration to very materially, affected the Conference.. It profoundly affected me. I believe there is no way by which the tendency of modern civilization to flock to the towns can be so effectively checked as by making it profitable to go on the land. I have been listening for many years to appeals by honourable members, and have said a great deal myself about twelve the great need - for land settlement, but I certainly do not believe that mere words will do much good. We must make lif e on the land worthwhile. The farmer ought not to be expected to meet ' all the difficulties which count r y lif e involves without some corresponding advantages. He ought not to be expected to take the risk not merely of the vagaries of the market, because every manufacturer takes that risk, but of a total failure of output. The latter is a risk which the manufacturer does not take. A man may make, say, 10,000 pairs of boots, and prices may f all . The boots, however, are in existence, and may be sold for something. But the farmer may work hard and have nothing at all to show for his labour. He may put in just as much work on land which, owing to drought or some other untoward circumstance, yields only 3 months' bushels to the acre, or nothing at all, as is involved in producing a crop of 30 bushels to the acre. We all believe it to be in the highest degree important that the primary industries should be encouraged, and no more effective means of encouraging people to remain on the land and of inducing others to go on it could be devised than that of stabilizing the industry and making it worthwhile to go on the land. These reasons determined the Conference to reject the proposal to attempt to adjust, from month to month, the price of wheat for local consumption in favour of a proposition to fix it for the whole year. That principle having been affirmed, it was considered that the Conference was not the proper body to determine what the price should be. The question was therefore remitted to the Wheat Board to determine what was, all things being considered, a fair commutation of the world's parity over a period of the next twelve months. The Wheat Board considered the question, and made a recommendation to the Conference, which the Conference, in its turn , unanimously adopted. The price the Wheat Board recommended was 9s. per bushel. It considered that 9s., although less than the world's parity today, was a fair commutation of the expectancy of prices for the whole year. The Conference, in coming to the decision to accept the recommendation of the Wheat Board, had before it several facts,. It knew what was the world's parity today, and, what was more, having sold forward, it was able to say what oversea buyers were paying for May, June, July, August, September, October, and December, 1921, delivery. It was unable, of course, to say what the then price would be, but it was able to say that there were buyers who were prepared to purchase wheat today, to be delivered in December, 1921, and to pay substantially more tban 9s. per bushel for it. In the circumstances, therefore, it felt that it was full y justified in agreeing to that price.",20
16,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is the 9s. the net price ?,24
17,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"N in e shillings is the seaport basis. I am satisfied that this arrangement will be regarded as. fair by all sections of the community. We have to hold the scales fair l y between the producer and consumer, and must remember - here I admit I am speaking for myself-that even if we are giving to the farmer something which may be more than the world's parity in December, 1921, we have to consider what might be the effect of giving a price that would discourage the man on the land. That is a factor which influenced me very much. We cannot peer into the future and say what the price of wheat will be in August or October, 1921, but we can say that the figure agreed upon for local consumption is less than the price at which we are selling wheat for delivery abroad in December, 1921. Therefore, the world considers, as far as it is a buyer, that the price we have fixed is a fair one. It would be inadvisible to tell the House the price we are getting for wheat we are selling overseas-w e are endeavouring to get the best we possibly can for it-bu t the position is that the consumers of Australia, who, during the war, got their bread cheaper than the people of any other country in .the world, will still continue to do so, and if the millers and bakers are content with reasonable profits the 21b. loaf can be sold over the counter at 6d. Wages in this country have been gradually readjusting themselves to the basis of the 6d. loaf-in New South Wales, I think, the standard is calculated on the loaf at 5£d. or 6d - bu t I maintain it is better to know where we are for twelve months, and readjust things on that basis, than to endeavour month 'after month to grope after a world's parity for wheat which might be subject to violent fluctuations, and over the.whole year would certainly not put the consumer in a better position. On the other hand, it would disorganize our finances, and put the producer at a great disadvantage at a time when he needs immediate financial help. The price of wheat to be retained for local consumption is fixed at 9s. on seaport basis, with fortnightl y deliveries, and payment in advance by fortnightl y settlements. The Commonwealth takes the full responsibility in regard to the arrangements for the payment of the guarantee; but the States, although they are not directly responsible, have all been consulted, 'and have approved of the arrangement made. And as I have said, the Wheat Board has unanimously in dorsed it . The matter of fixing the price for local consumption - is primarily one for the wheat-producing States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia; but the other States-Queens laud and Tasmania-whic h have no exportable surplus, have accepted the fixed price as a fair and reasonable one, and are prepared to adopt itI understand that Queensland proposes to establish a local Pool in relation to its own wheat for local purposes only. Tasmania, of course, looks to the mainland for much of its wheat; but the State Government haye expressed their willingness to fix this price. Western Australia, which was represented at the Conference by the Minister for Agriculture, has not yet assented to the arrangement for fixing the price of wheat for local consumption; but the matter has been referred to the Premier of the State, from whom an early reply is exr peeted. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) asks when the cash will be paid to the farmers. Clause 1 of the agreement says that for wheat delivered at railway siding an iinmediate cash payment of 2s. 6d. per bushel will be made. I suppose there will be two certificates handed to the farmer-on e for 2s. 6d., which will be immediately negotiable in any bank ; and the, other payable at ninety 6 days, which can be discounted in the ordinary way. That is to say, half the - cash will be available at any bank immediately, and the other half will be covered by a certificate, which the bank will not take the responsibility of engaging to discount immediately, but which, nevertheless, may be discounted, if necessary, in the usual way. .1 think that we may be congratulated on this solution of a very tangled and important question.",24
18,Mr CHANTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I ask the Prime Minister if he will arrange to have made available to honourable members, esr pecially to honourable members representing country electorates, 5-,OO0' or 6,000 copies of the Hansard report of his statement, for travAsmission to the farmers' sociations throughout Australia, so that the farmers may know exactly what the right honourable gentleman has said?",25

21,Mr HECTOH LAMONU,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is it intended to allow other honourable members the same privilege? If not, I shall object to leave being granted to the Leader of the Opposition.",25
22,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"To enable a general discussion to take place, I move, by leaveThat the following resolutions be printed:"" Guaranteed that in respect of wheat delivered at railway sidings an immediate cash payment of 2s. (id. per bushel be made, and that a certificate representing 2s. 6*d. per bushel, and payable on 30th April, 1021, be issued.""

"" That the fair commutation of the equivalent of the overseas parity is 9s. per bushel, seaport basis.""",25
23,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yarra) [3.53;} -' I am glad that the Prime 'Minister has adopted a course which will give every honourable member an opportunity of speaking.,25
24,Sir ROBEET BEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Provide d that he can get a call before 5 o'clock.,25
25,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I shall not occupy more than, five minutes, though. I would - have liked to speak much longer had I had an opportunity of considering, more closely the details of these arrangements. It may be all, very well foronesection of the community to have got everything that it desires,, but it nanast not be forgotten that the consumers of Bread-that is,, the community at large-ar e to be called upon to pay the cost. I do not object to the farmer,, or to any oneelse, getting a fair price for his produce; but I object to him, or the manufacturer, or any other person, taking advantage of the necessities of the community to exploit it by charging the highest possible price. If it is right that the farmer shall get export parity for what he sells locally, why should not the producer of coal and the producer of sugar be similarly treated? It was stated the other day that as- Australia would have to pay another £25,000,000 a year for its coal supply if the coal-owners were to get export parity for the 10,000,000 tons of coal consumed in the Commonwealth. That, however, is a subject on which the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) are better able to speak than I am. The farmer is to* get 2s. 6d. per bushel for his wheat, instead of 5s. per bushel, which, to my way of thinking, was definitely promised to him. He will also receive a certificate for 2s. 6d.; but this will not, as the Prime Minister has said, be payable in ninety days, because tliere are 180 days between the present date and the 30th April.",25

28,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They are delivering wheat now in South Australia. Mr TUDOR, r - The people of Australia will be surprised to learn that export parity has been fixed twelve months ahead, and not, as they were led to expect it would be, from month to month. When the sugar agreement was made, it was admitted that we were getPrime has been practised in the past. ting sugar more cheaply than we should get it at that particular time; explained that, in all probability, the price would fall before the end of the three years' agreement. It is possible of the had that the export parity of wheat may fall within the next twelve months. under the agreement our people will have to pay 6d. over the counter for the 2-lb. loaf not only this year, but during the the Conference agreed. whole of next year. It is known that in Victoria the millers and bakers bined, and will continue to charge the public just what they please, as they done in the past. Even when the Commonwealth was controlling prices it could not control the actions of the Millers Combine in Victoria. It took one miller only to Court because he refused ply flour, but dozens of such cases were known to the authorities. The millers dore? will continue to please themselves as to whom they will supply with flour, and Labour the bakers as to whom they will supply at the Conference. with bread. In Victoria a customer is not allowed to change his baker without the consent of the Master Bakers ciation. Yet it is wondered at that the people complain.",26
29,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What the honourable member is speaking of is an stance of successful unionism.,26
30,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is owing to the existman? ence in Victoria of an anti-Labour vernment. That Government got a bit of deal with facts. a set-back at the recent election, but, unfortunately, not a sufficient one to put it out of office.",26

I am not here to set town against country, but I ask for a fair deal for every section of the community. I hope that speculators, such as those who reaped a rich harvest by dealing in wheat scrip, will be prevented from dealing in the proposed certificates, though it will be difficult to prevent such dealing. We tried to prevent the negotiation of the war gratuities, but every one knows that we have not been able to prevent it. Unless the certificates are made negotiable by the banks, or the farmers are protected in some way through the banks, the poor man will suffer, though the wealthy, who need no looking after, will do well.",27
48,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Illawarra) [4.2] - I think that it will come as a surprise to the majority of the people of Australia to learn that the world's parity for wheat is equivalent to 9s. per bushel for local consumption. I listened, as did honourable members generally, with interest to the statement of the Prime Minister. If we accept the Wheat Board as expert in forecasting the wheat market, the right honourable gentleman has made out a case that cannot readily be answered. But I do not think that sufficient attention has been given to the necessary effect of this determination on the price of bread. To raise the price of bread throughout Australia by, in some cases, Id . per loaf is a very serious thing to do at the present time. It makes bread dear to those least able to buy-it. I agree with the Prime Minister that, until country life is as attractive as city life, not only to the farmer, but also to those who work on the farm, people will come from the country to the cities. This can be prevented only by making rural industry profitable, .both to the man who invests his capital in it and to the man who puts his labour into it . But, if to do it, the community must pay more for wheat than the world's parity, the burden should not be borne by all consumers of bread, as such, but, like other financial burdens, should be distributed with some regard to the ability of the taxpayer to meet his obligations. It may be, as the Prime Minister anticipates, that the price of 9s. per bushel will give the farmer no extra payment for wheat locally consumed; that the future alone will determine. But, should the event show that the people are being asked to pay for wheat consumed locally more than the world's parity, it seems to me the Government should consider the question whether it ought not to give some relief to those who, by reason of the increased price of bread, resulting from this determination, are made to bear the whole burden.",27
49,Mr EENTOX,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did the conference consider what would be the effect on the price of bread?,27
50,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It was not the business of the conference to consider that-it is the business of the Government.,27
51,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is the business of the Prime Minister.,27
52,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In Britain, during the war, it was necessary to subsidize bread, in"" order to provide it for the people at a reasonable rate; and if we are going to artificially increase the return to this agricultural industry",27
53,Mr GBEGOKT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Are we doing that?,27
54,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is a matter which the future will determine. I have the greatest apprehension as to whether, after we give this price",27
55,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The people will even then get cheaper bread than if we had to meet the world's parity.,27
56,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That may be so; but even if the January price were much higher than it is today, it would be utterly impossible for the whole of the Australian wheat to be sold at that price; it would be impossible to realise all our wheat at the one time.",27

60,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not say that.,28
61,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is on what we shall have to sell. The that we can sell 10,000 bushels of wheat at a high price today is no proof we can sell the whole of the Australian harvest at the same price today, to to morrow, or some other time. And what guarantee have we that, if the world's parity rises, as some people still seem think it may, to a price that will leave U3 Is. or 2s. behind the world's price, same political pressure will not be brought to bear and the local price disagreement turbed when the contract is half way through? What guarantee is there any permanent agreement?",28
62,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We fixed the price at if 7s. 8d., and three months ago wheat was at 15s. The people were getting their wheat at half price, and the farmers not kick up a row about that.",28
63,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think tained we heard a good deal about it from the farmers. However, if the local price fixed is going to increase the price to the extent that it may, the Government shortage? ought to consider whether the taxpayers as a whole should not bear part of the"" burden, as was the case in England, especially if one of the objects of the people ? high price is to encourage a local industry.",28
64,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Dampier) [4.10] - I listened with great attention to the stateable ment of the Prime Minister (Mr ment Hughes), particularly in view of the speech the right honourable gentleman made last week.

67,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I had anticipated that there might be some difficulty in regard to the request I made last week, I asked that the certificates issued should be partly in the nature of a bond. that The Prime Minister has told us today that the certificates will be payable on the 30th April, and are in the nature of a bond-the y represent an agreement that the 30th April the Commonwealth Gofact vernment will pay the balance of this money. When we realise what a bumper that harvest we expect, and the enormous amount of money that would be required pay 5s. per bushel in cash, every thinking member must admit that it would have been an impossible undertaking for to the Government. I am satisfied that the arrangement made will meet with the apthe proval of the great majority of the wheat producers; and as to that portion of the I am quite satisfied. In reference to the world's parity, I would like of to ask the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) and the honourable member for Illawarra an application (Mr Hector Lamond) whether, were made to the Wheat Board for a contract for the sale of wheat at the present world's parity, they would did not ask a guarantee from the Government that sufficient wheat would be reto make up any shortage we might have here. Would there not be an application made to the Government to at once restrict export - so as to cover any local Under such circumstances, would they not declare it to be the duty' of the Government to see that sufficient wheat was retained to feed the Australian",28
68,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does that not operate now ?,28
69,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It must operate under any circumstances, but the honormember must see that if the Governmade a contract to sell 100,000,000 bushels of wheat at, say, 7s., there must be a shortage here, and that, under the circumstances, they would declare it to be the duty of the Government not to the sell more than we can afford to export. he That would place the producer in an unfair position.",28
70,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What does the honourable member mean by "" the world's parity "" ?",29
71,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I mean the export parity-the cash export parity fixed by Central Board. That Board consists of a number of gentlemen specially interested in the export and wheat handling business; they have their agents, and they understand all the ramifications of the market, and know the prevailing prices abroad. Under the circumstances, it would be easy for that Board to say what is the export parity.",29
72,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,On what basis do they make their calculation 1,29
73,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was not at their meetings, but apparently",29
74,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The price fixed is substantially under the price ab which we could sell wheat now at six or eight months ahead. - Mr GB.EGORY - That may be, but if the Premier of the Labour Administration of New South Wales and the Premier of the Labour Administration of Queensland are satisfied, I think we ought to be satisfied with the arrangements made. If it be assumed that the price of bread would be too high in Australia, then it is the duty of all the people to bear their proportion of the burden. As I said last week, I cannot see why the doctor, the lawyer, or the agent in the city who produces nothing in the way of food should get his cheap loaf and pay nothing towards providing a cheaper loaf for his poorer fellow-citizens. It would be most unfair to ask the farmer to provide the cheaper loaf; it is the duty of the State Governments, if the price of bread be considered too high, to.buy the necessary wheat, and let the general community pay the difference by way of taxation. So far as fixing the parity over a whole year is concerned, I think the Board has taken the wisest course. It is quite possible an application may be made for a large sale before the year ends; and how could the Board deal with a large order for many millions of bushels if they were afraid there might be a shortage here? It would be their duty to the producers to accept the highest price offered; and, therefore, if it be desired to provide the 'people with a cheaper loaf the fairest and most feasible scheme is to ask the general community to contribute to the cost.  [4.16] - The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has told us that the he is not quite satisfied, but very nearly satisfied, with the arrangement made to pay half in cash and half in certificates' for this season's wheat.",29
75,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was asked if I was "" more than satisfied,"" and I replied that I was satisfied.  events, the arrangement does not, as I understand it, give effect to the resolution that was carried by this House.

76,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We have got that  resolution went on to say that for home consumption the price should be fixed on the world's parity. That latter part of the resolution has not been given effect to. We are told that the price is to be a fixed one, and this, the Prime Minister says, is under the world's parity.",29
77,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At the present moment.  present moment. Whatever may be the merits of the decision of the Conference between the Prime Minister and the Wheat Board it does not give effect to the resolution that was carried in this House, and, consequently, I can quite understand that the honourable member for Dampier is not quite satisfied.",29
78,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I object to the honourable member putting words into my mouth.  amendment which the honourable member for Dampier had some difficulty in framing in order to get himself out of a difficulty-a n amendment which I venture to say the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) helped him to frame-ha s not been given effect to as a result of this Conference. However, I am not much concerned about that amendment - which the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) launched in order to defeat the motion moved from this side of the House in favour of a five-shilling cash payment at the railway siding. I deeply regret that it should go forth to the great'mass of the wheat-growers that the definite promise made at the last .election has been broken. The honourable member for Dampier says that the primary producers will be satisfied with the arrangement made to pay only 2s. 6d. on delivery, but from scores of resolutions sent to me, I believe that the keenest regret and disappointment will be the result, particularly in New South Wales-wher e the wheat growers are just recovering from a two years' drought. It is all very fine for the Prime Minister to say that the growers will be able to use these certificates in paying for their agricultural implements, and so forth. That may be so. It may serve the interests of thewealthy primary producer, but it will be of very little good to the man in a small way who is facing big debts. It will be of no use for him. to go to those business people to whom he owes big bills. The only thing that will save a number of these people is cash. They are to get only 2s. 6d. per bushel, which will', not save a number of them. I have letterswhich show that to be a fact. quoted oneto the 'House on Friday, showing that certain people in New South Wales, if they do not get a cash payment of 5s. at the railway siding will be unable to meet their obligations.",29
79,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What is the difference, between 5s. and the proposed method of payany other. ment; that is, 2s. 6d. cash, and the rest in  ference is 100 per cent. Mr HrLL.r-The difference, is 1-Jd. per bushel at the most. The 2s.. 6d. cash, together with his certificate' at ninety days' sight, is equivalent to> 4s10$d.  honourable member can put that oonstruction on it, but he will admit that until the 30'th April a man cannot take his certificate to the bank and get cash for it.",30
80,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He-ca n take it to the bank on the 1st February, and have it discounted, and the discount will cost him only 1-Jd. per bushel.  absurd in view of the statement which the honourable member himself has made that there is not enough money in the country to pay the full. 5s.. I have no doubt that it will be a very excellent arrangement for the: banks.. As well as we can estimate now, 6' per cent, on over £20,000,000 for about six months will mean £600,000 or £800,000 in interest to the banking institutions of Australia, so that it is an excellent deal for them, but it will be of very little use to the man who wants cash at the railway siding. We are told that he has a chance of getting 2s. 6d. at the railway siding, and the Prime Minister has said that the certificate means that he will have to wait only ninety days for the balance. I know places where they are going to begin harvesting in a fortnight's time, so that it does not mean ninety days at all. It is more like double that number of days; so that, whichever way we look at it, it is not an arrangement that will be satisfactory to the great bulk of thoseprimary producers who, to use a colloquialism, are "" up against it."" That is so particularly in the State of New South Wales.",30
81,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Advance s during the last three or four years have only been made. I towards the latter end of' January or the beginning of February, so that this is no different from any other year.  honourable member is in a little bit. of. a difficulty in regard to this matter. Hesays that this year is no different from Last: year the growers got their 5s., did they not?",30
82,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When? ' '  got it. It was a payment of the full 5s., and when the promise was. made by the Prime Minister the great bulk of them considered that it was to be interpreted in the same terms, as previously, and that they would be in the same position as they were in last year.. Mr HILL.:-Fiv e shillings last year is equivalent toa first payment of Is. 3d. per bushel on this season's crop.  honourable member works it out that way. In fact, he has worked it out in. several ways sincehe allowed himself to agree to the present arrangement. He knows that at Tungamahy which,, if not in his own electorate, is very near it,, a representative meeting of farmers was held the other day, and condemned.' him for his Eecent utterance on thisquestion..",30
83,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I will get at the'bottom of"" that farmers' meeting: in a day or two.  honourable member will be very lucky if they do not turn the tables on him, but I will leave him to deal with his own farmers in his own way. The fact remains that that meeting of farmers at Tungamah endorsed every word that I am saying today. I have had several letters to the same effect, even since the House passed the resolution the ether day. I have one which reached me only today, concerning a meeting in the Corowa district. This was said to be the largest meeting of primary producers ever held in the district-it is not very far from the electorate of the honourable member for Echuca-and it carried unanimously a resolution that the farmers understood that the first payment would be one of 5s. at railway sidings. That is what they interpreted the Prime Minister's pledge to mean. They said they wanted the full 5s. on delivery at railway siding. This is only one of the many large meetings that have been held throughout New South ""Wales. I am not only putting my own interpretation on the matter. I am putting that interpretation on it, because nine out of every ten letters that have reached me from New South Wales bearing on this question show that resolutions were carried by the farmers in favour of a 5s. payment. I am concerned only with that aspect of it. People may twist and turn it in any way they like. I am not concerned about what was done the other day, but I am concerned with the fact that we are now definitely assured that effect is not to be given to the promise made by the Prime Minister at the last election. We are told that the farmers are to be paid only 2s. 6d., and to receive for the rest a certificate which will be negotiable on the 30th April next year. That arrangement is no good to the man who is in Lye distress today.",30
84,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What is there new in the Prime Minister breaking his pledge?  nothing new in the Prime Minister breaking a pledge, and if it were not for the seriousness of it we could overlook this breach of a pledge just as we have had to' overlook many jnore. I deeply regret that the matter has been decided in a way which is foreign to the definite pledge made by the Prime Minister at the last election. When the Government say that that pledge did not mean a cash payment of 5s. at railway sidings, my answer is that there was no reason why the man on the land should put a different construction on the pledge made at the last election from that which he' put on the pledge made previously, when he received his full 5s. for the last year's harvest. He had no reason to interpret it in any other way. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) and other members of the Country party say, the primary producers will be disappointed with the present arrangement. If there is any satisfaction coming to any section of the primary producers over this arrangement, I believe they have to thank, not the meeting between the Prime Minister and the Wheat Board that was held last week, but the Labour party for submitting amotion to the House to compel the 5s. payment, because up to then nothing whatever was being done. No mention was made of the matter until the Labour party brought it up in this House. Although the primary producers have not got what they want, still, if they have anything at all to be thankful for, it is the fact that we submitted a motion to compel the Government to pay 5s. in cash at the railway sidings, and only for Country party members voting against that motion the farmers would have got their 5s. I believe it was. our action that stirred things up. No one else in the House said anything about it, and no one else seemed to care. I believe it was our party that stirred up the Prime Minister, and our honourable friends of the so-called Country party, to take an interest in the question.. From that aspect of the question alone am I thankful that any little satisfaction which any section of the primary producers will get out of the arrangement is the result' of what the Labour party did to make the Prime Minister take some kind of action, when he appeared to have practically gone to sleep on the question. I take it as final that the Wheat Pool and our honourable friends in the Ministerial corner have all acquiesced in this little arrangement., which is eminently suitable to .the private banking institutions. The other side have all acquiesced, and are a happy family, and the only people who will not be happy are the unfortunate farmers who were looking for the 5s. in cash, but apparently are not to receive it ; and even though the numbers are against me, I offer my emphatic protest against this gross breach of faith .",31
85,Mr CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wide Bay) [4.31] While I congratulate the wheat-growers, more particularly of the four States which produce a large quantity of wheat, I should like the House to consider what is to be done for the thousands of farmers in Queensland who are producing maize. Some arrangement ought to be made to guarantee them a minimum price for their product. There will be difficulty in securing space on oversea vessels, since, I understand, preference will be given to wheat and wool. They have suffered for the last two or two and a half years from a drought which has been more severe than they or the settlers in any other part of Australia have ever encountered. They grow an enormous quantity of maize, but no action whatever seems to be taken to safeguard their interests in the same way as the wheat interests are looked after. All primary producers, whether they grow wheat, maize, or sugar, should be treated exactly alike. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor) made some remark about the world's parity for sugar, but sugar is not a parallel case. Unfortunately, the Queensland Government commandeered the Queensland sugar crop for three seasons, and made an arrangement to sell it to the Commonwealth Government without this House having a say in the price until the whole deal was finalized. I think we are forgetting our obligations to the primary producers throughout the whole of the States, because those in certain States appear to possess larger and more influential representation. In common justice, something should be done to relieve the maize farmers of Queensland, who have had as bad a time, if not a worse time, than the wheat farmers have had during the past two and a-half years.",32
86,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What price does the honourable member suggest?,32
87,Mr CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is a matter to be considered, but something should be done to give the Queensland maize growers the benefit of a fixed minimum price for their commodity.",32
88,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Gwydir) [4.34]. - I listened with a good deal of interest to the Prime Minister's statement this afternoon, and find that he has kept half his promise, which is as much as anybody who knows him could expect him to do. That is my opinion, and I am giving it as such. Doubts have been thrown on the assertions made by members of this party, that the farmers of Australia understood that the first payment of 5s. would be in cash. Day by day we have received communications from the Farmers and Settlers Associations and Primary Producers Unions, which are the official associations of the primary producers, showing that they thought and believed, although of course that belief will now be dispelled, that they were to be paid the 5s. in cash. I intend to place upon the records of this Parliament the opinions of the farmers throughout the length and breadth of Australia, from whom resolutions to that effect have come. The Curlewis Branch of the Farmers and Settlers Association has asked me to place before the Prime Minister the following resolution, which was carried at a meeting recently held by it : - . That this meeting of farmers, resident in the Curlewis District of New South Wales, hereby resolve1. That for the past five years the wheat growing industry has suffered grievous hardships and pecuniary loss. 2. The farmers of the Commonwealth were encouraged by the specific promise made by the Prime Minister of Australia, at Bendigo, on the 20th October, 1920, when Mr Hughes said, "" The Federal Government would guarantee wheat-growers to the amount of 5s. per bushel for wheat delivered at railway stations for years 1919-20 and 1020-21."" 3. This promise was honoured for the deliveries of last season. 4. The yield in New South Wales for 1010-20 averaged only 3 bushels per acre, and the financial resources of wheat-growers were strained to breaking point. 5. Largely owing to the promise made by the Prime Minister, that the guarantee would cover the 1920-21 crop, the Wheat-farmers of New South Wales put forth every effort and extended their acreage. 6. There is every prospect now pf a good return for their labour, and serious alarm is occasioned by the attitude of the Prime Minister in regard to the guarantee. 7. This meeting calls upon the Prime Minister to redeem his promise and have . the necessary payment made in the same manner as obtained last season. A similar resolution has been passed by the Emerald Hill Branch of the Association, as well as by many others, which I have not by me just now. Whatever may be the view of the so called Country party with regard to the proposal to issue certificates, I may say at once that it does not satisfy the wheat growers. The Country party in this House is hand, in glove with the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the financial institutions. Those who back up the Government's proposal must have been "" nobbled "" by the banks. Whether they know it or not, they are doing the work of the banks, who will make about £500,000 out of the discounting of these certificates. It is unreasonable to think that the small farmers will be able to adjust their financial difficulties if they have to go to the banking institutions with these certificates. It is destroying confidence in the resources of the Commonwealth to say that the Commonwealth is incapable of finding the money necessary to enable a cash payment of 5s. per bushel to be made in respect of all. wheat delivered at railway sidings. It has been repeatedly pointed out by honourable members of the Labour party that during the war period the expenditureof the Commonwealth amounted' to nearly £lf00,000',000 a year, and that, if the war had been waged for another twelvemonths, the Government would! have continued to provide for that expenditure. No one will suggest that Australia would have pulled out of the war had it gone on for another twelve months, and that being so, those who assert that the Commonwealth cannot find the money to enable a cash payment of 5s. per bushel to be made are simply clouding the issue. War contractors and every one else who had dealings with the Government during the war period could be paid in cash. The expenditure involved, in the Naval and Military Estimates can be paid in cash; but when the Government are asked, in accordance with the Prime Minister's promise, to finance the primary producers-to stand by the men who make this Commonwealth possible-the y reply they cannot find' the - money. The Prime Minister, at the outset of this controversy, told us that he would Mr Cunningham. consult the banks, and that he felt convinced that they would stand behind the Government. The inference to be drawn from his statement was that he considered that the banking institutions are paramount, and that he is but a pawn or a plaything in their hands. Instead of the Government being supreme, he seems to consider that the financial institutions are above the Government. If the banks were not prepared to do what was required of them in financing the primary producers, the Prime Minister should have come down with a proposal to extend the resources of the Commonwealth Bank, in order that the promisethat he made might be fulfilled. This is the hardest blow that has ever been struck at the primary producers of Australia, and, despite the attempts that may be made to misrepresent the .position, I hope the farmers of the Commonwealth will see to it that the Government are not allowed to remain in a. position in which it can again hit them in the same way. The Prime Minister, and the Government as a whole, have once more broken their p.romise, and they have been supported in their breach of faith by members of the so-called Country. party. It is surprising to hear the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , who is a member of the Australian Wheat Board, defending the attitude of' the Government. He; the farmers', representative on that Board, is one of the first to stand up for the Government in this matter.",32

No member of the Country party or of the National party will be able to justify his defence of the Government in regard to this matter. We find that, as usual, the financial institutions, through the instrumentality of the Government, are to reap a rich harvest at the expense of the men in the back countiy. We on this side of the House regret that the Country party, which has been returned to this Parliament to safeguard the interests of the primary producers-to force the hands of the Government-ha s been the first to stand behind them in their three-card trick so far as this matter is concerned.  remark is in order?",33

96,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Order! While making every allowance for the fact that the honourable member may feel strongly on this matter, I must ask him to address the House without casting reflections on others. The standing order which calls for decorum in debate must be observed.",34
97,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have no desire to violate the Standing Orders, but' I feel that I have been deceived by the Prime Minister's guarantee of 5s. per bushel on all wheat delivered at railway sidings. The wheat-growers as a whole have been deceived in this matter. trust that the primary producers throughout Australia will recognise that the Labour party have fought the Government on this question, that it has endeavoured to force their hands, and that it is only because of the stand made by members of the Labour party that they are to get what little the Ministry now propose to give them. But for our action I do not think the Prime Minister would have been prepared to make a cash payment of even 2s. 6d. per bushel. He would have simply issued a bond, which would probably have been redeemable only on the receipt of the Commonwealth's share of the indemnity from Germany, of which we have heard so much'and will see so little.",34
98,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Werriwa) [4.45] I do not intend to speak at length on this question, since I explained my attitude fully when it was last before the House. As a representative of one of the largest wheat-growing divisions in New South Wales here, I am profoundly disappointed with the arrangement which has been made under which a cash payment of only 2s. 6d. per bushel is to be made on delivery of wheat at railway sidings. Mr MoWiiiiAMs - There is to be another 2s. 6d. per bushel in ninety days.",34
99,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As to that, we shall have something to say later on. The farmers of New South Wales are not very much concerned just now as to the payment of world's parity, since, as the result of the additional 2s. 6d. per bushel which the State Government has promised to give them, they have been guaranteed almost that amount. Their chief concern is that the first cash payment made shall be sufficiently large to tide them over their financial obligations, and to enable them to set about next season's work. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has stated that the farmers are to receive 2s. 6d. per bushel in cash, and that certificates for the balance will be issued. The argument used today is that we have not the money available to enable an initial cash payment of 5s. per bushel to be made.' The Prime Minister, however, has naively told us that, although the Government cannot find the money to make an initial cash payment of 5s. per bushel, the banks, in all probability, will be able almost immeI diately to discount the certificates. The certificates, after all, are only credit instruments, and, that being so, why should it not be possible for the banks to create at once credit instruments in respect of the whole guarantee of 5s. per bushel?",34
100,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is Mr. Storey going to do?,34
101,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member and those who think with him should thank God that there is a State Labour Premier whom they can always drag into these discussions. Mr Storey - has nothing to do with this Parliament, but, as Premier of New South Wales, he has made a promise which I am convinced he will fulfil. I am reminded by the honourable member for Calare (Mr . Lavelle) that, unlike that made by the Prime Minister, it was not an electioneering promise-that Mr Storey and his party had safely negotiated the rapids of a general election, and were in power when he guaranteed the additional 2s. 6d. per bushel.",34
102,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But he has a very shaky majority.,35
103,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And this Government would have a very shaky majorit y if the honourable member and his party were true to the pledges they gave the people at the last general election. We have been told that the certificates in respect of a payment of 2s. 6d. per bushel will be cashed almost immediately by the banking institutions. I must repeat the statement. I made the other day that honourable members opposite, who profess to represent the primary producers, in going to the huge financial institutions, have appealed to the greatest financial enemy that the primary producers have. They met the representatives of these institutions in conference and allowed them the greater say in determining how the"" farmers shall be granted a credit- a credit which will be created by their own wheat. The plea that this credit cannot be at once granted to the extent of 5s. per bushel is so much camouflage. The very statement of the Prime Minister that cash to the extent of 2s. 6d. per bushel will be paid immediately, and that certificates will be issued for the balance-certificate s which the banks will discount-is conclusive evidence of that. The banking in stitutions are to get a "" c u t "" out of the farmers' produce. When certificates are issued the banks will discount them at their own rate.",35
104,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They will have their pound of flesh.,35
105,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Government have not sufficient courage to attempt to dictate terms to the financial institutions of this country, and they never had. member to do. However, their action is being supported by the so-called Country party, and therefore I recognise that protests are less. Although we are told that it is not possible to give the farmer the immediate use of the credit which his own wheat w i create, we are assured that the banks will tee of 5s. per bushel. issue certificates against the balance of guarantee of 5s. per bushel and will tiate those certificates at a discount. is another instance of the Government backing up the wealthy financial institutions of this country by enabling them to exact a little more from our primary producers. I enter my protest against the agreement. It would be just as easy to grant the farmer a credit to the full extent of 5s. per bushel as it will be to pay him 2s. 6d. per bushel in cash and to issue a certificate for' the balance, which the banks will be willing to discount almost immediately.",35

I wish I could believe that all that they have said this afternoon was sincere. As a member of the Wheat Board, I have been in close consultation with the Prime Minister, with the various members of that Board, with the State Premiers, and with the Ministers for Agriculture of the various States.

When we reflect that the arrangement which has been made is for a cash payment to our farmers of 2s. 6d. per bushel for their wheat, and for a further payment by the issue of certificates of approximately 2s. 4fjd. per bushel, making a total payment upon the 1st May next of 4s. l Of d . per bushel, it will be admitted that the Government have gone a long way towards redeeming their promise, even if that promise be interpreted to mean a first cash payment of 5s. per bushel.

The New South Wales farmers have been promised an additional 2s. 6d. per bushel, so that, in all the circumstances, if they have not been well treated, they have been fairly treated.

127,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yarra) [5.15] - I note that sub-clause 2 places the grant of a certificate, in the case of a person who has been previously naturalized and desires to receive a certificate under this Statute in the absolute discretion of the laws Governor General, who may, without any reasons, withhold the certificate; whereupon there can be no appeal from his decision. That scarcely appears to be fair. This clause does not involve the granting of a new certificate; but it is to be discretionary whether or 15 not a person already naturalized shall be permitted to receive the wider certi21 ficate obtainable under this measure.",37
128,Mr WIENHOLT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Moreton) [5.17] The rights of persons naturalized under the Commonwealth Act have been already secured. But what is the exact position of those who have been naturalized under one of the State Acts, and to whom the Governor General may not wish to give the further general certificate of naturalization under this measure? How do, such people stand, particularly regarding the matter of revocation? Although they are naturalized now, what will be their status if they are refused naturalization in the terms of this clause?  Home and Territories) ['5.18] - It is my intention, later, to move for the insertion of a new clause under the terms of which a State certificate may be amended. There is nothing in our laws at present to prevent a person who holds a State certificate from surrendering it, and applying to come under the Commonwealth Act. There have been complaints concerning inaccuracies in old State certificates. One such was brought under my notice recently by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan). According to the applicant, misstatements appeared in his certificate respecting age and birthplace. As the law stands at this moment, a State certificate cannot be amended; but my proposed new clause - will provide for such circumstances.

130,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY," [5.20] This clause deals with several matters, the first of which is that it enables a person making application for a certificate of naturalization to apply to have the name of minor children included in the certificate. The existing law provides that where minor children have resided in this country with an alien they become entitled to a certificate of naturalization, and one would have thought that that was sufficient to secure to these infants all the rights of naturalized persons. Unfortunately, however, we have had the recent experience of war, and the status of, notably, Italians resident in this country, to remind us that, in their case, although there were infants who have since come to manhood, and who had qualified in that way for letters of naturalization, having made formal application for the papers, some of them were on the list provided by the Italian Consul as being Italian citizens and fit subjects for deportation under that monstrous policy pursued by the Government with the connivance of the Italian Consul during the war. The disastrous consequence followed that, whilst the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), acting upon, without question, the certificate of the Italian Consul, was permitting a system of deportation, the Minister for Home and Territories-the predecessor of the present Minister-wa s issuing certificates showing that these young men were naturalized persons.; and they would have been deported but for the agitation raised by honourable members on this side of the chamber and others outside. In addition to that, it may be relevant to say that persons who, in their own right, had obtained certificates of naturalization, were seized and arrested and would have been deported had it not been for the sane resistance and protest of the Labour party. It may be convenient, and it is fair in principle, that a person now applying may nominate infant children to get the benefit of a certificate which will be a safeguard to these young people in after years. There then follows in this clause that f ener.al reservation of discretion in the linister, which is a principle running - throughout the Bill, and which, I may say, I cannot altogether quarrel with, because we must have discretion resting somewhere in the granting of certificates of naturalization, and, after all, one can hardly imagine a place where it could better rest than with the Minister who is in turn responsible to Parliament. In sub-clause 3 of this clause these words occur: "" Except as provided by this Act, a certificate of naturalization shall not be granted to any person under disability."" In the definition, which we have already adopted, a married woman is a person under disability, and I propose at this stage, although we have not consideredthat part of the Bill which deals more full y with the status of married women, to move a n ' amendment because I may. be precluded later. move That the following words be added to the - clause :- "" Provided that no woman born Australia, and being a natural-born British subject, shall cease to be a British subject by reason merely of her marriage with an alien."" I desire to safeguard the interests of those Australian women, who, being born here, are, at the time of their birth and up to the time of their marriage, entitled to all the rights of British ship, and who are, as we perhaps to say, Australian citizens. be taken for granted that the acceptance of a proposal of this kind would be radical departure, not only from legislation, but also from the obtaining, for the most part, the civilized world. I endeavoured show, on the motion for the second readunenviable ing, that it would not be so. In America, at all events, though the law is somewhat obscure, they seem to jealously the status of their * American-born women, and the marriage of an American girl to an alien does .not destroy American nationality of the woman. several of the South American the same law exists. In America it prethat vails so long as the woman continues to be domiciled in the TJnited .States of America. In Haiti and Venezuela continues under all circumstances. the emancipation of women we have vanced considerably in regard to their contractual and property rights, generally we have, by legislation, as well as by our moral code, raised the status Home and Territories) [ 5 . 3 5 ] of women very considerably time when man, being the animal, determined it by threats a club or other lethal weapon. have made considerable advance regards property and contractual and their standing as citizens, women are now entitled to the same thing. protection as men. It is curious, in the twentieth century, that a Mr Brennan. g i r l born in this country, and never having been out of it , should find herself, by reason of marriage, declared to be of German, Austrian, or French nationality when foreign blood does not flow in her veins. We have now determined that it will take five years to qualify for - nationality in this country. It may be, therefore, even with the very strongest I desire and in the best of good f a it h on the part of a man to become naturalized, - that he may find himself in the Commonin wealth for, say, three years, but disqualified from marriage with an Australian g i r l because she feels that if she contracts marriage she will lose her citizen rights.",38

I will not be dogmatic about some of the minor Republics, but I understand that under the TJnited States of America law a woman marrying a foreigner takes the nationality of her husband whether she is American-born or not.

137,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is the thin end of the wedge of Imperial Federation.,40

139,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Melbourne Ports) [5.40] - There is no doubt that, as the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) has suggested, this is the thin end of the wedge of Imperial Federation. We are getting nearer to that state of things every day. Our laws are being framed on what we think they want in the dear old Mother Country.  foreigner, married to an Australian woman, deserted her, she would get divorce and regain her nationality, and that, if she became a widow, she would have the same rights.",40
140,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If we get .much more legislation based on the idea of uniformity with the law in Great Britain, we shall undoubtedly be getting nearer to Imperial Federation, and the charge that this Parliament readily acquaesces in such legislative proposals will have much greater weight. As a representaa tive of Australian Democracy I am not going to follow slavishly any British law at all. In regard to naturalization, the sooner we break away rather than follow in British law the better it will be. There comis no reason on earth why an Australian-born woman should not have the same rights as an Australian-born man; but in this Bill we are .restricting her rights. Why should we, by means of this measure, limit the field of to any Australian-born clause woman? The whole thing is preposEngterous, and I am surprised that anybody unishould accept the principle. But I do not think it will be accepted. I know, however, that we are like voices in the wilderness in our objection to this measure, and are met with the contention 6138 Nationalily [REPRESENTATIVES. that our legislation must be brought into conformity with that of the dear old Motherland.  Motherland a lot, you know.",40
141,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Perhaps ""we do, but we owe her nothing so far as naturalization is concerned.

142,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Well , I am surprised that the Minister will, not accept the amendment. He has told us that none of the privileges obtained tinder State laws will be taken away by this measure, but we are not now allowing any opportunity for naturalization under a State law. Nobody has a right to deprive any native-born Australian woman of her birth right. Indeed, I doubt the authority of the Government to take away the birth right of any child born in Australia of an alien father, though in this Bill we say that, if a father be an unnaturalized foreigner, the mother becomes denaturalized. MT. MCWILLIAMS - Do you carry your argumentfarther, and include an Australian-born child of a Chinese father?",41
143,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I say that all children born in this country are Australian, whether the father is naturalized or not. We cannot get away from the fact that they are Australian-born citizens. It has been held in Conservative Great Britain that a father cannot sell his child's birth right, even if he leaves - England and becomes a naturalized subject of the TJnited States of America; but in this Bill we say that an Australianbom woman who marries a foreigner loses her nationality and her children beJapan. come denaturalized.

144,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Batman) [5.48] - I do not wish to delay the Committee except with a few words. When I spoke of gave the position in America, I had in mind a passage which I had read in Hall's International Law, seventh edition. He touches this subject, but does not, I ad-' mit, appear to be very .positive. On page 238 of the last edition he saysExcept in some American countries, the nationality of a wife is merged in that of her husband, so that when a woman marries a foreigner she loses her own nationality and acquires his, and a subsequent change of nationality on his part carries with it , of course, a like change on her side. By the law of the United States of America, a native woman marrying a foreigner, perhaps, remained a subject of her State, though an alien woman marrying an American citizen becomes herself naturalized; by that of Ecuador, a native woman retains her nationality so long as she stays in the country; and in Venezuela and H a it i she keeps it in all circumstances. I observe in the note to that passage that Mr Hall points out that the American law on the subject is not dear, but it appears to be as I have stated. I was referring to this statement when I spoke of the TJnited States of America as having adopted this principle. The Minister has asked - why should not an Australian-born woman marrying a foreigner who is about to return to his o.wn country take the nationality of her husband. My amendment will not in the slightest degree prevent her from doing this: It merely states that by reason only of her marriage with an alien she shall not cease to be a British subject.  Foreign Law shows that an American woman who marries an alien takes the nationality of her husband, and it gives a list of countries to which this law applies, such as France, Greece, Germany, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and",41
145,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Well, I have quoted an authority sufficient to show that I am not speaking without some knowledge of the subject. If an Australian girl, having married an alien, desires to leave this country she may become naturalized in form legislation upon another country or in the country i which her husband resides, and may betion come recognised as a citizen of that „ry, but it ought to be quite a simple matter to provide in this Bill that at least while she is domiciled in Australia she will maintain her rights as an tralian citizen, and therefore also her rights as a British subject.

As an Australian, t is I am not prepared to delegate to any other part of the Empire the power to determine the nature of legislation to be enforced in Australia.. I want to see the citizens of this country kept free from outside interference in respect to determining what laws shall apply here. As the honourable member for Batman (Mr . we Brennan) has rightly pointed out, this legislation affects vitally the interests of our women-folk. To make an Australian-born woman, who chooses to marry a perwho is not naturalized here, an alien, not in keeping with the elementary This legislation certainly does not conserve the interests of. - our own people, whose birth right it is to be An be Australian-born man can marry an alien by woman, and still be regarded as having all the conditions attaching to his citizenship; but an Australian-born woman who marries an alien is to be deprived of her birth right as an Austra",42

156,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"B y passing this Bill as it stands we shall deprive ourselves a number of Australian citizens. Legislation which will do this cannot be described as desirable and advantageous, particularly in a country which is seeking population. If we deprive Australia of her natural-born citizens by making them aliens, we cannot prosper as we should.  hold good if the honourable member could show that the Government would prevent aliens from becoming naturalized.",43
157,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At the end of five years circumstances may arise that may prevent an alien from becoming naturalized. We do not know what will happen within five years. A woman who marries an alien and is thus deprived of her nationality as an Australian, may hope to be restored to her nationality at the end of five years, but may be met by a set of circumstances under which the Government are not prepared to naturalize her husband.  oufc of a hundred the Government would agree to issue the naturalization papers.",43
158,Mr MARVIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is the hundredth case whose interests I am endeavouring to protect. My object in rising is to protect the womanhood of Australia from such legislation as this, particularly when it has not received the wholehearted endorsement of an Australian Parliament. A Democracy should demand equality of sex in the rights of citizenship. This legislation comes to us with a request that because it has been adopted in other parts of the Empire we should slavishly follow it here. I am certainly opposed to such a course where Australian interests are involved.",43
159,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Werriwa) [6.3] We are a sovereign people, with a free Constitution, aud entitled to determine matters for ourselves without dictation from elsewhere. Therefore, the proposition that we should conform to legislation of this character because it has been agreed to outside Australia does not appeal to me. This Bill may be part of an Imperial scheme, but, so f&r, Australia has not even accepted British naturalization, but has had its own law in this regard. It has not even permitted any of naturalization certificate issued in any other part of the Empire to hold good here. This was a safe course for us to adopt, and it will be a safe course for us to continue. As it is quite possible that aliens who may have been naturalized in other parts of the Empire may not be considered proper persons to be naturalized here, it is a power we ought to reserve to ourselves. However, the idea that we should adopt a clause because it has been included in legislation in another part of the Empire should have no support from us. Of course, if the merits of the provision suggest its adoption, it is quite a different matter. It seems to me absurd that an Australian-born woman, whose parents may be Australians, and probably of British descent, should, on marrying an alien, lose her Australian rights of citizenship, and be able to acquire them again only on the naturalization of her husband. I support the amendment, because I think that men and women should have equal treatment in matters of this kind. It is to the women of Australia that we look for the rearing and bringing up of future generations. The only argument for the provision in the Bil l seems to be that it conforms with the law in other parts of the Empire; but if we are to take our laws from other places, we may as well get rid of this Parliament' altogether. My view is that if the provision in the Bill cannot be supported on its own merits, it should be rejected, no matter where it may have originated.",43
160,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,West Sydney) [6.8] - I am unable to understand the Minister's statement that if the amendment is accepted the Bill will be rendered null and '- void. Why should that be so ?  the uniformity of our law with that of the Empire.,43

162,Mr EYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know nothing there to support the declaration that the acceptance of the amendment will render the Bill null and void, so far as pire-wide operation of naturalization certificates is concerned. I have already argued that it is possible, if we so desire, to provide for an Australian naturalization, allowing those who wish for an E m pire naturalization .to obtain it by complying with the necessary conditions, such as the five years' residence. At the present time, an alien can be naturalized in Australia after a residence of two years. Why cannot we retain this condition in respect of Australian naturalization, and, as the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton) has suggested, give an Empirewide certificate of naturalization to those who desire it , and comply with the conditions? The Minister said that that would require the issue of certificates of different kinds, which would cause confusion and difficulty. That objection, however, does not apply to the amendment, which provides simply for the declaration by the Committee that an Australian woman shall not, on being married to an alien, thereby be deprived of her Australian nationality, but may remain an Australian if she cares to do so. In making such a declaration, we 'should not be asking the British Empire to recognise anything. The only document which can be recognised as Empire-wide in its operation is the certificate, and the amendment says nothing of such certificate. All it says is that a woman need not give up her Australian nationality on marrying a foreigner.

The woman who marries an alien will have no document [250] or certificate except her marriage certificate, which is not the certificate referred to in the schedule. No the E m - provision is made for the issue of a certificate, and the amendment can have only an Australian operation. I hope that the Minister will consider the proposal from that point of view. It is only fair that he should do so, especially when a member like the honourable member for Moreton is convinced of the soundness of the argument, but says that, because of some artificial obstacle, he cannot support the amendment.",44

It seems to me very unfair to say that, if an Ausfcralian-born woman marries a foreigner, she shall lose her nationality. W it h her nationality such a woman loses citizen privileges, and among them the franchise. I have known Australian women to marry foreigners who have always been good Australian citizens. In some cases, unfortunately, the husbands did not get naturalized before the war, though to all intents and purposes fchey were as good citizens as any of British nationality. It is proposed that, if a woman marries an unnaturalized person, she shall lose her citizenship, and shall not be entitled fco vote until her husband has resided in Australia for five years. Previously the term of residence was two years. There is no I justification for legislation - to restrict the rights of citizenship to this extent. The plea advanced for the provision in the the Bill is that it will secure uniformity. For some time past we have been d r if t in g away from what was the practice before the war, and, instead of legislating for ourselves in the interests of this community, have been accepting legislation drafted for us in some other part of the world - Now, when we show clearly the need for an amendment of the law;, we are told by the Minister that it cannot be accepted, because the Bill would then not be in conformity with what the British Government has determined.",44

I fail to see why the plea for uniformity should be allowed to defeat an amendment which is calculated to protect the women of Australia who marry foreigners, more especially when it is proposed to increase the qualifying period for naturalization from two to five years. An Australian woman who marries a foreigner, who afterwards deserts her, is robbed of her rights as a citizen, in addition to being left here to battle along as best she can.

The only reply to our arguments throughout the debate has been the plea that we have agreed at the Imperial Conference, or made some other arrangement, to bring our legislation into conformity with that of the rest of the Empire. No case has been put forward against this amendment except that continual cry for uniformity. No attempt has been made to show what advantages will accrue to the citizens of Australia, some of whom will certainly be in danger of having their rights curtailed by this legislation, by falling into line with the legislation of Great Britain.

On the other hand, there is a peculiarity about this clause in that it expressly asserts the superiority of each and every State Legislature in a matter over which the Commonwealth has jurisdiction.

I propose to amend that clause, with a view to making it conform to the provision with which we are now dealing.",50
206,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the alteration be in conformity with the British Act? ,50
207,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It seems strange that the Minister can alter one portion of the Bill without impairing its uniformity with British legislation, but cannot alter another portion of it.  the schedule to the Bill, which is the British Act, will not affect the question of uniformity.",50
208,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Batman) [8.43] Upon the general subject of revocation, I stated previously that I do not think there should be any revocation of naturalization certificates.",50
209,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Not under any circumSt'flrT^ COS ^,50
210,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Subjec t only to one qualification, namely, that which is set out in the first part of this clause, which readsWhere the Governor General is satisfied that a certificate of naturalization' granted by him has been obtained by false representation; or fraud, or by concealment of material cir? cumstances . . . the Governor General shall, by order,, revoke the certificate. The principle which applies in the domain of real property and in the perfecting of titles whereby a certificate of title  able member think that if a naturalized person were trading with the enemy during a period of war, his certificate of naturalization should be revoked?",50
211,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I shall deal with that matter presently. I agree that Avhat one obtains by fraud should not be regarded as sacrosanct, and that he may very properly be called upon to disgorge it. There is a kind of analogy in the real property law which makes a certificate of title practically irrevocable except where it has been obtained by fraud. Apart from that condition-althoug h there may be serious offences enumerated in the clause as reasons for the revocation of letters of naturalization-ther e is a good deal to be said in favour of declining to revoke a certificate of naturalization when once it has been granted. I say that, not by way of condoning or minimizing the seriousness of the offence to which the Minister has just called attention-that of a naturalized person engaging in trade with the enemy during a period of war. That, probably, is one of the strongest grounds for revocation in the clause. But, where there are very exacting provisions to be fulfilled before a grant of letters of naturalization; where there is required, as under this Bill, five years' residence; and when the applicant is then submitted to a searching examination concerning character, and a variety of other related matters; then, after that length of residence and after that examination, when we take a man into the ranks of our citizenship we should render ourselves permanently responsible for him. From the practical stand-point, that is really a safer course than if we were to resort to the method of revocation of letters of naturalization. For, when we have revoked them, what are we going to do with the individual? ""We may resort to a policy of deportation- a practice not altogether foreign to this Government; but it is a very cumbrous and unsatisfactory way of dealing with recalcitrants of our own country. And, when we remember that these people have probably established families and have their circles of relatives and friends who still remain here, the fact of denaturalizing them creates only more dissatisfaction and danger than if we were to deal with them as law-breakers, if they are so, who were natural-born or naturalized citizens of the Commonwealth or the Empire. I was impressed by the significant remark of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Wienholt) that we should be very chary about making aliens of persons whom we had once admitted to citizenship. far from that being a disloyalist plea, it can be argued from the point of view of law-abiding citizenship. The law can and ought to punish guilty persons for what they do. When we make persons citizens, we should be permanently responsible for them. Under this Bill, revocation may be made for a number of reasons. of these are necessarily the subject of a special inquiry. The person concerned has that benefit in some of the instances quoted in the clause; while, in others, he has not. He has that right under the terms of paragraphs (a), (c), and (e) of sub-clause 2, while in paragraphs (b) and (d) he has no such right. It is certainly an advance that this right of inquiry should have been granted at all. It is something quite new and refreshing for the Government to give to any man, in circumstances of this kind, the basic justice of an open inquiry of any sort whatsoever. To that extent the Government are deserving of congratulation.  the honourable member's whole-hearted support. Mr Brennan.",50
212,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"To that extent, the Minister will receive it. But it is curious that where a personhas within five years of the date of the grant of the certificate been sentenced by any Court in His Majesty's Dominions to imprisonment of a term of not less than twelve months, or to a term of penal servitude, or to a fine of not less than one hundred pounds, his certificate of naturalization is revoked, and he has no claim to an inquiry. It is true that he is not altogether excluded from an inquiry, but he has no right to one. With the recollection that most honourable members have of the kind of thing done during the war, and of the character of the offences for which people were prosecuted, fined, and imprisoned, it must be obvious to them that it can be quite an easy thing for a very good citizen to be fined £100. Mr MCGRATH: - Did they not fine people for saying there were six Australian Divisions?",51
213,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . Men were prosecuted and punished under an Act which enabled the Court to impose a fine amounting to just this total of So £100, or a term of imprisonment covering just this same period of six months, for saying there were six Australian Divisions in the field.",51
214,Mr MCGRATH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They do not now deny that there were six.,51
215,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It was not then a question of what was right, but of what was expedient. And it was very inexpedient, for the purposes of conscripSome tion, for any one, who considered he had a special duty in telling the truth, to be permitted to do so in this respect.",51
216,Mr BELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Surely the honourable member was not punished for telling the truth ? - Mr BRENNAN - I was punished as far as it was possible to punish me. I judiciously abstained from saying there were six Divisions in any place where I was likely to be overheard by secret service men whom the honourable member's Government paid to go about the country initiating prosecutions against law-abiding citizens. If I could not be good I was careful. The Minister might at least, without interfering with that golden rule of uniformity which both possesses and oppresses him in dealing with this measure, amend the clause in order to give the benefit of a public inquiry to those persons indicated in the paragraph which I have just quoted; that is, an inquiry into the circumstances in which they have been fined. In other words, there should be a re-trial before a person is punished twice. When a man gets six months it may he taken for granted that justice has been done, and that he has been sufficiently punished for the one offence Something along the same lines of argument may be said in regard to paragraph d, in relation to which also no inquiry has been provided. I invite the attention of the Minister to the last paragraph, which reads(e) remains according to the law of a State at war with His Majesty a subject of that State. This is a ground of revocation, and mandatory at that.  nationalities?",51
217,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But why should we be governed in the treatment of our citizens by a law passed by another country over which we have not only no control, but with which we are actually at war? Let us suppose that we have a Frenchman for a fellow citizen-sinc e it is wiser to select a nation with which we are immediately and, for the present, more - friendly-wh o came out here, and. after having passed through his five years' probation, eventually became a naturalized citizen. He lives here for twenty-five [ years, rears a family, and establishes himself as a good and useful citizen in ! every respect, so that not even the most captious critic could suggest anything against him . Let us suppose, further, that war were to break out between B r it a in and France-which , God forbid - and let us suppose that France passes a law that every man born on French soil, and having had French citizenship,, shall be called to the colours, and that | they shall disregard any letters of naturalization given them by any other country. In such circumstances here is a citizen of our own country, who is paying our own taxes, and obeying our own laws, and who has not necessarily the slightest sympathy with the country from which he came; yet this foreign enemy nation is able to denaturalize a good citizen of our own country. And, because this, enemy country has declared him to be not a citizen of this country, then, ipso facto, under this clause his letters of naturalization must necessarily be revoked. That is contrary to elemental justice. I do not know on what principle it is done at all. Why should we surrender the rights of our own citizens to an enemy country against which we are fighting? And, just for the reason that-accordin g to its law - a citizen of this country ceases to be ouicitizen, why should we necessarily follow suit and cast him off?' Something like that was said about the Germans during the war. It was under what was known as the Delbruck law that the Germans were said to decline to recognise our laws of naturalization as divesting Germans of their German citizenship. But, after all, so far as I can ascertain by reference to the text books, Germany's stand in that respect was no different from the attitiide adopted by France, It a l y, and Spain. Indeed, I know scarcely any civilized country from whose laws upon this specific point those of Germany greatly differ.",52
218,Dr MALONEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Switzerlan d stands out distinct from all. Mr BRENNAN"" - Probably she does. None of these countries admits the right of its citizens to go abroad and acquire another naturalization. The Latin . maxim on the subject, well known in the text books, is Nemo potest exure patriam. "" Nobody may cast off his nationality."" That principle is well known, I say, in civilized countries. It is to be said in favour of Britain, however, that while she accepted and guarded that principle very jealously up to the time of the passing of the Naturalization Act of 1870, since then she has adopted the view that when one of her citizens goes abroad and acquires another nationality that person ceases to be a national of the British Empire. So far as I can see, Great B r it a in is almost alone in that regard; and I would like to know if the Minister can tell us what other countries have agreed to the principle that one of its citizens can go abroad and throw off nationality, and when he acquires nationality abroad, cease to owe allegiance to hi3 own country.",52
219,Mr WIENHOLT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It might get a person into a very difficult position by calling him up against his own people.,52
220,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not know what the honourable member means by that. There were men who eame to this country before the recent great and tragic war who were born in Germany, and who had established themselves here and adopted British nationality for themselves and their families. In many cases these people were whole-hearted supporters of the Allied cause; and if there is anything in war at all--and I have as little to say in its favour as any one-it is quite right that a person who adopts citizenship should make himself a citizen absolutely, with all its duties and responsibilities, whatever they may be. I would be glad if the Minister would let us know what the departmental view is concerning sub-clause c, and also if he can tell the Committee what other countries are prepared to say, '' You give our people naturalization, and we will divest them of their responsibility to us."" Great Britain has made such a declaration, but she is the only country which - has said so in so many words. If it is not as I suggest, we will have the unpleasant consequences concerning which I argued in the earlier stages of this discussion. It is somewhat difficult to deal with a clause which extends over two pages; but, so far as I know, I have expressed my principal objection to this somewhat long and involved provision.

We have been told, in a vague sort of way, about Imperial Conferences; but, so far, we have had no evidence of any such gatherings.

Some person, in order to satisfy his prejudice, or, it may be, malice"", or order to buttress up his own business against that of a rival, may send in declaration setting out grounds why, his opinion, a certificate of naturalization should not be granted or should be retion, voked; and although it may be less objectionable that the declaration should be made on oath rather than in a casual, tittle-tattle manner, still, it is equally desirable that the person making it should be prepared to support it under cross-examination, and come into the light of day. The Minister, or the tribunal which may be formed under 'this Bill, should have full power to cross-examine him, in order that the public may know who he is, what his motives are, and sources of his information. It is vellous what strong declarations some people will make if they are satisfied their declarations will not be examined, or that they will not be cross-examined to the truth of what they have stated. During the war this odious system, this throw-back to medievalism, which was the engine of so much injustice, was popular with the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), who, apparently, not having a scintilla of idea as to what conposed stituted justice, was ready to throw men into prison, and keep them there, on secret evidence of any person who, actuated by malice, or for any reason, was pleased to decry a fellow man; and it makes one indignant now to minded, after the war is gone, of the kind of thing sanctioned by the Government, and especially by the Minister for Defence during the war, except in those cases ""where members of his own party disciplined"" him, and made him trial to persons whom he was prepared to treat unjustly.

""When a declaration is made to in the effect that an alien who wishes to be naturalized is not entitled to naturalizaor that a naturalized person should be denaturalized, the person making it should be put into the witness-box. During the recent war drastic legislation was passed, both in Australia and elsewhere, giving Governments greater powers than they exercised in normal times; and we seem unable to get out of the groove into which we then fell, our legislation still being based on abnormalities such as arose out of the war. In my opinion, both clauses 25 and 26 should be struck the out. I do not approve of these declaramartions. There are many ways of bringing evidence against persons without allow that ing declarations to be sent to a Department which are not to be made public. as Many persons, if they knew that their names would be published, would not make damaging statements about others; but, with the guarantee of secrecy, some very persons have no scruples about taking away the character of others who are probably much better men.

245,Mr JAMES PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Maranoa) [9.52]. - If there is one man in the Chamber more than another who would like every one to get British justice, it is the Minis preceding clause in connection with that under discussion he will see how unjust is the law proposed in regard to a man applying for naturalization. ""We cannot forget the evidence on which many Australian-born persons were interned in . this country during the war. In the Moreton. district several men, as loyal as any in the community, were interned on framedup evidence, as they have since been able to prove to the satisfaction of their neighbours. I have particularly in mind the case of a man who was interned merely for political reasons. He was a professional man, occupying a high and responsible position in the Moreton district; but, because he got into ""holts"" with the Conservative candidate, a case was framed up against him. In the first instance, the uniformed police made a thorough investigation, but without result, and then two detectives were employed, who, after they had made an in - 5 quiry, reported favourably upon him. Then the authorities procured a couple of military spies, who soon rigged up a case, and the man was interned, although he was as innocent as I am. Indeed, he had never uttered the things that I have said on the public platform against this Government without being interned. He was taken from his wife and family, and his profession was ""cruelied."" Under the clause, similar treatment might be meted out to a man applying for naturalization. The Bill does not deal with Germans only, it deals with all aliens, including those whom our friends opposite - the flag-waggers, the band players, the God-save-the-Kingers spoke of as "" our brother Allies."" It wassuggested that I should be run in,"" because of what I had said about the Japanese in Northern Queensland. A detective followed me around to every platform, practically asking me to say something against the Japanese. Several members on this side of the House, including the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) and the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) were prosecuted; and I say that it is not British fair play if the accuser in a case is not there to be cross-examined. All we ask for is an open Court.  make a declaration which is produced in evidence.",58
246,Mr JAMES PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But the clause speaks of ""any declaration,"" and that covers any declaration made against the man who desires to be naturalized. This means that declarations made in secret may be used as evidence.  that the name of the person who makes the declaration shall not be disclosed.",58
247,Mr JAMES PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Any person may make representations in the form of a statutory declaration. Let me give honourable members a case, as the position strikes me. A person makes an application for naturalization, and, perhaps, some one in the same line of business desires to get a blow in ""under the belt.'' A man may be accused of having uttered disloyal sentiments years ago, and the accusation may be made in secret. This accusation is placed before the Minister, and the poor devil accused knows nothing of the charge made against him: Is that' British fair' play ?'  vided that the name of the accuser sball be disclosed?",58

The clause originally provided that these representashould be in the form of a statutory declaration, and that the contents should not be disclosed to any person without the consent of the informant, except in a prosecution for perjury.

The  the removal of the most objectionable part of clause 25. I am quite willing to admit that some good purpose may be served by clause 26, and for that reason would not like to see it completely struck out, but on its wording it refers both to the declaration in clause 24 and the declaration in clause 25. Under clause 26 the evidence is not only that a declaration was made, but also as to the contents of that declaration, because a true copy may be produced. The declaration is also to be evidence that the person named in it made the declaratidn, and that the declaration was made on the date mentioned. The form of declaration mentioned in clause 24 has to be made by the person applying for naturalization, and if. in subsequent years litigation arises, perhaps by his children claiming to be British subjects, or that their father was naturalized, it may be necessary for them to prove that he made the declaration under clause 24, by the production of the declaration filed by him. Then the contents of that declaration are proven under the provisions of clause 26. A very good purpose is served by clause 26 so far as that declaration is concerned, and to that extent the clause should stand. same time there is foundation for the objections so forcibly put by the honourable members for Batman (Mr Brennan), Hunter (Mr Charlton), and Maranoa (Mr James Page). This can be got over by excepting from the operation of clause 26 the declaration referred to in clause 25. Do not make the production evidence of the declaration itself. ",59
261,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then I move That after the word "" repealed "" the ing words be inserted :- "" except a declaration .made under the last preceding section. I cannot exactly see in what legal proceedings a declaration under clause 25 will require, to be produced. In fact, do not think clause 26 was ever intended to apply to the provisions of clause 25. Clause 25 has evidently been put in afterwards. The provisions of clause 26 are apt and appropriate for such formal declarations as a person is required to make when he applies for naturalization. It might later be said that the person never made a declaration, and his certificate might be challenged. In such a case proof by the production of the declaration is desirable.",60
262,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is to be gained by excepting declarations made under clause 25 if they do get into any Court?,60
263,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The things that may be declared in that declaration are not formal matters.,60
264,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,All that clause 26 says is that it is evidence of the person named as declarant having made the declaration.,60
265,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It proves more than that. It proves the declaration itself. Any copy produced has to be certified to be a true copy. It must be a true copy, because you are proving the declaration itself. Otherwise it would be only necessary to have the name and date copied. The clause says in so many words that you are proving the contents.",60

267,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The clause says, "" An y declaration . . . may be proved.'' It goes on to say, "" The production of the declaration or copy shall be evidence of the person therein named as declarant having made the declaration at the date therein mentioned.""  the declaration.",60

269,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTHERN TERRITORY,In clause 27 the same words are used to imply that the contents are to be proved.,60
270,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Of course, it proves the contents. The first part of it makes it followevidence of the things contained in the declaration; the second part of it makes it evidence of the time that the declaration was made. Oft.en the time at which a declaration is made is important. I For example, where a naturalization certificate was challenged, it would be important to prove that the declaration was made before the date in the certificate, because the applicant is required to make the declaration before. Under clause 24, it is provided that he ""shall produce in support, of. his application his own statutory declaration."" I , therefore, contend that the clause means that the production of the declaration, or a true copy thereof, proves not only the contents, but also the date. It would be very dangerous to allow things to be proved such as may be declared under clause 25. We do not know what may be the representations made under that clause; but we know the matters that may be declared under clause 24. - That clause deals with very formal matters. Under it, the applicant is to declare .his name, age, birthplace, occupation, and residence, the length of his residence in the British Empire, or the period within the eight years preceding the date of his application, during which he has been in the service of the Crown. All these are simple, straightforward matters, to which he has to declare; but we cannot say whafc sort of - representations might be made under clause 26. They might be such as were referred to by the honourable member  member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), and the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan); but I think that with this amendment the objection will be overcome.

The honourable gentleman has contended that the production of the declaration referred to is not to be evidence against the person making that declaration. Our interpretation of the clause is that it is designed to provide evidence, and, that being so, that it must be evidence against the person concerned. There can be no getting away from that position; but if the Minister's contention is correct, he should be able to accept, without further discussion, the amendment that I propose to submit.

The person against whom a charge is made ought to have the right to cross-examine the declarant. Otherwise he will not be afforded a fair chance of establishing his NOES. innocence. Every man should be given the fullest opportunity of proving his innocence in respect of any charge which may be laid against him.
