2,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Mr Mason Allard, one of the Commonwealth Government's representatives on the Board of Amalgamated Wireless, and its chairman, proceeded to Great Britain last year, and returned to Australia about a fortnight ago. I had an interview with him when he was passing through Melbourne, and he is sending to the Government a report of the communications which took place .between the British Government and himself concerning beam stations, . At the moment I do not think there is any statement on the matter that I can usefully make. NA  the Prime Minister been drawn to the report of a new methoddiscovered by Professor J . M . Thompson, a botanist of Liverpool, for the storage and transport of f r u it ? If so, will the Government take early steps to test the value of the new method? For the right honourable gentleman's information, I may say that in a report to the Weekly Times representative in London on the 28th January, Professor Thompson saysI am positive that 1I have found the key to the whole problem of Empire fruit transport and storage. I shall be able commercially to revolutionize long distance shipments. In the course of his report, he refers to Australia, and says The journey from Australia is a trifling affair, as storage from four to six months will be easy. I am prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth and State Governments and private firms to test the transport and storage of all kinds of fruits, including Queensland pineapples. Is the Government prepared to allow representatives of the Commonwealth in London to examine Professor Thompson's claims in this matter?",14
3,Mr BRUCE,STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF,"I suggest that the honourable member should get into touch with the Department of Markets and Migration. He will there obtain the fullest information we have on the subject.

5,Mr BRUCE,STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF,"If the Government undertook to do that in the case of one organization, it might be asked to do it with respect to all. We could not possibly undertake such a responsibility. LEAGUE OF NATIONS .",15
6,Mr COLEMAN,STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF,Can the Prime M in ister inform the House whether any representations have been made by . the Commonwealth Government in regard to FRUIT. the proposed alteration of the representation of nations on the Council of the League of' Nations ?,15
7,Mr BRUCE,STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF,The Government has been in receipt of cablegrams from the British Government with regard to the number of permanent members upon the Council of the League of Nations; but there is no information on the subject which I can usefully give to the House.,15
8,Mr COLEMAN,STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF,South Africa has protested against the proposal.,15
9,Mr BRUCE,STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF,"I noticed a paragraph to that effect, in this morning's newspapers. Communications from any of the dominions to-the British Government are automatically forwarded to the other dominions, and the Commonwealth Government has no information on the subject referred to in the newspaper paragraph. BUSH FIRES. POSSIBLE SHORTAGE OF FRUIT CASES.  in the Herald last evening suggesting that, as a result of the bush fires in Victoria, there may be a shortage of f r u it cases, will the Minister for. Trade and Customs cause inquiry to be made and see that any such shortage shall if possidle be avoided ?  concerning the matter referred to have been made to the Department for Trade and Customs. In view of the large quantity of timber said to be available in Australia, the difficulty which the honourable member's question suggests is, I think, one which those most concerned should first, attempt to deal with.

11,Mr BRUCE,STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :(a) Returned soldiers who have passed the examination for appointment to the Third Division of the Commonwealth Service will be permanently appointed, as vacancies occur, in their order of merit at the examination. (&) No distinction can he made between those in temporary employment and others not so employed. HOUSING ACCOMMODATION. Mr ""WEST asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeIn view of the statements being continually made from public platforms and pulpits, and also appearing in the press, that there is a shortage of 30,000 houses, which is affecting the public health, and that the position will be made worse with the arrival of additional immigrants who are likely to come_in greater numbers owing to the passing of the Widows and Fatherless Children Pension Bill, and the adoption of the 44-hour week in New South VVales, will he make a statement as to when Parliament will have the opportunity of assisting the Government with that proposal referred to in their policy as the "" Housing Scheme""?",16

The Tariff Board has not yet completed its inquiry, and until its report is received I am not in a position to give the honourable member the information he desires. - Mr GREGORY asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that evidence has been given by reputable firms before the Tariff Board to the effect that the non-imposition of a dumping duty on wire netting would not affect the selling price in Australia; in other words, that if netting were imported at a landed cost less than the Australian wholesale price, it would provide a greater profit for the importing merchant, and not a cheaper price for the farmer purchaser? 2. If so, will he instruct the Tariff Board to inquire whether there is any combination 'between itjie Australian manufacturers and any of the wholesale houses in Australia, or anything in the nature of restraint of trade, or of any agreement not to sell at prices leas than that fixed by the Australian manufacturers, or of any trade influences which would tend to compel or induce the wholesale dealers to concur in a trade policy of refusing to sell British goods in Australia at a fair market price?  inquired into.

The scale provides a specific rate of payment for each class of work performed, and the remuneration is calculated on a unit basis. It also includes an allowance for the provision of office accommodation and lighting. 2. The minimum payment is Â£25 per annum, but as a general rule this rate operates only for a short period after the establishment of ' the offiee. The payment is not affected by the amount of revenue, and frequently the payment made for the work exceeds the reearned at the office. 3. There is .no fixed minimum. The scale of payment operates irrespective of the comvolume of business transacted. DESIGN OF POSTAGE STAMPS..",17

Will he direct that regulations under the be framed and gazetted forthwith, so as to afford redress to unfortunates who have pubmet with accidents during the course of their display at the occupations ? 4. For what reason have the regulations prounder the said Workers' Compensation Ordintable of ance been so long deferred?",18
28,Mr MARR,ELECTORAL DIVISIONAL,"The answers to the honourable member's question's are as follow :1. The ordinance is in force in the Territory, to the extent that it is' dependent upon matters to be prescribed by regulation, it is not fully operative, as regulations prescribing certain matters of procedure have not yet been promulgated. 2. The department has information respecting one claim only, and that is of very recent 3 and 4. The delay in promulgating the regulations has been largely due to certain difficulties which have arisen in connection with procedure and interpretation. An early soluastion of the difficulties in question is anticipated, and every endeavour is being made to the ensure that the regulations shall be promulwith as little further delay as possible. - SOUTH AFRICA.

30,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"Certain of the information desired by the honourable member was supplied by me on the 3rd February, 1926, in reply to questions asked by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr . Mackay). I will communicate with the Commonwealth Shipping Board regarding the further information desired, and w i ll advise the honourable member more full y as early as possible. NA",19
31,Mr HILL,CONTRACT FOR STEEL,"The contract for steel sleepers referred to yesterday by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Makin) is one requiring special plant. It could not be carried out by any small manufacturers, could not give satisfactory deliveries or manufacture them at reasonable rates. If the manufacture of steel sleepers is to become an established industry in Australia, this can be achieved only by proper plants being installed, otherwise the price and deliveries would make their use impossible. I have reason to believe that more than one Australian firm will quote under the conditions laid down. The sleepers are required to be delivered at Darwin . To send them up in monthly instalments would entail utilizing the monthly service to that place, a3 monthly deliveries would not j u s t if y the chartering of a special steamer. Even if the monthly boat to Singapore, which calls at Darwin , could undertake their delivery, the additional freight entailed would make this proposition impracticable. The delivery by f o ur specific dates, not three shipments, as stated by the honourable member, was deliberately arranged so as to provide shipments of sufficient size to justify the employment of steamers.",19
32,Mr MAKIN,CONTRACT FOR STEEL,"W h e r e from? . Mr HILL - F r o m wherever it is antiSALE OF VESSELS - cipated the contract will be let. The value of the contract will exceed Â£200,000. To give an idea of what is entailed, it is mentioned that if only one press were employed, and a sleeper turned out every two and a half minutes, working three shifts a day for six days a week, it would take 111 weeks to manufacture the 352,000 sleepers required. It is evident, therefore, that more than one press will be required, in addition to which special arrangements will have to be made, which no small tenderer could face. Tenders were called only in Australia, but it was specified that either Australian or British tenders would be accepted-n o other country than B r it a in was included. There will , therefore, be no foreign contractor competing with Australia, as stated by the honourable member, and the shipments SLEEPERS. specified were definitely arranged so as to reduce the cost to the Australian manufacturer as well as the British . The [2.48] -(B y tariff on British sleepers is 48s. a ton, plus 25 per cent.; on those from other countries, 90s., plus 35 per cent. Tenders were invited on ""20th January, 1926, and are due to close on 16th March, 1926. Dealing with the honourable member's reas they quests seriatim, the replies are1. That the contractors be permitted to deliver sleepers in monthly instalments, instead of in three shipments, as the latter gave an undue advantage to foreign tenderers. Reply - The delivery of sleepers is not specified in three shipments, but by four specified dates. Deliveries at Darwin in lesser quantities would unduly add to their cost, and the specified deliveries are as much to tha advantage of the' Australian manufacturer (who is sufficiently big to carry out this contract), as to the British manufacturer, with whom only the Australian manufacturer is competing. 2. That the contractor be granted monthly progress payments. Reply - The contract provides that progress payments shall be made on the delivery of each shipment, but there is nothing to prevent any one when tendering making it a condition Hi at advance payments for portion of the value of the sleepers shall be made as they are manufactured. Such a request would be considered in dealing with the tenders. 3. That there is only one firm at present in Australia in a position to tender undor the terms of the contract as proposed. Reply - T have reason to believe that more special than one Australian contractor will tender under the conditions as laid downjby the department. 4. That [Australian manufacturers - be not placed at a disadvantage, and manufacturers abroad given an advantage, in the of sleepers required for the Commonwealth - railways. Reply - So far as the conditions under which . the contract is to be complied with are concerned, both Australian and British manufacturers are on the same footing. NA PROCEEDINGS .",19
33,Mr HUGHES,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"B y way of personal explanation, I desire to call attention an-error in the Votes and Proceedings yesterday. They show that I was absent from the sitting, and as I have a lively recollection of having been present I desire the libel to be corrected.",20
34,Mr SPEAKER,ERROR IN VOTES AN D," The correction has been already made in the revised issue. CRIMES BILL . In committee (Consideration resumed from 17th February, vide page 988) : Clauses 2 and 3 agreed to.

37,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Y a r r a ) [2.59] - Post poned clause 4 defines a constable, and proposed new section 8A empowers "" any to constable "" to arrest without warrant. of Whilst it is necessary to give that power to a constable who, for instance, sees a very person breaking into a building, the granting of the same authority in connection with an industrial dispute is quite a different matter. I suggest to the Attorney-General that the proposed new section should be postponed u n t i l clause 4 has been dealt with .",20
38,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,The two are not interdependent.,20
39,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Peac e officers were appointed under the Peace Ofiicers A ct for a special purpose, which was, mainly, to deal with industrial disputes.",20
40,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,That is not so.,20
41,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"There is not the slightest doubt that they were appointed any in connection with the British seamen's strike, which was an industrial dispute. If . . . the Attorney-General will frankly say that the object of the clause is to give to a constable the right to arrest without warrant persons engaged in industrial disputes, we shall join issue with him right away. f he desires to l i m it the power of arrest warrant to cases in which a in - policeman sees a person breaking into a the shop, or committing some other obvious offence, we take no objection; but we cannot agree to give a constable the right to is arrest without warrant persons who, in our judgment, are not criminals, and have committed no offence except that they have done something which the - powers that be regard as an offence.",20
42,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Kooyong-Attorney - It is intended by this of clause to make the enforcement of the act Section 8 of act gives to a constable certain powers It has been in practice to apply that section, because the powers of a constable at common law depend largely upon the distinction drawn between a felony and a misdemeanour. At common law a constable may arrest without warrant for a felony, but in general he may not do so for a misdemeanour, unless there is special statutory provision to that effect. Commonwealth legislation there is no distinction between a felony and a misdemeanour, and, accordingly, section 8 is difficult to apply. The proposed new section 8A is for the purpose of conferring power of arrest without warrant only where the requirements of paragraphs a and 6 of the proposed section are fulfilled. It is not proposed to give a general power of arrest without warrant. The conditions of paragraphs a and b are that the constable must have reasonable ground for believing "" that the person has committed an offence against the law of the Commonwealth,"" and "" that proceedings against the person by summons would not be effective."" The second paragraph refers to cases in which the offender by absconding might evade service of the summons, and to cases in which, if he were summoned, the proceedings might not be effective, because he might not put in an appearance at the court. The States have legislation providing for arrest without warrant in a large number of cases. In the State of New South Wales the Crimes Act of 1900, as since amended, provides that a constable may arrest with out warrant any person whom he with reasonable cause suspects of having committed an - offence irrespective of the requirements of paragraph b of this clause. Therefore, the law in New South Wales today is practically the same as that provided in paragraph a of the proposed new section 8A without the limitation imposed by paragraph b. This provision does not go so. far as the act now in force in New South Wales. All the other States have provided for arrest without warrant for different classes offences. Various crimes under the Police Offences Act and the Crimes Act of Victoria come within this class, and under the following acts there are provisions for arrest without warrant:-Explosive s Act 1915; Geelong Harbour Trust Act 1915; Health Act 1915; Local Government Act 1915; Marine Act 1915; Markets Act 1915; Melbourne. Harbour. Trust Act 1915; Public Works Act 1915; Railways Act 1915; Stamps Act 1915; and U n l a w f u l Assemblies and Processions Act 1915. One result of dealing with this subject of arrest without warrant in separate statutes is that a constable is apt to be uncertain of his powers. He has to conIn sider the particular legislation under which he is operating, and that obviously hampers the administration of the law. When an act is made an offence under the law it is proper to allow an arrest without warrant if the constable has reasonable ground to believe the facts set out in paragraphs a and b of the clause. If a constable were to act without reasonable ground-and that would be a matter entirely for a jury-h e would be liable to heavy damages. The objection to the provision for arresting persons guilty of industrial offences is not really associated with this, clause; it raises the question whether there should be industrial offences. If there be industrial offences, they must be treated as breaches of the law, and the ordinary procedure of the law must be applied to them. The alternative to introducing a general section, safeguarded as this one is, is to consider whether it is necessary to insert a special provision for arrest without warrant m each of the bills brought before this House. That would be highly inconvenient, and the officers administering the law would have some difficulty in ascertaining their powers. The officers administering the law would know exactly their powers under this clause, which is not nearly so drastic as the New South Wales act. It appears to be a perfectly reasonable. provision. An individual arrested under this clause may immediately apply to a magistrate for bail. Clause agreed to. Clause 8 agreed to. Clause 9 (Search Warrant).",20
43,Mr SCTTLLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Y a r r a ) [3.9] - Sectio n 10 of the act, as amended by the bill , will readof If a justice of the peace is satisfied by information on oath that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that there is in any house, vessel, or place(a) anything with respect to which any offence against any law of the Commonwealth has been, or is suspected on reasonable grounds to have been, committed; What is the reason for adding the words ' ' any law of the Commonwealth "" ?",21
44,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.10] - Unde r the provision it is intended to increase the power of justices of the peace in issuing search - warrants.. At present they can issue them only when the offences in question Happen to be indictable. I can best explain the necessity for this clause by giving one or two actual instances which have arisen in the administration of the law. Certain provisions in the Australian Soldiers patriation Act prohibit the of pensions. A penalty of Â£ 2 5 is prothis vided by statutory rule in the case of persons who advance money on the in security of pensions. This is not made an indictable offence, and, accordingly, it is impossible to issue search warrants in such cases. It is known by the CommonThis wealth authorities that some pawndealt brokers and money-lenders have been adtion vancing money on the security of pensection, sions, and that they have pension ceralthough tificates in their safes. In some cases evidence of the soldier can be obtained to show that he handed over his pension certificate to the pawnbroker or the money-lender. Against his word is the pawnbroker's or money-lender's version, and it then becomes a of who is to be believed. is no power to search or safes to find out whether loans diction. were made against pension certificates, because this offence under statutory rule is not made indictable. The object of amendment, therefore, is simply this: that where it is shown to the satisfaction of a justice of the peace that there is reasonable ground for believing that articles, including books and documents which may provide evidence of an offence having been committed, are in the possession of a person, search may be made for those articles - There is no General) sanctity about an indictable offence, and the the Commonwealth authorities in the ministration of the law should not be be read in conjunction with hampered, as they are now, owing to the precise terms of the section which we propose to amend. This clause does not give a general power to justices of the peace to issue search warrants as they please. They must be satisfied, before isstiing a search warrant, of the facts set out in the clause. Clause agreed .to. Clause 10After section twelve of the principal act the diction ? following section is inserted :"" 12A -(1.) Any offence against this act, small matter. although declared indictable, may, with the consent of the defendant, be heard and mined by a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. Ifr. Latham. "" (2.)

50,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,The legislation of States does not permit the prosecutor to decide where the offence shall be heard.,23
51,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The legislation of the States contains general provisions which permit a court to deal with offences in relation to property, where the subject matter is smalli n value. The justices are then able to deal with the case summarily instead of committing the person concerned for t r i a l. This is a question for the consideration of the committee. I do not wish to take up a dogmatic attitude, because it appears to me that on this matter there may well be a difference of opinion. It is important to remember that this olause deals only with offences is relation to property and substantially amount to larceny. The clause is drawn upon the view that an offence in relation to property of a value of less than Â£ 5 0 may, if the Commonwealth authorities think proper, well ' be dealt with by a court of summary jurisdiction. That is the whole idea of the clause. Of course, it plainly permits the - Commonwealth authorities to decide whether an offence in relation to property under Â£ 5 0 in value shall be tried before a magistrate.",23

That clause throws upon the person accused the onus of proving his innocence, r have always thought that it was a f u n damental principle of British justice that upon the Crown, or the person prosecuting, is thrown the onus of proving the defendant guilty. As this proposed new sub-section is in opposition to that principle, I should be glad to hear from the Attorney-General the reason for its in clusion in the bill .",23
57,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Kooyong-^Attorney General) [3.23] - B y taking a similar case from the State law, I may be able to make my explanation clearer. Let us suppose that a person is charged with having driven a motor car without a licence. In the absence of some special provision in the law to meet the circumstances,' the prosecution would have to prove, first, that the person accused If it drove the motor car, and, secondly, that he had not a licence. It is difficult to prove a negative, whereas, if the accused person has been granted a licence, he should have no difficulty in proving it . This clause is designed to meet cases of that kind. Under the Commonwealth law the same principle applies in the Customs Act in the case of persons who may remove goods only with certain lawf u l authority. Should a man be charged with having removed goods without lawful authority, it would be difficult for the prosecution to call every one who might have given him authority to remove the goods to show that no such authority had been given. The possession, or otherwise, of authority to remove the goods would be a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused.",23
58,Mr COLEMAN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Coul d not the same principle be applied to industrial offences also?,23
59,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"No . In such cases uo question arises as to doing acts without lawful authority, or without lawful authority or excuse, or without permission. I know of no industrial offence to which this principle could apply. The object of the clause is to deal with cases such as I have mentioned.",24
60,Mr WEST,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"East Sydney) [3.25] - I know of no other law which providesthat the onus of proving his innocence shall rest with the person accused. Under the Roman law, I believe that that is the position, but British law throws upon the prosecutor the onus of proving the guilt of the person accused. I do not think that the committee will stand for an alteration of that fundamental principle of British justice. The case instanced by the Attorney-General is different from this one. Before voting for the clause, I should like him to give some better reason for its inclusion in the bill. A person who is charged with an offence is sometimes awkwardly placed because of his inability to get bail or to obtain proper legal advice. He may not be aware that he has committed an offence. Unless a better reason for the inclusion of this clause is given, the mittee would be well advised to reject it . Personally, I think that it has been inserted to see whether members of the Opposition are alive to the danger of such a vital principle being interfered with.",24
61,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Yarra) [3.29] - It is true, as the Attorney-General has stated, that various measures now on the statute book provide that the burden of proving his innocence shall be thrown upon the accused. Otherwise, the Crown would be expected to prove a negative. This proposed new sub-section, however, begins' "" Where under any law of the Commonwealth """,24
62,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,The effect of the proposed new su.b-section is limited in that it applies only to the charge of having done something without lawful authority.,24
63,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,There can be no lawful authority for any offence against the law. Lawful authority cannot be given to break the law.,24
64,Mr MAXWELL,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Some acts which, when committed without authority are offences, are not offences if done with authority.",24
65,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Surely the honourable member does not suggest that that is the intention here?,24
66,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Yes .,24
67,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"This proposed section shows the danger of mixing crimes with offences that are not crimes. Where there may be political bias, there is uecd for honourable members to carefully scrutinize a provision like this, because under it a person charged with assisting others to strike may be called upon to prove his innocence. To say that under any law of the Commonwealth any act, if done without lawful authority, is an offence against that law, and that the burden of proof of his innocence rests on the offender, seems to be a breach of the principles of British justice.",24
68,Mr COLEMAN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Reid) [3.32] - I should like to ask the Attorney General (Mr Latham) if a person who ventures on to a wharf in connection with a union's business becomes guilty of an offence if he goes on that wharf without lawful authority?,24
69,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"That man might be charged with trespassing, in which case com- he would be prosecuted under a State law, but this section would not apply to him.",24
70,Mr COLEMAN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"On e must of necessity defer to the legal knowledge of the. honourable and learned member, but we are naturally suspicious of a bill of this kind which deals with industrial offences. The proposed new section reads as follows :Where under any law of the Commonwealth any act, if done without lawful authority or without lawful authority or excuse It seems to me that there is a certain amount of redundancy about it.",24
71,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.33] - The apparent re? dundancy in the proposed new section is unavoidable, because some statutes use the words ""without lawful authority,"" and others use the words ""without lawful authority or excuse."" In order to remove any misapprehension on the part of honourable members, I might illustrate exactly what this proposed section will do. Where the charge is that the person has' done something without lawful authority, it is proposed to shift the onus of proof as to the existence of the authority. The examples which I have already given indicate fairly the difficulty of the prosecution in having to prove the negative. Under section 82 of the Defence Act any person who, without l a w f u l authority, makes or attempts to make a sketch, drawing, photograph, picture, or painting of any fort, battery, field work, fortification, & c , is guilty of an offence. The offence consists in doing something without l a w f u l authority. The allegation of the absence of that l a w f u l authority is a necessary part of the charge.",24
72,Mr MAXWELL,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,The absence of that l a w f u l authority is the essence of the offence.,25
73,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"It is. In such a case the effect of the proposed new section would be to require the defendant to show that he had authority to make his sketch or drawing, and this he could easily do if he had the necessary authority. Section 120 of the Excise Act provides that no person shall sell except by authority any excisable goods unlawfully removed from a factory. If this proposed section were the law the Crown would still have to prove that the goods were excisable, that they were removed from a factory, and that the defendant had sold them. The defendant would have to prove that if he did all these things, he did them under authority. That is the only effect of the proposed section. The defendant will be required to show that he has authorityto do an act which is only unlawful if he has not that authority. It is a reasonable provision. Clause agreed to. Clause 16 agreed to. Clause 17 (Unlawful associations).",25
74,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Hunter ) [3.35] This is a very important clause. proposes to insert in the act a number of new sections relating to the protection of the Constitution and of public and other services. The following are declared to be unlawful associations:(a) Any body of persons, incorporated or unincorporated, which by its constitution . or propaganda or otherwise advocates or encourages(i) the overthrow of the Constitution of the Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage; (ii) the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of a State or of any other civilized country or of organizod government; or (iii) the destruction or injury of property of the Commonwealth or of property used in trade or commerce with otlier countries or among the States, or which is, or purports to be, affiliated with any organization which advocates or encourages any of the doctrines or practices specified in this paragraph; (b) Any body of persons, incorporated or unincorporated, which by its constitution or propaganda or otherwise advocates or encourages the doing of any act having or purporting to have as an object the carrying out of a seditious intention as denned in section 24A of this act. Honourable members of the Opposition do not stand for violent revolution. There is nothing better than adult suffrage, which permits the people of a country to determine everything for themselves. But the proposed provision lends itself to criticism, and certainly calls for explanation. The words, "" The overthrow of the Constitution of the Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage "" are too indefinite. No one would contend that persons who seek to bring about some radical change in our form of government should be punished so long as they proceed on lines that are constitutional and in a manner that does not lend itself to violence. I could understand the provision better if the words '' violent revolution "" were used. Authorities admit that a revolution may be brought about in a legitimate manner, and that it may not necessarily be sought to be achieved in contravention of the settled policy of a country. In substantiation of this point, I quote resolution 74 of the Industrial Policy of the Church of England, adopted at the Lambeth conference. It reads as follows: An outstanding and pressing duty of the Church is to convince its members of the necessity of nothing less than a fundamental It change in the spirit and working of our economic life. Dean H a r t, of Melbourne, in a pamphlet dealing with the resolution, explains what was meant by a "" fundamental change ""A "" fundamental change"" is a revolution. I do not mean a violent one. The committee say plainly that "" the goal can never be reached by violent revolution."" Apart from its immorality, violence is ineffective. Yet, under the bill, the overthrow of the Constitution by revolution is to be a criminal act! Certain sections of the people may advocate a change; or a movement in that direction may be commenced by one or more of the States.",25
75,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Would the honourable member say that every basic change in the Constitution must necessarily be brought about by revolutionary means ?,26
76,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"If there is a complete change, it can be termed a revolutionary one.",26
77,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,There is a distinction between the two.,26
78,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,There is certainly a distinction between a violent revolution and one that is carried on within the law.. I can quote no better authority in support of that contention than the Church of England. Very few honourable members will deny the logic of the statement issued by the conference of that church.,26
79,Mr MAXWELL,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,-Is there any objection to revolution by violence? Mr ' CHARLTON - That is not provided for in the clause.,26
80,Mr MAXWELL,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,The mention of sabotage indicates the character of the revolution that is referred to.,26
81,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The clause says, ""revolution or sabotage,"" not ""revolution and sabotage."" The word ""violent"" should appear before ""revolution "" to indicate the use of force to accomplish the end sought.",26
82,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"May I direct the attention of the honourable member to the word ""overthrow"" at the beginning of the clause? The overthrow of the Constitution is entirely different from its amendment or alteration.",26
83,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,The overthrow of the Constitution may be brought about in a legitimate way. But it would still be a fundamental change.,26
84,Mr MAXWELL,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,The honourable member confuses revolution with evolution.,26
85,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I do not. There may be a peaceful revolution to bring about a change in any state of society. My argument is buttressed by the statement of the conference of the Church of England, which is an authority that stands very high. I cannot imagine any honourable member saying .that the Church of England would advocate any action that might be detrimental to the well-being of this or any other community.",26
86,Mr MAXWELL,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Can the honourable member give an historical instance of peaceful revolution?,26
87,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"If there is a desire to bring about a change, and it is advocated in a proper way, the people are educated up to it . That would be, in fact, a revolution, a basic change, brought about according to law and order. May I quote further from this authority ? He saysBut there is another kind of revolution. Tiie complete change of the system of British farming in the eighteenth century is always referred to as the agrarian revolution. The later change which the use of power-driven machinery made in manufacture, is the industrial revolution. But at the time it was hardly realized that a revolution was going on. That shows plainly that .there can be a peaceful revolution. I do not wish to be misunderstood. I am merely endeavouring to point out what I regard as defects in the bill.",26
88,Mr WATSON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The honourable member wishes to insert the word "" violent"" ? ",26
89,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"That word should qualify "" revolution "" in the clause. . Mr WATSON - There should be no objection to that. ' Mr Charlton - I wish to hear what the Minister has to say. Difficulty is also experienced when we endeavour to define ""sabotage."" I understand that word to mean the destruction of property; but unless a plain definition is given trouble will be encountered, later.",26
90,Mr MAXWELL,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The definition of "" sabotage "" can be found in the addenda to the 1924 edition of Webster's Dictionary.",26
91,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I have not been able to find a definition in the dictionaries .that I have consulted. The clause also makes provision for deportation in certain circumstances. Any one found guilty of specified offences may be sentenced to imprisonment and may subsequently be deported, at the direction : of - the' Attorney-General. I agree that the power to deport should be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament. That power, however, must be exercised in a. reasonable way. What causes me concern is, when does a person become an acknowledged citizen of Australia? Some one who emigrated to Australia 20 years ago, and has since complied with all outlaws, may, because of a mistake, come within this provision and render himself liable to be deported. Should we deport any one who has resided in Australia for that length of time? Our existing legislation gives the Government the power to deport a person within three years of his arrival in Australia. I gravely doubt whether we should be justified in deporting any British citizen. We all belong to the one Empire, and we claim that we desire to bring about closer relations amongst the people of the Empire. Will the deportation of Britishers have a tendency in that direction ? comes to Australia from Britain , and with in a reasonable time commits acts which prove that he is not amenable to our laws, he should be deported. But where is the line to be drawn? A Britisher is entitled to the franchise after six months' residence in Australia. It is but fair that he should be amenable to our laws when he has a voice in the affairs of the country. I doubt whether the power to deport should be placed in the hands of the Attorney-General. I have nothing to say against the present Attorney-General. Any man who occupied that position would, I know, endeavour to do what was right. But it must be admitted that a certain amount of prejudice exists among politicians. A man may be unconscious of such prejudice, but it is there, and may possibly lead to injustice. I submit that it should be left to a court to decide whether a man should be deported after he has served a sentence imposed by it .",26
92,Mr BELL,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,I do not think it should be lef t to the court. I think it should be lef t to the Attorney-General.,27
93,Mr CHAELTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I think that a judge is more likely to deal equitably with an offender than would the At torney-General, no matter to what party he might belong. ' Mr BELL - Then deportation would be in the nature of punishment.",27
94,Mr CHAELTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"l t is the worse punishment that could be imposed upon any man. Under the clause an offender might be sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and after he had served that sentence the Attorney-General might im pose a further sentence of deportation. If , in the hearing of a case, a judge considered the offender's crime so serious as to warrant deportation, it might be lef t to him to impose that penalty. A foreigner must have resided five years in Australia or in some other part of the British dominions before he can apply to be naturalized. A f t e r a foreigner has resided for five years i u Australia, or in some other part of the British dominions, and has taken out naturalization papers, I would say that he has become an acknowledged Australiau citizen, and if he commits an offence' should be punished in Australia according to our law. There should be some definition of an Australian citizen for the purpose of this measure. Let me quote, in If a man reference to this aspect of the matter, from a leading article which appeared in the Age of 3rd FebruaryBut is a Britisher a foreigner? Is it to count for nothing in Australia that a man is British-born? Of the population 84} per cent, is Australian-born, 12} per cent. Britishborn-9 7 per cent., practically, British stock. Vet, for the purposes of the deportation clauses of the Crimes Bill, a man or woman of British birth is kin with any other nation's lowest breed. Whatever are we coming to that we cannot maintain law and order among people of our own blood in our own country? Do not those who are submitting the present measure' see the possibility of future danger in the extraordinary degree of power with which they propose to invest tha Attorney-General I The right to deport an Australian-Briton should not rest with auy single individual. It is a right that Parliament should not allow to exist at all. The setting up of such an insulting and degrading classification between Australian and Briton would bo a source' of perpetual irritation, In the sight of such laws as are now proposed the native-born and the British-born should stand equal. Let penalties for offences be increased in severity, if need be, but let the proposal to deport British people be dropped. It is clear that before the Crimes Bill reaches the statute-book it will have to be extensively and radically amended. The public verdict is certain to be that its present terms are unduly drastic. The Ministry should be careful to avoid the folly of trying to combat Soviet insurgence by' methods that savour of czaristic autocracy. There is a lot of common sense in that leading article. Some line of demarcation should be drawn, so that we may know exactly who is considered an Australian citizen. Such persons should not be permitted to do wrong without punishment, but they should be punished within the limits of this country and not by deportation. I have criticized this clause in the hope that, if he approves of my criticism, the Attorney-General will remedy any defects of the provision which have been disclosed. Honourable members on this side do not oppose the clause, but they say that it sliould be amended in certain directions. Without going through every part of the clause, I have endeavoured to outline briefly the position we take up in regard to it . No one can contend that we are offering any unwarranted opposition to the clause. I do not intend to propose any amendment of it. I throw the responsibility amendment upon the Government. matters to which I have directed tion are worthy of consideration. cannot be expected that a perfect bill will be introduced. Every measure must be given careful consideration during committee stage. We have already postponed two clauses of this bill, and the clause now under consideration is one of the most important provisions it contains. It requires very careful consideration to see whether it does not go a little too far. It is possible to deal with associations established for the purposes referred to in the clause without, at the same time, proposing to deport who may not have been born in Australia. It would be wrong for me to offer a legal opinion, as I am not a lawyer, but, in view of the fact that legal opinions have so often been found to be wrong, it might not be out of place for me to say that, in my opinion, this clause will, if there should'be an appeal to the High Court against action taken it, have the same fate as section 8AA of the Immigration Act. It is true that the High. Court did not decide this Parliament had no power, an immigration law, to do what section 8AA of the Immigration Act for; but so far as I could stand their judgments, the justices of the High Court did not convey the impression that we could, under any law, deport citizens of Australia, or at least those who were here prior to federation. I doubt whether they would not hold the same view should an appeal to them be made against action taken under this clause. The Chief Justice of the High Court held that we have no power under an immigration law to deport persons who have become members of the Australian community. He did not say whether it could be done uuder a crimes act. Mr Justice Isaacs contended the Immigration Act did not apply to persons who came to Australia 1901. This bill does apply to such persons. It may be that Mr Justice Isaacs,, should an appeal under this come before him, may decide that we have no power to go back to a time before ' federation in a provision for the deportation of people who were in Australia at that time. Mr Justice Higgins said that section 8AA of the Immigration Act was Afr. Charlton. invalid and there is no power under it for its to deport Australian citizens. ' He did The not say whether it could be done under a atten- crimes act, and I doubt whether it could. It Mr Justice Rich said that section 8AA of the Immigration Act is valid, but there is no power to deport persons who were the here prior to federation. Mr Justice Starke said that section 8AA of the I m m igration Act is invalid and cannot extend to citizens of the Commonwealth. We have yet to determine who is a citizen of the Commonwealth, and it appears to me that it is very doubtful whether, on unlawful appeal, this legislation would stand. The reputation of this Parliament is injured every time its legislation is declared uncitizens constitutional by the High Court. There has been appeal after appeal in connection with taxation legislation, and the recent immigration legislation, and the H i gh Court has held that this Parliament had not the power to do what it attempted to do. In view of this, we should be very careful to act within our constitutional powers, and I have very grave under doubt whether we have the power, even under a crimes act, to deport persons who were here prior to federation. I that hope we shall not be led away by exciteunder ment because the clause is applied to unl a w f u l associations, and to the comprovided munist association in particular. under- Whatever may be our feelings towards people who desire to bring about revolution by violence in this country, it is our duty to be careful in dealing with what we regard as offences, not to overstep the mark by attempting to do something which we have not the power to do. If it should be decided later by the High Court that we have not the power under a crimes act any more than under an immigration act to deport Australian citizens who were here prior to federation, where will this Parliament stand? It will be said that it is incapable of looking after the affairs of the Commonthat- wealth. I urge the Attorney-General to listen to criticism of this clause, and if before he comes to the conclusion that it is necessary to amend it , I hope he will adopt that course. I have come to the measure conclusion that, however sound an amendment I moved might be, it would be certain to be defeated, because honourable members opposite would consider that it was proposed for party purposes. I have therefore decided not to move any amendment. I leave to the Government the full responsibility for all action taken but in regard to this measure. I am offering ing no opposition to the clause. I do support unlawful associations in any shape or for m . If their members are prepared to be amenable to the law, must put up with the consequences. can make no clearer statement than But I submit that the provisions of clause are unsatisfactory.

A f t e r a general cussion of the clause, I hope that the Attorney-General will.move such amendQueen ments as he may deem necessary. If any honourable member on the other side siders an amendment of the clause necesall sary, he should submit it so that it may be discussed, and reasonable amendments will probably receive support from this side. I have no doubt that we all sire to make the measures passed by House as perfect as possible, and we only do so by careful consideration at the committee stage. I trust that neceshave sary amendments of this clause will made so that it will not only stand test of an appeal to the High Court, will be framed in such a way as to be fair and equitable to every member of tary forces. the community. Mr A . GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [4.5] I believe that all honourable members agree that the provisions in the bill under which penalties can be imposed upon those desiring by violence to overthrow constitutional government in Australia are necessary, but I regret that the Government has thought it necessary to bring in special legislation to deal with these people, as by doing so they are making martyrs of them. Similar action has not been taken in Great B r it a in or other civilized countries. Whilst it may be necessary, for political purposes, to promise legislation of this nature during an election campaign, there is no occasion for members of the Government and those supporting them to make it appear that the members of the Labour party are in any. way associated with communists. It is idle for the Government to suggest that if effect is given to the provision now before the committee, strikes will be abolished. In submitting this measure to Parliament, the Government stated that it was endeavouring to keep f a it h with the public, in doing so it is endangerthe liberties of the people. The comnot munists publish a little journal, known as the Workers' Weekly, which some supnot porters of the Government occasionally they read and use for purposes which suit I them, and, in doing so, bring the that. paper under the notice of people this who have never heard of it . Such have honourable members encourage that which I the Government is endeavouring to I recall what happened in this disState some years ago, when certain persons had not a good word for the late Victoria, ancl did not hesitate to say that they were strongly in confavour of a republic. They advocated sorts of changes in our system of governments in words which no one would dare to utter today; but the authorities of the day took the stand that people should be allowed to speak as they dedesired, as free speech was a safety this valve. Notwithstanding all that has. can been said concerning communism and socialism, socialists and communists must a majority behind them before they be can act in the way they desire.

98,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The honourable member is quoting from the 1911 edition, which has been altered. Mr A . GREEN - I quote fro m the latest articleThe great communists, like Plato, More, Saint-Simon, Bobert Owen, were the very reverse of selfish or idle in their aims; and communism as a force in the historical evolution of economic and social opinion must be regarded on its ideal side, and not merely in its lapses, however natural the latter may be in operation, owing to the defects of human character. As a theory it has' inspired not only some of the finest characters in history, but also much of the gradual evolution of economic organization, especially in the case of co-operation (q.v.); and its opportunities have naturally varied according to the state of social organization in particular countries. The following should widen the knowledge of the honourable member for Angas: The communism of the early Christians, for instance, was rather a voluntary sharing of private property than any abnegation of properly as such. I am not here to support or condone the teachings of any people in Austraha who claim to bo communists, and who speak of using force in order to achieve their objective. I do not think that possible; but I deprecate the actions of honourable members who, under the plea of debating this matter in a spirit of sweet reasonableness, endeavour to prove that every reformer in this country has his hands gilded with Russian gold or covered with blood. On the one hand we are told that the communists have brought Russia to such a f e a r f u l pass that the people are starving, and in the next breath we are informed that throughout the civilized world, and particularly in the British Empire, they are spending millions in propaganda. If honourable members opposite think that the people of Russia or elsewhere are providing vast sums of money to assist the communists or the Labour party in Australia, the way is open to them to join the Labour party and thereby get their share of the money we are supposed to be receiving. I wish to quote other authorities, including one whose opinions are considered of value in this chamber. There is, for instance, the following definition of socialism; as adopted at the Lambeth Conference: Socialism itself as a scheme of brotherhood is the outcome of the life and teaching of Jesus Christ. Use property as a trust, use as a trust, use Iabom as a trust, use one's life as a trust, lent by God to be used, in His sight, for the benefit of brother man. this is the doctrine of Christ and the truth of socialism. Those gathered at the Lambeth conference have, I know, a better knowledge of ecclesiastical matters than a lay reader, such as the honourable member for Angas. Let us see what the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) has to say on this subject, in - his publication entitled The Case for Labour. Although the right honourable gentleman is now a member of another political party, I consider his knowledge of industrial matters equal to that of any honourable member on this side of the chamber. He is the only honourable member opposite who has the slightest knowledge of the Australian worker's view-point and position, and consequently his opinion should be of value. Dealing with the cause of unemployment, he says:Unemployment is the modern riddle of the Sphinx, which society must solve, and that speedily, or perish. Instead of debating this bill , which proposes to depart industrial leaders, we would be more usefully occupied in considering methods whereby this great riddle could be solved. We have heard a good deal of the losses caused by strikes in this country, but it has been shown by figurespublished by the Commonwealth Statistician, that those arising from unemployment are ten times greater. In dealingf u r the r with the solution of the p r of u n e m p l o y m e n t, the r i g h t honourable gentleman saysLet UB consider a little the causes of unemployment and some possible remedies. Private ownership of land is undoubtedly a primary cause; private ownership of capital is another. In Australia, where there is sufficient fertile land for at least 50,000,000 people, it is absurd that with' a population of under 5,000,000 there should be unemployed men. But it is not less absurd that with capital amply sufficient to employ a population much larger than our present one there should coexist idle capital and workless men. These are the primary and, so to speak, passive causes of unemployment. on active cause that I propose to deal with here, the manufacture of the unemployed man by employers of labour. There is no feature about the present unsystematized methods of production so tragic as. the manner in which private enterprise deliberately creates for its own selfish ends an army of unfortunates who are chained to their ringbolt in the industrial inferno by relentless necessity, as surely as were the galley slaves of old to the oar by fetters of iron. THE ONL Y WAY SOCIALISM CAN COME. There is, as every one knows, only one way in which a five-year-old child can become a man-h e must grow and mature. There are many ways .by which he may be helped to become a healthy, strong, skilful, and wise man, rather than a sickly, weakly, unskilled, and foolish one; but only one way in which lie can become a man. He must grow and develop in the natural way. Socialism will come if it is to come-as I believe it will in due time; just as manhood comes to a boy. And its coming will cause no more astonishment than does the boy's arrival at what we call manhood. That is to say, it will cause no astonishment at all ; for its growth will have been so gradual as to almost escape attention, as does the growth of all things in the eye3 of those who see them daily. Indeed, this development of the social organism will be even less noticeable than adolescence in the human organism. A boy becomes a man, but his parents remain man iand woman. He changes, they change too, but much less than he. But with the social organism it is different. There are, so to speak, no lookers on, and the change runs through the whole sphere; those who stand by relatively unaffected by the processes operating in and upon others are a negligible quantity. The social organism as a whole is affected'. Complete collectivism, when we get that far, will appear the most ordinary, natural, and inevitable thing in the world to those who live under it . It will be as ordinary, natural, and inevitable as that a young man who is 21 a year ago should be 22 today. There will be no abrupt and rude transition from private enterprise to socialism, but every stage will follow upon a preceding one, preparing all men to expect, to anticipate, and to desire it . Many will think it a perfect or, at any rate. ' the best possible system, as many have thought every system under which they have lived i a o b l e m every age and country. But some, on the other hand, will not, and a few will peisistently denounce it as the few always denounced all systems. But even to these, as to all , the system then existing will be quite natural, for they will have either known no otlier, or have reached it along a road which was then the only and inevitable road that men could take, and from which socialism had long stood out as the only and inevitable goal. If the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) were to preach that doctrine today, he would be in grave danger of being penalized under the proposed law. It is with",30
99,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Not at all.,31
100,Mr A GREEN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Thoug h the Attorney-General may split straws, unquestionably the fundamental purpose of the bill is a crusade upon ideas. Even in the Mother of Parliaments, which hitherto we have considered not quite so democratic as Australian legislative institutions, nobody has dared to attempt to legislate in the manner proposed in this bill. I have not quoted The Case for Labour in any spirit of hostility to the right honourable member for North Sydney, but merely to support my contention that any citizen of the Commonwealth should have the right to express today the ideas which the right honourable gentleman expressed years ago when he was a leader of Labour. No man can predict the future state of society, but we need not be afraid of ideas. Even in religions new sects spring up and make war upon the older order. Jock Garden is, I understand, a member of the same denomination as the honourable member  the latter is merely a local preacher, the former solemnizes marriages. Yet the honourable member declares Jock Garden's Christianity to be wrong, whilst Jock Garden says that the honourable member is devoid of christian charity. I advise the honourable member to be less vindictive and less narrow. The intolerance of rival christian sects has been responsible for a good deal of trouble in the world, but at times they unite to make an onslaught upon agnosticism, which is not without influential supporters, even in this chamber. History teaches us the value of freedom of thought and speech. Let there be no repetition of the bitter prejudices with which Charles Bradlaugh had to contend. Do not try to suppress ideas that are so wild and irrational that they can be exploded in a few seconds by sound argument. If the Government adopts a policy of suppression, it will merely aggravate the danger it seeks to remove. It will drive underground the quacks who prescribe weird nostrums for the cure of political ills, real or nary, and by making martyrs of them . give to them and their shibboleths a greater vogue than they merit. Not so long ago slavery was in practice, and approved by law. Good Queen Elizabeth ventured her fortune in slave ships, and some of our Puritan forefathers, before putting to sea, fell upon their knees on the shore and asked the Ahnighty to bless their effort to bag slaves from the galleons of the heretic King of Spain. In America at one period most of the ministers of dissenting sects in the Southern States thundered from the pulpits their defence of slavery and quoted Holy Writ to show that it was ordained of God. Millions of people were prepared to fight for a system which they sincerely believed to be just. William Lloyd Garrison, who stood almost alone in opposition to slavery, was persecuted from one end of the United States to the other. A halter was placed around his neck and he was led in obloquy through the streets. His paper was published with the aid of a negro boy, because no white man was game to help him in his crusade for the emancipation of the slaves. John Brown was hanged for espousing the same cause. But afterwards, when hired labour became more economical than chattel slaves, the American people abolished slavery. Therefore, I say we should cherish above nil things the right of the reformer to preach the faith that is in him. It is scarcely necessary for me to restate my attitude towards the fantastic ideas of the communists. I no more believe in what they preach than I. endorse the absurd defence of the fascists by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell). The honourable member is prepared to crush the communists, but he would allow the fascists to assume the reins of government and maintain peace and order according to their methods. He may try to make himself believe that the Australian and the Italian fascists have nothing in common, but both bear the same name, and there is not the Mr A. Green. slightest doubt that their ideas are identical. Some honourable members opposite have warned us against the possibility of repeating in Australia the horrors perpetrated under Soviet rule in Russia. I advise them to read Bed imagi- Russia by John Foster Frazer, M.P. It is a thrilling story of Russia in the time of the Czar, when no man's life was safe, and when a person who expressed general views different from those of the oligarchy was sent to Siberia. The people of Russia did not enjoy the privilege of adult suffrage as Australians do, and revolution was the only means of redress that was available to them. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr. Killen) said that the bolsheviks had slaughtered 1,300,000 Russians. We do not know how many millions were slaughtered under the rule of the Czar. The Russian people have devised their own means for curing political and social evils, and even though in their fight for freedom they assassinated the Czar, let the fact not be forgotten' that the English people executed Charles I . , and the executioner, holding the head on high, said, "" Behold the head of a traitor!"" And I read in my school history that never was England more respected at home and feared abroad than under the rule of Oliver Cromwell, at whose instigation the royal head had been lopped off. So we should be careful to preserve to every man full liberty of thought and speech. Honourable members opposite say that there is danger from the communists. I say.that there is none. What is preached today was preached scores of year3 ago with even greater vehemence. Parliament may pass this proposed law, and future governments will interpret it according to their political convictions. Jock Garden may be convicted aud deported by the present Ministry, but who shall say that a Labour Government will not subsequently come into power which will declare that, as Mussolini was a menace to Italy, so is Bruce a menace to Australia, and that he should be sent out of the Commonwealth to the country where he was educated, and which he so dearly loves.",31
101,Mr HUGHES,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"North Sydney) [4.35]. - Clause 17 contains the vital principles of the bill, and to discuss it in detail would be to go over again ground that was more or less covered during the debate on the motion for the second reading. Still there are points that yet need emphasis. I draw a sharp line of demarcation between the communist, the member of - the Industrial Workers of the World, who believes in overturning constitutional government by force, the promoter of general strikes, the man who resorts to unconstitutional methods, and the unionist who, rightly or wrongly, engages in an strike. It is a little difficult for those who have not taken part in industrial struggles to understand just how strikes occur. An y attempt to analyse, tabulate, classify, and explain them must fail unless there is behind it experience and knowledge of the psychology of the unionist. One must see things in the mirror the unionist sees the flected, which to him is the world of reality. The difficulty I see in dealing with this subject arises out of its complexity . 1 some respects, a material one, but if one goes deeper, it is psychological. It maybe asked, why does one wing of the industrial army avow itself a believer in class war; why does it view with suspicion every act and utterance of the other wing, andregard the members. of that wing with suspicion and even hatred ? The explanation is to be not in the conditions that today, . but - in the facts of history. If honourable members wish to understand the. Labour movement, they must remember that, during the. last 75 years, there has taken place a revolution so complete that, if in times gone by civilization might be regarded as a pyramid resting on its base, it is now poised on its apex. Of course, those who believe in democracy will say that, throughout the ages, civilization has pivoted on its apex, but now rests on its base. From the beginning of time, except at short and infrequent intervals, which were like oases in a desert, the people who have done the work of the world have been without power. They have been, at the best, pawns in the in dustrial game. For the most part the work of the world was done by slaves. Until comparatively recently - I believe towards the end of the eighteenth century-minin g in '. Scotland was carried on by men who could not leave the districts in which they were working. But it has now come about that the labour wingof the industrial army-thos e who were Ishmaelites-hav e come into their kingdom. The stone that the builders rejected ha.3 become the corner-stone of the industrial, temple. Those who do the manual work of the world are now the repository of political power. Naturally, persons who have ordinary been nurtured on the traditions of the past, on stories of injustice done to the workers in days gone by, view with distrust and suspicion proposals for settling the industrial question on lines suggested by men of another class. In my opinion, that question cannot be settled; the problem cannot be completely solved. I do not say that nothing can be done, in which that nothing, ought to be done. Inworld redustrial trouble can be aggravated; it cannot be assuaged. But the Labour movement is human nature at work. To suppose that the buyer can The question is, in have the same point of view as the seller, or that the conflicting interests of employer and employee can be reconciled, is to expect the lion to lie down with the lamb. Still, civilization has found a way, not of ending but of settling differences on other matters; the law forces a settlement on one of the parties. The rule of law is the mark sought, of civilization; without that rule it would exist be impossible for society to cohere; without organization civilization could not exist. While we may deplore the eagerness with which the unionist flocks to the standard of his union when it is unf u r l e d ; and when he is bidden comes out on strike, yet surely it ought to be one of the easiest things in the world to understand. The labourer is so placed that without solidarity, without united action, he would be utterly undone. Although we may deplore the fact that he strikes when his union tells him to do so, nothing would be more foolish in principle than for him to do anything else. How else can .he hope to protect his interests? But we are in a new age. Those who were formerly the servants are now the masters. "" Other times, other manners""; and we must, if we are to keep step in the march of progress, extend the principles and domain of the law to cover the sphere of industry. This bill takes up a rather illogical attitude. It does uot declare strikes, as such, to be illegal. It simply says that some strikers are to be penalized, while others are not; and it selects-as is natural in the circumstances, because the measure is born of the recent strike of British seamen-the transport industries as being the most important to the community. So, indeed, they are. In some industries a cessation of work inflicts no hardship on society. For instance, if the persons engaged in the boot industry ceased work, the community as a whole would not be seriously affected. But the bill is marred by curious omissions. There 13 nothing in the bill to make it an offence for persons engaged in coal mining to 1 strike. Yet transport depends for its life upon fuel. Under it, strikes, in themselves, are not an offence. is the stoppage of transport that is in certain instances, to be an offence against the law. A distinction like this is impossible to maintain. If we arc to endeavour to ensure industrial peace, Ave must have power to deal with strikes generally, and not merely in a piece-meal way. I do not believe that it is possible during a strike to bring about a settlement by the mere application of the penal clauses of the bill - There should be means at the disposal of the Government for settling, or attempting to settle, putes. The bill purports to deal with the strike and the lock-out, and with any person who does anything to interfere with transport. If honourable members will trace the 'British seamen's strike back to its ultimate cause, they will find that it was due to the action of the British ship-owners in reducing wages. Now the reduction of wages by an employer is not an act that comes within the provisions of this clause. But, technically at any rate, it should do so. The bill proposes to punish persons, not' for being in the wrong, but for doing certain things, whether these are right or wrong from their point of view. I do not agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) that it is aimed at ideas; it is aimed at acts. A man may think what he likes, and, withiu reason, he may say what he likes. For every strike-I am putting aside those shibboleths and concepts of society which are current among unionists-there is an immediate cause. Mr Hughes. Some employer or person, or section of society, has done some, definite thing to bring it about. It may be only that some one is suspected of having done this thing. Now unless the purpose of the Government is clear, and it is intended. ,to deal wi|th either party involved in a dispute, the unionists will regard this as a class conscious mea-' sure, and say that it is aimed at trade unions, that it endeavours to hamper; to crush them, that it does not deal impartially with both parties, treating the employer, who is in the wrong as frequently as the unionist, in the same way as the unionist. Leaving this, I now turn to the proposal for deportation. Under clause 17, this penalty may be imposed for every offence mentioned therein. As to its imposition upon It members of unlawful associations, I say nothing. But as a remedy for industrial unrest, and a punishment for strikes, it is a penalty not suited to the offence. We are living in the twentieth century, and are dealing with an infinitely complex and difficult situation. Strikes are the most common phenomena of the age. They occur everywhere. The other day I read in a. newspaper that a strike in Pennsylvania had just terminated after a duration of, I think, 165 days, during which it had caused dis- the loss of Â£200,000,000. reduced hundreds of thousands of people, of all classes, to the verge of destitution, and had thrown the industries of America into confusion. We read every day of strikes all over the world. Clearly deportation is not a remedy to Ibe applied 'to so universal a disease. I admit freely that the leaders of industrial trouble in this country are mostly persons who were born elsewhere. That, perhaps, may be a slap in the face for myself. The recent, strikes were fomented by persons born abroad. There may be something in this country that distils and sublimates the grosser nature common to people from countries overseas; that here, as it were, mankind is spiritualized. However, I tshall not dwell upon this fascinating theme further, lest I unduly elate the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) and others. Although strikes may be led frequently bypersons not born in Australia, it is obvious that the majority of those who take part in them are Australian born, and they may do what they please, paralyze the trade of the country, without fear of deportation, it is . quite a wrong conception of industrial unrest to think, for one moment, that this clause, if put into operation, would prevent strikes. It could not do so. What we want in this country above everything else is population. This is not only a white man's country, but a country in which the people of one race so predominate that practically 97 per cent, of its inhabitants are of British origin. We are all agreed that British people are the most desirable migrants. We are holding out both hands to welcome them. Y e t it is proposedthat, when they come here and engage in their favourite recreationstrikes are more common in England than anywhere else-the y shall be deported. I do not believe that this proposal is in the best interests of the count r y. Law must be observed, because civilization rests upon the rule of law. But the law should f it the circumstances and apply to all alike. The Government would have done better to declare every strike a breach of the law. strikes are wrong, they ought not to be permitted.' To permit or condone an illegal act while its effect is small, and thus encourage it u n t i l it has arrived at a point which cannot be checked is wrong. The Arbitration Act declares that strikes are illegal. Yet strikes take place. would be better to face the position by admitting that under our present powers we cannot deal effectively with the industrial problem. Assume that a strike such as the recent strike of British seamen occurred after this provision hadcome into operation, and that it provoked that most dangerous form,- a sympathetic Strike, how would it be dealt with under this section? As a civilized community we ought to face the fact that we have grown up, and cannot afford to have insurgent movements aimed at the destruction of society. If a strike is wrong, it ought to be declared illegal. But what can we do? If the strike is supported by a sufficient number of people throughout this country, it may readily become general, and clearly no law would be effective against it . I do not say for one moment that the Government in framing this measure has not, as it were, been compelled to proceed along certain lines. It was committed to them by its pledges to the people. It had ample warrant, so far as the vote of the people was concerned,, for introducing this bill, or even a measure going much iurther. But I say that Ministers would be better advised to confine the deportation penalty to unlawfu l associations, and to rely upon other penalties which are flexible, convenient, and usual, in dealing with ordinary industrial disputes. It cannot bo said that the remedies upon which we rely for maintaining law and order generally would he ineffective in maintaining industrial peace. In my opinion it would be better to f all back upon those penalties against which, in themselves,, nothing can ""be said by the unionists or the general community. In New South Wales during the recent strike, the B r i tish seamen who refused to work their ships were sent to gaol in such numbersthat the authorities had to call a halt, because of insufficient gaol accommodation. B ut Messrs. Walsh and Johannsen, the head and front of the offending, suffered neither imprisonment nor inconIf venience, though if they had been subjected to the same penalty as was in flicted upon the seamen, I am inclined to think that it would have had a salutary effect upon them There is about mild punishment something that would appeal to the great body of the people in It this country, and I am, therefore, in favour of amending the clause so as to provide for summary procedure for ordinary cases which I . think is essential. Graver offences should be. heard before a jury. The punishments inflicted would be flexible, and generally applicable, so that theywould incite neither comment nor opposition. I cannot in the circumstances do other than make the suggestion to the - Government, leaving the responsibility for the bill on its shoulders.",32

110,Mr YATES,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"There is a left wing in all advanced forms of society. There is a left wing in the Labour party. During the whole of my life I ' have been a left-wing man. We should not forget that the world was made perfect, and that, therefore, any imperfections that now exist are man-made. man-made, they can be unmade by man. I live and strive for the day when we shall attain to that state of perfection which existed at the creation. was then no capitalistic or wage system; no policy of "" the devil take the hindmost "" ; no "" pull devil, pull baker "" for a living or an existence. In the days of the trade union movement men advocated ideas which at the time were considered just as bad as are the ideas advocated by some persons today. would not injure one of my opponents, nor would I advocate violent revolution, or any action which would cause destruction, because to do so would be futile. After having created something, it is futile to tear it down without first enjoying it. For a person's actions to be judged by the standard of this measure is not just. Not only do I want to protect the trade unionists and the f eople inside the Labour movement, but also want to stimulate to further effort those who may think that, having reached a certain stage of progress, they can rest. There can be no rest until what ought to be attained has been attained - Numbers of trade unionists hold that view. The present High Commissioner, Sir Joseph Cook, speaking in the New South Wales Parliament in 1S92, said that he was a republican; that he was not one of those men who were prepared to sit down ana. wait for the republic to come, but was prepared to put his shoulder to the wheel to hasten the day. At that time Sir Joseph Cook had no thought of King or flag. But how would he fare if he uttered that sentiment today? Except in respect of that one ideal, Sir Joseph Cook led a blameless life; no exception could be taken to anything that he said or did. Since that time, however, he has shown his apostasy by wearing buckled shoes and knee breeches, and by carrying a sword which from time to time trips him. That shows the transformation that can take place in man. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), who has just resumed his seat, is not different. When he, in turn, has to wear buckled shoes and knee breeches, and carry a sword, I do not know, what will happen. It ' is remarkable what changes Being can take place. In the light of the definition given by the Church of England to the word "" revolution,"" and with the administration of this legisThere lation in the hands of one whose political bias runs away with his common sense, it is possible for any person to come within its purview. We are not asking early the Attorney-General to restrict in any way the power to deal with unlawful associations, but we want his assurance that it will apply only to those who I preach violent revolution, sabotage, and destruction. The man who comes here - lik e myself, a ""pommy,"" except that I have had a more extended residence in - Australia-and is prepared, although a citizen of the Commonwealth, to fly in the face of convention, has only himself to blame if through repeating an offence he is deported. But that is not the class of man who will be dealt with, under the proposed new sub-section 3 0 J. That sub-section deals with the trade unionists who are out to improve the condition of the workers. The clause as: it stands leaves to those who for the time being are in authority, the determination of what constitutes revolution or sabotage. That means the government of the day. I do not suggest that the present Government would abuse that power, but there might come a time when a government would do so. The Government would be acting with in its mandate if the word "" violent"" were inserted before the word "" revolution."" "" Revolut i o n "" may mean anything. B y sane and reasonable reformers revolution means effecting a complete change from existing conditions. If we leave the clause as it is, what will happen if a strike takes place? It is not unusual for a man when excited to act and speak i u an irresponsible manner. If in his excitement he addresses a strike meeting, and lets off what is commonly called ""hot air,"" no one is greatly concerned. He certainly has a right to an outlet for his pent-up emotions'. A f t meeting is over he may again be a peaceable citizen. But having, like a drunken man, in the excitemeut of the moment, given expression to revolutionary utterances, he may be reported to the Government, and without warrant be summarily arrested by a constable, and charged with having advocated revolution. The bill goes too far. We ask only for the interpolation of the word ""violent."" Its insertion would indicate that the Government intended to deal only with those persons who believe in attaining their objective by violent methods. hope that the Attorney-General will accept the suggestion which has been made.  feel it incumbent on me to reply to some remarks uttered, I think by mistake, by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green). Had he realized their meaning, he would not have uttered them. The honourable member referred to my statement that communism was anti-christian, and gave a definition of communism which he extracted from au old edition of a certain book which has since been more or less revised. In the light of history, it is clear that the honourable member made an unfortunate reference to the old edition. History supports my previous statement and refutes the contention of the honourable member. The communistic revolution in Russia has [43] supplied sufficient evidence that communism is anti-christian. The Christian Church was attacked by communism, because the communists realized that it stood between them aud the attainment of their objective. It is well known that priests and bishops of the Greek Orthodox Church were, in many instances, dragged by the communists from the churches and - shot without a trial. At times they were not even taken outside the churches, but were shot down in cold blood inside cathedrals and churches. That the revolution was not aimed solely at the Greek Orthodox Church, which came more or less under the protection of the State, is shown by the fact that other Christian churches and sects were' similarly misused by the communists. I have it on the authority of one of the most learned and respected Lutheran' pastors in South Australia, that no section suffered more from the communists during e r the the great Russian upheaval than did the Lutheran churches. That pastor, who has spent the greater part of his l if e in the service of the Lutheran Church, stated emphatically that communism was anti-Christian. He added that, while he would not participate in political warfare, he had preached, and would continue to preach, against communism from the pulpit of his church. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) referred to the Lambeth conference. If he had been as Well acquainted with some of the big men who attended that conference as I I am- I speak with all humility-h e would not have made the remarks that he did. Those who know the former Bishop of Willochra (Dr White) could never imagine that he would in any way countenance communism. And no one acquainted with the big Christian men who took part in the Lambeth conference would be so foolish as to suggest that they would advocate communism or revolution .",36

112,Mr COLEMAN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Reid) [5.20] - The  sons) has said nothing that requires answering and has not 'discussed the provisions of the bill now under consideration. I take this opportunity of repeating certain objections which during my second-reading speech I raised - to this part of the bill dealing with unlawful associations. I think the Government should qualify "" r e v o l u t i o n "" by making it either "" violent revolution "" or "" revolutionary violence""; and I submit that a definition of . ""sabotage"" is required. After considerable research I have ascertained that Funk ancl Wagnall's new standard dictionary of the English language defines "" sabotage "" as-1. The act of cutting shoes or sockets for ment. rails in railway ties. 2. By extension of meaning, the act of tying up a railway by malicious damage. 3. Hence, any poor work or other damage done by dissatisfied workmen; also, the aet producing it , plant wrecking sabot, - a wooden shoe.) The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) gave Webster's latest definior tion. The term is palpably vague. I France in an anti-strike law passed years ago, it was found necessary t fine sabotage to beThe wilful destruction, deterioration or ren- constitution dering useless of instruments or other objects, - with a view to stopping or hampering work, industry or commerce. Surely if in a French law it is found necessary to define the meaning of a deportation. French word it is equally necessary to do so in this bill. In the absence of such a definition sabotage may be interpreted mean anything from going slow job to a railway "" regulation "" strike and the w i l f u l destruction of property. - Mr LATHAM - All things are intended - bo be covered by the word if they .are directed to the overthrow of the tion. Everything depends on that objective. "" Mr COLEMAN - A court will interunlawful pret the meaning of sabotage on proanything ceedings instituted by the Attorneybeing General. It will decide whether the of sabotage referred to it is admittedly - something tending towards the overthrow - of the Constitut ion. But, no matter how heavier penalty is provided. - the icourt may decide the matter, I contend that it is the duty of .this Parliathe ment to make the purpose of this clear, and to remove from it all ambiguity. "" Revolution"" means a sudden change. We may .advocate the complete destruction of the present constitution by a radical :and sudden change, or, in other words, by a revolution not accompanied by violence.",38
113,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Not necessarily.,38
114,Mr COLEMAN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"M a n y people advocate the abolition of the Senate. Many people regard the land tax views of the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) as of revolutionary character. It is largely a matter of one's point of view. I do not see why we should so much revere the Constitution. Constitutions change with development of thought. Many people are to be found today advocating a very radical alteration of our Constitution and a general reconstruction of our method of .governTherefore, the provision of the bill should be made clearer than it .is at present.

122,Mr COLEMAN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Anothe r objection to this part of the bill is the use of the words, "" any other civilized country or organized government."" I ask the Attorney-General to explain the necessity for them. These provisions relating to unlawful associations are objectionable not only for the very excellent reasons advanced by honourable members of the Opposition, but, also, because they vest in the Attorney-General a power to in flict, punishment in addition to that which may be imposedby a court, and, also-, because the power of punishment thus, reposed, in the Attorney-General may be exercised at a moment of political hy.steiiia or under the influence of. political bias. I have been asked' by certain Sydney' booksellers to ascertain what their position, will be under the proposed section30F; which reads as follows: Any person whoknowingly, prints, publishes, sells or exposes for sale any book, periodical, pamphlet, hand-bill, poster or newspaper for or in the interests of or issued by any unlawful association shall be guilty of an. offence.

126,Mr COLEMAN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,That . is most inequitable. The mere fact that a person has attended a meeting of an association will put him i u the position of being regarded as a member of the association.,39
127,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,A man can readily prove that he is not a member of an. association.,39

129,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Kooyong-Attorney - Variou s point3 have unlawbeen raised by honourable members on this group of provisions, and it is perhaps convenient that I should deal with to them at this stage* Considerable attenbooktion has been directed to the words "" revolution "" and "" sabotage "" -' in seccoivtion 30A. These are words that must be be taken with their context. They cannot be picked out and looked at by The essence of the matter in is that this is a compound phrase. The prohibition is directed against advocacy of the overthrow of the Constitution by revolution or sabotage. "" Revolution in that context plainly means revolution to bring about the overthrow of the Constitution. It is, therefore, different from the peaceful development of the present state of society into the state of socialism referred to in The Case for Labour, which was written by the right honourable member for Nort h Sydney (Mr Hughes). It is essentially different from the growth of a child into a man, which was used illustration in that work. Many words are frequently used in a metaphorical sense. The word "" revolution"" comes within that category. But that is not its customary meaning, which implies and connotes the use of violence. When the words "" revolution"" and "" sabotage"" -.ire used in direct association with the phrase, "" the overthrow of the Constitution,"" it cannot reasonably be argued that the phrase can be interpreted to apply to the peaceful advocacy of alteration to the Constitution by ordinary methods. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) urged that, although the provision of deportation might act as a preventive, the power to order deportation should be exercised by a court and not by the Minister. It would obviously be much easier and more pleasant for the executive to place the responsibility upon a court. A vita l objection, ever, is that a court can deal with an individual only upon evidence that is strictly relevant to the offence with which he is charged. Evidence relating to his antecedents, history, character, and general behaviour, possibly in other lands, would be irrelevant and in admissible,",39
130,Mr MAKIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,It would be admissible before sentence was passed.,40
131,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Evidenc e relating to prior convictions and' good character, not evidence of bad character, would be admissible. I shall give an illustration. Some time ago a foreigner was convicted in Sydney of the offence of in decent exposure. The only relevant evidence was that relating to the parto ticular offence with which he was charged. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonthe executive. ment. I do not, think that he' had prior convictions. When his effects came into the possession of the authorities, it was discovered that he had been sent, to "" Australia to preach doctrines of revolution, and that he was actively engaged in revolutionary organization, to carry something on which he had been supplied with funds from some source that was not discovered. He had in his possessirn most violent and inflammatory material, copies of which had been circulated among his compatriots. He was undoubtedly a most undesirable citizen, and under the provisions of the Immigration as an Act he' was deported. That action was taken before the recent decision of the High Court of Australia. The Minister who ordered his deportation did his duty in protecting the community against a dangerous individual. It would have been impossible to place before a court the evidence upon which the Minister quite properly acted, because it would have been irrelevant to the offence with which he was charged. Mr E. RILEY - He was a criminal.",40
132,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Yes . The point that I am endeavouring to make is that any action in connection with deportation must be taken in the light of facts that concern the history and the character of the individual, and that such evidence is not admissible upon any inquiry by a court. The duty of taking such action should be accepted by the government of the day, with a full sense of the responhow- sibility that is involved, the primary consideration being the safety of the community in the future.",40
133,Mr MAKIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Would it not be possible to empower the court to review a person's history and his antecedents ?,40
134,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,That would be an entirely novel method of procedure.,40
135,Mr MAKIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,I realise that; but the difficulty which the Minister apprehends might be overcome by such an enactment.,40

Those officers are required to give advice to the government of the day, to enable legislation to be drafted and the administion. tration of the Commonwealth to be carried on. They are responsible to the Minister whom they advise. It is Minister, however, who accepts f u l sponsibility in this chamber, and no other than he can state whether he has accepted the advice tendered to him . partmental officers are not in a position to defend themselves against criticism honourable members or any one else. A though it was not the purpose of the honourable member for Batman to dilute the acid which at the moment he was proscribed ducing, I was pleased to hear him that it was improper and unfair f o orable members to criticize those officers deon the assumption that they were responsible for any particular legislation.",41
142,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I go further than the Minister.

143,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I agree that the committee or the House is responsible. Honourable members know perfectly well that these officers have to advise one government today and another government at a future date. Their reputation stands sufficiently high to enable every honourable member to say that they give equally government.. with There were one or two other criticisms is unto which a reference might be made.

It : iseasy, under good economic circumstances to be contented and happy, and, with a good bank balance-, to wear a smile. It should be remembered that sickness and unemployment produce psychological effects, and in the case, of such a person as I have described, that might: be the real, reason for his departure from the proper path as laid down by the Nationalist Government of the country. A f t e r all, society itself has a certain responsibility for the psychology of its members. Certain circumstances may operate to render a man . bitter-.

When. a. person is indicted for any of the offences referred toi n the clause,, the judge, or the. jjiry. beforewhom his caseis heard cannot help but be impressed by the fact that if he was not born in Australia and if f o u nd guilty, is liable to be deported by another person.",42

149,Mr MAXWELL,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,In what way would they 'be affected-in favour of the offender or against him?,43
150,Mr BLAKELEY,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The probable assumption is that they would be affected in favour of the .offender, but if that is so, the very intention of the Government as framers and sponsors of this bill , will fail. Despite all kinds of abuse and corruption we have, through the ages, gradually established a judiciary of which we can justly be proud, and I think it is quite wrong that the politician should interfere with the judicial functions of the State. It is wrong that any person depending ou the votes of the people should take part in the trial of the people. It is only in certain exceptional circumstances that the executive must accept responsibility. When a man has been found guilty of murder, and sentence has been imposed upon him, the decision has been made by the judiciary, and is based upon the facts. But it is only in the case of taking a life by hanging that executive action is necessary. Under this clause a person may 'be found guilty and penalized by the judiciary, and, upon that, the political factor is introduced. I protest against the political and judicial instrumentalities being mixed in 'the way proposed in this clause. It may be quite legal., provided that the High Court does not upset it . The Attorney-General and the Government must accept responsibility for 'the bill , and for whatever is done under . it when at is brought into operation. Honourable members on this side have entered their protest against it . They made a similar protest against the provisions of the Immigration' Bill , and much of 'that protest has' since been by the decision of the ""High Court. I 'am totally opposed to the deportation of any >one who has acquired citizenship in Australia, particularly when a person who commits a criminal offence is '.not liable 'to deportation. The thug, the garr.oter - and the murderer cannot be 3 deported, but an .academic crank who for advertisement and his own glorification, advocates the - overthrow of the nation by .means of revolution., is to be subjected to penalties which a criminal of the worse - type would not be subjected to. For these reasons, I am strongly opposed to the proposed new sub-section.",43
151,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Lang) :[6.f J. - The honourable member for Darling (MT . Blakeley) appears to have lost sight of the fact - that a great many persons of foreign extraction who come to Australia accept 'the privilege of citizenship, exercise that privilege to the fullest extent and claim the protection of the law, but at the same time disclaim the responsibilities .of citizenship. They take pride in proclaiming themselves to the citizens of the world, towing allegiance to no country, .and recognizing no regularly constituted authority. That is .an aspect of the ' matter which should not be overlooked when we are (considering who are. and . who are not desirable .citizens of the - Commonwealth. - I think, however, that a useful purpose has been served by questioning the definition of certain terms used in this clause. The terms "" r e v o l u tion "" and "" sabotage "" were mentioned during the second-reading debate. The Attorney-General (Mr Latham) .has made it perfectly clear that the word "" r e v o l u t i o n as applied in this proposed new sub-section must - be read with the context and having regard to the purpose - of the measure,, and should not be considered independently. It seems to me that ;it might be wise to more clearly define what is covered by the terms "" sabotage "" and "" job-control,"" because otherwise it is likely that a great deal of argument may ensue over their ; exact meaning. ""It is unfortunate 'that "" sabotage"" is not very clearly defined in our dictionaries. Dictionaries, unfortunately, afford us l it t l e help at arriving at a clear meaning of the word ""'sabotage,"" and, in some - cases, have not - given .any definition at ,ail. One justified definition has already 'been quoted 'by the honourable - member for Reid (Mir. Coleman), but it is - so limited as to'be - practically valueless - when considered in connection with 'the purpose of this - clause. The word "" sa'botage"" is defined a little .more clearly .and at greater length, ias the - honourable member for .Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) pointed out, in the 1924. edition of Webster, which is not available in the parliamentary library. These two words might well be more clearly defined in the bill before it is passed, because it is not advisable to have any ambiguity of meaning in words used in a statute. Very often phrases slip into bills which become acts, and disputes subsequently arise in the courts as to their exact meaning which lead to endless trouble. Mr C. RILEY - Coul d not a definition be set out in the bill ?",43
152,Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"A definition clause could be inserted. It was stated during the second-reading debate that the term "" job control "" has not yet been defined, but that is incorrect, because I find that in the Commonwealth Law Reports, volume 23, there is a full definition, although it does not cover everything, by Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr . Justice Rich, and also by a witness, Mr . Adams.",44
153,Mr FENTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Is that in a recent judgment?,44
154,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"It is to be found in the report of the case Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association v. Federated Seamen's Union of Australia. On page 305 .of the Commonwealth Law Reports, volume 23,' I find the position stated as follows :-As an instance of the difficulty in the present case, Mr Adams, who. as an expert, gives the principal evidence on the subject, says : "" I should say it was an attempt by the men on a particular job to refuse work on that job for the purpose of enforcing industrial conditions."" The mere fact of his stating, '' I should say,"" may indicate a mere personal opinion, and not a knowledge of the meaning accepted generally by others as well as himself. Then he makes it part of the definition that the control must be ""by the men on a particular job."" This would exclude all men who refused work before engagement, and would therefore exclude almost all the evidence as to the exercise of job control by individual members in this case. Again, he says, job control may be in some cases by an "" organization.""' That is not consistent with what went before, but, if true, it is outside this case both because the information does not charge the exercise of job control by the organization, and because the award does not include it. The word "" j o b "" hardly permits the final definition, because what is selected as the thing to be controlled, and called the "" job,"" is naturally not susceptible, of prior delimitation. It must vary with circumstances and with the progress of industrial operations. It may be a house, or a shop, or a ship, or a waterworks. control,"" so far as we understand that phrase to have acquired any definite meaning, connotes the control by employees, whether already engaged or not, or by some organization representing them, of some single enterprise or portion of an enterprise of an employer, which is selected as an isolated unit of industrial operations; the effective method of enforcing the control being, not a general strike in the industry or of the union, or even in the general service of the employer, but a strike of the employees engaged on.that unit or a refusal to engage on it at all. If that be the true meaning of the term, it does not, as we have stated, accord with the definition in evidence in this case, nor does it entirely coincide with the application of the phrase by the terms of the award, though there is nothing in the award, so far as we can observe, inconsistent with it so far as its meaning is concerned. If that is the definition of these learned judges, it seems that it needs amplification, and I suggest for the consideration of the Attorney-General that it might be well to consider this proposed new sub-section a little further before asking the committee to pass it . It is most important that we should have a clear definition of the terms employed in the measure, especially where there seems to be such a wide divergence of opinion concerning what the words actually mean and what they actually imply. A f t e r all, tha Attorney-General's explanation can, in the absence of any clear and judicially authoritative definition, be regarded only as hia opinion. I think it would be wise to clear up any doubt in the matter by inserting a definition clause covering words or phrases as to which there is any ambiguity regarding their meaning. MT . MAKIN (Hindmarsh) [6.18] My views on this measure have been admirably expressed by honourable members on this side who have already spoken; but there are one or two other points with which I wish to deal. I do not dispute the contention that the national legislature should be possessed of full powers, including power to deport; that a legislature such as this should have complete and absolute powers. The application and administration of a particular law should, however, be safeguarded in order to conserve the fundamental principles of British law. This Parliament should not be permitted to discriminate in the matter of citizenship, because I venture the opinion, as a layman, that in doing so we would find our""Job selves in a very embarrassing position. I believe that the deportation of a British citizen resident in Australia would be to be unconstitutional, and the government of the day. ment responsible for it would be placed in a very embarrassing position. Australia is one of the first of the British dominions to consider the adoption of this method of punishment, which strikes at the very root - of the privileges of British citizenand ship.",44

But , in any case, we should not follow an evil example; rather should we set an example to other dominions in upholding the best traditions of the Empire - Whilst I affirm the right of the national . legislature to exercise absolute and complete power over its citizens, I hold that it is the responsisub-paragraph bility of the judiciary which, in the i terpretation of the law, holds the scales justice evenly, between the Crown and accused, to determine what penalties the should be imposed for an offence. Under this bill the judiciary will be required determine whether or not a man is guilty, and then impose a penalty; bu t deportaundefined tion is a super-punishment to be imposed by the Government without reference to of what it means. the court as to its equity. That is contrary to the principles of British jurisprudence. The Attorney-General has explained that the power of deportation is retained Cabinet because it is undesirable to troduce into the court a man's previous records, or any other evidence that is not admissible in the trial of an ordinary criminal offence. The answer to is that in a criminal trial, after the has returned its verdict, the judge, before passing sentence, refers to the previous convictions of the accused. Similarly, proceedings under this bill, the accused's past record need not be introduced into the trial, bnt after the verdict has been given, may be taken into account by the court when determining the punishment. thing else. If that procedure were adopted the cused would not be prejudiced in any way, and the Government would believed of a responsibility and freed of any suspicion that, for selfish ends, it was despotically deporting its political opponents.

All possibility of the misapprehension would be removed if words ' ' force or violence "" were used in both sub-paragraphs. The term "" reto volution "" has been used in many senses. "" Sabotage"" is a French term, and is in the bill, bu t we are asked to accept the Attorney-General's opinion Sitting suspended from. 6.30 to S p.m.",45
158,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"To emphasize the to the argument I was advancing before the in - suspension of the sitting, I repeat the point I made. The first paragraph of the proposed new section 3 0 A reads, "" The that overthrow of the Constitution of the jur y Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage."" That means that any association that advocates the overthrow of the Coni n stitution of the Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage is unlawful . The Attorney-General says that revolution means the exercise of force or violence, but we, on this side, say that it may mean someRevolution is a complete acchange. The Attorney-General says that i*-. eould not be a sudden change without reforce, but I submit that it could.",45

160,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"M a n y a revolution has been committed by members opposite. They were quite wrong, in some of their revolutions, but I would not put theminto jar! for that. We speak very familiarly today of the industrial revolution in England, but there was no force or violence about that, and it was certainly not very gradual. It was, in fact, very sudden from the point of view of the craftsmen who were thrown out of employment by the introduction of machinery. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), and the honourable member for Forrest  tionary change in our Commonwealth Constitution. We have heard it threatened in this chamber that Western Australia may secede from the Commonwealth.. To do that would be to overthrow Commonwealth Constitution. It would be a revolution, but not necessarily brought about by force or violence. While I . entirely disagree with the honourable members who advocate that change, I do not think they should be put into jail or deported. The words "" force violence"" ought to be inserted before the word "" revolution."" If the. honourable member for Forrest were to advocate that Western Australia should secede from the Federation.,; he would be advocating, revolution. The Government says it intends to punish only those who. advocate revolution by force or violence. That being so we contend that the word's "" force o r violence."" should be included; in the first, paragraph of the proposed new seetion. Therecan be no reasonable explanation why the wordfe should not be included in eaGh of the paragraphs. Paragraph a (<) refers to- "" the .overthrow of: the Constitution of the Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage,"" while paragraph a (ii) refers to "" the overthrow by force, or violence of the establishedgovernment of the Commonwealth."" should the words "" by force o r violence "" beincluded in. the paragraph that deals with the overthrow of the established government of the Commonwealth, but not in the paragraph that deals with the overthrow of the Constitution of the Commonwealth ?- What difference is there between "" the Constitution of the Commonwealth "" and "" the established government of the Commonwealth "" that calls for this variation in phraseology? The distinction made in drafting the bill suggests, that the intention of the honourable Government is to bring, under the heading of unlawful associations those who advocate a complete and sudden change, whether accompaniedby violence or mot. I submit that the. provision as it stand's is dangerous,, and that the intention of the. Government should be made clear. To say that the word "" revolution,"" without qualification, means. revolution by force or violence, would not carry much weight in a court of law, when, in the next paragraph, the words "" force or violence"" are used. The court would undoubtedly come to the conclusion that the distinction was made deliberately, and would hold that, if. no distinction had been intended, the words "" force or violence "" would have been included in both paragraphs. The fact that the Goour vernment declines to insert the words in both paragraphs shows that it wishest o class as unlawful-, associations that advocaterevolution without force or violence. Surely it is not intended to arrest men who advocate a change in our industrial system. If it is or so intended, I can understand the wordingof these paragraphs,, but the Government denies that, that is so. The Attor: ney-General has; said, that the Government does: not wish to? deny freedomof speech except to prevent the advocacyof revolution by force or violence. Then why not insert those wordsi n each paragraph ? The honourable member fo-r Reid (Mr Coleman)- has emphasized theambiguity of the word ""sabotage,,"" and. the honourable member for Batman- (Mr Brennan) has said that it is "" a. bad French word:,"" but this committee is asked to accept it without a definition of . it in the. bill. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), said that there was nos need todefinei t because it was defined in. the dictionaries. I have yet toi learn that the courtsof law are Why bound, to accept dictionary definitions-. If they were, their work would be greatly simplified. The Government that wishes us to accept the word sabotage as having a clear and definitemeaning has placed in the bill a definition of the word ' ' employer."" Every one surely knows what an employer or employee is, but every one could not. define the word "" sabotage,"" which' is used in different ways in different circumstances. The proposed new section 30r is typical - of many provisions in this bill . I.suggest that the bill was draf ted in a panic, and that . it is hysterical legislation. There is nothing happening in the country to warr a n t many of its provisions. .priceless freedom we boast of in British countries is .being seriously - whittled away. .Let me read the proposed - new section in abbreviated for m , .so as to drive the .meaning of it home to .honourable .membersAny person - who (knowingly sprints, publishes, sells - or exposes ""far sale any book -.issued by any unlawful association shall be guilty of an offence.

It is proposed to give to the - Attorney-General the power to superimpose, after a court of law has decided upon a penalty, the greater penalty of - deportation. We may agree that there are persons in .this country who advocate . the use. of force and violence, and the attainment of rtheir .ends by force, - and . we all agree that they ought .to be punished; but I suggest - that - whatever punishment is inflicted be inflicted-only by-the judge who hears the evidence and sees the .prisoner. To :give into the hands of the political head 'of the .government of the day the .right to-.superimpose another punishment is fundamentally wrong. I repeat what ,1 .said during the second-reading debate, that I would the prepared to trust .the Attorney-'General if he were sitting on the High Court bench to deal tout jus-tice, ' but ' that I would-not trust him as I be- the political head of a .government swayed by thejpassions of the times. The - one .great principle we have .tried to lay down in all legislation providing .punishment for crimes is that penalties shall be imposed by .the -.judiciary of the country, removed from the taint of politics and the prejudices of parties. In support of that contention, let me quote the honourable the Attorney-General. On a former occasion, When we were discussing a proposal 'to appoint appeal boards for 'taxation purposes, the honourable gentleman opposed the government of the day, ! and saidThe principle is embodied in .the Constituthat judicial powers - shall be exercised by judicial persons. The essence' of a judicial as determined: by the Constitution, - is that the (person exercising judicial powers shall not 'be' removable at the will Of 'the Government.' The Attorney-General is removable at the will of the Government and the will of the people, but the judges are appointed for life. The Attorney-General said that only judicial persons exercise judicial powers. sence of our Constitution is that a judicial person appointed to exercise judicial power is free from the control of the government of the day. appointment cannot be cancelled. We on this side are firmly of the opinion that the determination of whether a mau shall be deported from Australia is a judicial, function ; but if it is held to be not a judicial function, then I say that the grave act of deportation should not be performed unless accompanied by the judicial action that accompanies a j u d icial function. We are asked to assume that the Attorney-General will act in a judicial way, but on his own interpretation of the Constitution no judicial, function should be performed unless by a judicial person, who is not the political head of the Government, but a member of the judiciary appointed under the Constitution. are the arguments advanced by the Attorney-General? He said that there might be certain facts and certain evidence in justification of the deportation of a man under this legislation that could not be brought before a court of law as relevant evidence. He said that the history ancl general record of the man would be irrelevant as evidence before a court, and therefore could not come into consideration in the question of deportation. It sounds well in theory, but what is the practice? What would the Crown Prosecutor do when charging a man from another part of the world, who had a bad record? He would certainly put it in .",47
162,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,It would not be possible. It would be very improper . for him to attempt to do so. >,48
163,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"No doubt such an action might be improper, but the Attorney General knows that many improper things are done.",48
164,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Not by Crown Prosecutors; they are a fair set of men. In any case the judge would prevent such evidence being put in .,48
165,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The Crown Prosecutor would certainly divulge the history of the accused. He would charge him with being an advocate of revolution, and I venture to say that it would be relevant for him to produce the record of the accused in other countries, especially if he sliould were a revolutionary and an advocate of The esthose things so much talked about by the Attorney-General. Apart from that, in our ordinary courts, before a prisoner is sentenced, a list of his prior convictions His is read, and there is nothing to prevent, this Government, if it so desires, from in cluding in the bill the right to produce to the court, before sentence and after trial, evidence to show justification for deportation. I should not object to the Government having the right under this bill to deport certain undesirables who have recently arrived in this country, persons with criminal instincts, who have been chased by the police from other countries: But - wo distinguish between those undesirables and persons who have made this country their home, those whom the Leader of the Opposition defined as Australian citizens. We distinguish entirely between the power which the Government already possesses under the What Immigration Act to deport undesirable immigrants, and the power to deport our own citizens who have lived here probably half a lifetime, merely because they are guilty of an offence for which Australian-born citizens can receive at the most only about two years' imprisonment. Transportation for life in the Old Country was at one time regarded almost as the alternative for hanging.",48
166,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,British-bor n citizens may even be imprisoned for a couple of years before being deported under this bill.,48
167,Mr SCULLIN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"That is quite possible. On the other hand, Australian-born citizens committing a similar offence are to be sentenced at the most to two years' imprisonment. The bulk of our people who have come from across the seas are British. They are of the stock that laid the foundations of this country-the stock from which we have sprung. The fathers of almost every one of us were British born, and we are asked to show so little regard for that stock from which we have sprung 1 as to treat our British-born citizens differently from our Australian born, no matter how long they have lived here. A man may live in this country for 50 years, aud yet be liable to deportation under this legislation. If he commits an offence against this law he may, after serving a certain sentence in prison, be ordered by the Attorney-General to leave this country for ever, to leave his family, and, possibly, his grandchildren, behind. It is no use saying that such an action is not contemplated, because we have recent evidence that the Government attempted, by the woi'sfc methods that it could employ, to deport a man who had lived in this country for over 30 years. The Government failed on the job. It appointed a political board to deport this man, but its decision broke down owing to the High Court upholding the Constitution of this country. While we do not object to the punishment of persons who break our laws and become criminals, we strongly object to persons who have lived here for years, and whose family ties are deep-rooted in the soil of Australia, being exiled from their families. They should be treated the same as Australian-born citizens, because they are of the stock that laid the foundations of our country. This clause provides, not for judicial punishment, but for political punishment. The Government first of all tried to convict persons without a proper trial. In fact, it did convict persons by means of a political board, and the Attorney-General justified the Government's action in appointing that board by saying that it is not always possible to prove your facts in a court of"" law by evidence that is legally admissible. A murderer cannot be sent to his doom under the laws of Australia today unless he is proved guilty on legal evidence. Yet a person who advocates something that is opposed to the economic and political ideas'of the Goverument may be deported from Australia at the mere will of the Minister. The Attorney-General justifies the proposal to give the political head of the country the power to deport persons for the very same reason that he gave in support of the appointment of the political board to which I have referred. It is no use saying that any action taken by him will be judicial; it will really be political. It will be political punishment superimposed upon the decision of. the court. While the judge sitting in the court, having heard the evidence and watched the demeanour of the prisoner, may consider the offence triflin g and impose a fine of, say Â£ 5 , the .fact, that the man was found guilty will enable the Attorney General to say that he shall be deported. It is a wrong power to place in the hands of the Attorney-General, and it is a wrong punishment to give to persons who have made this country their home. . Mr BRENNAN (Batman) [S.25] The only word of unfriendly criticism that, I can utter about the excellent speech just delivered by the honourable member f b r Yarra (Mr Scullin) is that, perhaps, he is taking the absurdities of the Government a little too seriously. A fte r all he should, in a spirit of Christian charity, remember that the Government is under the necessity of justifying its election war-whoops. Having endeavoured to create a scare about a chimera which had no real existence, and having succeeded in frightening a considerable section of the electors into supporting it in its absurdities, it must now legislate in order to preserve uniformit y on the lines upon which the supporters . of the Government spoke during the recent election. The part must be acted in full . The Government cannot call off the piece after having staged the first act. It cannot ring down the curtain and disperse the crowd. The thing must go through in its natural sequence, and, therefore, what was spoken foolishly in the electorates must be enacted foolishly in Parliament. F r om the very memorandum which the Government has printed to show the amendments in their proper relationship with the Crimes Act as a whole, it will be seen that we already have powers under the laws of this country to deal with such crimes as sedition, disaffection, treason, and other offences against the order and good government of Australia. And so, in truth and in fact, by an examination of this document it may be proven that there is no real reason whatever for this panic legislation which the Government has introduced. We enacted a good deal of this class of legislation during the war, but the government of the day had to be excused. It was a Nationalist government- a panic government. It was a government that kept on seeing things, preferring to see things rather than to do things which had any real value. It was constantly passing acts of 'parliament to restrict 'the liberty of the .people and freedom of speech, and, generally, to t e r r if y aud terrorize the people as an evidence of its burning patriotism. But at least it had the good grace to recant. The Nationalist Government of the day had the'grace to repeal some p i the legislation which it passed in war time, - or at least the worse of it . It had the common sense when it did find its feet, aud ceased to see things, and the hysteria had passed ancl the war madness and blood-letting had come to an end, to r i d the statute-book of those absurd provisions which were passed in' the name of the War Precautions Act. But now in time of peace, if it is a time of peace, that class of legislation is to be re-enacted. What really is to be reenacted? What we are considering for the moment is the proposed new subsection 30c, which readsAny person who 'by speech or writing advocates or encourages(a) the overthrow of the Constitution of the Commonwealth by revolution or .sabotage; (Zi) the overthrow by force or violence o'fthe established government of the Commonwealth or of a State or - of any other civilized country or of organized government; or (c) the destruction or injury of property of'the'Commonwealth or of'property used in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States, shall be - guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for any period not exceeding - two years, and, in addition (if he was not born in Australia) to deportation by order of the 'Attorney-General as provided in this act. My first comment is - that that is sufficiently provided for by existing My next comment is that, legislation, the Government catch cries with which it has become 'familiar - by a 'too deep reading of communist literature. It has used the word "" sabotage "" as though that word had an - established meaning in modern literature. It is not English, and it is bad French. It has adopted the term "" job control "" as though it knew what, the term meant; but it does not attempt to define it. Apparently, ment's idea is that 'we on this side will enlighten them as to the meaning of these Mr Brennan. terms, which are to be embodied in acts of Parliament. Owing to 'the propaganda of the Government, many people are 'becoming afraid of their own shadows, and, therefore, they say that no one ought to object to the punishment of an association or of an individual who advocates' - the overthrow of .the Constitution'of the Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage. I was never a great advocate of physical force in bringing about industrial, political, or international reforms. In .fact, I am afraid that in the year 1915, and thereabouts, I gaiued a somewhat evil reputation for being, of all things in a Christian - country, a pacifist. I was one of those who, at a time when such views were unpopular, advocated - that we should import into our dealings with 'other nations something of the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount, in which, during times of peace, we profess to believe, but which, in that time of war, were .scrapped or dealt with by the censor. I cannot, therefore, be accused of being an advocate of political or industrial reform by force of arms or bloodshed. I do not believe in those things. But I do believe in freedom of speech. I believe also in the wisdom of the policy pursued by Great Britain for 100 years, which permitted all sorts of cranks, fanatics, and heretics of various kinds to meet in their little meeting places in the centre of London, unhampered and unhindered, - and to give expression to their views .as to the best - way to overthrow - by force the established government of the very country in which they were speaking. No harm came from their' utterances. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) - was correct when he said that 'those .meeting places provided those people with a safety valve, which prevented their danlaw. gerous doctrines from developing in secret in its as they did in Russia and elsewhere, until is adopting they resulted in actual .and treacherous physical force, causing the murder of officials and of men in high-public positions, .and the useless destruction of human life. It is arguable whether it is English wise to pass legislation to render it a penal offence to express opinions. I believe in making it penal to commit offences; but the .'expression of opinions : is a different matter. Being a pacifist, the Govern- infected with notions of Christianity which are consistent with the Sermon on the Mount, 1 do not likebloodshed or force, and, therefore, I am content to allow that portion of the bill toremain. B ut it goes further. It is also an offence to advocate the. overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth, orof a State, or of any other civilized country or of organized government. It would appear that people in Austraha may not advocate with propriety the overthrow, by .physical force, of. a civilized government on the other side of the world. If the Prussian Czar were now on the throne, it would clearly be an offence to advocate that czarism should be overthrown in that country, notwithstanding that by consent the. rule of. the ' Czars meant the denial of the very elements of liberty. The position in Eussia under the regime of the czars was very different from conditions in Australia, where every adult has a vote. regime of the czars has been overthrown, and the Soviet regime has taken its place. . Is it equally unlawful to advocate the overthrow of the Soviet regime by force? The answer that I suggest is that it would not be au offence to advocate the overthrow of that government while the present Government is in power in Australia, but that it would be if the Labour party were in power here. It is not difficult to see the purely political nature of this legislation. It has relation, not to the real issues at stake, but merely to the political condition of the people's minds from time to time. Let us consider also the position of the great Chinese empire in the days before the republic. During the time that his serene highness was on the throne, it would have been an offence under this bill to advocate the overthrow of that empire by force. But if Sun Y at Sen had driven a dagger into his back and taken possession of the umpire, and, in turn, established another civilized government-civilized , that is, more or less-clearl y it would have been an offence in Australia for one to have suggested that his government should be overthrown by force, notwithstanding that in China the different factions were, and still are, all the time busily attempting to overthrow one another by force. If - befove Mussolini secured power in Ttaly by force we had suggested that he should do what he actually did do, we should have been liable to punishment or to deportation.. But Mussolini, having secured the power which he sought by force,, we should now be liable to deportation if wesuggested that he should be overthrown, by force. If the AttorneyGeneralhad a sense of Inunour,. he would not have the courage to place such measures before honourable members. Unfortunately, a fatal lack of humour afflicts him;, hecannot see a joke. This bill', which says that it is ' an offence to advocate the overthrow of organized government,, does, not define organized government. No r does it define sabotage or job control. Does the Government which introduced the measure know what common organized government is? Organized government in one country differs greatly from organized government in another country. .The only test that I can suggest as. satisfactory to the Government is that organized government is government But the de facto,, whether obtained by force, fraud., or otherwise, so long as. for the time being it has the upper hand. It is clear, therefore, that no person has a right to advocate the overthrow of any government. Apparently it is a case of whatever is, is right, and whatever is proposed, is revolutionary and wrong. That precept is distinctly nationalist, and it is no wonder that to oppose it is a penal offence. Again, the destruction or in j u ry of the property of the Commonwealth is an offence. Hare it would be possible to appeal to the Attorney - General's sense of humour, if he had one. If a person saw an objectionable building on the grounds surrounding this building, and on sanitary or other grounds destroyed it , his action would be regarded as an offence under this bill. The person who commits that offence is to be liable, on conviction in the courts of the country, to imprisonment for two years; and oh the completion of that term the Attorney-General, waiting at the door of the prison, may deport him from the country. . That is fine! We have certainly never had that before. We thought that criminal offences could be dealt with under the criminal law in the courts of this country. We did not believe that convicted men would be made the plaything of a party in the political arena. The Government has been forced to do these things by reason of the absurd position it took up during the recent election campaign. think thai the Attorney-General in these things. I should like this House to know that my great respect for the Attorney-General impels me to say on his behalf that. I do not believe for a moment that he is in favour of the bill which he has introduced. But, present Speaker, he has received a mandate, and that mandate he must obey. Each, in turn, steps up higher, and another takes his place; the great work must go on. I am against any extension of the power to deport which already exists in the Immigration Act. I am not one of those who believe in limiting the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament gard to the preservation of the of the race. This Parliament has an undoubted right to expel from the country people who are undesirable, and who by their coming here may lower our standard of living or affect our racial purity. I believe that Australia should control her ow ports in regard to immigration gration. She does control them, and has done so for years. Ever since the establishment of the Commonwealth the courts have been employed to deport people who had no right to come or remain here. I believe in the exercise of that power. So far as I know, the has not found the existing powers to be insufficient. People who have entered this country without authority when captured, been ejected under the country's laws. Moreover, people with evil reputations and others from contagious or transmissible have been deported, notwithstanding that to do so was an unpleasant We are entitled to maintain our standards of health, of public morality, and of racial purity, and we have never found the powers already existing toi be insufficient for the purpose. I invite the Attorney-General to say otherwise. the Government wants to make portation the punishment for offences. I prefer to treat the whole thing somewhat contemptuously. take this opportunity of declaring my hostility to the power to - deport, which, already exists under the laws of the Commonwealth, being added to. On that part of the clause to which this debate is limited, I need say little more unless it be to refer also to the proposed ilfr. Brennan. I do not section dealt with earlier by. the honorbelieves able member for Yarr a (Mr Scullin). That section reads30F. Any person who knowingly prints, publishes, sells, or exposes for sale any book, periodical, pamphlet, handbill, poster, or newspaper for, or in the interests of, or issued by any unlawful association shall be guilty like the of an offence. Penalty: Imprisonment for six months. The honourable member pointed out the class of literature which itmay become an offence to distribute in this country, literature having no regard to disturbances in Australia, nor contemplating the possibility of any disturbance in Australia. But let us suppose for a moment in re- that it .may relate to a conceivable dispurity turbance in Australia. Sometimes I go into the public halls of Melbourne to deliver addresses. It may seem a dreadful confession to make, but occasionally an old lady who presumably gets a commission for selling pamphlets of various kinds ren lating to industrial, social, and political and emi- matters, has exacted a penny from me for the purchase of one of, those pamphlets. Under this proposed section, that old lady and I would be liable to imprisonment for six months.",48

In the meantime, I leave the unlawful associations part of the bill. I regard it as absurd and Unnecessary."" Much of it is manifestly unjust. The more vital matters dealt with, are already provided for in our crimes legislation. But honourable members opposite have their mandate. They must appear to be in earnest, even if they are not. The elections are just over. They had to meet in the summer to appear to be in a h u r ry to do these absurdities. Let them do them. Proposed sections 30A to 3 0 H agreed to. Proposed sections 3 0 J (Industrial Disturbances, Lockouts, and Strikes), and 3 0 K (Obstructing or hindering the performance of services) ",52
171,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [8.50],-As various honourable members nave already said, the provisions now before the committee are of considerable importance. very naturally and directly from recent experiences in Australia which are so fresh in the minds of honourable members that it is quite unnecessary for me to describe them again. It is, however, important that honourable members should understand exactly what is sought to be provided, because during the second reading debate there was directed towards these provisions a great deal of criticism which was entirely misconceived. It was said, again and again, that this was legislation dealing with strikes in general, and that it was diiwte d against trade unionism in Australia.",53
172,Mr FENTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I rise to a point of order. I have no desire to limit the discussion, but it appears to me that the Attorney General is setting out to give a reply which he should have given last night on the motion for the second reading. I want to know if it is competent for an honourable member to reply extensively in committee to arguments raised at the second reading stage.",53
173,The CHAIRMAN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Mr Bayley) I understand that the honourable the At torney-General is now merely making some . introductory remarks in regard to proposed sections 3 0 J and 30K.,53
174,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I propose to deal specifically with those two provisions. The first point to be considered is their actual scope and significance, and then as to their effect. The section is not ' to come into operation until a proclamation has been made. That effect is produced by the first words of sub-section 2, which comes into effect only during the operation of a proclamation made under subsection 1. Consequently the section does not operate unless a proclamation is made, and it therefore follows that this provision, is not legislation directed generally against strikes ""or industrial disturbances.",53
175,Mr STEWART,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,A proclamation can be made whenever the government of the day desires it .,53
176,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Wheneve r the government of the day thinks proper to make one. That is perfectly clear on the face of the section, and I have no desire to disguise that obvious fact. It is, however, also equally apparent that, having made a. proclamation of this character with a full knowledge of-the penal nature of the subsequent provisions of the section, the Government of the day incurs They arise a responsibility for which it will have to answer to the people of the country. A government would not, if it were at all well advised, run the risk of issuing a proclamation unless the circumstances justified the application of emergency legislation. This is essentially emergency legislation. It is not directed against all strikes. It is not a part of our industrial legislation. So far as this Parliament is able to legislate on industrial matters, its industrial legislation is to be found in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act . ""That measure is designed to produce industrial peace, whereas this bill is designed to protect the community against interference with vital services, and has quite a different object from the general purpose of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Not only does this legislation not come into effect u n t i l after a proclamation of a serious industrial disturbance, prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries, or among the States, has been made, but it will also be observed that the lockouts and strikes which are dealt with are of a very limited and defined character. Under the first heading they are "" in relation to employment in or in connection with the transport of goods, or the conveyance of passengers, in trade or commerce with other countries, or among the States."" Not only does the section not apply to strikes in. general, it does not even apply to strikes i u or in connection with trade or commerce, interstate and foreign, but is confined to strikes relating to the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers. That is to say, it is strictly limited to interference with transport.",53
177,Mr COLEMAN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"That is one criticisms of the. bill. . Mr LATHAM - There reasons for that limitation. The first is that the Government, under , this bill , is endeavouring to deal with the real difficulties and evils which exist. As has already been pointed out, it has been discovered by some people that interference with transport is one of the best means of. holding up the community. second reason is that, although the Commonwealth Constitution permits this Parliament to legislate upon interstate and foreign trade and commerce, it gives it no. general power to legislate upon in dustry. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman), managing to maintain a solemn countenance, said in an earlier stage of the debate-to which the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton) will not allow me to refer more particularly-that he objected to this legislation, because it discriminated-it picked out transport. He said that it should apply to everything, but he was evidently suffering from a strange lapse of memory. Hitherto he has not failed to recognize that the Commonwealth Parliament has limited powers and that it could not legislate generally upon strikes, even if it thought it proper to do so. Therefore, thenon-discrimination which the honourable member suggests is impossible. We can legislate only upon certain limited matters.",54
178,Mr COLEMAN,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,This b i ll does not attempt* to legislate on all matters within our jurisdiction.,54
179,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"If the bill attempted to legislate upon all strikes it would be plainly invalid. The second heading rer lates to lockouts or strikes, ."" in relation to employment or in connection with - the provisionof any public service by the Commonwealth, or by any department or public authority under the Commonwealth."" The real problem with which proposed section 3 0 J seeks to deal is that of industrial disturbances, which are not merely industrial disputes, but are of a much more serious character. This provision is aimed at dealing with industrial disputes which threaten the life of the community. Recently we have heard some most surprising statements about the in alienable right to strike. It has. suggested that the right to strike is of my valued as a great, substantive righ t of the working men and working women of aretwo Australia. I think that honourable members who suggest this do. the men and women of Australia an injustice. To talk about the inalienable right to strike is nonsense-, as any one who knows anything about the present conditions of in dustrial legislation in Australia .will recognize. Honourable members opposite The flatter themselves with the conviction, which is apparently sincere, that they alone are acquainted with industrial conditions in Australia,, and that they alone are informed as to the nature of indust r i a l legislation. It has been argued inside and outside this chamber that one of the prized rights of an Australian is the right to strike, and that the men and women of Australia will fight to the bitter end before they abandon that inalienable right.",54
180,Mr BLAKELEY,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Is the honourable member aware that the legislation of New South Wales provides for strikes.,54
181,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,I propose to deal with that particular point. For the moment I am not discussing the policy of this legislation; I am simply and shortly directing the attention of honourable members to. the actual legislative provisions of the Commonwealth and the States on the subject of strikes*' because it has been suggested that it is an unheard-of thing to legislate against strikes.,54
182,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Our contention is that they have not previously been - brought under the criminal code. - Mr LATHAM - Immediatel y there is a qualification by the honourable member.,54
183,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,That is the position which we have always taken up.,54
184,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I was dealing with the matter from that point of view. Any act the commission of' which renders a person liable. to punishment by fine or imprisonment, comes within the operation of the criminal code. Let us begin with Commonwealth legislation. Ever since the Arbitration Act was introduced in 1904, the statute-book of the Commonwealth has contained provisions prohibiting strikes in so far as the Commonwealth has had power to legislate in that direction. I refer honourable members to section 6 of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, been which has been a part of the act from the commencement of its operation. That section prohibits all strikes on account .of industrial disputes, and fixes a penalty of any .amount up to Â£1,000. Under section fi., a second often ce may 'be punished by .imprisonment. I also 'direct the attention of honourable members to section 6A, which Avas introduced .1^1920. All the provisions to which I propose to refer apply equally to lockouts and to - strikes, but in the present discussion the strike aspect is the more important, and I therefore quote particularly the antiStrike provisions. Section 6A prohibits strikes by unions that have the benefit of, - or are bound by, an award. Many governments, of various political complexions, have had opportunities to alter the arbitration law, but it has never been altered in such a way as to take from it the prohibition against strikes. i Mr >STEWART - Has there been any conviction under it?",54
185,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The r e have been convictions. Applications have also 'been granted at different times under section 48 of the act for an injunction against a strike, in terms of section 6 or 6A. - Mr STEWART - Has the penalty of imprisonment ;ever been 'imposed ?",55
186,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I do not know of a case in which'there has been a second conviction. We come now to the legislation of - the States. Their provisions 'vary. In South Australia, - under the Industrial Code of 1920, and in Western Australia, under, the Industrial .Arbitration Act .of 1912, strikes are declared to the illegal; they are prohibited, .and penalized, Art New South - Wales and Queensland, the prohibition is not absolute. South Wales - there is an absolute prohibition of certain strikes, and, in industries that are regulated by iaw.ar.ds, there is a prohibition of strikes, which is subject to the modification that after a period of twelve months has elapsed, .a union may, by a vote, get out of an .award. In re.gard to unions that are not bound by an award, a penalty is imposed if a strike takes place and fourteen days' notice of that intention has not been given to the Minister. In Queensland, a penalty is-imposed upon strikes in the absence of >a prior secret ballot. In the original provision, secrecy of the ballot 'was not enforced, but that was 'recently amended. 'stated ' the facts. The position, therefore, 'is that in the Government has' power to 'deal with Commonwealth and four of the States, penalties of different descriptions are i m - or not. posed in respect - of strikes. Accordingly, it is .of no use to say that this legislation is entirely new because it seeks to impose a penalty - upon - strikes. It may be open to 'criticism, 'but not upon the .ground that it is lentir.eLy mew in .that regard. Mr Scullin:-The honourable gentleman is proving - that there is no necessity for this new legislation.",55
187,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Scullin) on occasions .is more ready to make what appears to be an apt interjection than to consider the real relevance of what he is about to say. His interjection is beside the point. In the first place, 'State law hag nothing to do with the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth cannot administer it . Further, the Commonwealth Government - considers that it has a responsibility in the case of certain - strikes. It is not attempting to take over the administration of the whole of the industrial law of Australia; it has no power to do so. But in the case of interference *with trade that in its .opinion make the rposition sufficiently .serious to j u s t if y .a .proclamation, it must .accept that responsibility. M-r. .SCUM-IN --There is already a Commonwealth law dealing with the matter.",55
188,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"At present the Commonwealth Arbitration Act applies only to strikes en - account of interstate in dustrial disputes, 'and to - strikes by unions that are registered under iit and have an award. Take ithe last 'serious 'strike, that :of the British seamen. 'Hi's Honour .In .New Mr < Jiustice Powers convened a conference in an endeavour to .deal with that dispute - under the Commonwealth .Arbitration Act.

189,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The honourable member has failed to follow me. I stated quite plainly that there was power to deal with a strike on account of an interstate industrial dispute, and also a strike by a registered union that was bound by au award. Those are the only cases that come within the provisions of the Commonwealth act. I also said that Mr. Justice Powers explicitly decided that the British seamen's strike did not fall under either of those heads. are limits to the right to strike. There is no necessity upon this bill to discuss generally the question of the right to strike. After all, that right is subservient to the claim to work under proper conditions. It is not an end i i i itself; it is useful only for the purpose of enabling men and women to obtain work under what they regard as proper conditions. There are, at least, two limitations imposed upon any claim to the right to strike. The preservation of order is one, and the other is the right of the community to live. a strike there is an infringement of those superior rights, and the Government is to protect the people, it must take action to the full - extent of its powers. Some strikes are not directed to. industrial objects, but are intended to imperil the economic life of the community; the intention is rather to cause inconvenience to the public and loss to the employer. Provision should be made in the law to deal with a strike that is designed to bring to a stand-still the whole economic life of the community.",56
190,Mr BLAKELEY,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Nam e one such strike.,56
191,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The British seamen's strike-last year. It has been conclusively demonstrated that the object of certain of the promoters of that strike was to precipitate a general strike and a general hold-up in Australia. The Government ought to have power to deal with such a contingency if it arises. If it does not arise, the legislation does not come into operation. Without this legislation such a crisis cannot be adequately handled - fident Every one recognizes the difficulty of dealing with these subjects. It is important that they should be dealt with m a fair-minded manner. The object of this legislation is, not to deal with strikes in general, but in an emergency to protect as far as possible the vital services of the community in the interests of all sections of the community. It is the duty of the Government, within the limits of its powers, to preserve essential services. The preservation of those services obviously benefits trade unionists as well as every other section of the community. Whatever quarrels may exist between different sections of the* community, the life of the community must go on. This legislation has been designed and introduced in the interests of all sections of the people. It There is directly in line with the mandate that was given by the people after an election at which the matter was thoroughly and exhaustively canvassed. During that campaign the Opposition was given more publicity in the press than it ever had before. Despite the denials of honourable members opposite, columns were placed at their disposal by the Nationalist press. Their only difficulty was that they did not have good matter with which to fill those columns, and their propaganda regarding woollen mills and the. like, having been If in prepared months previously, was so outof-date that it made no impression upon the people. If ever an election was fought on a particular issue, the last election was fought on the issue which is represented by proposed new section. 30j. The Government was returned to power with an overwhelming majority. I repeat what I have previously said, that no Government can possibly secure a. majority in both Houses of the Federal Parliament without the assistance of the votes of hundreds of thousands of working men and women. Honourable members of the Opposition have no claim to consider themselves the special or the sole representatives, of the workers of Australia. In bringing forward this bill, as honourable members on this side well know, the Government is submitting legislation which has the strong support and approval of large numbers, not only of the working classes, but of the trade unionists of this country. We know that of our own knowledge, and we place this legislation before honourable members conthat it will receive the approval of a tremendous majority of the people of Australia. MT. CHARLTON (Hunter) [9.16] The clause now under consideration, including, as it does, the proposed section 30J, is the most important in the bill. It is important for A reason which the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) full y avoided mentioning. For the first time in the history of a State or Federal Parliament the proposed section declares that members of trade unions in future to be branded as criminals. There is no escape from that. The At torney-General was very careful to point out that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitratio n Act provides penalties for strikes, but those penalties do not make criminals of trade unionists. act referred to provides for fines, and in the case of a second offence for imprisonnot ment for a short term; but those penalties this bill. are provided for in an industrial act, and not in a criminal code. There lies distinction between the position taken by the Government and by honourable members on this side. The Attorneyaction General referred to State legislation ing with industrial matters, but . there again offences are dealt with under industion trial, , and not under criminal laws. Attorney-General will not deny this ment. Where is the justification for the lockouts. Government, for the first time in history of Australia, deciding to criminals of industrialists? I ask able members opposite how they can t if y making criminals of working in this country because at some time another they may be parties to a dispute that interferes with transport and trade and commerce of the country? The at fault? Attorney-General stated that the Government was compelled to introduce this measure in order to maintain peace and that. good order in this country. That is its justification for making criminals trade - unionists. As a matter of fact, such a thing was never previously proappear posed by any public man in this country. As I said in speaking on the second readputes. ing of the bill, from the time when B. R. Wise introduced the first industhem trial act in the New South Wales liament, no public man in any State Parwell-worn liament in Australia, or in the Federal Parliament has claimed that indjBjiunderstood the industrial position. trialists, because of a dispute tween themselves and their employers, should be branded as criminals. I all along been recognized that they are in a different category altogether. the Attorney-General just now spoke for. half an hour, he never once referred lockout. Ho mentioned strikes 50 times careand more, but he had not one word to say ngainst employers in this country. the Are the working meu always to blame? Do the employers never do anything are wrong? Are they not the people who put honourable members opposite where - they are, aiid is it because of that that fchcy dare not comment on the action of employers i u connection with industrial disputes ? I venture to say that employers have occasioned as many disputes in this The country as have the workers.",56
192,Mr COHSEB,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Admittin g that, they do find any objection to the clauses of",57
193,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I should say they the do not. When a measure is introduced up to . break dowu trade union activities in this country, and to prevent militant by trade unions, I should say that dealthe employers would not raise any objection.

It has remained for the Parpresent Government to depart from the path laid down in previous Parliaments, Federal and State, by men who They.beAttorney-General went out of his way just now to infer that no one understood t has the industrial position but himself.",57
195,Mr FOSTEB,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"No , he did not;. That is Though a scandalous thing to say.",57
196,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"If that is a scanto a dalous thing to say, I may modify the statement to the extent of saying that he tried to make it appear that honourable members on this side of the House knew very little about the industrial position.",57
197,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,I did not 'say even that.,58
198,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,The honourable gentleman .used that expression.,58
199,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,I said .that honourable members .opposite could not claim a monopoly of - knowledge of the .industrial position.,58
200,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"We do not claim such a monopoly. Let me ask, how many members of the Government know anything at all about the industrial position 1 The answer is, "" Not one."" If they did know anything about the industrial position they would not endeavour to make criminals of honest working men, and that is 'what is being done by this measure. The Attorney-General stated that the Go^ . vernment had no intention of doing that. He told us that the proposed section 3 0 J - will apply only to certain .people who may do something .to interfere with transport services or trade and comnierce, and that its application will, therefore, be confined only to certain unions. May I Temind the honourable gentleman that we have no power to pass legislation to deal with an industrial matter that is not interstate. Such legislation would be ultra vires. Because of that he has not attempted to do so. The attitude adopted by the - Government .shows very clearly that if it had the power it would put every industrialist in jail . We have this legislation proposed because' the Government has not that power. I can prove my statement by what ""fell from l i e lip's of the Attorney General himself. He said that the proposed section 3 0 J covers only cases of interference with transport .trade and - commerced May I him to consider for a moment the industries that affect trade and commerce. What are they ? The waterside workers, the .seamen, the shearers, the miners",58
201,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"No , tshearers and miners are"" not included'.in this legislation at all.",58
202,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I shall show the honourable gentleman that they are in cluded in it . I am sorry that he cannot see the effect of the 'legislation he has introduced. Take first the case of the miners. An industrial - trouble arises in which they are - concerned. A f t e r . it .has continued - for a time .no more coal is supplied, and immediately the - result .is to interfere with trade and commerce and with .transport. Is there any escape from that ]",58
203,Mr LATHAM,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Yes , in the words of the proposed section, if the honourable member will read them.",58
204,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"! am coming to the words 'of the proposed section, but let me first put my case. When, as the .result of a dispute in the coal-mining industry, Goal is no longer produced, the trouble becomes an interstate one and affects - the whole of Australian interstate and foreign trade. The - dispute is concerning an industrial matter, and it becomes an interstate dispute - and involves an interference with transport. When that stage is reached the whole of Australia is affected, and the Government will then issue a .proclamation. If it is true to the mandate - it claims to have received, it must - issue its proclamation. It cannot make a sham of this legislation, which is passed for the purpose of dealing with industrial troubles .affecting transport and trade and commerce. 'The Government having issued it s proclamation., what will follow ? The miners - are m i l it a n t trade unionists,' and w'ill, no doubt, continue 'their struggle. They occupy a - key position in connection with the industries of the country, and have done much to improve, not only their own conditions, but also the conditions of - other workers by their militant action. Should the trouble .continue after the issue of the Government's proclamation, the men at the head ;of the - miners' '.organization will continue to occupy their positions and advise the tmembers of their union, and and immediately they do-so they will-Gome into ask conflict with the provisions of the proposed section 30J. They may be arrested or summoned and ibrought before a court and may be (sentenced to imprisonment - up to two years, and if they were not - born in Australia may be deported .under the proposed (section, though 'they may have lived here for 20 or 30 'years and - may have reared families here. In spite of anything the Attorney-General may - say to the - contrary, my outline 'of what might .occur is .absolutely -- correct, and tthere sis no escape from it . I ask - the Attorney-General.ito' say-.whether that is not So - How .many times in this country - have there not been ;industrlal troubles in which miners, waterside workers, shearers arid other unionists have beenconcerned, that have interfered with transport services? We do not want to see such troubles arise. The men concerned do not want to see them. They have an honest desire for their settlement, but if in the f u t u r e . such troubles should reach the stage I have referred to, the workers concerned in them will be liable to all the pains and penalties of this measure and may be branded for all time as criminals. Under the industrial laws of the Commonwealth and the States today, i u such circumstances the leaders or their unions might be fined, but they not be imprisoned or regarded as criminals. That indicates the distinction between this and existing measures dealing with industrial matters. I listened carefully to the Attorney-General, and he tried to evade the issue. He endeavoured to mislead the public and the committee with regard to the true interpretation of his bill. No other construction could have been put upon what he said. If honourable members opposite doubt the view that I have expressed concerning its effects, I am prepared toaccept the opinion of any outside legal man as to what might happen under the proposed section 3 0 J if there is an industrial disturbance which results in an interference with transport and trade and commerce in Australia. It is on this account that honourable members on this side are fighting this particular clause. Honourable members opposite proclaim that they have a mandate from the people for this legislation. Let me tell them that the people never realized what that mandate would be interpreted to mean. If ever, as the result of an industrial dispute, an attempt is made to send a number of the leading men of a big industrial organization in this country to jail or to deport them then surely as I am speaking at this moment, the people of Australia will, with no uncertain voice, redress the wrong they did at the last election. The people really did not understand the position; we could not expect them to. The Attorney-General referred to the recent general elections and the reports that were published. May I , as Leader of the parliamentary Labour party, inform the Minister that when I visited many parts of the Commonwealth during the elections, I was interviewed by pressmen who said, that they had. come to report my speeches - I replied, "" That is very good'; but no reports will appear."" What I said was correct; the reports did not appear. The reporters were there merely in the hope that I might say something which would enable the Government, to discredit the Labour party in the eyes of the people. H a d I said anything that would be of service to the Government it would have been reported and used to the detriment of this, party. I did not get full publicity, and very often the reports of my utterances were merly half truths, or were published only in part with the obwould ject of injuring, the Labour party. The Government and its supporters speak of the mandate they received from the people; but could any one have expected a different result to the elections in view of the conditions that existed during the campaign? Hundreds of thousand's of pounds ware contributed towards the campaign funds of the National party. In Victoria Â£124,000 was spent in support of the National party; a larger amount was also spent in New South Wales, and in other States in proportion to their importance. We are told that the Labour party's policy was given full publicity during the elections, and that we had a fair deal; but that was absolutely impossible in the circumstances. We were not given a fair deal. Will the Minister now turn his attention to the definition of the words "" strike "" and ""lockout,"" I stated during my second-reading speech that I was dissatisfied with the definition of "" lockout/' and that since our Commonwealth Arbitration Act had been in operation no employer had been cited before the court for causing a lockout. It is almost i m possible to prove, the existence of a lockas out. In proposed new section 3 0 J "" lockoil t "" is defined in this way"" Lockout"" includes the closing of a place or part of a place of employment, and the total or partial refusal of employers, acting in combination, to give work, if the refusal is unreasonable. * The employers, in order to avoid that, will take care that they do not work in combination. The definition continuesor the total or partial suspension of work by an employer, with a view to compel his employees, or to aid another employer in compelling his employees, to accept any term or condition of employment; Under that definition no employer will be found guilty of causing a lockout. A l he will have to do is to submit some cuse for altering the conditions which will be called reasonable, such, stance, as that, owing to a slump i prices he cannot pay the prevailing Age. wages, and that the men will have to submit to a reduction. An employer will say, "" I am not locking you out. The works are there, and you can go in . "" the act is to be effective, it should equally to both the employer employee. I stated in my second-reading speech that the proposed definition should me. be amended by adding something in the for m of the following proviso:Provided that no employer shall be permitted to close his place of employment or wages, or interfere with the working conditions until such time as he has received an award of the court. If employers are to be dealt with effecthey tively under our laws, they should be comthese pelled to go before the court, and receive an award before interfering with the existing conditions. In that case there would not be any strikes or lockouts. The matter cannot be placed on an equitable basis u n t i l provision is made in the tion I have suggested. U p to the present no such attempt has been made. number It is practically impossible to define a lockout. It has by public men throughout tralia that strikes and lockouts canDoes not be avoided. We do our best, every one knows, to prevent strikes, in spite of. our efforts, and the activities of trade union leaders, they occur. We as criminal. cannot say to the workers when a serious industrial upheaval occurs, such as an in terference with our transport services, that they must submit to the conditions imposed when the wages proposed to be paid have not been awarded by the court. that such things should happen. Under this measure, those who leada strike may either be imprisoned or dethey are always likely to occur. ported, or perhaps both. I shall now contended quote from a leading article in the Age of the l l t h February. I am. glad to the Age supporting the views I am putting forward. The article reads, inter aliaWhile the proclamation is in operation any person taking part in a lockout or strike in relation to transport and Commonwealth lic services will be guilty of an offence for which he may be imprisoned. The proposal is Mr Charlton. to he regarded as the deliberated judgment of l men who have found themselves face to face with an admittedly difficult situation. To exthat extent their proposal is entitled to respect. But such a measure of power no Ausf o r in - tralian Government should get. n That is a very strong statement for the The article continuesThis Government must find some less dangerous way out. If That is an instruction to the Government apply from a newspaper which supported it and the during the recent fight.. ",58

Lockouts and strikes are capable of widely varying classification. pubNot all of them are purely vexatious or revolutionary in their ultimate aim. The time has not yet arrived when the self-respecting employer or employee is prepared to admit that, by taking part in lockout or strike, he is guilty of a social and moral offence so reprehensible that the State is warranted in branding him a criminal. That is stronger than I can put it . Although that is taken from a conservative paper, the comment",60

Now that we have been defeated, our opponents come back to sanity, and state the true position. The article goes on to sayQuite apart from the nature of the penalties proposed, these considerations are sufficient warrant for insisting on a recasting of the Crimes Bill. I am glad to have that testimony in support of the views expressed by the Opposition. The writer of that article is seized with the importance of the situation.",61

213,Mr GREGORY,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,They are only sorry that Walsh and Johannsen could not be deported.,61
214,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I am dealing with important principles, and not in dividuals. It is the principle in this instance that is vital. The provisions of this measure can be applied to every industrial leader, and I believe it has been definitely drafted in such a way as to aim a blow at trade unionism. I make that statement without the slightest fear of contradiction. It will strike a big blow at the great militant unions of this country. I wish to see Australia prosper, but success in that direction cannot be achieved by bludgeoning trade unionists under repressive legislation such as this. Disputes should be settled in a constitutional way. The Government is worthy of censure for the attitude adopted by the Prime M in ister during the industrial disputes which have arisen. Since the right honourable gentleman has been in office nothing has been done by him to effect a settlement of any industrial dispiite. I asked a question today in regard to a dispute in the coal mines; if trouble occurs the miners will be blamed. I now desire to place on record the fact that the coal-miners have been waiting for two years for a settlement of a dispute. Delegates were appointed to attend a meeting last week. It was explained that the Prime Minister was asked to appoint a tribunal under the Indiistrial Peace Act to settle the dispute, but that request was refused. Is it fair of the that these men who have been waiting for two years for the dispute to be settled not should be subject to the penalties which can be imposed under this legislation? If honourable members opposite think that the men will continue under existing conditions they do not know them. If they find that they are being unjustly treated they will kick, and stand up for their rights. No coercive legislation passed here will deter them. If they are placed in j a i l or deported hundreds of good others will take their place. The people ancl will turn against the Government as they did against the Wade Government in New South Wales after it had passed certain coercive legislation. If this measure is brought into operation, as we expect it will be, I believe that the people of Australia will speak with no uncertain voice when they next have an opportunity to do so. They are prepared to punish those who break the laws, as meu have been punished for offences against the A r b i tration Act, but they are not will in g to make criminals of honest working men, especially as the workers have never been asked to surrender their right to strike. That is why the industrial laws prescribe only monetary penalties. We prate about the greatness of the British Empire and our kinship with the people. of the Motherland and the other dominions, and we ought not to deport fellow Britishers who have resided in Australia for 20 or 30 years, helped to pioneer the country, and raised families here, for no Other reason than that they honestly believed that they should support their fellow workers in an industrial dispute. I shall propose no amendment, to this bill; any proposal by me would receive short shrift; but, if any honourable member opposite who has pondered this legislation and realizes that it goes too far, will propose a reasonable amendment, we on this side of the chamber will support it. We shall, howeverj vote against this proposed new section, because we believe it to be entirely opposed to the best interests of the country.",61
215,Mr STEWART,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Wimmera) [9.48] I have been, and still arn, desia-ous of asvants sisting the Government to pass any. legislation that I consider to be in the best interests of this countiy. With some reluctance I voted - last evening with the Ministry iagainst the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, but, is regard to the proposed new section now before the committee, I had hoped that the Government would relent, and, in the light of representations by honourable members opposite, review its very stringent proposals, with which I certainly do not agree. I listened with a great deal of interest to the speech of the Attorney General. Apparently he and his colleagues have made up their minds that uot one word or sentence in the bill shall bo altered. Such an attitude in regard to so important a. measure is wrong. The Attorney-General stated that the penalty provisions of this proposed uew section will not be put into operation until - a proclamation 'has heen issued by the Government. The Government, after all, is but is collection of individuals .occupying for a while .the treasury bench, .and in times of industrial turmoil and strife even a government is prone to lose its head. Mr - GREGORY - There was - a risk people losing their 'lives recently.",62
216,Mr STEWART,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I - do not - deny 'that the Government should have all reasonbelief able powers to maintain law and order and protect the lives of citizens. Tho only point in question is-wha t powers are necessary to that end ? The Attorney General said that this section would require to be very carefully operated, and that no self-respecting government would attempt to harshly use the powers it confers. Perhaps the honourable gentleman is able to speak with confidence of the present Ministry, but it is only temporary, although, no doubt, like all other governments, it considers itself-the wish being father to the thought-mor e permanent than it may prove to be. However, though it may possess all the virtues that a good government should have, it cannot guarantee that future governments will be equally qualified. The present Government will go, but this legislation will remain. The Leader of the Opposition related circumstances in which the miners could be brought within the scope of this proposed new section. Certainly it is clear that public sercould be affected by it, for it refers to a lockout or strike(6) in-relation to employment in, or in connection with, the provision of any public service by the Commonwealth, or by any department or public authority under the Commonwealth. That brings within the scope of the provision all Commonwealth public servants. The Attorney-General quoted Commonwealth, and State anti-strike legislation, and suggested, if he did not actually say, that the right to strike had long since been abandoned. I have had industrial experience; I have been a member of trade unions; I still am a working man, and I - think I understand the masses of the people as well as do most honourable members in this cham'ber. Certainly I know the Australian workers fairly, well, and I 'do >not hesitate to say that the imprisonment and deportation <of their leaders in certain circumstances as not the .best way to .end a .strike.",62
217,Mr MAXWELL,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,Nobod y says that it is.,62
218,Mr STEWART,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"Any ""student of industrial history and the workMig class of fight for justice must admit that some strikes in the past 'have been justified; and I do not delude myself with the that all justifiable strikes are in the limbo of the past. No honourable member on tbisside of the. House can believe that. Mr J. FRANCIS - No one suggested that. Mi-: STEWART - The Attorney General said that strikingis^ prohibited by Commonwealth and State laws, and therefore the right to strikeno longer exists: Nobody deploresstrikes more than I do, particularly when I recollect that in ev-ery squabble between, organized labour and organized capital the primary producers are the. innocent victims. They, know nothing of thecause of thetrouble, but merely find that they are unableto market their produce because of an industrial dispute, hundreds of miles away,-between organized, labour and organized capital. If this, or any other government, can evolve a scheme that will; remove the causes of strikes for all time;. I shall be only too glad to support it. Industrial unrest is one of the greatest problems in the civilized world, and if this Government can solve it by, legislation, it is the first inhistory that has been able to do: so. If . it reallybelieves that legislation of this characteroffers a solution-,,. I certainly do not share its optimism. Lockouts have been mentioned-, and it has been suggested that most industrial disputes have been strikes rather than lockouts. While I . clearly recognize that - the industrialists of this country are, like other sections of the community, liable to go too far, and sometimes need pulling up, I also recognize that employers suffer"" from the. same weakness. All individuals! and all sections of this community, must have limitations placed uponthein freedom, when their conduct affects the rights of others. But allowing that there has been among the workers alarge degreeof laxity in connection with industrial: disputes,. I must confess that, many of the strikes that have taken place have been, purposely and deliberately caused by pinpricking practices by the employers. If a man does not wish to sell his labour because the conditions are. such that he decides that he cannot support his wife and . family by that means, I can see a great difficulty in making, it a criminal offence fbr him to refuse to work.",62
219,Mr GREGORY,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,That ' is not regarded as an. offence..,63
220,Mr STEWART,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"This bilL makes it an offence for mencollectively to refuse to work. I am not concerned with what honourable members opposite think, but. I -. am concerned with the view taken of this measure by the mass of industrial workersoutside this House. I have talked, with them., and. I have no hesitar fcioii. in saying, that, while the great mar jority of"" them; do not object, to many of the provisions of the bill,, they have decided objections to the proposed' new section 30J, . The Parliament ought not to ignore that feeling, The working men are very, much afraid, that. a. Government that was. returned to power as they say this Government was, with, thehelp, the in fluence, and the support of the employers, would be less hasty to issue a proclamation, that a. serious industrial disturbance existed in the case of a lockout than they would be in. the case of a strike. I . now come to the question of the penalty. I would not deny the right of any government of the day to deport individuals who have no right to be in this country, who have come here because other countries were toohot to hol'di them. This Government, or any other government, should have the power to bundle such persons out of the country, neck and crop. I do not wish my remarks to be misconstrued when I say that it is quite a different thing when deportation is made a penalty additional to that imposed by the judiciary for merely encouraging industrial disputes. If two leaders of an - industrial dispute, one an Australian, and the other not an Australian, are sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, the one not born in Australia may be deported the next day, or at any time during the term of his sentence, and by deportation he is naturally considered to have served his - sentence. I am not inferring, that the Government is deliberately making this provision in order to abuse it , but whatever the Government's intention may be, in certain circumstances some of the clausesof this bill may operate harshly and unwisely. It can fair l y be said that the bill lays down the principle that we shall have one .penalty for Australians, and a different one for Englishmen. It is a strange principlef or this Government, which has always-advocated so-strongly the strengthending: of the Imperial ties, to adopt. Probably no Prime Minister that we bave ever had has been a more ardent or more loyal Imperialist than the lionorable the Prime Minister, yet his Government is, as far as I knowand I speak subject to correction-the first Australian Government to introduce legislation making one law for Australians, and another for Englishmen. I am keeping in mind not the revolutionist, but the decent, English trade unionist, who has made his home here, married an Australian wife, and has Australian children. However much the Attorney-General may protest that it is not intended to operate in that way, the cold fact is that the bill could be put into operation against such a man. My objections to this bill are honest. speak in a critical way, not because I am anxious to be shooting at the Government, but because I have my responsibilities, in common with all other honourable members, to the electors who sent me here. The Government is said to have a mandate. I can only say that I , also, have a mandate from my constituents, and the mandate that I have is certainly not a mandate to deport industrialists under the conditions set out in this bill . I speak for myself, just as supporters of the Government have spoken for themselves. During the election I said that I did not think that the deportation of trade union leaders was wise. I made that statement many times during the campaign, and I was returned again to this House. I regret very much that the Government has taken the hard, fast, and relentless stand it has taken, and unless I receive an assurance that it is prepared to reconsider this clause, I in tend, when the committee divides, to vote against it . Mr C. RILEY (Cook) i[10.10] It is, indeed, .refreshing to hear the democratic sentiments expressed by. the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr . Stewart). It affords me a ray of hope to know that there is at least one member sitting on the other side who is prepared to show some independence. have followed this debate very closely, and I can assure honourable members that I was loth to rise to speak on the bill . Honourable members supporting the Government refuse to be influenced by the reasoning and pleading of honourable members of this side. We full y realise that they represent the large business interests which during the recent election right campaign did their utmost to enable the composite Government to continue in office and to destroy the Australian Labour party in the process. Anything that honourable members on this side say has little or no effect, and the polite rebuke administered to the Government by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr . Stewart) was full y justified. The Government's refusal to accept any suggestion offered by the Opposition should be deprecated by all fair-minded men. I strongly oppose the bill, and particularly the proposed new section 3 0 J , because it is class legislation directed against the trade union movement of Australia. I I have had considerable experience in trade unionism, and have been connected with a number of strikes. I have held offices in organizations some of which included large sections of Commonwealth public servants. The Government must carry on the game that it began prior to the election, and this panic legislation is neeessary to convince the people that there is still a likelihood of serious indust r i a l disturbances in Australia. I warn the Government that any attempt to put this legislation into effect will be playing with fire, because, so soon as any trade union leaders are arrested or deported for association with strikes, thousands of men will be ready to step into their places, and the effect will be to stiffen the backs of the strikers and the trade unionists. During the election campaign a great deal was said about the frequency of strikes and the general behaviour of trade unionists in Australia. It was also said that members of the Labour party were promoters of strikes, and full y prepared to take part in disloyal actions. The Nationalist party was strongly backed by the capitalistic press, and because of that the Labour party were misrepresented and placed at a great disadvantage. I remember, during the election campaign, ' seeing a cartoon depicting Australian in dustries being strangled by three monsters I - Strikes , Anarchy, and Revolution. That cartoon should have properly shown Australian industries being strangled by i m porters and others, who have little or no interest in Australia, their only concern being the making of huge profits at the expense of our industries and workmen. The Attorney-General, in his second-reading speech, quoted at length from the Workers' Weekly, It is strange that honourable members behind the Government have displayed a greater interest in that journal than have honourable members on this side. We have every reason to suspect that the Workers' Weekly is controlled by the interests that largely contributed to the campaign funds of the Government. The Attorney-General significantly stated that no advertisements appeared in that journal, and, in view of the thousands of its. copies that are distributed, and the tens of thousands that were distributed just before the elections, I ask the Attorney-General why the special Investigation Branch and the members of the Commonwealth Police Force were not instructed to inquire as to the source of the funds of this journal? During the election, honourable members behind the Government were guilty of many utterances which they did not honestly believe. I desire to place on record a statement made by the honourable member for . ""Wentworth (Mr . Marks) at Clovelly, on the 19t.h October last. The question was addressed to him, ""Can you j u s t if y the action of the Bruce Government in' having cruisers! built overseas ? "" The reply was, "" Yes, because the Government knew that if the keels were laid at Cockatoo Island, the communists would prevent them from ever reaching the water."" 'So honourable member would seriously subscribe to such a contention. That statement was deliberately made with a view to in j u r in g the Labour candidate and the Labour party generally. Then, again, we have been charged with disloyalty. The Governor General Lord Stonehaven, on 23rd October, said, "" L o y a l t y to the Crown is nowhere more marked in the whole of the Empire, not excluding the centre of the Empire, than it is in Australia,"" The Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce), for purely party purposes, at that time said, "" Revolutionary forces are at work in Australia to disrupt, our Empire ; I am appealing to the country to give me a mandate to deal with the situation."" I should like to ask whether it was Hi s Majesty's - representative or the Prime Minister who told the truth. This measure is purely camouflage, and introduced with the idea of saving the face of the Government. I shall never admit that to strike is to commit a crime. Why does not the Government display the same earnestness in dealing with market-riggers and the manipulators of cold storage that it shows in introducing al bill with a view to in j u r in g and interfering with the trade unions of Australia? The honourable member for Angas (Mr . Parsons) spoke of the primary produce of the country having been held up. It is lawful for owners to hold up primary produce, but a similar act by the workers is considered a crime. Not many months ago the wealthy pastoralists and the wool-selling brokers of this country decided to withhold their wool from sale because they were not satisfied with the prices they were receiving. That was countenanced by the Government. But if the workers, who have nothing to sell but their labour, refuse to sell it because the return is considered to be unsatisfactory, the Government says that they must be punished, or even deported, for having been associated with a strike. The refusal of the pastoralists and the wool-selling brokers to offer their wool for sale threw hundreds of storemen, trolley and dray men, as well as seamen and wharf labourers, out of employment, but there was no sympathy for those men. If it be wrong for a man to refuse employment, it is equally wrong for another who has a commodity to sell to refuse to offer it for sale. The Go- vernment hastens to introduce a bill to deal with strikers, but it does nothing to interfere with the monopolists and profiteers in our midst. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr . Hughes) shortly after his return from the Old Country during the war period said that he was out to shoot the profiteers. But no shooting took place. We have now another Nationalist Administration, which also allows these enemies of the country to> go free. Many combines are in operation in Australia today. We know that the brick and tile combines have operated to the detriment of the whole of the people of Australia, particularly of the returned soldiers who, having returned from the war, have been made to pay excessive prices for the bricks, tiles, and timber used in the construction of their homes. To the shame of the Government, be it said, that it has not raised a finger to protect them. I ts energies are directed against the' poor workman who gets nothing-, more out. of life than a basic wage-, and can only carry, on from week. to. week on a. wage which, is not sufficient to provide hiswife and. family, with: decent comfort. been said regarding arbitration. honourable member for Wannon Rodgers). said that the industrialists ;could' not have it both ways; that they could not have arbitration and also the right to strike. The workers of this country will never give, up their, right to strike. Labour party and the trade generally do not want strikes; they do all in their power to prevent them. only way to prevent strikes isby removing the cause of strikes. While has done much to minimize industrial disputes, our arbitration system is not perfect. There is too much delay in dealing with the claims before the court; in the meantime, many injustices are suffered by, the workers. It is no wonder that they, become restless, or that at times they take thelaw intotheir own hands, and strike. I* wish 'to refer to the present dispute at Mort's Dock, Sydney, where 1,500 men have been, thrown out of ment because of a dispute the painters and dockers-. The and dockers presented their case to the court, as did the The judjsrehaving read his proposed award, said that if the parties had any suggestions to make, he was prepared to receive and to consider the in. tions were made by the employers', and a return containing some statistics was submitted by the industrial officer for the Commonwealth. The submission of that return caused' the judge-to alter his award' materially. Yet the union had no opportunity to. challenge the figures it contained. As a result, a large section of the painters and dockers was called upon to. accept considerably reduced The present, strike is the result of that procedure. It was wrong for the judge to alter hisproposed award af ten the case had been closed, and without oneof theparties to the case to challenge, or even to investigate, the figures on which the judgment was finally based..

We realized that it was a serious, thing to close down the workshops at that' time, but wehad no alternative. Master retailers* wholesale grocers, and manufacturers are able to increase the prices:, of theircommodities at anytime, and; without reference to any authority; but the workers are not able to obtainincreased payment for their labour unless they first submit to long and tedious arbitration proceedings; or negoemploy- tiations with the-employers. No. force affecting in. the land is capable of stopping the painters manufacturers, employers,, and master reemployers. tailers from raising the price of their commodities at any time; but let a body of workmen attempt to do the same, and it is an entirely different matter. Sugges- The workers cannot be blamed f b r all industrial troubles. It is interestingto note that during the last few months there have been very few disputeson the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, whereas when the Government proposed to dispose of the vessels of that line there was a succession of stoppages and disputes. As a matter of fact, those disputes werepurposely brought about wages. by the pin-pricking attitude of the management of the line and its officers. This attitude was adopted for the purpose of"" causing, such turmoil as would permitting bring the line into dispute and assist the endeavours of those who were trying to dispose of it . But the moment the Government foundthat no acceptable offerscame to hand for the purchase of the. line, industrial disputes on the vessels of the line practically' ceased; it The utterances of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart)' aue very encouraging to honourable members of the Opposition. Evidently there as one honourable member supporting the Government who is not prepared to forsake policy and principle for place and power. No matter what is said by honourable members of the Opposition, the. Government and its supporters have made n p their minds. Reasonable suggestions and amendments put forward from, this side will not be accepted - But Ministers are not in earnest. They are merely seeking to save their faces andcontinue the huge conspiracy entered into during the recent election. If any proclamation is to be issued under these provisions it will most likely he issued on the eve of the next election, when it can be used for party purposes. whatever action is taken under ibis bill it will not intimidate the trade union leaders, because for - every hundred persons imprisoned and deported there will be thousands with sufficient courage to take their places and carry on the work of trade unionism.",63

There has certainly been quietness in the industrial arena since the amending immigration bill was passed last year. If we pass this legislation I hope that it will be made effective. years ago Walsh was fined Â£100, but that sum has never been collected. Again, about twelve months ago, a similar fine was imposed upon him, and it has not I have no desire to see this legislation similarly ineffective. A issue was placed before the people, person and the Government was given a mandate to pass legislation to bring about peace and order in our industrial affairs. Some unionists are, unfortunately, too loyal to their unions. In No r t h Queensland a small number of unionists declared ill a ship black, and when it came south i - the unionists in the different ports would That is a mistaken_sense The Leader of the Opposibusition in the most indignant manner told committee to-night that if the bill was passed and trouble occurred in the industry, the miners as well as workers engaged in the transport unions might be drawn into it . Mr CHA.IU.TON - They will be drawn in if trouble arises.",68
237,Mr GREGORY,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,I ask the honourable member to read the provision.,68
238,Mr CHARLTON,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,I am prepared to its debate it anywhere with the honourable member.,68
239,Mr GEEGOEY,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The proposed new section 3 0 J (2 ) readsAny person who, during the operation of such proclamation, takes part in or continues, or incites to, urges, aids or encourages the taking part in, or continuation of, a lockout or strike(a) in relation to employment in or in connection with the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers in trade or commerce with otlier countries or among the States. What is there in that provision to .justify the honourable member's excitability ? He saw no such risk with similar legislation six months ago; and there is no possibility of it under this bill ; though why the coal-miners should be permitted to hold up industries at their sweet will passes my comprehension. can visualize the awful condition into which our trade and commerce would get if the post office and other Commonwealth activities were prevented from functioning. The Government must have power to deal with of that description. Honourable members .opposite should take stock and see where they stand. The workers of Australia are being urged to seek wealth and power. They do not realise that they are being led by forces that are more unscrupulous and tyrannical than mankind has previously known. There is not the slightest doubt that in recent years there has been a development in the trade union movement in the direction of unscrupulous tyranny. The ordinary trade unionist believes in law and order, and is opposed to the coercive methods of . the industrial agitator. When I went through of my constituency in which workers predominated, I found that a majority of them realized the in j u r y which was being done by a few unscrupulous persons who were using, in a most tyrannical fashion, the power that they possess in an endeavour to destroy the industries of Australia.

241,Mr GREGORY,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"The honourable memthe ber has made a preposterous suggestion. said I realise that it is necessary for honourable members opposite to find some excuse for the overwhelming defeat that they has suffered. I am pleased that this legisments, [4.4] lation has been brought forward. I ""hope that it will be passed and made effective. Mr A . GREEN - Does the honourable member think it can be effective?",69
242,Mr GREGORY,ERROR IN VOTES AN D,"I trust it will be effective. There are some people in this country who, year after year, have defied the law, and in doing so have created enormous losses, and caused destitution and desolation everywhere. Such acts should not be tolerated. It is our duty to pass effective legislation in order to control those who say that they will not obey the laws of the land. If they will not do so they should be placed in jail or sent out of the country. I would not have spoken but for the speech of the One honourable member for Wimmera (Mr . Stewart), and I now wish to make it clear that the act passed last year, of which the country approved on the occasion of the recent appeal to the electors, is almost identical with the measure now matters before the committee. I endorse the action of the Government in bringing the bill forward, and hope that it will be passed so that we shall have more industrial peace than we have had in the past. Progress reported.
