Realizing that atmospheric conditions might affect the ringing of the garden bell from time to time, I have structed the engineer to keep a careful note of the condition of the bell, and to supply a bell of stronger timbre than that in use at present.",11

3,Mr HIGGS,PARLIAME N TARY,"I wish to eay that I am entirely responsible for the removal of the mace and the placing of it under a seat in this chamber. I assure you that in removing the mace I had no intention of trying to lower the prestige of your position, or of insulting you or any member of the House. Acting in a spirit of frivolity , which I admit is quite out of place in a serious-minded politician, I removed the mace. Perhaps I have not sumcient respect for the mace. These outward forms and ceremonies do not appeal to me as'they do to honourable members who come Honorable MEMBERS - Do not spoil it .",11

Mr JOSE PH COOK-The Government have considered this matter very in - carefully during the interval between yesterday's sitting and this morning, have arrived at the conclusion sliould be investigated by the House it self. One reason for an inquiry removed, but there remain other serious matters. When there is taken from the chamber a book which is peculiarly the property of the Speaker, who is the seri vant of the House, the discharge of his duties are interfered with in a very serious way, and that can never be f the benefit of the House as a whole. There is also the interference with the property of the House, an investigation into which I think necessary. I know of no better tribunal for the making of an investigation than a Committee of the House, composed of an equal number of members selected from each side. The in vestigation' of such a body would clear the matter up, or, at any rate, would finalize it by a report to the House. further comment, I ask leave to propose the following motion: That a Select Com-nitt'ee be appointed quire into and report upon the improper removal from the chamber of Mr Speaker's copy of May's Parliamentary Practice, Mr Speaker's notes in connection therewith, and the abstraction of such notes, the interthat ference with the keys of certain doors chamber and precincts, and other disorderly proceedings; such Committee to consist Archibald, Mr Charlton, Mr Sampson, and Mr Bruce Smith, with power to send for persons, papers, and records, to report evidence from time to time, and to have leave to sit during the sittings of the House.

Mr K ING O ' MALLEY - In the light of the splendid report which I read Without yesterday, would it be possible for the Postmaster-General to put Mr Gasman, of Chicago, into the Postal Department to inof Australia at a reasonable salary?",12
15,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Personally , I would like to see Mr Gasman come to with Australia, and I am inclined to think he would be willing to come, but it in the is only fair thab I should consult my colleagues before making an important of Mr arrangement like that.  the notions and Canadian reforms which the Postmaster-General intends to bring into use in Australia, has he noticed that there no letter deliveries for towns where the inhabitants are less than 5,000 in for the United States of America and 10,000 in Canada, and does he think that these locknotions will suit Australia today?",12
16,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Parliament and the Postmasters-General have always endeavoured to give the greatest facilities for the delivery of letters throughout Australia. They have not drawn any distinction as to the size of the towns, and wherever the delivery of letters can carried out it is done in the country",12
17,Mr BAMFORD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Quer y 1,12
18,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"My view is to the same principle, and to extend it as far as we possibly can, but the question pub by the honourable member for Darwin dealt with a mechanical gentleman. Mr Gasman is the man who has designed all the mechanical appliances in use in the Chicago Post Office. There of is a great saving of labour and of the health of the people by the use of this class of machinery. As regards the area of land, the Chicago Post Office, like the Sydney and Melbourne Post Offices, is cramped, and it bas now been discovered that it can be managed by floors just as easily as if it was all on the ground itself. We can apply these principles to our two big post offices at least. COMMONWEALTH BA NK BILL .

22,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Some time ago estimated? there was a suggestion for a reciprocal arrangement between New Zealand and Australia as regards the payment of oldmatter age pensions. Has the present Ministry considered the matter at all ?,13
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It has been considered quite a number of times. As far as I can recollect, the arrangement cleaning seemed to be a one-sided one. That is the emphatic opinion of Mr Knibbs, as far as the actuarial side of the matter goes, and that is why the matter has not been submitted to the House before now. POSTA LCONFERENCE .",13

25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I would like to answer this question. I hope it may be possible for a Minister to attend the conference. It is of the utmost importance, I think, that some one with the requisite authority and status should be at all the conferences that take place from time to time. They are international in character, and, therefore, it is of the utmost Treasconsequence that our voice should be heard when the international sifting of I o r hope that we shall be in a position to see that the Government is represented by a Minister at the Madrid Conference. INFANTRY BATTALIONS.",13
26,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. As asked on the fifteenth day of May, what amount per head of actual strength did 55th, 56th, 63rd, and 64th Infantry Battalion each receive for their corps funds for the the years 1912-1913 and 1913-1914? 2. Is there any reason why the Defence omitted this answer to the queso r the tions when previously asked? 3. Does not the system of payment by approved establishment, and not by actual not strength, lead to anomalies? 4. Who fixes the approved establishment, and what is the reason for the marked differin the four corps between the estimated establishment and the actual strength? 5. Will any steps be taken to pay extra allowance to these corps which, tlirougli faulty estimates of their approved establishment, received less than weaker corps which were over",13
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"To make the clear, it is necessary, before replying seriatim to the questions, to make a brief statementThere are certain expenses - incidental to the maintenance of a militia corps, such as and care of arms, &c, and to meet this expenditure commanding officers are credited each year with an allowance termed Corps Contingent Allowance, which they hold practically in trust for the Government, and which they are only permitted to expend for certain prescribed purposes. This allowance for the years 1912-1913 and 1913-1914 was paid on the basis of 7s. 6d. per head of the authorized establishment. The amount is in accordance with the regulations, which also that, under special circumstances, it be increased to a sum not exceeding 10s. The answers to the questions are as follow: 1. 55th InfantryYear 1012-1013 .. .. Year 1913-1914 .. .. 56th InfantryYear 1912-1913 .. .. Year 1913-1914 .. .. C3rd InfantryYear 1912-1913 .. .. Year 1913-1914 .. .. 64th InfantryYear 1912-1913 .. .. Year 1913-1914 .. .. 2. It was explained that the payments were not made on the basis of "" Act u a l Strengths,"" but were made on the basis of 7s. 6d. per bead of the approved establishment, and that this procedure was in accordance with the regulations, and had been followed for a number of years. 3. It is considered that the present system of payment by approved establishments is one which is calculated to give greater all-round satisfaction, and to lead to fewer anomalies than would a system of payment by "" Actual Strengths,"" which obviously fluctuates considerably. 4. The approved establishment is fixed by the Minister, on the recommendation of the Adjutant-General. - The reason for the marked difference in the corps referred to between the estimated establishment and the actual strength is due :(a) to a larger number of Senior Cadets having been declared unfit upon medical examination than was estimated. (6) to the fact that, in the 55th and 56th Infantry, there were very few voluntarily enlisted men, whereas in the 63rd and 64th Infantry there was ;""' a large number, and more of these became time-expired or otherwise retired from the forces than was estimated. After the 30th June next the differences will not be so great, as by that date there will be but few voluntarily enlisted men. 5. The regulations relating to Corps Contingent Allowance prescribe that:"" In the case of units having many detachments, or for other reasons specially recommended by the M i l it a r y Board, such allowance may be increased to a sum not exceeding 10s. per head, subject to the necessity for sueh payment being proved to the satisfaction of the Minister."" It is open to any commanding oflicer to submit representations for an increased allowance under this regulation. CADET OFFICERS: REFUNDS.",13

Whether it is true that senior cadets who have purchased their own uniforms have been Not formed. kept waiting for months for a refund of the 7s. 6.27d. purchase money? 2. Will the Minister be good enough to expedite the settlement of all such claims for re7s. 0.92d. funds? 7s. 9.68d. Mr. JOSEPH COOK - This evidently refers to cadet officers w h o are p e r m it t e d 8s. 5.03d. to purchase the i r o w n u n i for m s , and 10s. 0.34d. o b t a in r e f u n d of cost from the D e p a r t m e n t . The answer to the questions is 9s. 10.25d. l is . 10.09d. 1 and 2. So far as is known at Headquarters there are no cases of cadet officers who have been kept waiting for months for a refund of the cost of their uniform. If the honourable member can furnish me with specific cases the Minister of Defence will have inquiries made, and if claims are in accordance with the regulations instructions will be given that they are at once to be adjusted. MILITARY OFFICERS. SENIORITY OF RANK .",14
29,Mr DANKEL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice As it is rumoured that by a recent decision of the M i l it a r y Board it is intended that in future-despit e the fact of difference in training for special work-officer s of all branches of the Permanent Force shall be considered as a whole in deciding the seniority of rank for promotion purposes, docs the Minister not think that any alteration of the method which keeps the permanent and administrative and instructional staffs separate in seniority, as they are separate in training, will be inimical to the interests of Universal Militar y Training in Australia?",14
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answer to the question is It has been decided that graduates from the Royal M i l it a r y College, on appointment to commissioned rank in the Permanent M i l it a r y Forces, shall bo borne on one list for promotion. This decision does not, however, apply to officers already serving as such in the Permanent M i l it a r y Forces. It is not considered that the procedure in question will be inimical to the interests of universal military training in Australia. LAND VALUES.  upon notice Whether any satisfactory arrangement bas been made between the Commonwealth, States, and Local Government Boards so as to arrive at uniformity in making land values for taxation purposes, and, at the same time, remove the alleged present unjust anomalies?",14
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answer to the question isThe late Conference of Premiers passed the following resolution, with which the Commonwealth Government arc inaccord:"" Resolved - That this Conference affirms the desirability of uniform valuations for Commonwealth and State purposes being adopted as early as practicable, and that the necessary legislative or administrative steps in that direction be taken by the States."" The New South Wales Government have already drafted a Bill for this purpose, and the terms of it are being considered by the Government. PILFERING OF LETTERS.",15
32,Mr BRENNAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Postmasterwatched General, upon notice I. Is he aware that pilfering from letter lars in the metropolitan area is a matter of frequent occurrence? 2. Is there not a larger number of complaints in respect of non-delivery of mailed letters under consideration in the Postal Department at present than at any time previously? 3. What, if anything, does the Minister pose to do about it?",15
33,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answers to the questions are1 and 2. I am not aware that such is the case. As a matter of fact, I do not think there is much pilfering. 3. Inquiries are being made in the matter. TEMPLE OF PEACE.",15
34,Mr HANNAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Minister E x t e r n a l ' A f fair s , upon notice I. Have the Government decided to present a writing-table and silver inkstand to the Temple of Peace at The Hague? 2. Have the writing-table and inkstand been procured ? 3. If so, who were the manufacturers of the writing-table and inkstand? 4. When were the orders given for their manufacture, and when were the articles completed? 5. Have they yet been despatched?",15
35,Mr GLYNN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answers to the questions are1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. Both these articles were designed by Messrs. Butler and Bradshaw, architects, of Melbourne, to the order of the A r t Advisory Board of the Historical Memorials Committee. The table was manufactured by Messrs. son and Moffat, of Melbourne, and the inkstand by Mr James White, sculptor, of Melbourne. 4. The matter was placed in the hands of the Advisory Board in May, 1913; the articles were completed about a month ago. 5. Yes. THE HIGH COMMISSIONER.",15
36,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"W it h regar d to quest i o n No . 9 on the notice-paper, I understand that the honourable member for M e l bourne P o r t s takes the responsibility for the accuracy of the report ?",15
37,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I take the responsibility for the accuracy of the report , and ask the P r i m e Minister the question s t and i ng in m y name1. Has he read the following speech attri buted to Sir George Reid, High Commissioner for the Commonwealth in London, by the London Daily Telegraph, viz.:-""The startling developments in connection with the Bill to give a measure of Home Rule to Ireland are with grave concern in Australia. The British Empire, as we are often told, comprises pilone-fifth of the earth's surface. On it onel if t h of the human race are assembled. In only one part of that vast possession is there at the present time any risk of the horrors of civil war. Is this awful danger in any place inhabited by one of the 370,000,000 of the coloured subjects of the King? Is it in any proof the self-governing Dominions? No. The singular and discreditable fact is that the scene of this threatened catastrophe-this gambling with the peace and prestige, if not the integrity of the Empire-is in the central citadel of our Imperial power, and amongst the wisest and greatest of the King's counsellors. Australians, themselves prepared to risk their lives in defence of the Empire, do seem to have a right in common with the rest of His Majesty's subjects abroad, to offer a respectful but very solemn remonstrance, and to demand that British statesmen shall do something of better than to allow this disastrous explosion to occur. If a way out cannot be found at once, surely at least some temporary compromise can be agreed upon to postpone the possibility of a bloody outbreak, and secure that better chance of a peaceful issue which added experience and further deliberation in a calm atmosphere would undoubtedly afford? 2. If so, does he intend to ask the High Commissioner for an explanation as to his action?",15
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I haye o n l y h a d time to glance over t h is question, and I h a r d l y think that an y good purpose w o u l d be served by the course suggested.",15
39,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I agree with the h o n orable gentleman. PAPERS.

40,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Capricornia) [10.52] I have no doubt that we shall be charged with obstructing the passage of this measure, but the truth is that we have little opportunity nowadays to obstruct legislation. There was a time when honourable members were permitted to speak for nine hours at a stretch, and even longer. That, no doubt, is to some a horrid memory, but at the present time there can be very little of the character of what used to be known as obstruction since, on a motion of this kind, an honourable member is not permitted to speak for more than an hour and five minutes. I regret that this Bill has not been amended-that it agrees word for word with the Bill that we passed last session. It must be recognised that several important amendments ought to have been made. For instance, clause 2 refers to preference in relation to any employment "" by the Commonwealth."" That is very loose drafting. The Acts Interpretation Act provides that "" Commonwealth"" means ""the Commonwealth of Australia,"" so that the clause provides that no preference or discrimination shall be made for or against any person in relation to any employment "" by the Commonwealth of Australia."" Why were the words "" Commonwealth Public Service"" not employed? Undoubtedly the explanation is that the sole object of the Government, in trying to pass this Bill, is to bring about an early double dissolution. Is that a worthy aim? When the Prime Minister took office, no doubt he assured the Governor General that he would be able to carry on the government of the country. If he finds himself unable to do so he ought to resign. He should not seek to use the forms of Parliament in this way.  the Labour party carry on better than the Liberal party?",16
41,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Possibl y not; but, in that event, the House in due time would be exhausted, and an election would follow in the usual way. I am sorry that there does not appear in this Bill a clause providing that no preference or discrimination shall be made for or against any person in relation to any employment in the Commonwealth Service on account of his membership or non-membership of any association of attorneys, solicitors, barristers, architects, surveyors, surgeons or physicians.",16
42,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They do not seek employment; they are sought out.,16
43,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My regret at this omission is not due to any objection on my part to ""the associations existing today among the professional classes. I agree with the Attorney-General when he says, "" I believe in unionism in every form."" At some time in our history, if we are to straighten out the discrepancies existing on our planet, there will be a union or association in connection with almost every occupation, or at all events, unions covering a series of occupations. The honourable member for Wilmot has just said that barristers, architects, and other professional men do not apply for employment. Does he not know that architects do apply?",16
44,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I was referring to the lawyers.,16
45,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If barristers and solicitors do not apply for employment, that is because of the perfection of their organization. I am aware, of course, that if a man wishes to retain the services of a barrister, he must do so through a solicitor. A barrister is not supposed to know anything about fees. With money, the root of all evil, he is presumed to have no concern. The Attorney-General smiles, because he knows that I am now touching upon a peculiar aspect of the profession of the law. Sordid considerations are not supposed to trouble a barrister, and he would be insulted if a man said to him, "" I wish to pay you fifty guineas to take up my case."" A barrister so addressed would say, "" How dare you speak to me in this manner. Y o u must consult a solicitor, who will brief me to appear for you, and will possibly mark upon the brief the fee which you desire to pay me.""",16
46,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will the honourable member connect his remarks with the third reading of this Bill?,17
47,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am tryin g to show that all professions should be brought within the scope of this Bill , if , as the Attorney General assured me, it is to apply to the professional as well as the industrial classes. When I asked, "" Why does not this Bill apply to the professional classes?"" he said, "" It does; we are an organization; it applies to us."" I then pointed out that the Bill declared that preference should not be given by any officer of the Commonwealth to a member of a political or industrial organization. The Attorney-General's answer was, "" Is that what it says?"" At that time, evidently he had forgotten that the word "" in d u s t r i a l "" appeared before the word "" association."" the point occurred to fore introducing the Bill , he would, perhaps, have omitted "" industrial,"" so that the Bill would have applied to associations of every kind. B ut since that word appeared in the original Bill , which was' closured through this House, and rejected by the Senate, the honourable gentleman's whole would be frustrated if he now allowed a single amendment to be made, because it would not then be the same Bill . In that case, the Senate would reject it , and it would have to be again brought before this Chamber for the At torney-General to attain his end.",17
48,Colonel RYRIE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Opposition tried it on.,17
49,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We endeavoured to i m prove the Bill . We have been told by the Prime Minister what is the object of the measure. The Attorney-General has admitted that, at the present time, it is the law that no preference shall be granted to unionists. So far as the M in istry are concerned, that law is like the laws of the Medes and Persians, in that they will not depart from it . They have thus proved by their own statements that this Bill is superfluous from the standpoint of the law; but it is all-important from that of the intentions of the Attorney-General and his colleagues. The Prime Minister stated that it is the in tention of the Government to force the Bill through both Houses for the purpose of securing a double dissolution. Prom an Argus report, published on 10th A p r i l last, I gather that the Attorney General, in speaking at Warrnambool, saidThe duty of the Ministry was to try and meet the trouble as it now existed. The only weapon which the Constitution gave was the creation of conditions under which both Houses might be compelled to appear before their electors. That was the main object in view now. During last session the Ministry passed two test measures. The first step to obtain a double dissolution had been taken. The duty of the Ministry was now to complete the task-to force the Bills if possible through the House of Representatives a second time. If the Senate again rejected it the Ministry could go to the Governor General and ask him to exercise his prerogative in submitting the differences of the Houses to the people. Throughout the past eight or nine months he seems to have regarded it as certain that the Government will secure' Had a double dissolution. I want to put behim be- fore the House and the country the position that the Government are in error the word when they say that they are powerless to enact legislation. They proved conclusively by their 'actions last week that they are not powerless. I propose to show that their legislation has not been obstructed. Whatever legislation has purpose been introduced by them which was in the best interests of the people has been approved, both by the Senate and by this Chamber. Reference to the Commonwealth Gazette of 3rd January will show that last session, apart from a number of Supply Bills, we passed "" an Act to provide for the acceptance of Norfolk Island as a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth and for the government thereof,"" "" an Act to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act i 1911-12,"" "" an Act to amend the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1902-11 in relation to eligibility for appointment to the Public Service of the Commonwealth by reason of State service,"" "" an Act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue a sum for the purchase of land for defence purposes,"" "" an Act to provide for a Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts,"" "" an Act to provide for the establishment of a Parliamentary Standing Committee on public works and for other purposes,"" "" an Act to provide for the construction of a railway in the Northern Territory from Pine Creek to the Katherine River, the appointment of officers, the making of charges, and the appropriation of money in connection with such railway,"" "" an Act to amend the Post and Telegraph Act 1901-12 and the Post and Telegraph Rates Act 1902-11,"" and "" an Act to authorize the raising and expending of the sum of Two million seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds for certain purposes.""",17
50,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order ! The honourable member is travelling over a very wide field, which seems to me entirely foreign to the purpose of this Bill .",18
51,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am not arguing whether these measures ought to have been passed or not. I merely mention them to show that the claim of the Government to a double dissolution on the ground that we have obstructed their legislation has no foundation in fact.,18
52,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! I do not see that that has anything to do with the third reading of this Bill .,18
53,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Is it not recognised that the Bill before us is a "" t e s t "" Bill ? The Attorney-General has admitted that it is already the law that no preference shall be granted to unionists in Government employment.",18
54,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It will be necessary for the honourable member to connect his remarks with the motion for the t h i r d reading of the Bill .,18
55,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"W it h all due respect, I claim that I am doing that when I show that the contention of the Government that we have obstructed ""legislation is destitute of all foundation. Surely, as an Opposition, we are entitled to offer some criticism of measures which the Government bring forward ? They should not' expect their Bills to be passed without any consideration whatever. I claim that all the discussion which has taken place, and which has led up to this crisis, has been necessary in the public interest.",18
56,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Whil e the honourable member will be perfectly in order in making a passing reference to other measures, he will not be in order in entering into details or debating those measures. He must connect his remarks with the motion before the Chair.",18
57,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I shall not enter into details concerning the measures that we passed last session. Although the Attorney-General has declared that he is in favour of unionism in every form, I cannot see any action of his which supports his professions.",18
58,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I thought that he was opposed to all unions.,18
59,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No . He says that hb is in favour of unionism in every form. We are educating the honourable gentleman. If I might use an expression which originated with the honourable member for Darwin, this is a Parliament which destroys reputations; and I venture to think that it is a means of educating some who have hitherto been very conservative. If the Attorney-General is now in favour of unionism in every form, and knows anything of the subject, he must be aware that there are a number of misguided or uninformed people who do not know the value of such organization. There are selfish people quite prepared to reap the advantages of unionism without paying towards the Organization which has given them their improved conditions. Let me give an illustration. Ac one time. I was in the position of secretary of the Typographical Association in Sydney, and we succeeded in increasing the membership from 400 to over 1,000. There were, however, some men who, as soon as they obtained situations in the Government Printing-office, and thought, that they had positions for life, discontinued their payment of 9d. a week. Is there any just-minded man who would contend that these men, reaping advantages gained for them by the association, should be placed on the same footing as those who were willing to continue their subscriptions? Let me give an instance of the value of preference to unionists. At one time, in Sydney, non-unionists were permitted to work in certain printing offices; but the unions became strong, and were sympathized with to such an extent that the overseers in those offices, when a man applied for employment, asked whether he was or was not a member of the Typographical Association, and, if he was not, he was not allowed to start. I am now speaking of the Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Morning Herald offices. Both those offices, and also the offices of the Argus and the Age, are now conducted upon unionist principles. No non-unionist compositor could possibly get into any of these offices; and I doubt whether any journalist who is not a member of the Journalists' Association would be given a position; at least, I hope not.",18
60,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The same may be said of the Government Printing-office.,19
61,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I believe that is so. Why do the Argus and the Age support the Government campaign against preference to unionists? If there were no Typographical Association, the trade of a compositor would not be worth following. I call it a trade, but there was a time when it was deemed to be a profession, and any one who followed it was, in consequence, entitled to wear a sword. The Government, knowing the advantages of unionism, and the influence that preference to unionists has in impelling men to join an association-knowin g what unionism has done for civilization-would , if they acted up to their professions of Liberalism, encourage preference. should like to call to my aid some observations of the Prime"" Minister. quote speeches of the honourable gentleman, from 1891 to 1894, in regard to which some people think there ought to be a political statute of limitations; but the quotation I desire to read is more recent. The Prime Minister said on that occasionTlie honourable member for Newcastle referred to me as an old-time' secretary of a trade union. The honourable member is quite right. When I was secretary to a union we always insisted on preference to unionists, and in a very summary fashion.",19
62,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What was the union?,19
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Coal-miners' Union. Wc had no difficulty in doing that, and I am free to tell the honourable member that if I were in the same position today I should do the same again. Purther on, in reply to a question as to how long he was secretary, he saidPor some years. If I were in that position again I should adopt the same attitude. I have no sort of sympathy with the man wbo will work alongside another man, and see that other paying every week of his life into an organization to protect his rights, and to maintain his position, whilst he himself is skulking, and deriving the benefit for which the other is paying and working. I have no sort of sympathy with that kind of tiling. The merest hint that an employer w i ll have no non-unionist in his employ has the effect of inducing a great number of men, who would otherwise object to pay the subscription to join unions, and so the merest indication that the Government is against preference will induce numbers to stay outside, and to that extent render unionism weaker and of less importance. It has further been contended that preference to unionists in Government employ will lead to the strengthening of the Labour party; and that is the sole fear of honourable members opposite. They have an idea that, because a man becomes a unionist, and because a portion of his money is, in certain cases, used to publish a paper for the dissemination of Labour political views, and sometimes to assist in paying the expenses of Labour candidates",19
64,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is the honourable member aware that the secretary of the Typographical Association in Sydney is on the committee of the honourable member for North Sydney?,19
65,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was not aware of that, but it supports my view that it does not by any means follow that a man will vote I for a Labour candidate simply because he himself is a member of a trade or labour We union. The secrecy of the ballot will prevent any harm arising from preference to unionists. However, I do not think that the secretary of the Sydney association is on the committee of the honourable member for North Sydney.",19
66,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That secretary is a Liberal.,19
67,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Is that a fact? I know that a former member of the Board of Management of the Typographical Association in Sydney worked for Mr Wilson as against the present member for East Sydney. It will be seen, therefore, that membership of a trade union is no guarantee of votes for the Labour candidates. I wish this fact were thoroughly realized, because, in Sydney, at all the Federal elections, especially for the Senate, Labour candidates are opposed by what are known as Labour Socialists, and these are supported by many unionists in West Sydney, East Sydney, and other constituencies.",19
68,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I remind the honourable member that he is now discussing the general question of unionism, and not preference to unionists in Government employment.",19
69,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Minister s and their followers fear that if preference be given in Government employment, it will mean an accession of strength to the Labour party in Australia, and I am endeavouring to show that such a result does not necessarily follow. Unless the Labour party, by its programme and its enthusiasm, can commend itself to the majority of the people, it must continue in the cold shades of opposition. Another incident that shows that the fears of honourable members opposite are groundless is the statement made by Mr W. Rosser, President of the city branch of the Railway ""Workers and General Labourers' Association of New South Wales, who referred in approving terms to the action of the Prime Minister in settling at Canberra, in a sympathetic mood, a strike which he could not get the Labour Government, when in office, to settle. There is the case of the president of a union attacking this party, and if any inference can be drawn from his remarks, it is that he will be found at the next election supporting the Liberal party. How then can it be said that to give preference to unionists in Government employment will have the effect of inducing people to vote for the Labour party or to subscribe to its platform? I suppose it is not of much use to try to induce honourable members to vote against the third reading, because their minds are made up. The incidents of the past week indicate that it is the intention of the Government to use all the constitutional forms of the House, even to the extent of exhausting honourable members physically and mentally, to force their legislation through. The Prime Minister said at Wangaratta, on 7th AugustWc could do with a little more peace in this troubled land of ours. No one regrets more than 1 do to see the unsettled state of the people and the perpetual state of industrial war, which never .seems to have an end. This land always ought to be vibrating with optimistic fervour, but in this land we have a state of affairs, industrially and otherwise, is very far from being what it ought to be. I hope most sincerely that we may do something to heal the breach between the various parties in this country, so that wo may together tackle those national problems that are overdue for settlement. That is his appeal for industrial peace in the community, but how does he propose to bring it about? By introducing a Bill which all his supporters admit is of no value or necessity, and forcing it through both Houses in order to bring about a general election. Wc are informed by the Liberal Whip that the deliberate intention of Ministers when they took [60] "" office was to bring about a double dissolution; that he did not know when it would come, but that it would come some time this year. We have no right to spend our time considering the third reading of a Bill of this character, when so many other important measures might be brought before us. We have no right to take such a Bill to His Majesty's representative, and ask him to send the two Houses to the country on it, putting the country to the enormous expense that a general election involves, and dislocating the commercial and trading community. The election that they say will follow the rejection of this Bill will cause a very great disturbance of trade. Incidentally, it will put honourable members to a great deal of inconvenience. It is 1,500 miles to Rockhampton, the heart of my constituency, and that is only a circumstance to the travelling I shall have to do if a double dissolution takes place.",19
70,Mr AGAR WYNNE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Bette r have an elective Ministry.,20
71,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am glad to find that the Postmaster-General is in favour of elective Ministries.,20
72,Mr AGAR WYNNE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am, and always have been.",20
73,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I believe it would be a happy issue out of a number of our political afflictions, and shall do my best to induce our supporters to place that reform upon our programme. We have no right to pass the third reading of the Bill if it is going to have the result that honourable members have said it will have. The Government have no right to waste the time of the House over it, because they are quite wrong in their publiclyexpressed opinion that they are sure tp get a double dissolution. They seem to think that His Majesty's representative that has no power at all. Has he no prerogative? The Constitution provides that if a Bill is passed by one House, and the other House fails twice to pass it, or passes it twice with amendments with which the House of Representatives does not agree, theGovernorGeneral "" m a y "" dissolve both Houses. That gives the Governor General the prerogative. The Attorney-General at St. Kilda said that the Liberal party need not bother about that matter, but I submit that they ought to bother about it. They have no right to go about the country making such statements as "" We are going to have a double dissolution,"" or "" Select your candidates, and we will make all the arrangements to have a - double dissolution this year."" They have no right to make statements of that kind - concerning a certain high personage.",20
74,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why have you been selecting your candidates?,21
75,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Because honourable members have set a very bad example which they had no right to set. I have the strongest objections to the passage of the third reading of the Bill , because we could occupy our time very much more profitably in the interests of the community; and if a double dissolution should happen to take place, if the Government can persuade the Governor General that they are unable to do any business, we have no reason to suppose that the same thing may not happen next year. Therefore we should hesitate before we try to lay down a precedent that will affect future Governors-General and future Parliaments. If a double dissolution should follow the rejection by the Senate of this flimsy measure, which is not necessary, and which will do nothing, bunch. then if any other party should later on - approach the Governor General and ask for a double dissolution on similar grounds they will naturally expect to get it . The proposal of the Attorney-General and Ministers is a very wrongful and unworthy attack on the working classes of Australia. The Attorney-General and his friends seem to b.e unable to realise what the working classes are doing for Australia. Who bear the most difficult burdens or do the most uncongenial work ?",21
76,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Who take the most risks and suffer most from accidents and loss of life?,21
77,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes ; who go into - the coal mines to dig out the coal that f nishes the Attorney-General and his friends, and us all,' with the warmth we require? Take the record of men who have gone into coal mines in Australia - and the number who have been killed by falls pf earth or from suffocation by damp or deleterious gases. Who are the men that take these risks? They are mostly unionists, against whom the Bill seems be directed. Take the cushions on which we sit on in this chamber, which' are necessarily soft to enable us to carry on our work when sitting for such long periods. Who have upholstered them? Not the architects, the surveyors, the barristers, or the solicitors. I could go through the whole gamut of men who might be employed on a building of this kind-the labourers, who dig the trenches, the stone masons, the plasterers, the carpenters, the plumbers, the painters and decorators, and the hundred and one odd men who would be employed. They are wage-earners, mostly unionists, against whom the Bill is directed. Who built the ships that took us across the ocean to the Old Country at Coronation time?",21
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Thes e details are rather irrelevant.,21
79,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I connect them in this way. At some time or other we shall probably build ships - If the Commonwealth ever enters into the steam-ship business-whic h will be necessary if it is to defeat certain combinations-ship builders must be employed, and to my mind it will be necessary to give employment to unionist shipbuilders. I am trying to impress Ministers, only one of whom is in the chamber.",21
80,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And he is the best of the,21
81,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It would be rather harsh to say that he is the best of a bad lot, but I believe that the Minister of External Affairs, if he had his way, would not be associated with a Bill of this character. He recognises the advantages that come from belonging to a union. We give employment to union barristers. Let us throw open the employment that can be found in the Department of the Attorney General to a number of non-union barristers, permitted to charge their clients as low a fee as they like. What would happen? Would honourable members at present in the profession,. and members of the Bar Council, be able to charge the u r - fees that they do charge? I venture to say they would not. I do not wish to incur the displeasure of the Chair by going over the whole ground of industrial activity, but I would like to say that in our Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong, we shall be employing union labour, I trust, and I would like to see the overseer at those mills instructed to employ to unionists in preference to non-unionists, all other things being equal. The Attorney-General and his followers in bringing in a Bill of this character do not realise what the working classes are doing for Australia. Should not the shearer who shears the wool, which will afterwards be sent down to the Commonwealth WoolPowers len Mills be considered? thing be done which will disadvantage him and help to keep down his wages below what is a reasonable rate ? mit that the Bill will have that eflect The Government should even at this 6tage withdraw the Bill rather than do anytheir thing calculated to weaken the trades and labour unions of Australia, and to troducing that extent retard the progress of civilizanot tion. I am sorry that the Bill does not contain a clause to this effectThis Act shall not apply to any officer Couunonwealth Public Service who gives prethe ference to members of organizations or ciations affecting which the President Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court has directed that, for the prevention settlement of an industrial dispute, or for maintenance of industrial peace, or for welfare of society, preference shall be given. If the Attorney-General and his supdirected porters consider such a Bill necessary they should surely be prepared to make an exception in the case of preference dustrial occupations. given on the lines indicated here. This House agreed years ago that it was i the interests of peace and order in the but the question was an absurd one. Commonwealth that there should be a law embodying that provision, and that President of the Arbitration Court should, where he thought it advisable, be at material substance. liberty to give preference to unionists the good and welfare of society. What is to prevent a non-union carpenter seekoccupation. ing employment in the Commonwealth to Service joining the Amalgamated Carsoon penters and Joiners Union, and so resary, moving any difficulty in the way of appointment ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then would be collective bargaining.",21
82,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There was a time when men refused to recognise the benefits of collective bargaining, but that day has gone past. I am extremely sorry bhat a third reading of this Bill. provision such as I have mentioned does posed it at every stage, sincerely not find a place in the Bill . Iiave less difficulty in accepting the Bill so. if it contained such a clause, as it would give some feeling of security if the bers of unions seeking employment in the Commonwealth Service could approach the as the Attorney-General President of the Arbitration Court, and ask him whether they were entitled to obstruction to the measure. preference. It does not always follow that the President of the Court will make an award of preference when he is asked in opposition to the measure. to do so. Honourable members are aware that only the other day Mr Justice [60]- 2 in a certain case refused to make: Should anyan award of preference. ",22
83,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not allowed to go. I subinto those details. Honourable members. - opposite who claim to be Liberals will have very great difficulty in explaining support of this Bill to their constituents. The Attorney-General, in in the Bill in its present form, did display the impartiality which he claims to be one of his chief virtues. It would be a very different Bill if it in of the cluded barristers and other members of legal profession, surveyors, architects, assoand other professional men. If the honof the orable gentleman had included conor tractors, as suggested by the honourable the member for Cook, the Bill would have the appeared to be more even-handed in its object, but in its present form it is against the interests of the great working classes of Australia. I use the term to refer to people engaged in in The Attorney General asked whether barristers were not n members of an industrial organization, I use the term industrial classes to indicate the the huge body of manual workers who are engaged in producing something of I do not contend for that a great deal of mental work is not necessary in connection with nearly every If honourable members were try their hands at the work they would find that considerable skill is neceseven in the occupation of the men his whom we sometimes see on country roadsides cracking stones.

I enter a final protest against tha I have opbe1 should lieving that it was my sacred duty to do I know very well that there are some people whose opinions I respect and memvalue, who think that we should haveallowed this Bill to go through as' quickly desired. I contend that there has been no unnecessary We are entitled to use the forms of the House to speak so long as we have anything to say I am aware that the press does a very great deal in educating the public, but Hansard also plays an important part in that work. We often laugh at Hansard, and say that it is an infliction to have to read it , hut if I may be pardoned for referring to myself, I have here a telegram from a man asking that he should be sent a copy of Hansard containing a certain speech made - This proves that there people in Australia who take keen and intelligent interest in Hansard. And those people are mostly to be found out in the back-blocks of this country, in the "" Never Never,"" where they get a mail only once a month, or once in three months. In mining camps and shearing sheds I have been surprised to find that the men there are better acquainted with the course of political events than are hundreds of men whom one meets in the big towns.",22
84,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why does that surprise y o u !,23
85,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Perhaps it is not a matter for surprise when one remembers the picture shows, libraries, and other forms of recreation which the people in the cities are able to enjoy.",23
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I cannot connect the honourable member's remarks with the Bill .,23
87,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am trying to excuse myself, if any excuse be necessary, for speaking at length on this stage of the Bill . I realise at once that when a man commences to excuse himself he accuses himself. But in excusing myself for making lengthy observations on this measure, - I desire to say that in my opinion it is necessary to convey, through Hansard, to people in the back-blocks the reasons why we oppose this measure, why we refuse to allow it to go through the House with lightning rapidity, and why we think it should not be made the basis of an appeal to His Excellency the Governor General for a double dissolution.",23

I believe we are under no difficulty whatever. At any rate [ apprehend no difficulty about it , because one of the planks I advocated at every meeting I addressed during the last election campaign was that no preference should be given to unionists in the carrying out of public works or services, as the funds for such works are provided by all classes of the people, and that therefore employment should be open to all.",23
89,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Do you apply ' that argument to contractors as well ! last year. Mr STUMM - Yes . I apply it all are some round, to all public works and services. a The position of the private contractor is quite different. He can do what he pleases with his own. He has the right to select any man he pleases, provided always that he pays the standard rate of wages. He is obliged to do that, or he cannot get the work done. But for unionists to say that they shall have preference in Government work, for which the funds are provided by all classes of people, is utterly wrong. They might just as well say that another man has a righ t to dictate what my religion shall be.",23
90,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why do they not give Packer's union a show on the Kalgoorlie Port Augusta railway !,23
91,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not trouble the House often, and the honourable member might allow me to state my parable in my own way. The position of honourable members in regard to preference to unionists is indefensible. They say that this ±>m is practically a provision that preference shall be given to non-unionists, because unionists will not work alongside non-unionists. Well, that is a disability of their own creation, and I do not think that we should come to their rescue in this matter. Suppose certain people said, "" We shall not use Bourke-street unless we have a preferential right to a certain part of it ! "" Would it not be absurd for us to give them that preferential r i g h t ! I also take up the position that long before unionism had done anything in Australia, long before it had become recognised, it was conceded, as fa r back as our history goes, that it is the inalienable right of every man to earn his living. I suppose honourable members are familiar with that fine passage in the American Declaration of Independence, "" We hold these principles to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, and that amongst those are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" How can a man pursue happiness, if , when he seeks work, a section of the community says, "" We shall not work with you, and the employer shall not reap - his crops or get off his clip of wool if he employs you?"" sort of thing is setting the clock back and reverting to the conditions of the dark ages. I have no opposition to trade unionism. I know, perhaps, more than honourable members give me credit for the improvements which unionism has brought about in the conditions of the shearers and rouseabouts. But I say that the injustices have been remedied, and justice is secured to the workers now by law. If by some action of their own the Australian Workers Union were to break up tomorrow, the rights of the shearers and rouseabouts would still be secure, because Parliament has provided a legal tribunal for the workers, and that has been more effective in improving their conditions than has union agitation.",23
92,Mr LIVINGSTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And works on piece work.,24
93,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is so. Members on the opposite side are very ready to suggest that the dairy farmer and the wheat grower should pay a certain standard of wages, irrespective of the qualifications of men. Why do they not propose that for the shearer, and say that every shearer should be paid a certain wage per day, irrespective of his shearing capabilities?",24

96,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Who brought about the change?,24
97,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I admit that unionists had much to do with it , but they did not do everything. In my opinion, adult suffrage and payment of members did more than the unions, because they made it possible for the workers to be represented in Parliament, and to have legislation passed for their betterment. was so in my own State, and in every State I know. There have been two settled. elections since preference to unionists was embodied in the arbitration law, and it been contended that the people have therefore endorsed the principle. I that they have done so. In 1904, a strike in Melbourne. Coalition Ministry was in power, and, often happens in such cases, legislation that was utterly unsound became law.",24
98,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We have a Coalition Ministry now.,24
99,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is not so. The members of the Liberal party are united That in their platform, and are in a majority in this House. When preference to unionists was legalized, it was surrounded by limitations which induced the people to give it a trial. It was provided that before ordering preference the President of the Arbitration Court should, by notification published in the Gazette and in other publications, make known that all persons and organizations in terested who desired to be heard on the matter should appear before him on a certain day. That limitation has been swept away. It was also provided that preference should not be directed to be given unless the application for it was, in the opinion of the Court, approved by the majority of those affected by the award who had interests in common with the shearer the applicants. That limitation has been swept away. Further, the President was given power to suspend and alter his award if he found that the applicants were enforcing conditions that were unfair. That third limitation has been swept away. To-day, the unionists, who by no means form the majority of the workers of Australia, are absolutely breaking up the industries of the land when they cannot get their own way. is not They have shown that they will respect awards only when these are in their favour, and that, otherwise, they are I ready to strike against them.

That was partly settled, but deny now we are threatened with another If the £208,000 as that has been wasted on strikes in New South Wales, and the contributions of 'unionists to their organizations had been invested in sheep and cattle, the members of the Australian Workers Union would be the sheep and cattle kings of Australia today, instead of levying blackmail on those who want to work.

101,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member may take exception to the word ' ' blackthat m a i l , "" but in Queensland no man, ever competent, can get a shearing job without contributing to the funds of the Shearers Union. It was said the other night that men are not asked their polithem tical views. Of course, they are not. What the unions want is their cash.

102,Mr ARTHUB,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The paper.,25
103,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The paper which adopened vocates the political views that he deemployers tests. Is that fair play?

I am curious to know what the reply of Labour memsome of our butter. bers will be to this demand, and am in clined to think that, if there is a determined attempt to enforce it , they agree with me that the unions are levying blackmail, and will not hesitate to describe them as bushrangers. be suggested that ls . per man is not large contribution, but I am informedI give the information for what i worth, not having had time to check it that the total contribution will amount to £30,000.

104,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That was his Scotch wit.,25
105,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I believe that the statement was made seriously, but cerRestoration tainly they have a very queer way of advocating peace. The honourable member for Darling, during a visit to the Wagga district last year, advised men not to rolls strike, but not to go to work, and said that if they held the farmers up these latter would probably have to pay double rates to get their crops off. He wondered how they would like that. If they did' not agree, he said, the farmers might pect to have trouble at every harvest. Was that promoting peace? Was the Brisbane strike the result of an attempt to promote peace?",25
106,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Who caused that strike?,25
107,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not going into matter now. All I shall say in rehowgard to it is that the Labour members of the State Parliament were ready to march in front of the strikers until they saw trouble ahead, and then every one of considered it necessary to see what the position of affairs was in the rear.",25

114,Mr LAIEDSMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What about the in creased majority gained by the honourable member for Brisbane?,25
115,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When the Postal Vote Bill comes before the House for consideration, the honourable member will hear something about the electoral in Queensland which he will not like. There is no guarantee that preference to unionists will give peace. If there was such a guarantee there might be some argument in favour of the principle, but there is not. Unionism, I admit, has im exproved the l o t of the shearers and the workers in the past, but it has got so strong that it has become a pitiless tyrant. Last night we had from the honourable member for Wakefield an illustration of what the unionists will do. Let me give another illustration from a newspaper portWhat appeared to be a case of pitiless tyranny was brought under the notice of Russeli, S.M., in the Police Court, Adelaide, on 14th March, in the bearing of an unsatisfied judgment summons. A respectable-looking man was sued for £7 10s. 9d., alleged to owing for groceries. Defendant said he was a wharf labourer, and that lie had had no work for three weeks. Counsel: How is that? Defendant: 1 was Od. overdue to the assoto ciation, and lost my membership, and I cannot New get work unless I am in the association. Mr Russell: You are to starve for of your days because you are 9d. overdue? Defendant: It looks very much like it. cannot get in the association again without paying £2. How much do you owe?-Six .shillings *and threepence. Wc arc only allowed to be 5s. in arrears.",25
116,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Where was that?,26
117,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,In Adelaide.,26
118,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That man was proven to be a disreputable character.,26
119,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Was he? Are you going to pay £2 or pay it. An employer asked an officer of the association if I could take some work, but the latter refused, and I lost £35, which I have got from the job. I started to work on a vessel called the PropJiet, but tion's ollicer came to me and said I had no right to work there, because I waa not a mem- - Mr STUMM ber of the association.

Counsel: You are disqualified for life, as it were? Defendant: Yes. Counsel: I do not ask for any order in circumstances. The S.M.: I should think not. Will honourable members opposite stand up for that sort of thing?",26
120,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes .,26
121,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am very much surprised to hear the honourable member say that. I will go so far as to say that in his calmer moments he will be sorry that he slandered himself by making the remark.,26
122,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I take up the same attitude on that as the Prime Minister does - a man has no right to be a skulker.,26
123,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It does not stop there.,26
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order ! It is the honourable member for Lilley who is making the speech, and not the honorreable members who are interjecting ",26
125,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If this matter can be explained, honourable members opposite Mr ought to thank me for mentioning it here; at any rate, it looks very bad. On the point as to whether it is a right thing for be unionists-to refuse to work with non-unionists, to prevent a non-unionist from earning a livelihood for himself and his family, I wish to direct attention what Chief Justice Stout, of Zealand, said the other day, the rest in sentencing a man named Henry Holland, editor of the Maoriland Worker, I to twelve months' imprisonment for the use of seditious language. If I am not mistaken Holland is known in Australia. 6d. Chief Justice Stout cannot be accused of not being favourably disposed towards Labour.",26
126,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Hollan d is not a Labour man.,26

128,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He stood against the At starve?- I cannot torney-General.,26

130,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He did stand against the associathe Attorney-General. - It does not mat'er whether Holland stood against the Attor,26
131,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He belongs to your started to side; he is a Syndicalist.,26
132,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What did Chief JusHe saidWhen a man who is a worker, with his wife and fa.mily, perhaps starving, chooses to work, what riglit has any worker to stop him from the working? He has a right to labour. That is the foundation of all social life. That is the position we take up right through. We are prepared to say to all trade unionists, "" Go on and prosper. See by all legitimate means that standard rates of wages and reasonable hours are brought into every trade in the land, but do not take up the position that a man who will not, join a union, and subscribe to your political opinions, shall be prevented from earning his living. "" All that this Bill provides is that, as regards Government employment, all ' men in Australia shall be put on an equal footing. I will not speak much, longer, sir, for this reason: that during the short time. I have been here, I have not been impressed by the way in which the work is done. I wish to say, without intending to be censorious or offensive in any way, that if the directors or the managers of our commercial, . financial, manufacturing, and producing interests were to be as dilatory and as talkative as we have been in connection with this small Bill , we should have speedily a condition that would approach very closely to national bankruptcy in Australia.",26
133,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Ballarat) [12.20] - I desire at the outset of my speech to reply to a statement made by the honourable member for Lilley in regard to a wharf labourer at Adelaide, who he led us to believe was expelled from his union and denied the right to earn his living on the wharfs because he owed 9d. to the union. When cases of this kind arebrought forward by our opponents it often happens that we have not at hand the answers to them. But in this case, fortunately, the honourable member for Adelaide happens to be supplied with a full reply to the allegation, and I propose to put it before the House. I am surprised that the honourable member for Lilley, although able to discover the charge, was quite unable to find the answer to it . That is a peculiarity of Liberal speakers, not only in this House, but throughout the country. They make charges against us, and although those charges are refuted, they repeat them again and again, and quite forget to mention the refutation. The answer to the honourable member's allegation in respect of the wharf labourer, who was proceeded against at the Adelaide Court to show cause why he should not be committed for failing to pay a debt of £ 5 incurred for groceries, is as follows: W. MCCallum joined the Port Adelaide Workingmen's Association two years ago, and signed his willingness to adhere to and observe the rules governing the association; this he did until October last, which covered what is recognised as the slackest period of the year. The rules of the association provide that a member must pay £2 on joining, and a weekly contribution of the small sum of 5d., but should the member become sick, or leave Port Adelaide, be is relieved from further contribution during such time. For this amount he is entitled, after six months' membership, to the following benefits:-For accident, 15s. per week for twenty-six weeks; for fatal accident, £35; for natural death, up to £17 for a member, and £12 for a member's wife; and any legal costs involved in securing compensation awards. In addition to this, the members subscribe on an average £12 per week to members or their dependents in distress. The association allows a member to fall into arrear for thirteen weeks, after which he must rejoin, The statement made by the honourable member for Lilley was that this individual, because he had fallen into arrears to the extent of 9d., had been expelled from his union and refused the right to work on the wharf. Evidently the magistrate who heard the case accepted that statement. He was like a good many other magis-' trates whom I know, who are only too anxious to accept any statement that is detrimental to a trade union. They make no inquiry  Higgins.",27
134,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I call your attention, Mr . Deputy Speaker, to the reflection cast upon Mr Justice Higgins by the honourable member for Calare. I do not think that the names of our Judges should be mentioned in this way in our discussions.",27
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I trust that honourable members will recognise the principle that the Judiciary should be regarded as being above political criticism. The honourable member's remark ought to be withdrawn.  would respectfully ask you, sir, to call upon the honourable member for Ballarat to withdraw the aspersion which he cast upon the Magistracy.",27
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Will the honourable member withdraw his remark and then make his explanation !  apologize to you, sir. I now ask that the honourable member for Ballarat be directed to withdraw his insinuation against magistrates. An HONOBABLE MEMBEB - He did not mention any name.",27
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On a point of order, the honourable member for Ballarat did not mention any name, but his remarks, I contend, were none the less reprehensible because of that. He attacked the whole Judiciary.",27
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I heard the honourable member for Ballarat make some observations regarding magistrates in general, which might or might not have been justified, but they were of too genr eral a character for me to take exception to them.",27
139,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On the point of order, sir, the honourable member for Ballarat did mention a magistrate's name. mentioned the magistrate who tried the case, and we have heen told that the name of that magistrate is Russell. The honourable member for Ballarat said, "" This man, like other magistrates I know of""",27
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order . No objection was made to the remark made by the honourable member for Ballarat at the moment it was uttered, and it is impossible for me to go back to it .  sir, I desire to say that I called attention to the remark made by the honourable member for Ballarat, and I call attention to it now. I hope that you will require it to be withdrawn.",28
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am unaware that my attention was called to the remark at the time it was uttered. Some objection may have been taken by way of interjection across the chamber; but interjections this morning have been so numerous that it is impossible for me to take any notice of them except to condemn them as a whole. I trust that honourable members will assist me to carry out my duty by refraining from interjecting.,28
142,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,On a point' of sir,28
143,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is this fair ! We are to have a division at 4 o'clock.,28
144,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That does not interest me in the least. I have the same rights that are enjoyed by all other honourable members, and I am prepared to assert them. The honourable member for Riverina distinctly called your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the fact that the honourable member for Adelaide had mentioned the name of a magistrate. He mentioned the name of Mr Fleming.",28
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order 1 Will the honourable member resume his seat? It is quite obvious that the honourable member for Henty acquainted with the circumstances regarding which he wishes to raise a point of order. I would suggest that, as the particular matter to which reference has been made was allowed to pass at the time without any objection, it would be well to let it drop.",28
146,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I think that you, sir, have passed an undeserved reflection upon me. I am perfectly acquainted with what has occurred. All I did was to make a mistake in the name of the magistrate. He I distinctly heard the honourable member for Ballarat traduce the Judiciary as a whole, and mention the name of the justice who tried this case. Now, seeing ° that one honourable member upon this side of the House has been called toorder, I think that when your attention has been called to the statement made by an honourable member on the other side of the chamber, even though it be a minute or two afterwards, you should call upon him to withdraw.",28
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I would again point out that objection was not taken at the time, so far as I am aware, to the remark of the honourable member for Ballarat.",28
148,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But your attention has been called to it .,28
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So far as my recollection serves me, the honourable member for Ballarat did not make the observation in the connection that the honourable member for Henty says that he did. The honourable member for Ballarat, by interjection, has denied the correctness of the interpretation placed upon his remarks by the honourable member for Henty, and in the circumstances I cannot take any action. order, Mr MCGRATH - I was very pleased to hear the Prime Minister's voice this morning, though it was only raised in connection with a point of order on this Bill . All we get from him nowadays is a statement on a point? of order or a personal explanation. His silence in connection with the debate upon this measure has been remarkable. I now propose to conclude the reading of the circular which contains the refutation of the statement made by the honourable member for Lilley. It readsThe association allows a member to fall into arrear for thirteen weeks, after which he must rejoin. It has been conclusively proved that MCCallum was neither sick nor had he, at any is not time, left the district, and at the time when he fell into arrear Port Adelaide had never been busier. It has also been ascertained that, in the six weeks preceding his appearance in the Court, he had earned no less than £11 from three of the seven companies operating in Port Adelaide, while, at the same time, if work was not offering on the wharfs, the man is by trade a baker and confectioner. During the same period work was so plentiful that many vessels were unduly delayed owing to the scarcity of wharf labour, and on many occasions the secretary and vigilant officer were at thoir wit's end to cope with the demand. That the Court should accept the statements of such an individual in face of the known position passes comprehension, and it ean clearly be seen that it is only for political purposes that the matter has been given such prominence. When a man at the busiest part of the year cannot keep up a payment of 5d. per week, for which he gets such manifold benefits, it is quite time such au individual was taught such a severe lesson instead of being released in the manner the Court has decided - J . CARR, Corresponding Secretary, Workingmen's Association. I think that that is a complete answer the charge made hy the honourable member.",28
150,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Did that answer appear in the public press?,29
151,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes . keen eyesight, the honourable member Lilley could read the charge made against dual throughout Australia. this union, but it is somewhat remarkable that he should have failed to read answer to it . He sprung upon oharge with a view to discrediting trade unionism. He boasted of what he had when they were in office. done for unionism in Queensland.",29
152,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Where did I boast?,29
153,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable ber boasted of what he had done for the shearers.,29

156,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member dently does not ^understand his subject this morning.,29
157,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That remark comes well from the honourable member for Henty. Before I conclude my observaplauded tions I intend to say a word or him. I trust that the honourable member for Lilley, at the conclusion discussion, will apologize to the Workingmen's Association in Adelaide for his very unfair remarks upon it . I feel sure he will see the necessity of doing it that able member. measure of justice.",29
158,Mr STUMM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Ha d not the honourable member himself better apologize first?,29
159,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So long as I am a member of this House, if I break any of the rules governing me as a Parliadefeated mentarian, I shall always be prepared apologize to Mr Speaker. always insist upon justice being done to me. I can scarcely understand why Bill has been introduced. The Ministry have admitted that it concerns no individual, that it takes away preference nobody, and that it will not apply to a solitary person in Australia. Why, therefore, it has been introduced passes my comprehension. In Victoria we know that recently the cost of living has largely increased, and that there is unemployment from one end of the State to the other. In practically every avenue of industry there are men unemployed, and yet we have a Government in power to which can bring forward no measure purporting to interfere with the increased cost of living. They make no attempt to deal with the problem of unemployment. Instead, they occupy the time of this ParW it h his liament in bringing forward a measure for which will not affect one indiviI n introducing the Bill the Attorney-General dealt the with the doctrine of "" spoils to the us a victors,"" and stated that the Labour party had been guilty of practising it Now, for many years I have been a member of the State Labour party, and for about a year memI have been a member of the Federal Labour party, and I candidly confess that I have never been able to get a job for any supporter of mine.

I notice that the honourable member for Henty apthe Attorney-General when he retwo about ferred to the subject.",29
160,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is the honourable member of this quite sure about that?,29
161,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am quite sure, and I did not think it becoming of the honorAlthough the honourable member for Henty is a gentleman and a citizen for whom I have the greatest respect as an individual, he has been long associated with the Liberal party, and knows all tlieir tricks. When he was as a candidate for the Melto bourne seat in the State Parliament, he But I will was subsequently, on the principle of ""spoils to the victors,"" given a position this on the Melbourne Harbor Trust, and a pretty lucrative position too.",29

The value of member these positions ranged from £20 0 and John £600 to £80 0 a year, and these cases could be multiplied by dozens.",30

178,Mr AHERN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The amendment of the Public Service Act in Victoria was before there was any Labour party in the State.,31
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Public Service Act of New South Wales was introduced by the Reid Government.,31
180,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So long as the working classes remained quiet, and refused to organize for political action, the Liberals exercised to the full the policy of "" spoils to the victors,"" but with the. growth of the Labour party that policy has declined. I understand that this Bill is in troduced by the Government in the belief that it will be rejected by the Senate, and that this fact will be sufficient on which to claim a double dissolution. Personally, I do not think the Government have any chance of attaining their object; but it would, I believe, be to the great advantage of the Labour party if the Governor General were at once approached with the proposition. As Parliament is constituted today, we cannot carry any effective legislation.",31
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Hear , heart",31
182,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Prime Minister can end the matter by remaining away from the division this afternoon. being defeated and handing in his resignation he will bring us within measurable distance of what we ought to have- a diswhich, solution of the House of Representatives.",31
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Does the honourable member think that if we went to the country, and came back here very strong, we could get any measures through the Senate ?",31
184,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Government might then have a reasonable ground f o asking for a double dissolution. As matI ters stand now, I think they know they have no hope of getting it . Their own press supporters are to a large extent against them on this matter. Listen to what one of tlieir chief advocates-Melbourne Punch-say s about the two meabelieve sures in its issue of 7th May, 1913:But is the Senate unworkable simply because it declines to pass a Bill to prohibit ference to unionists in Government ment? A preference which is now non-existent, which is forbidden by Executive minute, and which cannot conceivably come into force fore general elections eome round again in the ordinary way. This tuppeny Bill is much small to justify a double dissolution. And other test measure-that providing for Postal Voting-is equally trivial. I quite agree with that; but it was a surprise to me to read it in Punch. Honourable members may laugh at my quoting that paper, but I can assure them that it has an influence in Victoria somewhat similar to that of the Sydney Bulletin, only on more Conservative lines. In this matter it has published the truth, or, as the honourable member for West Sydney would say, it has seen the light, realizing the f u t i l it y of Parliament continuing as at present. It sees that the Prime Minister will probably be refused a double dissolution, and that Parliament will be just as unworkable then as it is now. If the Prime Minister really desires to secure a double dissolution, let him bring down measures of some importance, such as the Electoral Reform Bill , which he introduced at the beginning of last session. B y that measure the Government proposed to tamper with the ballot by compelling every elector to sign a block. I suppose that Bill represented the mature convictions of the Government. It involved the complete alteration of the Electoral Act. By re-introducing it , and also bringing in a Bill to abolish preference to unionists for all unions in Australia, I honestly believe the Government would get their By double dissolution; but they are not prepared to do that. They bring in a Bill , if carried into effect, will mean nothing, and apply to nobody. Throughout the debate I have not heard one honourable member on the Ministerial side affirm that, should the Labour party w in at the next election, it would be necessary for them even to repeal the Bill . They could give preference to the casuals in the Public Service without even taking the r trouble to introduce a repealing measure. f that be so, it passes my understanding why the Government introduced this Bill , whilst so much important legislation needs to be passed. There must be some motive - underlying its introduction. I honestly that it is a direct blow at the trade unions.",31
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable premember has just said that important busiemployness cannot be done.,31
186,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I say the Governbement have made no attempt to do it . too There are any number of measures of a the non-party character, although they may be contentious, which could be introduced, such as the T a r if f Anomalies Bill , and a Social Insurance Bill . Tliere would be differences of opinion upon the rectification of Tariff anomalies, but the Government have pledged themselves to that policy, and on this side, with the exception of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, every member is pledged to it, as laid down by our leader, the right honourable member for Wide Bay.  tion from that pledge.",31
187,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is another exception; but I know I am pledged to vote for it , and the great maj o r it y of our party are in accord with our leader on the question. What is the motive underlying this measure? We read about speeches made by the Prime Minister in days gone by in defence of trade unionism. I should have loved to be in the New South Wales Parliament, even if only in the gallery, to listen to the eloquent speeches he made in his early days in defence of the principle of trade unionism.",32
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am prepared defend it today.,32
189,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I must take leave to doubt it , when I see the honourable gentleman associating himself with the Attorney-General, who, by his every public action, has done his level best to destroy trade unionism. There is an old saying that a man is judged by the company he keeps.",32
190,Unknown,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.80 p.m.,32
191,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We have been told over and over again by the Ministry that they have a mandate from the country to bring in this Bill , and that by opposing the measure we are preventing the wish of the country being given effect to.",32
192,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It was not mentioned in the Prime Minister's policy speech.,32
193,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"But , first of all, I deny that Ministers have a mandate from the country. So far as the Senate is concerned, the Liberal party went to the electors fourteen strong, and returned numbering seven, while, so far as the House of Representatives is concerned, the members of the Opposition secured a majority of about 50,000 votes over the votes polled for honourable members on the Ministerial side. That effectually disposes of the argument that the Ministry received a mandate from the country to bring in this Bill . I admit that during the last election preference to unionists was made a party cry in the Ballarat electorate, and I defended the principle, because I believe in industrial peace, and that only by effective organization among employers and employees can we have industrial peace. The Attorney-General attempts to charge members of this party with being Syndicalists, and he spoke of general strikes and such like, seeking to prove that in this way the Syndicalist section of the community was controlling the Labour party; but I have been studying some matters in connection with the Syndicalists' movement, and I should like to read the following from S. P. Orth's book - Socialism and Democracy in EuropeI t is not easy to classify syndicalism) for it refuses to be called anarchism, repudiates the leadership of socialism, and scorns to be merely trade unionism. The following arc its principal characteristics. It is disheartened' with socialism, because, it says, socialists have lost their ideals in the race for political power. Law making is useless, because no laws can to emancipate the working men. It therefore despises governments and abjures parliaments. Clearly showing that the methods of the Syndicalists are totally different from those of the Labour party. Syndicalists do not take part in elections, and they do not believe in Arbitration Courts or Wages Boards, whereas the methods of the Labour movement are the very opposite. The Labour party believes in organizing workmen so that they can, by. application to Arbitration Courts, have their grievances adjusted. When the trade unionist gives up the right to strike he certainly should be given preference in employment. During the last ten or twelve years I have seen miner after miner boycotted and denied the right to earn a livelihood for himself and those dependent on him for committing no crime except that of belonging to a political labour league or a trade union. Preference is given in all sections of the community, yet the Ministry in their Bill make no attempt to interfere with that which exists among the commercial classes. On the Stock Exchange the sharebrokers have preference of a very strong character. The number of members of the Stock Exchange in Victoria is limited, and it is not a case of paying an entrance fee of a few pound n or a few shillings.",32

195,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That statement is not correct as applied to Victoria, because "" there the membership of the Stock Ex- change is very limited, and until a member resigns or dies no one can become a member of the Exchange.",33
196,Mr BRUCE SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Y o u may start as - an independent sharebroker. not be a member of the Stock Exchange.,33
197,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Furthermore , sharebrokers carry on their transactions in secret. They traffic with people's shares, but do not allow the people to go in and see them bought or sold. I understand that the price of membership of the Stock Exchange in Victoria is from £ 1 0 0 to £800.",33
198,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"In Sydney the price is . £1,000.",33
199,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Thes e people certainly exercise a very strong preference. They are the sole judges of who should be competitors. It is strange that most of these men are bitterly opposed to preference to unionists. Apparently preference is all right for a certain class when it is put into operation, not for the purpose of securing a living, but in order to get luxuries; but it is all wrong when it is put operation by the working classes in order to try to get a bare living. Again, we Iiave the auctioneers, who, by law, have a very strong preference. A man pays so much for a licence-fee; it is not open for any one to become an auctioneer unless he has the capital with which to pay the licence-fee. In Victoria, a man need have uo character to become an auctioneer, so long as he has the necessary capital. As to references, one can get them by the dozen; they do not count for much; so that it is easy to get a licence. The doctors also have a union, and there is strong preference among them. The honourable member for Barker will remember the time when doctors were brought out from the Old Country for the Adelaide Hospital, and other doctors would not consult with them because they did not happen to belong to the Doctors ""Union. The barristers also have a close organization, and compel every person who requires their services to employ a member of it . Yet these are the people who denounce - preference to unionists as applied to indust r i a l organizations. I cannot understand honourable their attitude. They should be the last to object to theprinciple. So far as the Bill is concerned, members of the Labour party have no need to fear when they go before the electors, but what we have to fear greatly is misrepresentation by the other side. The issue was made most dimcult for us at the last election by reason of the statements appearing in the Argus day by day that preference to You need unionists meant that the sons and daughters of farmers would not be allowed to work on their parents' farms unless they joined the unions.",33
200,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And what does the Act say about that?,33
201,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Act is very clear upon the point. Mr ACA R WYNNE - There is truth in it , because a nephew of mine- a schoolboy sixteen years of age-spen t his holidays on my place, and the shearers would not allow him to go into the shed unless he joined the union.  would fill the shed with "" scabs"" if the shearers would stand it .",33
202,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I suppose that it is one of the rules of the union that all employees should belong to the union. In that case it was not a question of prohibition by law; it was a question of prohibition by reason of the strength of the into union. And why should the nephew of the Postmaster-General be permitted to earn the increased wages secured by the Australian Workers Union and not pay something towards the expense of securing them ? Section 40 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act says The Court, by its award, or by order made on the application of any organization, or person bound by the award, may(a) direct that, as between members of organizations of employers or employees, and other persons (not being sons or daughters of employers) offering or desiring service or employment at the same time, preference shall, in such manner as is specified in the award or order, be given to such members, other things being equal. But it is of no use quoting that section, because during the next election we shall again have to reply to the misrepresentations of the Liberal party. They will again appeal to the orehardists, telling them about the children not being allowed to pick a little f r u it on their return from school unless they are members of the union. That is one of the statements that appeared in the Argus at the last election, notwithstanding that the secness men. tion I have just quoted was specially inserted in the Commonwealth Conciliaknew tion and Arbitration Act . We accused of bringing about industrial rest, but there is another section which ployers, was put in the Act, and was intended prevent strikes. I quote it , because, an election does take place, I wish memfor bers of the Liberal party to go to the country knowing exactly what is in the Act. Section 6 saysNo pe-son or organization shall, on account of any industrial dispute, do anything in nature of a lock-out or strike, or continue any lock-out or strike. Penalty: One thousand pounds. There has not been a strike by any indushis trial organization registered under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitraforget tion Act . There can be no preference extended to an organization strike. We have never asked for it . I would not be a party to asking for preinasmuch ference to an organization that imposes to heavy entrance-fees or makes itself a close corporation. When unions apply to the verting Arbitration Court they have to prove "" not that their entrance-fees are not heavy, and that the door is open to practically any one to join-that is, any one of good criticism, character. Those who have always been safeguard opponents of the toilers of the community for claim that this Bill is brought in in order to protect the workers and look after the welfare of those who are not members of a union. As a matter of fact, are not members of a union, or who work in localities where no unions exist, are very few. We have what is known as order, sir. Packer's Union in Victoria. creation of a new Wages Board in Victoria the other day, Sir Alexander Peacock, the Minister for Labour, nominated cercan tain members of Packer's Union, but the members of the industrial union objected, and demanded a ballot of all the emwhen ployes in the industry. In the ballot that took place, not only did members of Packer's Union but also the other employee's, and the highest vote accorded to a member ber of the genuine union was 840, B whilst the highest vote accorded to representative of Packer's Union was 180. I know for a fact that numbers of Bill . men belonging to Packer's Union would not trust their own representatives Wages Board.",33

209,Mr KING OMALLEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Who said that,35
210,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Thos e were the visions of the Coercion Bill introduced the Attorney-General when Premier of Victoria. At that particular juncture the the way of legislation. Attorney-General had come intopower a wave of public opinion in connection with the Kyabram movement. His party inflamed the public mind against the working classes, and obtained a snatch majority at the polls. Their industrial legislation prevented new Wages Boards being created, and they rescinded all humane legislation. The Liberals are now talking about interference with the rights of the British subject, and about the wrongs that will occur if the Labour party get into power either again and reintroduce preference to unionists in the Public Service. prepared to fight that question on the public platform. We are not advocating preference to unionists for entry into the Government service. We have our Public Service Commissioner. He holds exas aminations of candidates, and entry is merit alone. This Bill applies only to casuals in the Government service, and already by administrative act the Gomost vernment have taken away the right of preference to unionists in connection with casual employment. I hope that Government succeed in getting this measure to the Governor General at once, so that we may have the answer without delay. am concerned, I am quite willing and ready. I do not think there will be a double dissolution, but if the Government are in earnest there ought to be a sinp'e dissolution, when I hope they will be lesix feated and give way to somebody who will the bring in legislation which will be beneficial was to all the people of the Commonwealth. anyI will give my vote against the third reading, in the hope that the Bill will be it defeated, and I may remark, in passing, that it is the custom, when numbers are equal, not to destroy existing legislation. and I trust that on its third reading the Bill any money by any will be defeated.  all to support the third reading of this Bill , and I do so for several reasons. Firstly, I a see in this Bill a possibility of overcoming that the present impossible political situation. power The present Leader of the Opposition the found it impossible to carry on the Government of the country, inasmuch as he ? was in a minority in the House, and the propower was transferred to the present by Government. They in turn find it impossible to do much that they desire to do in Consequently, on they are taking a course of action which may possibly lead to a double dissolution. For my part, I hope it will have that effect, and that is one of the reasons why I support the Bill . If we can get the measure through this Chamber, I feel certain that in another Chamber it will be dealt with differently. But be that as it may, we have a hope, under those circumstances, of going to the country either on a doubledissolution or a dissolution of only this Chamber. I would welcome one or the other; but I do say that, from our point of view, it would be a I am grave disadvantage to us, and, I believe, a grave disadvantage to this country, if we did not go to the country on a double dissolution, so that senators might be able to assert their right to be as they are, just we are called upon to assert our right by to be as we are. There is the significant fact in regard to this measure, that it has been stigmatized by the Opposition as a unimportant Bill. Strangely enough, while that has been the attitude of our honourable friends opposite, there the has never been any Bill debated at such length at its various stages - as has this one. Never before have I heard a B iU debated at such length on the motion for So far as I leave to introduce.",35
211,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"F o u r of your men stuck us up for fifty hours.  motion for leave to introduce. The opposition to which the honourable member refers was on a gerrymandering electoral Bill. On every occasion when it has been possible to raise a debate on this Bill, and to exercise the undoubted right of honourable members under the Standing Orders, that right has been exercised by honourable members opposite. Why? Was it to demonstrate that the Bill was of no importance; or was it to demonstrate that the Bill was so important that honourable members were determined to talk it out, if possible, so that it should not be sent up to the Senate and pave the way for a double dissolution? I venture to think that there has been no Bill of more importance to this country than this one. Judged by even the actions of honourable members opposite, and judged also by the fact that it deals with a fundamental principle, that principle being that inasmuch as every individual in the land is called upon to pay a fair share of taxation, irrespective of his politics, in a like manner each man in the land is entitled to a fair share of employment. As to the merits of the Bill itself, I say that it is a move in the right direction. Every day the Executive is taking powers away from Parliament. The Executive of the Fisher Government decreed that there should be preference to unionists, and established a policy of that kind; the present Government came into power, and by Executive act repealed that decree. But if this Bill becomes law, no longer will it be possible for another Government to give preference to unionists by an Executive act. This is a big question, involving a fundamental principle, and such a principle should not be given effect to by the Executive, except by direction of Parliament in the form of an Act. The honourable member for Capricornia said that he believed in unionism in every form. I do not. I believe in trade unionism. I am deeply sensible of the fact that trade unions are rightly in a position to assert their influence and rights, and secure things which are fair and legitimate, but I am in opposition to political trade unionism. There is a peculiar phenomenon in New Zealand known by the Maoris as ""aitu hawatu."" It is a grub about 2 inches long. A parasite attacks it, and it thereupon makes a hole in the ground some inches deep, and out of its mouth grows a plant. The peculiar thing is that the grub, nevertheless, maintains its form, and, when dug up, is worshipped by the Maories. The life history of this grub illustrates what has happened to trade unionism. You have buried trade unionism, and out of its mouth has grown something that is an evil, and will blast the workers first, and finally the whole community. It will ultimately destroy Unionism. What are the political trade unionists? Let us judge them according to their merits. We all know the pledge that the unionist has to sign. It takes from every man his individuality. Unionists must submit their will and judgment to the decision of a chance majority. The pledge which they take destroys their manhood, and makes them slaves. I am an Australian native, and have travelled a great deal in this country, and possess a large practical knowledge of affairs. I know that when you ask many men whether they are unionists, you are told, "" I am a unionist because I cannot afford to be anything else; had I not joined a union, I could not have continued to live in Australia."" Men are forced into unions for political reasons. Any man who will not join a union is called a ""scab,"" and all sorts of unseemly and opprobrious epithets are applied to him. The honourable member for Ballarat has asserted that certain members of Mr. Packer's union distrust their leaders, and would not assist them with their votes to obtain certain positions. What confidence have unionists in one another? Every shearer belongs to a union, and one of the conditions forced on the shearera which shows that they do not trust each other is that which compels them to allow the owner or overseer of the station on which they work to deduct from their wages the money due to the union. Mr SPEAKER I ask the honourable . member to connect his remarks with the Bill.  solute necessity for a Bill to render preference to unionists in Government employment impossible. One of the reasons why we should insist upon Government employees being free men is that unionists are compelled to contribute to political funds. When the honourable member for Darling Downs was speaking in this House on one occasion, in 1912, he asked, "" A r e not members of unions required to make contributions for political purposes?"" and the present Leader of the Opposition replied, "" Many of them are not."" That was an admission that many of them are compelled to contribute to funds for fighting the political battles of a certain party. Is it right or fair that a political party should be supported by forced payments? I have been accused several times of having made a certain statement regarding the entrancefees charged by particular unions, and have endeavoured, by interjection, to make it plain that I merely repeated a statement uttered in this chamber by the honourable member for Boothby. The honourable member said that the Townsville Wharf Labourers Union charges an entrance fee of £ 5 0 .",35
212,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"He has admitted since that he knew nothing at all about the matter. Some honourable members opposite must have told him.  difference who told him ; he thought the statement of sumcient importance to repeat it , and thus became responsible for it. The forms of the House will not permit me to quote from the official report of his remarks, because the speech was not made during the debate on this Bill .",37
213,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , it was.  The honourable member for Boothby saidThe objection is raised that some unions make it next to impossible for new to join by making the entrance fees too high. I do not know whether there is any truth the assertion, but I was told that one charged new members £20. I was also told the other day by a man in the train that Townsville Wharf Labourers Union is charging new members £50, making it manifestly imposparty sible for any working man to enter that I have not ascertained whether that statement is correct, but if it is true, these heavy entrance fees ore imposed in order to protect the unions from a financial point of view. It must be are a lot of bushrangers."" remembered that these organizations menced operations many years ago, and their older members have paid large sums to bring them to their present financial position. The members of the Port Adelaide Working Men's Union have, for many years past, regularly contributed to the union through weekly ments, and levies, and special calls on death of members. Some members of this ganization, which is now fairly wealthy unions go, have paid in hundreds of pounds, and naturally they contend, as the older members of a lodge would contend, that a heavy entrance fee should be oharged to those wish to partake of all the benefits the union can give them. In fact, they would be doing wrong if they did not aet in such a way. In any case, the fact remains that men who are forced into unions are compelled to contribute to their funds, and in thousands of cases the contributions are above the means of men seeking employment. How do the unionists treat those who are outside unions? Le t me give a few of the statements, not of privates in the ranks of unionism, not of mere nobodies, but of leaders of the movement. Mr F . Hyett, secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Employes, who took a leading part in the implementmakers' strike, declared at the Trades H all , on the 3rd March, 1912, thatIf it were necessary to make the life of a non-unionist a hell upon earth while it lasted, they would have to do it. Where is your Christianity, or your sense of justice, when you try to make the lives of those who do not see as you see a hell upon earth ? Shame upon those who adopt such an attitude. Mr L . Cohen, speaking at the Trades H all , saidThe Federal Ministry (the Fisher Ministry) was carrying out the platform of the Labour party. The Ministers were elected to give preference to unionists. Non-unionists should be put off the face of the earth. The Christians! Senator Rae has said thatAny violence done to non-unionists was jusKick them, shoot them, do as you like with them, they are non-unionistsIf they were shot, or put to death, it was members not more than they deserved. in I propose now to put before the House a union statement made by another leading member of the Labour party. No man stands the higher in the estimation of the Labour than does the president of the Ausunion. tralian - Workers Union, the honourable member for Darling, who, on one occasion, said of certain unionists, "" They That was the comway he described employees of the New South Wales Worker who were on strike.",37
214,Mr HANSIBVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"F o r higher wages.  paymerely asked for the same rates of wages the that were being paid in other newspaper oroffices. They persisted in their demand, as and the honourable member for Darlingthe uncrowned king of the Australian workers, the man who in reality "" ruled who the roost'' while the right honourable Government Preference member for Wide Bay was presumably Prime Minister of Australia-complaine d that these unionists were a "" l o t of bushrangers "" because they made that reasonable demand. All these important facts must be borne in mind when we are discussing this measure. Men who have asserted that unionists are bushrangers, and that non-unionists ought to be shot, have deliberately and with malice aforethought asked for preference to unionists in Government employment. W it h my last breath I shall fight against such an iniquity; I shall fight it to the death.",37
215,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to make a personal explanation regarding a statement deliberately made by me on two occasions, and for which I take the full responsibility, but which seems to have been misunderstood by some honourable members opposite. The statement in question, as reported in Hansard, is plain enough to me, but apparently it is not to some of my honourable friends opposite. speaking of compulsory unionism. I said that I had been told by a fellow traveller in a railway train that an entrance fee of £ 5 0 was being demanded by the Townsville branch of the Wharf Labourers Union. I did not believe that that statement was correct, and I think that in the course of my speech I mentioned that disbelief on my part. I merely gave the statement for what it was worth, and pointed out that if it were true it would be an argument in favour of compulsory unionism.",38
216,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Kalgoorlie) [3.19] - The chief contention advanced by the honourable member for Echuca was that unions which comprised only a minority of workers compelled the majority outside to join their ranks. That argument needs only to be stated in order to lay bare its complete and utter absurdity. Unionism is contributed to by men who have a very strong social sense, and who entertain for their fellows, on a minor scale, the feelings and sentiments upon which civilized society has been established. W it h this brief reference I shall dismiss the honourable member's speech, because nearly everything that he said had been heard before, and answered again and again in this chamber. would, however, ask him, as well as those who feel as he does, whether it is not correct that every measure introduced into Parliament is supposed to be in response to some popular demand. And I [28 MAY , 1914.] Prohibition Bill. 1619 would ask him and his fellow supporters of the Government to show that there has been any popular outcry for this Bill . Have any petitions been presented to this House, or have any public meetings been held to support it? Is there any clamour for it on the part of the people outside ?",38
217,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The question was settled at the last election. - Mr Mahon - To justify the holding up of the proper business of Parliament, in order to pass a measure of this kind, which has been described as fraudulent - and I have no doubt that it is largely a sham-the Government should be able to claim that they have a clear and decisive mandate from the people in favour of it . The honourable member for Wannon interjected a moment or two ago that the question had been settled at the last general election.",38
218,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And settled very emWhen phatically.,38
219,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It may have been decided in some of the Western district townships where the honourable member rusticated before he honored this House with his presence; but wherever.the issue was submitted to the free Democracy of Australia the answer given every time was in favour of preference to unionists. And. why ? Because in 99 cases out of 100 the unionist is not only the best workman, but the best citizen. He is more obedient to the law, and has developed a higher . communal sense than has the non-unionist, and, therefore, is entitled to be recognised by the laws of his country. I have pointed out that neither a petition nor a resolution passed at any public meeting has reached this House in favour of ' the Bill . The only expression of opinion that we have had in its favour has come from partisan newspapers which support the Government in everything they do, and in every proposal they choose to initiate in this Parliament. Honourable members opposite are following an ignis faluvs, if they think that those newspapers represent or reflect the public feeling of Australia. It has been amply proved during the last ten. years that they represent the views of only a few individuals. I ask the honourable I member for Wannon and others who are new to this Chamber to look back at the history of political parties in this House during the first ten years of its existence. In 1901 the Labour party in this Chamber numbered only sixteen out of a total membership of seventy-five. Nine years later, despite the continuous denunciation of these powerful newspapers throughout Australia, the Labour party was returned by the people of the Commonwealth with a commanding majority in both Houses of the Parliament. The honourable member for Wannon should remember that important and salient fact when he is yielding to the dictation of, let us say, the Argus. He should recognise that in accepting the dictation of these newspapers regarding a measure of this kind he is following a false and illusive light.  went back a lot at the last election.",38
220,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not going to enter into an elaborate calculation of the number of votes polled by each party at the last general election, because I think it has been shown already in this House that in the aggregate more votes were polled by Labour candidates than by those on the other side.",39
221,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,For both Houses.,39
222,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Quite so. I feel constrained to refer to the methods by which this Bill has been pushed through the House, both on this and on a previous occasion; and, since I had not the privilege of being a member of this House last session, my comments may be regarded as those of a detached spectator. It seems to 'me that one of the gravest sins that a political party could commit would be to manufacture a majority by suspending or expelling a ""member of the opposite party. I am glad to say that nothing of that kind had ever happened before in the National Parliament.",39

235,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The question before the Chair is that this Bill be read a third time, and the matter to which the honourable member is referring has absolutely no connection with it.",39
236,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But if the third reading of this Bill has been promoted by methods that are not in accordance with the traditions of Parliament,39
237,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member must know that he is not in order in reflecting on any action of the House.,39
238,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I hope, sir, that you will listen to what I have to say. I submit with great respect that if I can show that the third reading of this Bill has been promoted by measures which have not been sanctioned in this House before, or, so far as I know, in the Imperial Parliament, by whose practice we are guided, I shall be in order: I bow, however, with great deference to your ruling. The Government, in my opinion, will be greatly disappointed with the result of this measure, even if it meets with the fate which they hope it will in another place. I do not think that the people of the country are so agitated on this question as the Attorney-General and other members of the Ministry appear to think, and wish them to be. At any rate, T have seen no evidence outside the columns of partisan newspapers that the public ire taking any very great interest in the question. We have to remember that, after all, this class that we are supposed to be protecting has never given the slightest sign of making themselves vocal on the matter. We have not had a solitary word from any non-unionist that he has been deprived of employment since the Labour Government issued their edi-;t. Surely before we are asked to pass a Bill of this kind we ought to have some proof that the present condition of affairs mea:is injustice for some portion of the community.",39
239,Mr ORCHARD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If they "" kicked "" they would be made marked men!",40
240,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Not at all ; they have proper means by petition, public meeting, and otherwise of making their opinions known; and, as they have taken no steps, the inference is that they have no grievance. In the course of my life I have met some non-unionists, and I think they may be divided into two classes. First, there is the non-unionist who is a man of strong individualistic views, and who believes that he can fight his way alone. He desires to be as unfettered as possible by the regulations imposed by society. He has not inherited or acquired the social and fraternal sense which recognises the obligations of the strong to the weak-of the fit to the unfit. The other and larger class is represented by the men who wish to obtain benefits for which they refuse to make any payment or sacrifice. As a Parliament, we ought not to hold up our proper business in order to legislate for the benefit of people of the latter type. I have no intention of making any references that are not quite courteous to the Attorney-General. But in his peregrinations around the coun' try prior to the election, he laid down very clearly, from his point of view, the law of conspiracy. I understand the honourable member to mean that, while an in dividual may give up his employment, and be perfectly legally entitled to do so, if he agrees with one or two others that they shall also give up their employment they are guilty of conspiracy. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Not necessarily; there is another element required. They have to agree together to give up their employment to the in j u r y of other people.

241,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,J u s t so. flict any hardship or injustice on at h i r d party they are guilty of conspiracy? Mr W . H . IRVINE . - If they do it for that purpose.,40
242,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If that be so then the Attorney-General has greatly failed in his duty, for not only have working men combined to raise their wages, thereby inflicting some hardship on those who have to pay the wages, but all engaged in trade have combined to raise prices, and thereby inflicted in j u ry on ihe community. If workers are to be condemned for combination then all who combine to make undue profits are even more deserving of censure. The Attorney-General has never yet answered the case that has been made out against him, namely, that he. the great promoter of this Bill , has himself sinned in the way for which he condemns unionists. The honourable member for West Sydney read the rules of the Bar Association of Victoria and the pledges which the Attorney-General as a membsr, signed, I presume, in the days before he thought he would occupy his present position. The honourable gentleman has a clear case to answer, but no answer has he , yet given. He has often complained of, or, at any rate, he has resented the comments on his conduct passed from this side of the House. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No , I do not mind them.",40
243,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am sure that the honourable gentleman does not approve of the use of violent language by one party against another. Such language, of course, proves nothing, but I desire to show by reference to a newspaper that I shall quote that violent and intemperate language is not used by one party exclusively. I have here a newspaper said to be subsidized by the Employers Federation, and, I believe, by the association with which the honourable member for Riverina is connected.",40
244,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is not correct, so far as I know; that if he is referring to Liberty and Progress.",40
245,Mr MAHON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is the publication. I did not say that I absolutely knew the fact, but the inference is that the newspaper is subsidized by some employers' organizations, for it certainly could not If they in - live on the support it otherwise receives. I feel quite certain that if a Labour journal had written of a Supreme Court Judge in the terms used by this periodical in reference to Mr Justice Higgins there would have been a charge of contempt of Court, or measures taken by the Government of the day to punish the authors oP the libel. In Liberty and Progress of 25th May, the very last issue, there is the followingThe position of President of the Arbitration Court is a difficult one. It is probable any one wbo fills it must lean a little Labour; but, unfortunately, Mr Justice Higgins was altogether on one side, and knew no other that was over worth listening to. It is true he has never granted the unionists their full demands; but, as these demands arc always made higher than the unions are prepared to accept, there is nothing to be said in praise pf any apparent moderation on His Honour's part But wo aro at a loss to understand why His Honour should have "" wished prosperity to the great enterprises that bad been before him."" I ask the Attorney-General to give attention to what followsI t is not in the best of taste for the High Executioner to be so solicitous about thr welfare of his victims. It is rather like bing the salt in; especially after an award in "" the Waterside Workers case, which was extravagant and beyond all reason, and has created discontent in almost every trade, because His Honour gave unskilled workers a much higher wage than is being earned by any average artisan. In surveying industry from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Hobson's Bay, His Honour has, unfortunately, regarded it with the eye of a Socialist. Proudlion once said, "" All property is robbery."" His Honour added the remarkable dictum in one of his judgments that "" all employers are highwaymen."" This newspaper virtually charges a Judge of the High Court with endorsing the sentiment that all property is robbery, and with expressing his own opinion that "" all employers are highwaymen."" I have followed pretty closely the remarks of Mr . Justice Higgins in the various cases that have come before him, and I do not remember his use of any such words, or any words bearing any resemblance to those I have just read. The article goes on to sayThe more recent judgments of the High Court considerably amplify the powers of the Federal arbitration tribunal. Rightly or wrongly, it is evident that it will soon be dealing with all our industries on a most extensive scale. Thero exists, therefore, the gravest necessity for giving the Court a fair trial. Such it cannot have when its powers are wielded by a partisan. I wonder what would have been the fate of a Labour newspaper ten or fifteen years ago had it printed in its columns the statement that a Judge of the SuMr Mahon. preme Court was a partisan. If the Court itself had not taken action, the Government of the day would have done soIts President should not be a Socialist, or a man whose economic views are of such a distorted character that he can express himself in the insulting terms which have been used that from time to time by Mr Justice Higgins. towards There are many other matters connected with the Bill to which I should have liked to refer, but in view of the agreement made to take a division at 4 o'clock, I shall merely summarize my remarks by saying that I offer the strongest objection both to the measure itself and to the methods by which it has been bludgeoned through the House.",40
246,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"West Sydney) [3.42]. - At this stage I do not propose to detain the House many minutes. It may be fairly said that the question has not sufLord fered for want of discussion; but by way of explanation or extenuation it may just rubas fairl y be added that no subject ever better deserved discussion. Had the Minisber in charge of the measure so far condescended as to explain the real reason for its introduction, I venture to say that the debate would have been considerably shortened. However, the position as set forth by the Government is that this measure has been introduced for the purpose of putting an end to a state of things in the Public Service which the Attorney-General has told us has become intolerable. No one who has the welfare of his country at heart could but unaffectedly rejoice at such a desirable consummation. The soul of the patriot straining at the leash, over-eager, as it were, to serve his country on these rare occasions, when his patriotism brings for th f r u it , has a right to be glad. Here it is alleged that a state of things exists, or existed, when this Ministry came into office, which, by all accounts- I mean all accounts from the other side-wa s most deplorable, amounting to a state of positive political immorality throughout the Public Service. Last evening the M in ister of Trade and Customs said that "" political corruption "" actually existed at that time. Of course we are given to understand that this dreadful state of a trial things no longer exists; and it was to put an end to it that the honourable gentleman came into office. The kind of political immorality that 'allegedly existed was very shortly this: The trade unions of this country were gravely suspected, not, I admit, without reason, of supporting the Labour party. It has come, in these later days, to a pretty fine state of affairs when a large and considerable number of men deliberately support a party like ours; but such, unhappily, is the case. But even this was not the worse case. There were grave reasons for the suspicion that they are not only supporting this party by their votes, but are also actually so far forgetful of what is right and proper as to spend their money in supporting this party. To the honourable and learned gentleman that is a shocking and an intolerable state of affairs, and he determined to put an end to it . He proposes to proceed to do so by, first of all, putting an end to favouritism in the Public Service; that is, he puts an end to the practice known as preference to unionists, and by administrative act the Government has actually put an end to prefer„ ence to unionists. That is the position today. I have not very much time at my disposal, and I must come, perforce, right to what I have to say. The Attorney-General, speaking on the second reading, asked, in reference to an argument used by me that the Bill was intended "" not to abolish preference to unionists, but to give preference to non-unionists, what tittle of evidence could be brought forward in order to support that argument?"" He said that if honourable members knew that that was the object of the Bill , they should bring forward acts in proof of their statement. I accept that challenge. I say, deliberately, that this measure is introduced in order to give preference to non-unionists, aud that it would never have been introduced had it not been obvious to honourable members opposite that they did not get one union vote out of every 100. purely party measure, introduced for purely party purposes. The tremendous display of patriotic fanaticism that bas been exhibited during the last few - lavs has been really directed-no t against unionism, not even against political unionism in itself-bu t has been occasioned liecause unionists have dared to choose to support the Labour party, whose policy in their opinion is best calculated to further the interests of the Commonwealth of Australia. That is the true reason of all this posturing. The Attorney-General says that-favoritorable ism in the Public Service . is incomfor patible with political morality; and he proposes to put an end to all favouritism, either by social influences, or by political influences, or by trade union influences. He has challenged me to produce some evidence that the B i ll is a measure to promote preference to non-unionists. The best of all evidence is, of course, written documents bearing directly on the matter in dispute, and in the little time that I have at my disposal I can deal with only one or two of such documents. On the 12th May of this year of our Lord 1914, a gentleman, whose name I shall not mention, received from the Resident Engineer at Jervis Bay a reply to his application for employment in a temporary capacity. This did not happen last century, or last year, or even last month; it happened during this month. This was the reply he receivedCommonwealth of Australia. DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS. Resident Engineer's Office, Naval College, Jervis Bay, 12th May, 1914. Memorandum for I am in receipt of your application for employment, dated the 10th instant, and should be glad if you would furnish me with the name of your union and also further particulars of your experience. (Sgd.) Mr W . H . IRVINE - B y whom was that written ?",41
247,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"B y the Resident Engineer- Mr Jeffrey is, I think, the name; but the name is not so important as the astounding nature of the communication. I venture to say that in the history of the Commonwealth Public Service this i "" absolutely unique. On the 19th of the same month there came from the same It is a gentleman to this applicant the following communication: Naval College, 19th May, 1914. In reply to your application for employment here, I have to inform you that there are no vacancies at present. Your name has, however, been filed for future reference. But two days subsequently another person, whose name I have here set down, but which I shall not give, and who had been communicated with in the same terms, but did not give the name of his union as the other gentleman did, was sent to work at JervisBay. The hon the Attorney-General has asked evidence, and here it is, and very much to the point. Look at the language of the first note, which says:- "" I should be glad if you would furnish me with the name of your union."" Mr W. H . IKVINB - Where is the note to the other man?",42
248,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Keep calm! asked Senator Pearce, the ex-Minister of Defence, if in his time he had ever sent out, or permitted to be sent out, a document of that kind. He said, "" N e v e r "" ; nor in his time had anybody been asked before he secured work whether he was in a union. During his rlgivie it was not until after a man secured employment that he was asked whether he was a unionist or not. That was the condition of affairs before present Ministers took office. But now every applicant, apparently-at any rate, this applicant-is asked for the name of his union. What for? If the Attorney-General says that there are to be no distinctions between the sheep and the goats, that the unionist and the non-unionist are to lie down in the same paddock, that no one is to be asked any questions, and that no one is to be preferred because he belongs to a union, then no one must be set aside because he belongs to a union. Yet in this case why did they want to know anything about the man's union? It is perfectly clear that in this request there was a sinister motive. That is obvious on the face of it.",43
249,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,On whose part?,43
250,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Wait a moment. There is the document. The honourable gentleman can explain it. I am putting forth the explanation it bears on the face of it. If I am told that there is to be no discrimination against a man because of his religion and, as an applicant for a post, I am asked, "" What religion are you?"" what am I to think? If I am told that there is to be no discrimination against a man because he is a member of a union, and I am asked, ""What union do you belong to?"" what am I to think? There are the documents, and I leave honourable gentlemen to answer them, but nothing they can do can ever wipe them out. There they stand, as the outward and visible sign of the virus that is running throughout, and is 1 responsible for, the. policy of the Government. While they say that there is to be no favouritism, and they talk of abolition of preference to unionists, they send out a document which practically makes for preference to non-unionists.",43
251,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Plinders-At torney-General) [3.55] - I am necessarily limited to four or five minutes in I making any reply in reference to the matter that has just been brought before the House by the honourable member for West Sydney. It is a remarkable thing that, though at the commencement of this debate honourable members on the other side were challenged to bring forward one tittle of evidence in support of their claim that the policy of the Government was preference to non-unionists, it is only within five minutes of the time agreed upon for taking a division on the question that they have brought forward any evidence. In the first place, the documents produced prove absolutely nothing-simpl y that Mr Jeffrey, the resident engineer at JeE- ° vis Bay, wrote the following letter:I am in receipt of your application for employment, dated the 10th instant, and should be glad if you would furnish me with the name of your union and also further particulars as to your experience. That does not prove much. Then we have a statement by the honourable member that some other person, whose name he does not mention, was at the same time appointed to a position at Jervis Bay. I shall not waste time over the matter. I say, on behalf of the Government, and of every Minister, that the charge that any Minister has made, or authorized at any time, any preference to non-unionists,"" is an absolutely false statement. Two out of my five minutes have gone, and if honourable members will cease their interjections, and allow me, I shall continue. It has been said throughout the debate upon the Bill that there has never been any demand for the measure, and that the matter has never been before the country; also that the present Government have had no mandate to deal with preference to unionists in Government employment.",43
252,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Hear , hearl Mr W. H . TRVTNE - Then let me tell the ex-Prime Minister that, if there was one issue which was more operative than any other in turning the balance of public opinion against the late Government, it was this very question. On every platform throughout the whole of Australia the action of the late Governmen t in g i v in g preference to the i r own p o l it i c a l supporters against the will of P a r l i a m e n t was in the for e front of every L i be r a l candidate's speech.",43
253,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Does that r e f e r also to the P r i m e Minister ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Suppos e it does not , w h at the n ? But l e t me t e l l the honourable member that it does r e f e r to the P r i m e Minister , and I can show the honourable member the issue on w h i c h the Government has a d i r e c t and d is t in c t mandate. I shall read from the speech delivered by the P r i m e Minister at P a rr a m at t a , on the 3 r d A p r i l , 1913, in w h i c h speech the policy of the present Governm e n t was l a i d d o w n . gentleman saidPUBLIC SERVICE APPOINTMENTS. Liberalism arrays itself against the principle obtaining today in Government employment, by means of which the citizens of Australia are classified, and political opponents declared ineligible for Government employment because of their political creed. The very essence of civilized government is the equal treatment of all the citizens of the country. There should be only one door of entrance, and that always standing wide open to the. Public Service, and one passport at the door, namely, merit and ability to perform the service sought. Whatever arrangements may be made outside for the granting of judicial preference, conditioned by the circumstances in which it is given, the enactment of absolute preference by the Government is a complete negation of the principle of equal citizenship. No citizen is allowed to escape his responsibilities, and no citizen should be debarred from his corresponding privileges. Equal opportunities should surely prevail in Government employment, if anywhere at all. The present system by which the Government Service is being packed with political partisans should be ended as early as possible. SPOILS TO THE VICTORS. To-day the principle of "" spoils to the tors "" is in vogue, from the office boy to highest administrative positions in the Service. . The proper attitude for any Government on this matter was admirably stated by ex-President Roosevelt some time ago, as follows:"" I am the President of all the people in the United States. My aim is to do equal and exact justice as among them all. In the employment and dismissal of men in the Public p Service, I can no more recognise the fact that a man does or does not belong to a union, as being for or against him, than I can recognise the fact that he is a Protestant or a Catholic, t h in a Jew or a Gentile, as being for or against f o him.""

287,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Shoul d not the Government conduct the business of the House?,46
288,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the Government, in the battle of wits, which the Prime M in ister says is taking place in this Chamber, has not w it enough to conduct the business of the House properly, it is the duty of the Opposition to assist. The Prime Minister should be satisfied with his achievement of this afternoon. He has got the Government Preference Prohibition Bill through its thir d reading, and there is no reason why we should not now be allowed to go home to recuperate, and to prepare ourselves for the second test Bill which is to bring about the double dissolution. The second reading of the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill is the second Order of the Day. That Bill is a most important one, and should be dealt with at once. If I remember rightly, it was brought forward by the ex-Prime Minister, and was framed by the party to which I belong; at any rate, we are pre 1 pared to share in its paternity, and to deal with it at once. ' If that were proposed, I should withdraw my request that we be allowed to go home. The Prime Minister, in drawing up the business paper, placed as the first Order of the Day the t h i r d reading of the Government Preference Prohibition Bill ; and, following it , he put three notices of motion. Surely he did not expect to get to those motions. If he did, where were his wits ?",46
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,B y what wit could we have arranged our business better ?,46
290,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We are showing the Prime Minister that he does not possess the w it that he thought he possessed when he stated in Sydney that there was a battle of wits taking place here, and that he was winning. He considered it a wm when he prevented us from debating a motion of censure by enforcing the rule that, when two hours had elapsed jifter the meeting of the House, the discussion of motions must cease. Now he is "" hoist with his own petard.""",46
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We have to put up with a lot when we come into contact with an unintelligent, stubborn, and unpatriotic Opposition.",46
292,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This is a sample of the Prime Minister's refined speech, which we are to imitate, I suppose, on these uncultured benches.",47
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I withdraw what I said.,47
294,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is very we should deal with the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill , which contains only twenty-four clauses and three schedules. We want to give power to Committees to compel persons to give evidence before them.",47
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Has the honourable member ever, in his parliamentary experience, known a courtesy like this to be refused to a Government?",47
296,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is a straight question. I ask, in my turn , has the honourable gentleman ever known a Government to avail itself of a majority of one to place the motions of the Opposition on the notice-paper where they cannot be dealt with? Has he ever known a Government, anywhere in the wide world, to treat a Speaker as you, sir, are being treated, by the action of the Prime M in ister in refusing to allow certain motions to be discussed ?",47
297,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable'member should not bring into the discussion the occupant of the chair.,47
298,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I beg your pardon, sir. The Prime Minister kept us sitting continuously for three days last week, ruining our constitutions. He showed us no courtesy then. When I asked him to let me go home, to gain the benefits of Tired Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep, he would not do so. Now that I am strong again, why should I consider his request? The Parliamentary Witnesses Bill , like the revision of the Tariff, and some other measures, is a matter of importance, which ought to be dealt with before other measures which are not permitted to be named, but which have taken up a great deal of the time of the country. What does the Prime Minister think Parliament is for? Does he think that it is like one of those machines in the Chicago Meat Works, in which a pig is placed at one end and comes out at the other end converted into sausages? of the Orders of the Day which he desires to postpone is that of Supply. When we reach Supply, I desire to deal with the question of Defence, and the failure of Major-General Sir I a n Hamilton to in clude in his report any observations as to the wisdom of compelling boys of tender years to undergo military training. I should like to have his opinion as to whether it is right to make such boys march 20 miles, as was done at Lilydale necessary that the other day.",47
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I submit, Mr. Speaker, that the only question which the honourable member may discuss is that of whether these Orders of the Day shall be postponed.",47
300,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was about to call the honourable member's attention to the fact that he is wandering from the question before the Chair, and is not in order in doing so.",47
301,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am offering reasons why these Orders of the Day should not be postponed. There are several items of Supply with which I should like to deal. There is, first of all , the question of Defence.",47
302,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The motion before the Chair is that the Orders of the Day be postponed, and the honourable member must confine himself to the question of postponement. He will not be in order in discussing the Orders of the Day which it is proposed to postpone.",47
303,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,On e of my reasons for objecting to the postponement of the Orders of the Day is that I wish to discuss the question of Defence.,47
304,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member will not be in order in discussing the various matters covered by the term "" Supply."" The question of Defence might very properly be discussed on a Supply motion; but the only question before the Chair is that certain Orders of the Day, including Supply, be postponed. The honourable member must confine his remarks to the question of postponement.",47
305,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was in hopes that we might discuss various matters covered by Supply, which opened up a pleasing vista; but you have brought me - back, Mr . Speaker, to the question of the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill . What is the Prime Minister's object in submitting this motion ?",47
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I wish to brin g some business before the House. One Mr HIGGS - What business?,47
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The proposal to deal with trusts, amongst other things.",47
308,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Will the honourable gentleman take, first of all, the Bill relating to trusts?",47
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We shall take it its order.,48
310,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Some honourable memthat bers are extremely anxious to deal with follows:the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill , but I should be quite willing to withdraw my opposition to this motion if the Prime Minister would agree to deal, first of all, with the Bill relating to trusts. The adjustment sooner we reach that measure the better.",48
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The member does not want to reach it .,48
312,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When the Minister Trade and Customs told us that he had the Beef Trust under his observation, we rectification did not expect that he would bring down a Bill to deal with it for another three or four years; but he has given notice motion for leave to bring in a Bill ing to it , and if the Prime Minister assure me that he will deal with it this afternoon I shall no longer oppose the motion. What is there about the Postal Vote Restoration Bill that we should convenience ourselves? Have we not come here full y prepared to deal with Parliamentary Witnesses Bill , which far more important than is the first Order of the Day? The Prime Minister should have so ordered the business-paper as render it unnecessary for us to raise these objections. Out of consideration for him, nexion. I shall refrain from speaking f ther at this stage; but if the motion be agreed tb, I hope to give a few reasons why the honourable gentleman should not have leave to introduce the Postal Vote Restoration Bill .",48
313,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Cook) [4.42] - I move That the following words be inserted after Item No. the word "" That"" :"" Orders of the Day 2 and 3 be postponed, and Order of the Day No. 4 be taken into consideration, to permit anomalies in the Tariff being considered forthwith."" The Prime Minister, in the course of the 170(B) policy speech which he delivered at Parra- matta, made a definite proposal that the anomalies in the Tariff should be immediately rectified. I propose to quote from that speech, and to refer, also, to a conber siderable volume of correspondence which came to me from factories in my must electorate some time ago, showing that it the motion. is urgently necessary that the anomalies in the Tariff be rectified. The Prime Minister, who was then should not be postponed. Leader of the Opposition, delivered what is known as his policy speech in matta, and it is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 4th A p r i l , 1913. In speech he referred to the matter as Meantime we propose to deal with the Tariff in the same way as in almost every civilized country in the world. It must no longer be the tool of parties. Its proper and reasonable should be suggested by experts who are absolutely disinterested, and with due and proper regard for the interests of all concerned. honourable That is a general statement, and he went on to make a definite statement dealing of with T a r i ff anomaliesThis .need not and will not prevent a prompt of such anomalies as are discovered by the Department in its administration. of By that definite statement the whole of relatthe manufacturing interests and their dewill pendent industries, as well as the great bulk of the people who believe in fostering Australian industries, were led to believe that there would be an immediate in - rectification of T a r i ff anomalies. The Labour party has been charged the with not dealing sufficiently with this is question when they were in office. As a matter of fact, the Labour Government dealt with it at very considerable length; to and I think this is an opportune time to place on record what they did in this conThe following lengthy stateu r - ment will show what was done:Commonwealth of Australia. CUSTOMS TARIFF. Principal items, from the Protective standpoint, dealt with by the Customs Tariffs 1910 and 1911 :-CUSTOMS TARIFF, 1910. Article. 1910 Act. Previously.

314,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable memis not in order in going into all these particulars on a motion of this k in d ; he deal with either the amendment or,48
315,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I propose to show that this Order of the Day is urgent, and To do so, I wish to discuss the T a r i ff generally, to at Parraj u s t if y my proposal.",48
316,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable gentleman will not be in order in discussing the Tariff schedule.,49
317,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then , I submit that I shall be in order in dealing with correspondence which shows that the matter is urgent.",49
318,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That depends on the nature of the correspondence.,49
319,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If I am not allowed to quote correspondence showing that an amendment of the Tariff is urgent, I cannot give honourable members justification for voting for my amendment. Some of the factory owners in the Cook electorate have communicated with me in regard to various items covered by the following:-Glas s manufactures, barrow wheels, stoves, sash weights, condiments, rope, cordage, binder twine, leather, straw hats, chemists' foods, carbide of calcium, paper, waterproof garments, bevelled and silvered plates, paints, clay pipes, chalks, basket and wicker ware. At the Alexandra end of the Cook electorate there are some bottle works, and it has been found that, by an anomaly in the Tariff, filled bottles are permitted to into Australia.",49
320,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The debate the honourable member is now initiating would be perfectly in order in considering a proposal to introduce a Tariff measure. The honourable member, however, appears to have forgotten the proposal before the Chair. He must confine himself now to the amendment he has moved or to the motion which was originally proposed. In doing that he will not be in order in opening up the whole question of Tariff anomalies and diverting the debate to that subject.",49
321,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is proposed to postpone Orders of the Day Nos. 2, 3, and 4.",49
322,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The subject to be discussed is the postponement of the Orders of the Day.,49
323,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes ; and one of the Orders of. the Day that it is proposed to postpone is a motion to go into Committee of Ways and Means, which would permit of the Tariff being dealt with.",49
324,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member will not be in order in discussing the question of Ways and Means.,49
325,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am merely pointing out to the House the proposal that is before the Chair.,49
326,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not in order in proceeding on his present lines.,49
327,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My amendment proposes that the motion to go into Committee of Ways and Means shall not be postponed, but shall forthwith be moved with the distinct purpose in view of a rectification of Tariff anomalies. A Tariff is always introduced in a Committee of Ways and Means; and my proposal is that only two of the Orders of the Day shall be postponed, and that the third one, namely, to go into Committee of Ways and Means, shall forthwith be proceeded with. Why should the Tariff not be considered ? The Government haye no other business properly before us for this sitting; if and they had they would go on with it . It is only by the will of the House that the Orders of the Day can be postponed, and the Government given an opportunity to introduce altogether different business. come The Government have not taken the precaution to have proper business before the Chamber. Four or five days ago the Government knew that the vote on the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was to be taken at 4 o'clock, and they had ample opportunity to prepare any business they desired. The Prime Minister, however, who is supposed to possess all the wits of the community, and to be a great strategist, confesses that he has no business to go on with, except by courtesy of the Opposition.",49
328,Mr BUHNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What courtesy have the Government shown us?,49
329,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Not much; we have had very short shrift, but that does not prevent the Prime Minister asking concessions at our hands. I submit that this is the proper time to deal with the Tariff, and we have all the hours before us up to midnight. If honourable members are prepared to come to a vote on my amendment, I am ready to resume my seat immediately. It appears that I am not in order in showing the extent to which the Fisher Government rectified Tariff anomalies, or in dealing with the strong appeals that have come to me on behalf of the manufacturing interests in the Cook electorate.",49
330,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I submit that the amendment is out of order. It is to the effect that a certain order of the day may be taken into consideration, so that an opportunity may be furnished for the consideration of anomalies in the Tariff "" for t h with ."" The amendment is out of order inasmuch as it is impossible of realization even if carried. There cannot be any consideration of the Tariff unless tliere is first a covering message to make that consideration possible.",50
331,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We shall deal with that point when it arises.,50
332,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We cannot with it at any time without a message. The proposal is to deal with the Tariff anomalies "" for t h with ,"" and I submit that, as that is impossible, the proposal is out of order.",50
333,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I rule that the amendment is in order.,50
334,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If I am not permitted to deal in detail with the rectification of Tariff anomalies, I may be ""permitted briefly to point out some of the questions involved.",50
335,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Le t the Government do as much as the Fisher Government did !,50
336,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Government are not prepared to do anything. We have an announcement from the Opposition that they are prepared to go on with business of a non-party character which affects the vital interests of the country; and we find the Prime Minister trying to shelve that business on a point of order. In the newspapers a few days ago there was a statement to the effect that stoves are being imported by Anthony Hordern and Sons, of Sydney, that are obtained at a lower price on board in London than they can be manufactured for, at cost price, in Sydney. Thus we have in the Cook electorate an industry that is being subjected to dumping and unfair competition at the hands of large manufacturers in England. The firm to which I refer employs between 200 and 300 men in Sydney, and at their other places throughout the Commonwealth some 800 men. Surely this is a matter that does not require any investigation by the Inter-State Commission, for the facts are self evident. The mere proof of a statement of that kind should be sufficient to induce any Government that has the welfare of the people of Australia at heart to bring forward a rectification of anomalies in the Tariff which can be proved beyond question. Then there is another industry, the iron industry.",50
337,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I must again call the attention of the honourable member to the fact that he is not in order in particularizing the various industries that he proposes should be made the subject of legislation regarding Tariff anomalies. The honourable member will only be in order in making a general reference to the whole subject.,50
338,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then I shall just indicate the industries which are affected, deal and the articles affected, without giving justification for the rectification of the Tariff upon tliem.",50
339,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member will not be in order in giving those details. He can deal with the matter in a general way only.,50
340,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Can I indicate the lines of the Tariff that should be dealt with ?,50
341,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Certainl y not.,50
342,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My amendment in dicates that certain Tariff anomalies should be dealt with, and I wish to say what they are.",50
343,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member would be in order in doing so when Tariff anomalies come up for discussion, but, under cover of an amendment of this kind, to such a motion as is before the Chair, the honourable member cannot specifically mention a number of articles, and thus debate the general question of Tariff revision.",50
344,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"-The proposal is that there should be a direction to the Government to rectify certain Tariff anomalies, and it is absolutely essential that I should indicate the anomalies that need to be rectified.",50
345,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member can do it in a general way only. He cannot go into particulars.,50
346,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I cannot refer to the manufacture of wheelbarrows in a general way. I must simply say "" wheelbarrows,"" though I do not propose to go into details.",50
347,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,To do. that would be an evasion of the ruling .,50
348,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to ask the House to give an indication to the Government that certain Tariff anomalies should be rectified. I do not ask to be permitted to go into details, but I wish to indicate some of the items where - rectification should take place.",50
349,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If I permitted the honourable member to do that, the honourable member could select a few items, and other honourable members could select a few more, and so a debate upon the whole Tariff would be raised, which obviously would be out of order.",51
350,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The ruling has circumscribed my remarks very considerably.,51
351,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am sorry, but it cannot be helped.",51
352,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My amendment is that the Order of the Day-Way s and Means-shoul d be gone on with in order to permit of the rectification of Tariff anomalies. If I am not permitted to briefly refer to the items which should be dealt with, I am not permitted to give justification for accepting my amendment.",51
353,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The procedure the honourable member suggests would involve the opening up of the whole fiscal question.,51
354,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What follows my action is of no consequence so long as my remarks are to the point.,51
355,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member's amendment is moved on a definite motion for the postponement of certain Orders of the Day, and he is not in order upon such an amendment in doing anything but speak in a general way upon the matter, of the rectification of Tariff anomalies. The honourable member must not traverse my ruling . He must abide by it .",51
356,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There seems to be nothing for it but to do so. I shall go back to the point of the promise made by the Prime Minister to have these anomalies rectified, which promise was also nade by the Minister of Trade and Customs and by the Postmaster-General. Y e t nothiag is being done - The Government have referred the matter to 'the Inter-State Commission, and we are told that no anomalies are to be rectified until that Commission brings in its report. When the matter was brought up on a former occasion, the Minister of Trade and Customs stated that 463 applications for Tariff protection had been sent in to the Inter-State Commission. Does not that show that tliere is a very strong desire throughout Australia that there should be rectification of Tariff anomalies? If there were no anomalies in the Tariff, if Australian industries were not suffering, there would not be this multitude of applications from the various industries. According to the Minister of Trade and Customs, 149 of these matters have been dealt with, and 320 witnesias have been heard by the Commission, and that evidence has been taken in Victoria only. Then, how many witnesses will be required in connection with the 463 applications? There will be at least 1,000 witnesses to be examined in Victoria alone. When the Minister was challenged that this investigation would take a long time, and that considerable time must elapse before a report was brought in , he ™i d that the Tariff could not be dealt with until these matters had been investigated in every State. Therefore the 1,000' Victorian witnesses must be multiplied by six, for the Inter-State Commission has to go to every State for evidence. At the present rate of progress there will be no report presented in the life of this Parliament nor in that of the next. What do we see in the meantime? Unemployed all over Australia. In my electorate there are many appeals to me to try to find men work, but I am unable to do it . I see that there are about two or three thousand unemployed at Ballarat.",51
357,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Not quite so many as that. I sbould say that the number is about 500.,51
358,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If we multiply that number at Ballarat by the number of cities in Australia proportionately, we shall see that there is a big army of unemployed. The honourable member for Fawkner took part in a deputation the other day showing that there were very many unemployed in Melbourne, and the same thing applies in Sydney. Why should there not be a rectification of the Tariff anomalies that will provide the unemployed with work ? This time of the year, when there is the greatest suffering from unemployment, is an opportune occasion for the House to give a direction to the Government that these - anomalies in the Tariff should be rectified. There is no escape for the Government in the matter. They propose to go on with the Bill to provide for postal voting. Important as postal voting may be, there is not likely' to be an election for some considerable time, because it is the last thing in creation the Government wish for. Postal voting therefore cannot come into operation for some considerable time, and, in the meantime, workmen are out of work. Postal voting will not feed the workless' hungry, nor clothe them, nor light their fires, nor put food in their cupboards.",51
359,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the people get postal voting, why do they want work ?",52
360,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No doubt, for many Liberal agents and touts at election time, the postal voting system would provide work at raking in votes. I have quoted from the speech made by the Prime Minister at Parramatta last year jusb prior to the election, and there was also a speech made by the present Minister of Trade and Customs at Toowoomba, and published in the Toowoomba Chronicle on the 8th A p r i l , 1913. This speech by the Minister is headed "" Advertisement,"" and occupies six columns of the newspaper. It is clear that it is a carefully prepared speech sent in to the paper, and paid for at so much an inch. Let us see what the Minister had to say in his statement to the electors. A TARIFF BOARH NKCESSART. In every debate Parliament has been hampered in considering Tariff measures from lack of accurate and complete information. With different industries in different States, and these industries in different parts of a vast Commonwealth, Parliament as a whole has not been able to do adequate justice. I cannot agree with that statement entirely. Honourable members represent every constituency. When the debate takes place in regard to the Tariff I have information to put before honourable members respecting industries in my own electorate, and I presume that is the case with every honourable member. Why , therefore, the need to send this roving Commission through the length and breadth of Australia to inquire into the Tariff when every honourable member must take the responsibility of standing by the interests of the constituents he represents, and of Australia generally? As far as I am concerned, what the Inter-State Commission recommends will not make much difference. If I consider it my duty to vote in favour of Protection for certain industries in my electorate, do honourable members think that the report of the Inter-State Commission to the contrary would affect me? I would boot the report under the table. [61]",52
361,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There are a lot of things that ought to be on the free list.,52
362,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"1 agree with the honourable member. While I say that goods which can be manufactured in Australia ought to have adequate Protection, I also say that there are a number of other items that ought to be placed on the free list, because they cannot be manufactured in Australia, and the duty on them is placing a burden on the people.",52
363,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member is again discussing the Tariff question.,52
364,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am pointing out anomalies. One anomaly is that there is not enough Protection on goods that can be manufactured in Australia; and another anomaly is that duties are collected on articles which cannot be manufactured in Australia, and the people are being called on to bear an unnecessarily heavy burden. Those anomalies should be wiped out. Even the Prime Minister said that-revenue duties should be wiped out. This is what the honourable member said in a speech reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 4th A p r i l , 1913I should add, further, that since becoming the responsible leader of the party I have been inundated with appeals from all sorts of people as to what I propose to do to bring .down the cost of living, and, at the same time, intimating that, in their opinion, the present high cost of living is' the direct and sole result of the present Tariff. I do not hesitate to say, without discussing the subject fully, that I am hopeful an expert investigation of the Tariff may lead to a substantial reduction in the purely revenue duties of the present Tariff schedule. That is what the Prime Minister proposed under the heading "" Reducing the Cost of L i v in g . "" We know perfectly well that there are a number of Tariff items about which there cannot be any dispute for five minutes. They are purely revenue-producing duties, and the Prime Minister, who has taken a prominent part in Tariff debates in this Parliament, knows perfectly well that he will see, as soon as he looks at the Tariff schedule, a number of duties which are not Protective, but are purely revenue-producing. I was proceeding to deal with the statement of the Minister of Trade and Customs in the Toowoomba Chronicle, in which he said that this matter was to be referred to the Inter-State Commission, and I indicated that, so fa r as I was concerned, the report of the Commission would not necessarily affect me. I am not alone in that attitude. Mr Deakin, who has been looked upon as the leader of the Protectionist forces, made a similar statement in connection with a previous Tariff Commission. On 15th December, 1904, Mr . Deakin made the following statement (Hansard, p. 8618): Personally, I decline to be bound by port, or by that of any other Commission, and that is why I take no exception to its personnel. Ho took no exception to the personnel of the previous Commission, because he did not intend to be bound by its report. Apar t from the personnel of the Inter-State Commission, does anybody think that honourable members will be bound by its report if that report does not suit them ? I say that no honourable member will take any notice of the recommendations of the Commission if those recommendations do not suit them and the interests they represent. We are told by the Minister of Trade and Customs that we are not to have the evidence, but that we must take the conclusions of the Commission. There are three members on the Commission, the central figure being Mr . Piddington. Those of us who come from New South Wales know that that gentleman is a confirmed Pree Trader. there is a division of opinion between the members, Mr Swinburne being on one side ",52
365,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member is proceeding further than he is entitled to do.,53
366,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Well , without discussing the personnel of the Inter-State Commission, I say that to ask the House to simply take the recommendations of the Commission without having the evidence, and without knowing whether the Commission is divided in its opinions or not, is a most ridiculous proposition. The whole purpose of the inquiry into Tariff anomalies in the way proposed by the Government is surely to produce evidence, and who is to be satisfied with the evidence? Not this House, but the Inter-State Commission. And because the Commission is satisfied with the evidence, does it mean that this House is to be satisfied also, without having an opportunity of studying the evidence ? To me it is more important to have the evidence and not the recommendations of the Commission, than it is to have the recommendations and not the evidence. I should be prepared to payconsiderable attention to the evidence taken by the Commission, but I should give very little consideration to the recommendations of that body. I  ton and Mr Swinburne on these matters. My electors sent me to this House beits recause they know what opinions I hold on the Tariff question, and I am prepared to decide on the evidence and not to allow the Inter-State Commission to think for me. Then the Minister of Trade and Customs proceeded in that speech which was published as an advertisement in the Toowoomba Chronicle of 8th A p r i l , 1913There is need for an impartial tribunal to keep constantly in touch with the great spheres bf production, manufacture, and imortation so as' to advise Parliament with nowledge on a thoroughly scientific basis. I agree with that. When we have rectified the whole of the anomalies, it would be a good thing for the manufacturers to be able to submit information to the Inter-State Commission, so that the Commission could put that information in such a form that it could be dealt with in - ^ telligently by honourable members, but the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission should not be held up in the first place. If The speech of the Minister of Trade and Customs continuedWith such _ a board Parliament can carry out policy^ with knowledge, and so give each State justice in the application of policy-to have an Australian Tariff for an Australian nation. The Liberal party, including Proteetionists and Free Traders, having accepted Protection as their ""policy, have agreed that the policy of the present Commonwealth Tariff as determined by the electors is to be maintained. The honourable member made that statement, and it has been dissented from . The honourable member for Parkes, in a considered letter written to the Sydney Daily Telegraph, denied this absolutely. He did not accept the present Protectionist policy; all he agreed to was a rectification of Departmental anomalies, not in the Protectionist direction, but i u regard to items in the Tariff respecting which it had been clearly shown that mistakes had been made. This is a totally different thing from the rectification of anomalies in a Protectionist direction. Other honourable members on the Government side are in a similar position. The honourable member for Werriwa said that he came into Parliament on a Free Trade reaction. The honourable member for Calare stated that he came here as a Free Trader, and it is a significant fact that the previous member for Calare, who had always been a Free Trader, but pledged himself to the Fisher policy of a Protectionist Tariff, should have been defeated, and that another gentleman who is a hot-headed Free Trader should have been returned. Both those honourable members have made astatement in the House that they will not be a party to the rectification of the Tariff in a Protectionist direction. Let me quote further from the statement of the Minister of Trade and CustomsA permanent non-political body shall be constituted, having statutory authority to(a) supervise and report to Parliament respecting industrial production and commercial exchange, also the working of the Tariff, its operation and effect upon investment of capital, and the employment of labour in Australian industries. (b) to make recommendations from time to time for the adjustment and revision of the Tariff in all cases of proved necessity with due regard to the interests of all sections of the community. And this is the point I wish to lay particular stress uponIn the meantime any anomalies or inconsistencies that may be discovered in the schedules of the present Tariff are to be dealt with as soon as practicable. We know perfectly well that when the honourable gentleman came into office an investigation as to Tariff anomalies had been proceeding. A f t e r the Fisher Government had dealt with the Tariff, and a long list of anomalies had been considered and removed and additional protection granted to Australian industries, the then Minister had lists printed, and gave an indication to the manufacturers of Australia that he would be glad to have evidence as to any further anomalies, with a view to their prompt rectification. The manufacturers all over Australia wrote into the Department for those forms, which they filled in and returned. So that when the present Government took office there was information ready to hand in the Department from the manufacturers of Australia regarding Tariff anomalies. Twelve months ago the Government were in a position to proceed with the rectification of the Tariff anomalies, and they are in the position to do it today. The Prime Minister took me up on a point of order a little while ago by saying that the Go[61]- 3 vernment were not in a position to proceed with this matter forthwith. I say that the Government are in a position to proceed with it forthwith. If it were possible for this House to resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole, and appoint one of its number to go to the Customs Department and get particulars of the proved anomalies of which the. Department has knowledge, the rectification of those anomalies could proceed this very day, and there is nothing to prevent that being done, except the obstacles created through the present Ministers being in . office. Reverting to the shelving of the Tariff question by placing it in the hands of this long-winded legal tribunal, I would remind honourable members that the Government said they were going to appoint a board of practical business men. That was stated by both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs. Those gentlemen knew perfectly well that the Inter-State Commission Bill had been passed, and if they were not referring to some different body, which was to deal with the Tariff questionj why did they not say that they proposed to hand it over to the Inter-State Commission?",53
367,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member will not be in order in dealing with that matter.,54
368,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish simply to point out that even the obstacle of the Inter-State Commission would not have been in the way if the Government had carried out their election pledges, and appointed a few business men to inquire into this matter, without that long-windedness which generally characterizes investigations by legal tribunals. The Minister of Trade and Customs played on some fine phrases in making his speech upon the Tariff question. He talked about Australian industries, the interests of the Australian nation, the interests of all classes of the community, the urgency of the Tariff, and anomalies being rectified forthwith. And yet the Government have been in office twelve months, and have attempted to do nothing. There is no attempt to go on with genuine business, though I assume that a majority on each side is prepared to deal with the Tariff. The honourable members for Wimmera"" and Gippsland were returned as Protectionists. Are they not prepared to allow Tariff anomalies to be dealt with forthwith.? Both honourable members are silent.",54
369,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member for Gippsland succeeded a real Protectionist.,55
370,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Ha d his predecessor, Mr Wise, been here, the amendment would have had his enthusiastic support. At the next election the voters of Gippsland will know how to distinguish between the friends and enemies of the Tariff. A f t e r the pre-sessional speeches, to which I have referred, the Government met Parliament, and on 13th July, 1913, - put forward a programme in this House in which the following statement occurred:It is the intention of the Government to maintain the accepted protective policy. The Inter-State Commission has already been appointed, and, in addition to fulfilling its stitutional duties, it will supervise and to Parliament with respect to industrial production and commercial exchange. It will also inquire into the working of the Tariff and its operation and effect upon the investment of capital and the employment of labour in Australian industries. It will make recommendations from time to time for the adjustment and revision of - the Tariff, due regard being had to the interests of all sections of the community. In the meantime, any anomalies discovered in the existing Tariff will be dealt with. What does "" in the meantime "" mean? Does it mean any time between now and the day of judgment?",55
371,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It means that the Government promised to rectify anomalies before the Inter-State Commission made its report, and it has broken that promise.",55
372,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It has doubly broken its promise. It did nothing for the rectification of Tariff anomalies in the 1913 session, and has attempted to do nothing this session. The Prime Minister, when seeking the suffrages of the people of Parramatta, was enthusiastic about the rectification of anomalies, and the reduction of the cost of living by removing revenue duties from the backs of the people; and the Minister of Trade and Customs spoke about building up Australian industries, and waved aloft the flag of Protection. When the Ministry took office, it found in the Customs Department a schedule of anomalies left there by the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, but notwithstanding the statement in its programme of business, nothing was done in regard to the Tariff during 1913, although it cannot be said that Government business was obstructed at all. The Government was able to pass Bills providing for the creation of a Public Works Committee and a Public Accounts Committee, and a dozen other measures of comparatively small importance ; but it made no attempt to deal w itb Tariff anomalies. Now it has allegedly discovered that it cannot continue to carry on, and has asked the House to pass Bills to create an unnatural dispute with the Senate, a course never contemplated by the Constitution, in the hope of prevailing upon the Governor General to grant a double dissolution. Ministers do this because they have no policy, and are supported by a crowd whose political opinions resemble a patchwork quilt, and are of every shade. Some of the Ministerialists con- are Revenue Tariifists, others are Protecreport tionists; others, again, would use the Tariff partly, to obtain revenue, and partly to protect industries, but they cannot resolve their differences. The honourable member for Werriwa has declared that if the Government dared to proceed with the Tariff he would fight for Free Trade. We know what that would mean. The honourable member talks without l i m it , and three like him would make it very difficult to do anything with the Tariff. The honourable members for Parkes and Calare, and several other Ministerialists, are also Free Traders. Thus the position of the Government is one of impotence. It has a majorit y of one only in this House. Were the honourable member for Werriwa to speak at length against any T a r i ff proposal, he could not be ""gagged,"" because, if offended, he would walk out of the chamber and leave the Government without a majority. Every member behind the Government is pulling a different way, and Ministers are trying to bring about a double dissolution in the hope of finding an issue on which to appeal to the country and consolidate.",55
373,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is again digressing.,55
374,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have here indisputable evidence of the need for the rectification of Tariff anomalies which particularly concern my electorate. I have taken several opportunities to induce the Government to go on 'with this matter. Last year, when an amendment was moved to the Address-in-Reply, censuring the Government for several things, the repudiation of pledges in connection with the Tariff was particularly mentioned. I have also moved the adjournment of the House to ask that Tariff matters be dealt with, but the motion was talked out. Now bhat the Government is without business to proceed with, I ask honourable members to direct that the Tariff matter shall be dealt with. I shall not occupy the whole of the time allowed to me by the standing order, because I .wish to have a vote on this question, in order to test the feeling of the House upon it'. Why should the Government be allowed, for party interests, to prevent the House from dealing with the Tariff, when an overwhelming majority is prepared to deal with it? Ministers are absent from the chamber, trying to discover some point of order which, will prevent a vote being taken, and if they cannot do that they will either have the question side-tracked, by the moving of some further amendment,- or will put up supporters to talk it out. The electors will be able to judge by the Government's lack of ' earnestness on the Tariff question whether Ministers are in earnest on any matter making for the welfare of the people.",55
375,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [5.45] - It must be very gratifying to the honourable member for Cook to pose as the one great Protectionist of the House.,56
376,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does this close the debate ?,56
377,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is the Prime Minister speaking to the amendment?,56
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am speaking generally.,56
379,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Anothe r honourable member rose when I called the Prime,56
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not propose to allow any one else to speak. I regard the amendment as purely obS t I'll C11VG,56
381,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I called the Prime Minister under the impression that he wished to speak to the amendment. If he does not intend to do so, any other honourable member wishing to speak has the right to speak first. Otherwise, the Prime Minister, in speaking, will close the debate.",56
382,Mr IISNTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Prime Minister wishes to close the debate. Mr. JOSEPH CO OK - Certainly . It is my duty to close it at the earliest possible moment.,56
383,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I cannot allow the Prime Minister to do that.,56
384,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I had begun to speak before a point of order was taken.,56
385,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I called the honourable gentleman under the impression that he rose to speak to the amendment.,56
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to speak now; and, if I can do so, to close the debate.",56
387,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member, by again speaking to the motion, would interfere with the rights of others who are entitled to be heard if they so desire. It is not the province of the Speaker to close the mouths of others who desire to speak by calling upon the mover of a motion to reply,, so as to shut the mouths of other honourable members.",56
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,May I not speak at all?,56
389,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes ; the honourable member may speak to the amendment; by so doing, he will not be closing the debate.",56
390,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to close it, and it is my duty to close a debate of this kind, if I can. The one good thing that will come of this debate is that it will be but another indication to the people of the absolute unworkability of this Parliament.",56
391,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then dissolve it !,56
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Le t the honourable member hold his peace a little while and we shall do our best to accommodate him. The justification for the course which the Government are pursuing is being demonstrated more and more every day by the Opposition. I refer to ' the fact that, apart altogether from test Bills, the Opposition decline absolutely to do the country's business, be it what it may.",56
393,Mr ARTHUB,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Giv e us a chance.,56
394,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have been trying for some time to give the Opposi- tion a chance. I wish to deal with the business of the country today, but the Opposition have declined to permit it to be dealt with. They absolutely insist that a motion for leave to introduce a Bill which has to do with the Beef Trust shall be pushed aside while they discuss the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill. Mr J. H. CATTS - Not amendment relates to the Tariff.",56
395,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That amendment was moved only because the Opposition found that they could not talk exhaustively to the original motion. It was moved only when they, found that they could not otherwise go ahead with their wildly obstructive tactics.",57
396,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is the Prime Minister in order in saying that we have been pursuing obstructive tactics?,57
397,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the Prime Minister made that statement, I ask him to withdraw it .",57
398,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I withdraw it .,57
399,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is perfectly true, all the same. Mr JOSE PH COOK - A m I not in order in saying that the effect of this conduct on the part of the Opposition is to obstruct the business which the Government have upon the business-paper ?",57
400,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to a point of order. A f t e r the Prime Minister had withdrawn the remark to which exception was taken, the honourable member for Wimmera interjected, "" It is quite true, all the same."" I ask that that statement be withdrawn - member to",57
401,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I did not hear the interjection, but if the honourable member for Wimmera made such an imputation, I ask him to withdraw it ",57
402,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Standing Orders require the withdrawal of a statement to which exception is taken, and I therefore withdraw the remark. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The obvious intention of honourable members opposite is to prevent the Government getting on with the business of which they have given notice.",57
403,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Government gave notice of one of these Orders of the Day months ago.,57
404,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member for Cook has just spoken.,57
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"He has just concluded a speech extending over an hour, yet here he is again chattering like a magpie.",57
406,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Kee p smiling ! Mr JOSE PH COOK - Well , I shall repeat, in my calmest tones, that the object of this proposal on the part of the Opposition is to prevent the Government proceeding with their business as they desire to do. In all my parliamentary experience I have never known a Governat all; my ment to be prevented from taking their own business in their own way and order.",57
407,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The . honourable member has done the same thing many a time.,57
408,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have not, and I have not known it to be done before. The ordinary courtesies to which the Government are entitled at the hands of the House are denied us every day by the Opposition. And for what purpose ? To prevent the consideration of Government business upon the notice-paper, which includes a measure affecting the Beef Trust. The Opposition tell us that the Beef Trust most urgently demands our attention, yet they are now blocking a Bill relating to it . They are using all the forms of the House.of which they can avail themselves to prevent its consideration. And they are doing this in order that the House may consider the supreme and pressing importance of a Parliamentary Witnesses Bill . Was ever political insincerity carried further? Was a political farce such as this ever enacted before in the history of civilized government ?",57
409,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ask the honourable withdraw the words "" political Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do so. Rule the statement out of order as many times as you like, sir, the obvious fact remains that the Opposition absolutely decline this day to consider the proposal of the Government to deal with a trust which the Opposition themselves say is in j u r in g the people, committing depredations upon the community, and engaging in a sinister attempt to force up prices. By their actions, and by their voices, the Opposition declare, when the Government make a proposal to deal with that very trouble, that the Parliamentary W i tnesses Bill is of far more importance.",57
410,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Government cannot deal with the trust until we pass an effective Parliamentary Witnesses Bill .,57
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We cannot deal with any Bill until it has been introduced, and the Opposition are preventing the possibility of considering a Bill relating to trusts by blocking Government business in order that trumpery mxtters may be discussed.",57
412,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is Tariff revision a trumpery matter ?,57
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not referring to the Tariff. That question has been switched on to cover the real purpose of the Opposition, which is to block the Government from pushing on with the business of the country, whether it relates to the Tariff or to anything else. They are out to prevent the Government doing any business whatever. If we came down now with a proposal to consider any part of the Tariff, this obstruction on the part of the Opposition would go on just the same.",57
414,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There might be obstruction on the part of the honourable member for Werriwa.,58
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Before the honourable member tries to take the mote out of the eye of the honourable member for Werriwa, let him take the beam out of the eye of the honourable member for Grey, who lodged an objection today, and told us plainly that he must be left out of the category of those'who desire to consider Tariff anomalies. How many more of the Opposition are in the same position? Is the honourable member for West Sydney anxious to consider Tariff anomalies? Is the honourable member for Cook himself burning with a desire to deal with them?",58
416,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Burning .,58
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member for Cook has been all through his electorate telling his constituents plainly time and again that he will vote all the duties down on everything relating to the breakfast table.,58
418,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have not.,58
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member has said so many times.,58
420,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I deny that.,58
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member has said that he will vote to bring down all - the duties on foodstuffs and everything relating to the breakfast table.,58
422,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to order. The Prime Minister is misrepresenting me. I have denied his statement, and I ask that my denial be accepted by him.",58
423,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is customary for an honourable member to accept another honourable member's denial of the correctness of a statement attributed to him. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The parliamentary rule requires me to accept the honourable member's denial. I have repeatedly read statements by the honourable member for Cook that he would vote to bring down the duties on all those things that relate to the workers' table.,58
424,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member is misrepresenting me, and refuses to accept my denial.",58
425,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I understood the Prime Minister to say that he had read certain statements.,58
426,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I deny it .,58
427,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member cannot deny the Prime Minister's statement that he has read certain things, but he may deny that he uttered the statements attributed to him.",58
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I go further, and say that I have heard the honourable member in this House declare that it was time that the duties were taken off some bf these things.",58
429,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Revenu e duties only.,58
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,No ; not revenue duties.,58
431,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable gentleman is telling an u n truth.,58
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I heard the honourable member enumerate the duties which, in his opinion, should come down.",58
433,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is saying what is not true.,58
434,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,58
435,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I withdraw it , and say that the honourable member's statement is incorrect. I ask that my denial be accepted, and that the Prime Minister shall not persist in misrepresenting me.",58
436,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have already pointed out that it is the practice of the House to accept an honourable member's denial of something attributed to him. I ask the Prime Minister to observe that practice, and, at the same time, I call upon honourable members to cease interjecting.",58
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We are entitled to ask whether this amendment has the support of the Leader of the Opposition? Has it his countenance? When we are considering Government business the right honourable gentleman is constantly absent. Members of his party are continually taking the work of the Leader of the Opposition out of his hands, and moving irresponsible motion after irresponsible motion. Is it not time that we heard from him on this matter ? Who is the Leader of the Opposition,. I should like to know ?",58
438,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Andre w Fisher.,58
439,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There he is the honourable member for Cook. It is time that we knew whether a proposal of this kind has behind it the authority or the Opposition. I have never seen anything like this before. The Leader of the Opposition is constantly out of the chamber, while irresponsible members of his party are proposing to take the business out of the hands of the Government. If the amendment has his support it is another motion of censure. As it is we can afford to treat it with the contempt it deserves.",58
440,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Prime Miuister has been out of the chamber nearly all the afternoon.,59
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I hope that'no one on this side of the House will attempt to play pranks, like honourable members opposite are doing, while I happen to be out of the chamber. Where is the Leader of the Opposition ? A m I not entitled to ask whether this proposal has his support ? It has been the rule since constitutional government began to ask whether such a proposition has the support of the Leader of the Opposition. A proposal kind ought not to have been moved in his absence.",59
442,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He was present whsn it was submitted.,59
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then why is he not here? Why can I not obtain from him a statement as to whether or not the amendment has his approval?,59
444,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,If the Prime Minister had been here in time he could have obtained it .,59
445,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Has the honourable member sent for the Leader of the Opposition ? I think I am entitled to ask that questiou.,59
446,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the Prime Minister asks me any question, I shall answer it .",59
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Her e is another leader! Honourable members opposite do not appear to see that this business is serious and "" loaded."" know whether this amendment is moved with the authority of the Labour party, or whether one or two quite irresponsible members are to take the business of' the Opposition out of their Leader's hands ? If the' latter be the case, we shall know what to do. I submit that I am entitled to know what sincerity there really is on the part of the Opposition in the burning desire they have expressed for the rectification of Tariff anomalies. business appears to be of such consequence that all the leaders of the Labour party are absent from the chamber when it is brought up.",59
448,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,How many leaders are there on this side?,59
449,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Goodnes s only knows! Tliere are four honourable members sitting on the front bench now. I suggest that when the important question of the Tariff is under consideration we are entitled to know the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition regarding it.,59
450,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the Prime Minister admit that it is important?,59
451,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is so i m portant that the Leader of the Opposition "" scoots "" out of the chamber-that he is out of the chamber, and will not express his opinion one way or the other.",59
452,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is not correct.,59
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ask, again, whether the honourable member for Cook has the authority of the Leader of the of this Opposition when he submits this amendment-whethe r it is done with the consent and approval of his leader?",59
454,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I represent, an electorate, and I take the responsibility of moving the amendment in the interests of my electors.",59
455,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Exactly ; then I shall have to take the responsibility, as representing not only an electorate but the country as a whole, of telling the honourable-member that we cannot take the proposal seriously.",59
456,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then do the other.,59
457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We have arrived at the point that an irresponsible member of the Opposition, without reference to his leader",59
458,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is not so.,59
459,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Possibl y flouting his leader's advice.,59
460,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is not so. We wish to,59
461,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,This important question raised for discussion is thought so much of by the leaders of the party opposite that they all absent themselves immediately from the chamber.,59
462,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is not true.,59
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is a fact that there is not a leading member of the Opposition in the chamber while this matter is under discussion. This Mr WEST - Who are the leading members ?,59
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable member not know his own leaders ? Are there so many that they are not known ?,60
465,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Is the Prime Minister in order, in a debate on this amendment, in going into the question of the leadership of the Labour party?",60
466,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Prime Minister is quite in order in asking whether an amendment of the kind has the approval of the Leader of the Opposition. I point out that honourable members have interrupted the Prime Minister, and thus prolonged his remarks beyond the time they otherwise would have .taken up. I have several times called for - order, and I must emphasize the absolute necessity,, when such a call is made, for honourable members not immediately afterwards to interject. I have several times had to call attention to this reprehensible practice, and, while I do not wish to proceed to extremes, if honourable members do not obey the directions given them they must take the consequences.",60
467,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I regard any matter affecting the fiscal question for the serious discussion of the House. The question has been deliberately raised by an honourable member of the Opposition, and I am taking the usual course in asking whetiier the amendment has the approval of the leaders of the party opposite. If this amendment be carried, it means that we quit these benches; and, therefore, the matter is serious.",60
468,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is that what is the matter ?,60
469,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to know where the Leader of the Opposition is on this question-whethe r the amendment has been launched with his concurrence? I am entitled to the information, but I am met with the question, "" ""Who are our leaders?"" If I am to judge, I should say that the honourable member for Cook is the Leader of the Opposition at the present moment, and, beside him, there is another leader in the person of the honourable member for Gwydir. Purther, there is an honourable member who has offered to answer any questions that I may care to ask.",60
470,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is the honourable member discussing the question before Chair?,60
471,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Prime Minister is quite in order in asking for information of the kind. The - honourable gentleman is addressing himself to the amendment, and expressing his views regarding the effect of it.",60
472,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Onl y a moment ago the accommodating member for East Sydney offered to answer any questions on points in regard to which I may be in doubt.,60
473,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I shall render the Prime Minister all the assistance I can.,60
474,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I pay the honourable member for East Sydney the tribute of saying that I have known him as always a staunch Protectionist. If this motion is serious-and I think it is - the n I can only conclude-bu t here comes the Leader of the Opposition.,60
475,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I believe that the Prime Minister sent for me.,60
476,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I should like to know from the right honourable gentleman whether he is in favour of the course now being taken? ,60
477,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What course? ',60
478,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"An important as one amendment has been launched, and the right honourable gentleman, who is supposed to lead the Labour party, does not know anything about it. The position is becoming more ridiculous every minute!",60
479,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We must object to the words "" supposed to lead the party ""-the Prime Minister knows that the right honourable gentleman is the Leader of the Labour party.",60
480,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What is the question before the Chair ? The speech of the Prime Minister makes me rather astonished.,60
481,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"A motion has been moved by the Prime Minister to postpone certain Orders of the Day until after the consideration of notices of motion Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Government business; and an amendment thereto has been moved by the honourable member for Cook to insert words which will have the effect of postponing Orders of the Day Nos. 2 and 3, but of bringing Order of the Day No. 4, and the question of the rectification of Tariff anomalies, under consideration forthwith.",60
482,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I should like to know if the Leader of the Opposition is of opinion that the business of the Go the vernment should be set aside while we discuss amendments of this character? Does the righ t honourable gentleman think that the proposal on the business-paper to deal with trusts, which he and others are never tired of alleging are to the h u rt and injury of the country-ar e forcing up the prices of goods which the workers consume, and thereby reducing the workers' earnings-shoul d be set aside while we discuss an abstract proposal which can have no good result ? We are entitled to know who is Leader of the Opposition in connection with these matters. usual to have Tariff proposals launched by any honourable member without the imprint of the leaders of a party. That is why I wish to know whether the right honourable gentleman is of opinion that this course of procedure should be followed-whethe r it has his approval and the approval of his colleagues. On the fiscal question itself, the position of the Government is quite clear j and I am going to take two minutes to state it to the House.",60
483,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Prime Minister is treating the question seriously-now I,61
484,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have said all along that I regard it as serious, and that is why I do not think it ought to be in the honourable member's irresponsible hands. The Tariff has been referred to the Inter-State Commission, which was created for this specific purpose by honourable members opposite. They provided the very machine which today is operati n g ; and, so far as I know, not one word of complaint has arisen, until very recently, as to the - personnel of the Commission.",61
485,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We did not appoint the members of the Commission.,61
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That honourable members opposite have never uttered one word of criticism as to the personnel.,61
487,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes ; I said that they were Pree Traders.,61
488,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That may be; but the honourable member, at the election, absolutely repudiated his party; and in that he was quite consistent. As soon as the declaration as to the Tariff was made at Maryborough, .the honourable member on the next night, I think, said that the Leader of the Opposition did not represent him in this matter-that , in effect, he would uot vote another duty of a protective character until he knew where the workers ""came in . "" Is the proposal before us one which will permit the workers to "" come in '-' ? This is a proposal for the rectification of anomalies.",61
489,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I shall vote for rectification where the workers get their due. Mr JOSE PH COOK - That is the proper attitude for the honourable member to adopt, but he swung himself right out of line with the rest of his party, who, without reference to the workers, pledged themselves to deal with the Tariff. And by what method were they to proceed? It is not Merely by the method of the machine which they themselves had created. When they passed the legislation creating the Inter-State Commission they specifically gave the Commission the function of dealing with the Tariff as it affected the worker, the consumer, and the employer. The question is being inquired into with all celerity-wit h the utmost possible despatch. The honourable member for Cook seems to know what are the fiscal opin fess that I do not.",61
490,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable  was a Pree Trader in New South Wales?,61
491,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the Prime Minister not know that t,61
492,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,All I have to say in reply to thetaunting interjection of the honourable member for Barrier is  at the same time the honourable member himself was.,61
493,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And at the same time the Prime Minister was.,61
494,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is the honourable member for Barrier still a Pree Trader?,61
495,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What has that f o do ,61
496,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"A p a r t alto may not be a Free Trader, the other two members of the Commission, at least, are regarded as Protectionists.",61
497,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"How does the Prime Minister know that? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I repeat that Mr Lockyer and Mr Swinburne are Protectionists. Several honourable members interjecting,",61
498,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have again to ask honourable members to keep order.,61
499,Mr JOSEPH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"COOK - It is a pity honourable members cannot let me get along with this matter. They have raised the question. Let us face it . I repeat again that the machinery has been created by my friends opposite, and that the personnel of the Gommission has been composed so as to make it compatible with the fiscal opinion of the country as cided, so my honourable friends say, and again, in favour of a Protectionist Tariff. There are two Protectionists on the Commission.",61
500,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Were they appointed because of their Protectionist ideas?,62

So there we have the machinery, and it is being operated by men who, own fiscal beliefs and opinions, are not likely to do any damage to the Protecthey to do otherwise? tionist policy of the country. They are now engaged in this work. Yet honourable members opposite want me to say to them, ' ' You must do just what I want you do."" I decline absolutely to do anything the kind.

I glad, indeed, to have this opportunity correcting an impression which has been industriously circulated throughout the country by certain Protectionists that Ministers propose to allow this Inter-State Commission to fix the Tariff of the country.

539,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member must address the Chair. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Le t us see where gentlemen opposite are. I heard the Leader of the Opposition speaking on this matter in the House not a long time ago. On the 9th September, 1909, just before he himself came into office, and was let loose on the Tariff, he challenged the then Prime Minister, Mr Deakin. Here is what he said I now ask the Prime Minister whether be really believes, as he invites other people to Many dis- believe, that the time will soon come when the Commonwealth will be able to contribute to the revenue, through the Customs and Excise, an amount in excess of £3 10s. per head T The idea is ridiculous and absurd; and, in my opinion, that piece of special pleading was worse than worthless; it was not only absolutely useless, but, though not intentionally, misleading to the public. . . . I go so far as to say that I shall regret it very much if the receipts from Customs and Excise for the Commonwealth ever exceed £2 8s. 6d. per head. That amount extorted from every individual in"" the Commonwealth, whether well-to-do or otherwise, is high enough in all conscience. . . . If the honourable member for Robertson is of opinion that it is too high, I am sure I can say, on behalf of all the members of our party, that we will assist him to reduce it. The high-water mark which the right honourable gentleman would not exceed was £ 2 8s. 6d. .per head, and if honourable members required his help he was prepared to reduce it . That was before he went into office; but after three years of office on the part of these honourable gentlemen, who have been fulminating ever since, the revenue from Customs an'd Excise was still at about £ 3 10s. per head. In a word, they did nothing with the Tariff during tlieir whole three years, and now today, when they are out of office, they are all burning with the desire to rectify anomalies in the Tariff, and to cherish the manufacturers and industries of Australia. The position is too obvious. But just let me put another aspect of the matter. Their organ, the Sydney' Worker, on the 6th November, 1913, dealing with the subject "" Who Pays?"", saidWho pays the Tariff? You workers every time. You not only pay the Tariff, but you also pay that extra tribute which the Tariff permits the master class to levy off the productive labour of the country. Mr J. BE. CATTS - Is that an editorial ?",63
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes . It is a denunciation of the Tariff. Sitting suspended from. 6.30 to S.O p.m. Mr. JOSEPH COOK.^-When the House rose for dinner I was making some answer to the question which has been raised, not only here but elsewhere, as to the bona fides of the Goto vernment and this party respecting are this fiscal question.

542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is their record. 1I have before me statements made by the honourable member himself consumer. only a little while ago, in which he clined to touch the Tariff until certain guarantees had been given with regard to the protection of the worker. Does not Tariff. the honourable member know that at the last Inter-State Conference at Hobart, or any other body. when the Labour party's present policybeen was settled, from which policy they not depart, the Conference turned down a proposal for effective Protection, and decided to leave the matter as not the right honourable gentleman say at Maryborough, by implication, "" No more Tariff until we pass the referenevidence dum, so that we may protect the workers?""",64

Where are honourable members in this matter? Is there any sincerity in their attitude ? Let them take the beams out of their own eyes before they go hunting for the motes in the eyes of individuals over here. I desire to make one or two references to the Tariff and its relation to the Inter-State Comniission. The honourable member for Cook said that the House would not agree to the recommendations of the Commission if those recommendations did uot suit the House.

Did this Tariff matter. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has complained that he cannot get all the taken by the Commission; he wants a shorthand note of all the evidence. I venture to say that this House has considered reports of Royal Commissions before today, in which a full report of evidence has been included, and the bulk of that evidence has been passed by totally unheeded. The honourable member should not convey the impression, however, that no evidence is to be furnished. That is far from being a fact.

I desire to bring this protest your notice, and will be glad if you would inform me as to what notes of evidence can be made available, sbould Parliament so desire, it? in connection with the applications which are being submitted to the Commission.

Rightly or wrongly. we regard that motion as a mere political The Bill to which it relates bring no relief to those who are askf o r help, nor will it benefit any section of the community. That being our ... 31 view we sought to induce the Government ... 32 to take up business of more importance to the country. The Orders of the Day, which the Prime Minister desires to postAYES. pone, are the second reading of the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill , and the consideration in Committee of Supply and Ways and Means. In the course of his tirade the Prime Minister declared that the Opposition were doing something that would tend to block the inquiry which the Government proposed to make into the operations of the Beef Trust. As a matter of fact our object is to assist the Government to secure an effective inquiry. The effectiveness of the Commission which has been appointed to investigate the operations of the trust depends largely upon the passing of the Parliamentary W i tnesses Bill . Again and again during the last three or four years commissions appointed by this Parliament to inquire into various enterprises and industries have found it utterly impossible to compel the principals to give that evidence which is so essential to enable Parliament to come to a proper decision. The Parliamentary Witnesses Bill is intended to remove that disability. The Prime Minister, however, chides us and asserts that we are trying to prevent the passing of useful legislation when we are really showing our bona fides by calling upon the Government to proceed with that Bill , in stead of wasting time in discussing measures that have no substance, and which are merely political placards. sire is that the Commission appointed to inquire into the operations of the Beef Trust shall have ample power to compel the agents of the trust to disclose that evidence without which no effective action can be taken by the Parliament. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Does the honourable member say that the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill will give that power to the Commission ?",67
575,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes . Mr W . H . IRVINE - That merely shows that the honourable member has not read the Bill .,68
576,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have read it . Mr W . H . IRVINE - Then the honourable member does not understand it .,68
577,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I take no notice of an interjection of that kind coming from an honourable gentleman, who a little while ago made a certain statement on the floor of this House when there was no one to reply to him , and had subsequently by a nod of his head to admit to the ex-Attorney-General that it was not in accordance with fact. mentary Witnesses Bill , the Attorney General will admit, is more important than is the Postal Vote Restoration Bill. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It has nothing to do with this matter.",68
578,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General, with his experience of parliamentary machinations, must know that the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill is far more important than is the Bill for the restoration of the postal vote which the Prime Minister desires leave to introduce. Every one of theOrders of the Day which the honourable gentleman desires to postpone, is of more importance than the uotice of niotion with which he wishes to proceed. There are, for instance, many matters that might be discussed with advantage to the people on the motion for Supply. There are many questions of far more importance to the people than is the notice of motion which, owing to the Prime Minister's own incapacity and want of foresight, cannot be proceeded with to-night. The honourable gentleman finds himself hoist with his own petard. I well remember when it was first ruled that notices of motion could not be discussed after two hours from the opening of the sitting had elapsed. It was on that ruling upon a point of order raised by the Prime Minister that our right to Our de- debate a censure motion was restricted. Advantage was taken of a standing order which had never before been called into requisition by any decent Government. Honourable members opposite strained the Standing Orders to secure a party victory. They showed to what length they would go in their desire to do nothing more than to placard the country with a couple of trumpery, useless Bills, which are more or less of a mockery.",68
579,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not in order in describing a Bill as a mockery.,68
580,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I withdraw the word "" mockery,"" and say that the Bills in question are more or less of an imposition on the credulity of the people. The ruling given on the occasion to which I have referred governs the action of the House today, and the Prime Minister, who initiated this method of conducting business, now howls like a baby because the Opposition seek to give preference to business more important than that with The Parlia- which he desires to proceed.",68
581,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think that the Government will resign very soon.,68
582,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"A f t e r the division just taken some of them might well be expected to do so, but I think that nothing short of a volcanic outburst would shift the Government. A f t e r the vote just taken on the amendment moved by the honourable member for Cook, the Victorian supporters of the Government, who were most loud in their demands at the last general election, must feel very uneasy. Unlike us they had not two strings to their bow. We were prepared if the Constitution were amended to see that justice was done under the Tariff, not only to the manufacturer, but to the worker and the consumer as well.",68
583,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is now traversing the amendment, which has been disposed of. He is not in order in doing so.",69
584,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I merely desire to show the hopeless position of some honourable members opposite in view of the decision just arrived at. I should not be surprised if the Ministerial party held a caucus and decided to withdraw the notice of motion for leave to introduce the Postal Vote Restoration Bill . desire to escape from the wrath to come they should withdraw the Bill , and try to avoid any dissolution either single or double. Judging by their looks some honourable members opposite realise that after the division just taken they will have some difficulty in facing the electors. What the Prime Minister said earlier in the day has been verified. The honourable gentleman declared that this was a battle of wits, and so it has proved. The Government and their supporters would have been better advised had they not adopted this method of restricting and curtailing debate on a question of great importance to the people of the country; indeed, we have been practically prevented from-discussing fundamental issues on which the government of the Commonwealth depends. To move a vote of censure is th<i inherent right of an Opposition; it is the only means we have of expressing our disapprobation of the action of the Government, and indicating to the country the state of affairs within Parliament. One would think that the Government would hesitate before they endeavoured, by stretching the Standing Orders, to embarrass the Opposition in performing one of their first duties to the people.",69
585,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is now discussing the effect of the Standing Orders.,69
586,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am discussing the effect of the ruling .,69
587,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is not before the Chair. The question is that Orders of the Day be postponed until after the consideration of the Notices of Motion 1, 2, and 3. Government business.",69
588,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am tryin g to show why the Orders of the Day should not oe postponed. They are of far more importance than the motions referred to, and, therefore, should claim our prior attention. The Prime Minister has a notice of motion for leave to bring in a Bill to restore the provisions of the Electoral Act with respect to voting by post; but there is no honourable member in the House, and very few people in the country, who understand politics, who won id, for a moment, say that they should claim priority over any measure that might be suggested. Only by the greatest stretch of imagination in a decadent brain could such an idea find a place. What does this proposed Bill mean?",69
589,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It means that sick If they people will get a vote.,69
590,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We , on this side of the House, have no objection to bovd '--dt sick people exercising the franchise. The next notice of motion is by the Minister of Trade and Customs, for leave to bring in a Bill to amend the Australian Industries Preservation Act. Will any honourable member tell me that the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill is not more important than that motion. The Parliamentary Witnesses Bill is intended to give to Parliamentary Committees powers which are absolutely necessary to their proper working, and which have hitherto not been possible under the law. This measure is of great importance, in view of the many Commissions and Committees in existence now, and likely to be created in the future.",69
591,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honbrable member is not in order in discussing the proposals embodied in the measures mentioned ; the question is their postponement.,69
592,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am endeavouring to throw a little light on the subject oefore the House.,69
593,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not in order in discussing the subject-matter of the motions on the paper.,69
594,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Parliamentary Witnesses Bill gives power to Committee* and Commissions to effectively conduct in vestigations ; and we claim that under the circumstances it ought to take precedence. The measure is full of important provisions, which, as I say, are absolutely necessary in view of the Royal Commissions already at work. A Select Committee is to be proposed tomorrow.",69
595,Mr AGAR WYNNE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member ought to be on that Committee 1,69
596,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill were law, I might be in duced to act on the suggestion of the Postmaster-General, but I have no desire to be on any Select Committee under present conditions. Then, again, could anything be more important than the discussion of the vast expenditure of the Commonwealth? Can any unbiased person, with no political axe to grind, contend for a moment that the consideration of Supply would not produce better results than a discussion on the empty, paltry, trumpery political placard represented by the first motion ? In order to test the sincerity of the Prime Minister and the Government on the question of the Beef Trust, I intend to move an amendment. We know how the Prime Minister stands in relation to Protection, and it is desirable that we should know how he stands in relation to the question of the trusts. I move That all the words after "" consideration"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" of Notice of Motion No. 2 as follows :- Mr Groom : To move, That he have leave to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1910."" It is of no use the Prime Minister masquerading with pretences before the people, because they have some idea of the value of those pretences. Only by placing the professions of the Government in a crucible and separating the genuine from the false, can we understand how the time of this House is being absorbed. If the Government are in earnest in their desire to trace the minions of the Beef Trust to their lair, and wish to prove whether the high price of meat is due tc the combine, or to other causes, they will vote for the amendment. If they do not vote for the amendment then the public will be able to judge where the Government stand. Should they support she amendment, we shall expect to see some tangible proof of their sincerity and earnestness in the matter. During the last few weeks I have been more perplexed by the proceedings in this House than I have ever been before in all my Parliamentary experience. I have never known a Government to play with the affairs of uhe country as the present Government have done. I submit the amendment, aud trust that the House in its wisdom will adopt it .",69
597,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE, I second the amendment.,70
598,Mr JOSEPH COOH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs ) [9.0] - Mr Speaker,70
599,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I had the floor.,70
600,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The forma l seconder can speak later. I have called on the Prime Minister.,70
601,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member for Oxley will not lose his right to speak. Here is another amendment,70
602,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for Oxley rose to second this amendment, and did not resume his seat. The Prime Minister, therefore, is not in order in interrupting the honourable member.",70
603,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I asked if the amendment was seconded-it was merely a formal matter-and if the honourable member did not resume his seat when I was on my feet he was out of order. I did not call upon the honourable member for Oxley. It is the practice of the House for the Chair to call on members from each side alternately, preference being given to a Minister when he rises. An honourable member who formally seconds an amendment is not deprived of his right to speak later.",70
604,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Her e is another amendment taking the business out of the hands of the Government, and again the Leader of the Opposition is absent. I desire to know whether this proposal to censure the Government by taking the business of the Government out of their hands has the approval and imprimatur of the responsible Leader of t.he Opposition. It is time we knew where we were in this House. I suppose that honourable members opposite, after an hour's debate, will bring in the Leader of the Opposition, and that he will give them his blessing. He is compelled to do it . He reminds one of nothing so much as that man one reads about",70
605,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On a point of order, I desire to know whether the honourable member is in order in referring to the Leader of the Opposition under cover of this amendment?",70
606,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Prime Minister is certainly in order in asking whether an amendment of this character, which proposes to take the business out of the hands of the Government,. has t.he sanction of the Leader of the Opposition.",70
607,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Leader of the Opposition reminds one of that man one reads about as running after a troop of other men. When he was asked why he was running after them, he said, "" I have to run after them, because I am their leader."" The Leader of the Opposition will come into the chamber directly, and I suppose be will be compelled to say again that he approves of this proposition, and that he will also Say, as he did before, "" This is business."" It is business, the business of deliberately preventing the Government from getting on with the country's business. I tell my honourable friends opposite that their doings are not disturbing me in the slightest, because they are making it abundantly clear to the country that, test Bills or no test Bills, they have not the slightest intention of letting the Government, do the country's business. I hope the country is taking notice of what is going on. Nothing could be more eloquent - nothing could be more demonstrative of the fact, which we have time and again told the country, that it is not possible to do business in this House-usefu l business.or otherwise.",70
608,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But you will cling on to office as long as you can.,71
609,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We shall cling on to office until we choose to quit it, or until this House bids us quit it . Let orable members make no mistake about that.",71
610,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Pu t on the ""gag"" you wish to push on with business.",71
611,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If ever the ""gag"" was justifiable, it seems to me it is in connection with obstructive motions of this kind, proposals which have the effect of obstructing Government business, and it amounts to this: that the Government cannot do business while our Standing Orders remain, except by the application of the closure. That is the plain English of it. And we are faced with that situation, and a very serious one it is-honorabl e members are acting in a way which has demonstrated one fact, namely, that no business can be done in the House except with their permission, unless it is put through by the application of the closure. All I have to say is that the Government have not the slightest intention of allowing honourable members opposite to do the business of the country.",71
612,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When we get a chance to talk, we shall talk, but when you put on the ""gag"" we cannot talk.",71
613,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I call the attention of the country again to the fact that honourable members opposite are asking the Government to ""gag"" them, demonstrating to the country thereby that they deserve it. The honourable member for Bourke says, "" Why do you not ' gag ' us?""",71
614,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , if you wish to get on with business.",71
615,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member thinks that he ought to be "" gagged,"" or he would not say that.",71
616,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Never . I think my remarks are too precious to be ""gagged.""",71
617,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Especiall y the remarks the honourable member makes when he is not on his feet. The country is being treated to a novel spectacle in this House. Honourable members who go about protesting that they want to do the business of the country, that they want to take in hand some useful legislation, will not permit the Government to introduce legislation of any kind.",71
618,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Withdra w the test Bills, and see what we will do.",71
619,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No , thank you. We have put one measure through in spite of you. With all the limitations honimposed on us, and they are many-suc h as no Government has ever yet had to face-w e have put through one of those if measures. We have put it through in spite of the Opposition and all they could do to prevent it.",71
620,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why cannot you put other measures through in the same way?,71
621,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Here , again, is another member who asks us to apply the closure.",71
622,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then you admit that you closured the test Bill through?,71
623,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Did we? I was not aware of it. If honourable members opposite go on as they are doing, the Government will be able to do a little business later on, because their own supporters are deserting them in disgust, going out of the House when a vote is taken in order to show their disgust at the whole proceedings. That is a spectacle we have had to-night. I congratulate oue honourable member on his pluck.",71
624,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,On e Pree Trader.,71
625,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Now we have an honourable member taunting another about his Free Trade principles-on e Free Trader taunting another Free - Trader; but we are not dealing with Free Trade now. I am dealing with the matter of the conduct of public business, and I invite the attention of the country to the spectacle before us to-night of an Opposition which clamours to do the business of the country, yet takes advantage of every form the house permits in order to prevent any business being done. That is one outstanding feature. Another outstanding feature following upon that is that this Parliament is not in the position to do business, and the sooner matters are brought to an issue, and the people of the country are able to express their opinion upon the whole parliamentary machinery and upon the composition of both Houses, the better for all concerned.",71
626,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On a point of order, I contend that the amendment is out of order. I understand that the motion before the Chair is to suspend the Orders of the Day until notices of motion are dealt with. My contention is that the amendment is to dispose of notice of motion No. 2 before we have reached it . The honourable member will have ample opportunity of moving his amendment when we suspend the Orders of the Day.",72
627,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I submit that the point is a good one. The honourable member can do nothing in the way of own. overriding a notice of motion until reach notices of motion.,72
628,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The amendment is out of order.,72
629,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Bourke) [9.12] - I am made by the Prime Minister. delighted that the amendment has been ruled out of order. The Prime Minister is anxious to go on with public busiuess. I am very pleased. A f t e r a lapse of twelve months, I am certain that he is anxious to go on with some business, and, had he spoken for a little longer, he would have contributed to the harmony of prothe ceedings, and helped us to go on u n t i l orders. II o'clock to-night. But he has at his disposal the very same instruments that he employed last session, and which had no scruples about using last session. Why does he not put them to use now There are methods-the Standing Orders and instruments-at the disposal of the kind occurring? Government. There are the Government. We are obstructionists. They are to go on with the business. Why do not they do it ?",72
630,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to a point of order. Here is an honourable member calldraw ing attention to the fact that the Opposithem. tion are deliberately obstructing public business. I ask you, Mr Speaker, rule the honourable member out of order for confessing ""that he has risen for the purpose of deliberately obstructing public business, and for invitin g the use of the "" g a g "" to try to prevent that obstruction.",72
631,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not tliink the Prime Minister has put the point correctly. The honourable member for Bourke was simply re-stating what the Prime Minister had already stated. Two or three times during the debate the Prime Minister has talked about the obstruction on this side, and the honourable member for Bourke was reconstructing the picture the Prime Minister had put to the House, and, in doing so, was merely making use of the language of the Prime Minister.",72
632,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have not heard the honourable member for Bourke declare that his intention was to obstruct the business of the House. If several honourable members interject at one time, and in loud tones, it is not possible to hear what is said.",72
633,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is quite true that I was not making any observations of my I was not in the least obstructing we public business; everybody knows I would not do so. If the Government would bring forward public business I would be prepared to give endorsement to it . I was merely recapitulating the statement. It has been said that it was necessary for some one to go to the country. I am pointing out that this Parliament could be sent to the country by an easier process than by sending me out of the chamber.,72
634,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The question before House is the postponement of these,72
635,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , sir. Is it not the duty of the Government, when they he profess to conduct the business of the country, to know enough, to be clever and ? capable enough, to so arrange the business-paper as to prevent anything of this",72
636,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We cannot get beanxious hind the Standing Orders.,72
637,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Standing Orders are a protection to all members of the Chamber, and the Government have to up their business in accordance with The Standing Orders are clear and definite, and there is no reason why to the order of business laid down by them should uot be proceeded with. orable member sees what the order of business is, and he gets a pair and goes away to one of the other States, or to England, or elsewhere, thinking that he will be back here in time to deal with a certain question, but he finds that in his absence the Government have shot up to a prominent place in the business-paper something new and unexpected. Government knew when they drew up the notice-paper that the Parliamentary W it nesses' Bill was of vast importance, and they made it the first Order of the Day. Why have they departed from it , and why do they ask us to discuss something else in its stead ? On the question of Supply",72
638,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There has already been an amendment which included that.,73
639,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That amendment related to Ways and Means.,73
640,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It dealt also with the postponement of orders 2 and 3.,73
641,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The amendment moved in connection with the fiscal question resulted in a long discussion, but no amendment has been moved in regard to the Beef Trust. That is an important matter. The trust is an evil regarded by the Government as being of vast importance, and it ought to be dealt with immediately. It would be far better if the Government were to move that Notice of Motion No. 1 be postponed until after motion No. 2.",73
642,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That has been ruled out of order, and cannot be made the subject of an amendment.",73
643,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to order. The honourable member for Moreton took a point of order on the last amendment, which proposed that Notice of Motion No. 2",73
644,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member cannot rise to a point of order on a matter that has already been decided.,73
645,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am speaking on different matter. I submit that there was an error in the drafting of amendment.,73
646,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member mav not now discuss it .,73
647,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That error has been corrected.,73
648,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order ! The honorf o able member has interrupted the speech of the honourable member for Bourke with teresting. a point of order which I rule cannot be taken at this juncture. An hon- Mr ANSTEY - I have another amendment, and if you rule that it is in order. I will speak about it .",73
649,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member may proceed, while I read the amendment.",73
650,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The question of the Beef Trust is an important one, and the Government chided the Labour party for The not doing anything in this matter. Today we have a genuine Government in power who desire to do something, and here is their opportunity. Let them go on with the matter at once. They may introduce a Bill which will have a. fa r more reaching effect on every household in the country than the other business with which they wish to proceed. A gigantic combine has taken hold of our meat supply, and every Government in the Commonwealth is trying to deal with it. The Commonwealth Government, recognising their national responsibility, are endeavouring to cope with the evil. If we are to deal with this matter, surely there is no necessity for the Prime Minister to introduce personal matters, and there is no reason why the Attorney General should gape at me in annoyance. I have done nothing to earn his disapprobation. I merely exercise my right as an honourable member of this Chamber to bring forward certain matters that are well worthy of consideration; yet the moment any honourable member rises to exercise his right the Prime Minister asks, "" Where is the Leader of the Labour party?"" The Leader of the Opposition has as much right to rest and recreation as any other honourable member has; he has other matters of public i m portance to attend to, and he has to leave other men of less capacity than himself to carry on the discussion in this Chamber. I feel that my obligations to the country demand that I should draw attention to the fact that the Government, a who profess so much interest in the operations of the Beef Trust, are disinclined to that push on with the matter at all . Mr W . H . IRVINE - Y o u are not in good for m ; you are not sufficiently amusing; I am going.",73
651,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No , I am not in good r m ; but 1 feel that later on in the evening the proceedings will become more in ",73
652,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You are driving your leader out of the chamber in disgust.,73
653,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have seen the honourable member for Parramatta go out also. I had to listen to him with great pain during the preceding Parliament, and his gigantic efforts hour after hour",74
654,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Eighty-the e measures your Government passed without the *' gag.""",74
655,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member will pass as many if he lives long enough. I notice, Mr Speaker, that there is a pained look upon your countenance, and under those circumstances, because of the regard I have for you, I will draw my remarks to a close. I feel that they have been so interesting that they are bound to result in good f r u it , and that the Prime Minister will give his endorsement to the amendment which I now move That notice of motion No. 1 of Government business be postponed until after the consideration of notice of motion No. 2 of Government business, which is as follows:-"" Mr . Groom : To move that he have leave to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1006-1910.""",74
656,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The amendment is a variation of a previous amendment which was ruled out of order. amendment, also, is out of order.",74
657,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Oxley) [9.25] - I am rather disappointed that the Prime M in ister has not seen fit to bring forward the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill . aware that he has appointed a Commissioner to inquire into the operations of the Beef Trust; and I claim that, without the aid of that Bill , the Commissioner will be almost powerless. W it h the aid of that measure, he will be able to obtain evidence which, if the Bill does not become law before he commences his i nquiry, he will not be in a position to collect. If the Government were anxious to bring forward business which the country would welcome, they would see that the most beneficial legislation which they could bring forward, and which would affect the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, and would be applauded by them, would be something in the nature of this Parliamentary Witnesses Bill. It would be of infinitely more benefit to the people than the Bill which the Government propose to bring forward at the present time. We know that the Bill which the Prime Minister is anxious to bring forward as the second test measure has very little significance, so far as the people of the Commonwealth are concerned. If the Government are anxious to go to the country, they can do so without the aid of this Bill. The Bill which has already been passed would not be of much use for the securing of a double dissolution, and the people know how to view it . The Prime Minister continually blames the Opposition for blocking business, although it is the Government that is at fault, because were measures brought forwar d of which the Opposition could approve, they would not be held up.",74
658,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then the honourable member admits that the business is being held up?,74
659,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes ; the useful measures for which the country is crying. They have been held up by the Government. I am afraid that the Bills which the honourable gentleman wants us to consider of vital importance will remain unpassed for a considerable time. Were he really desirous of going to the country, there is a shorter way of getting there than that which he proposes.",74
660,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Who wants to go to the country? This Mr SHARPE - We , on this side, are anxious to do so, to get a fresh decision from the people, and honourable members opposite say the same. The Prime M in ister has the power to send us there; let him use it . A Commissioner has been We are appointed to inquire into the operations of the Beef Trust, but without a Bill that has been dangled before us for some considerable time the inquiry will be largely useless, and he will get very little evidence. We know that it is very difficult to trace the operations of the trust.",74
661,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is out of order in discussing the Beef Trust.,74
662,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I wish to show that the Government has failed in its duty in neglecting to push forward a certain measure. Ministers are making their position more difficult by trying to bring forward a Bill which they know will take a long time to get through this Chamber. If they desire to meet the wishes of the people they should accept the amendment of the honourable member for Bourke.,74
663,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There is no amendment before the Chair.,74
664,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I hope that the Prime Minister wd'l} accept the thoroughly practical suggestion made by the Opposition, because by doing so he will do what is agreeable to the people.",74
665,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Ballarat) [9.40] After the eloquent and persuasive speeches that have come from this side, I am surprised that the Prime Minister has not acceded to the proposals of the Opposition. Earlier in the evening heseemed anxious to proceed with the Australian Industries Preservation Bill.",75
666,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You blocked it .,75
667,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We are exceedingly desirous that something should be done to check the Beef Trust, and I understand that the Bill is intended to give a Court larger powers to do that. Government has no mandate from the country to bring in the Bill for the introduction of which the Prime Minister wished to get leave this afternoon. The Government is kept in power by the casting vote of the Speaker. It manages to hang on to office, but has lost the respect of the country for doing so. An analysis of the voting at the last election shows that the majority of the people then pronounced strongly against the Liberals and against the restitution of the postal vote. The Government, however, wishes to repeal the legislation which abolished the postal vote. I am surprised that members opposite, who declare themselves to be Democrats, should be unwilling to bow to the will of the people. The Minister of Trade and Customs has given notice of a motion for leave to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the Australian Industries Preservation Act, a much more important measure than the Postal Vote Restoration Bill. We are ready to heartily support that measure, our enthusiasm for it being evidenced by tonight's debate.",75
668,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What has Minister to say?,75
669,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I suppose his answer will be the usual one, that ""he has the matter under observation."" We want the Bill to see the light of day. The notice of motion respecting it may be good window dressing, useful for an election campaign; but we desire to see the Bill introduced. Personally, if the Minister would promise that it shall be the first measure proceeded with, I would sit down right away. That is my answer to the Prime Minister's statement that we are blocking legislation. The Minister is silent. Evidently he has no intention of proceeding with the measure. afraid that honourable members opposite are only playing with the subject, and have no wish to offend their friends the Beef Trust. I do not wish to say anything unparliamentary, but do we not know as a fact that a cheque for £2,000 was sent by the Beef Trust to assist the Liberal party at the last general election ?",75
670,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw t i l 6 l'GLTl9.rk,75
671,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I withdraw it ; but the Minister knows that it is true.,75
672,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I know that it is a pure invention.,75
673,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am not saying The that the Minister of Trade and Customs handled the money,75
674,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have already told the honourable member that he is out of order in making that statement.,75
675,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I want to clear, up the matter. I should be very sorry to do the Minister of Trade and Customs an injustice. He thought that I was imputing that he had handled this cheque for £2,000.",75
676,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Neithe r I nor any one else handled it.,75
677,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member for Ballarat is now deliberately evading the ruling of the Chair. I remind him that he cannot do so with impunity.,75
678,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to show why the motion submitted by the Prime Minister should not be carried. The arrangement of business on the notice-paper rests with the Government, and if they had any constructive ability at all, it should not be necessary for them to seek to alter the the order of business. It was arranged that the division on the third reading of the Government Preference Prohibition Bill should take place at 4 o'clock this afternoon, and the Government should have so arranged their business as to render it unnecessary for them to move for the postponement of certain Orders of the Day as soon as that division had been taken. I wish to impress upon the Minister in charge of the Bill affecting the Beef Trust t i e urgency of dealing with the motion of which he has given notice, and I shall conclude by movingThat the words "" and 3 "" be left out. I am Mr FENTO N (Maribyrnong) [9.54]. - I second the amendment.",75
679,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What - will he the effect of it? Mr Fenton"" - The Prime Minister has moved for the postponement of the Orders of the Day until after the consideration of notices of motion 1, 2, and 3. The third notice of motion, which stands in the name of the Treasurer, and which it is proposed to omit from the motion, is for leave to bring in a Bill for an Act relating to the Savings Bank business of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. In the course of his strident ance this afternoon the Prime Minister appealed to us to proceed as early as possible with the measure designed to cope with that commercial octopus known as the Beef Trust, and our amendment is designed to assist the Govermnent to push on with it. We cannot, at this stage, discuss the notice of motion for leave to bring in a Bill relating to the Commonwealth Bank; but I certainly hope that the motion for leave will be rejected. If the Government should obtain leave to introduce the Bill, then, unless the "" gag "" is applied, honourable members will avail themselves of every opportunity to discuss it. We may discuss it on the motion for leave to introduce the Bill, the motion for the second reading, in Committee, and on the motion for the third reading.",76
680,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This "" stone-walling.""",76
681,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I ask that that remark be withdrawn.,76
682,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I ask the honourable member to withdraw it.,76
683,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is quite true, but I withdraw it.",76
684,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is only adding insult to injury.,76
685,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member must withdraw the remark, in accordance with the Standing Orders.",76

687,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member must not defy the Chair. I give him another opportunity to withdraw the remark.,76
688,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"In deference to you, sir, I withdraw it ; but I think it all the same. [63]",76
689,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The withdrawal must be without qualification. The honourable member knows that.,76
690,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Well , Mr. Speaker, I withdraw it .",76
691,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I hold very strong convictions in regard to this measure, and would do anything possible to secure its withdrawal. I regard it as the result of a deep-seated disapproval of the action of the Governor of the bank in conducting the business as banking busiutterness should be conducted; and the real object in the amendment is to secure its removal from the business-paper. I hope that the Treasurer and Attorney-General, who are now in consultation, will deem it wise to withdraw the motion. The immediate object of the amendment is to so arrange the business-paper that tomorrow we may be able to deal with the motion in the name of the Minister of Trade and Customs. No doubt, when the Treasurer asks for leave to introduce the Bill, he will afford us some information as to how far he intends to interfere with the proper carrying on of the Commonwealth Bank, and my opinion is that the measure would result in depriving the bank of a considerable portion of its business.",76
692,Mr BRUCE SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Commonwealth Bank will be given a quid pro quo. is Mr Fenton --I do not know that it will.,76
693,Mr BRUCE SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Governor of the bank thinks so.,76
694,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"From an interview which the Governor of ' the bank gave to a newspaper, it appears that he has practically repeated the offer made by the Leader of the Opposition, when Prime Minister, to the State Governments to allow them 75 per cent, of all the banking business.",76
695,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not in order in discussing that question.,76
696,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"However , the . motion that stands pre-eminently above all others is that in the name of the Minister of Trade and Customs; and I hope that the business will be so arranged that it may be discussed at once.",76
697,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Cook) [10.5] - I have not had an opportunity to say a word on the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill. I cannot see why the Government should desire to postpone this business.,76
698,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,=The honourable member must confine himself to the amendment.,77
699,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"In my opinion, it is absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth Bank should have power to deal with the Savings Bank business.",77
700,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not in order in discussing the powers of the Commonwealth Bank.,77
701,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I desire to show why notice of motion No. 3 should not be proceeded with . In my opinion, it Foster, Richard is unadvisable to interfere with the Savings Bank business.",77
702,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not in order in discussing the notices of motion on the paper.,77
703,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On e reason why the motion relating to the bank should be postponed is that the Treasurer is not yet ready with the Bill , and there are other matters far more urgent. Another reason is that the Bill is introduced at the dictation of certain persons outside this Parliament. Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) putThat the question be now put. The House dividedAyes ... ...

Last session, opportunities were the Government to pass a comprehensive Bill which would enable every citizen of the Commonwealth entitled to record vote to do so with reasonable security, so far as electoral difficulties are concerned,, with reasonable protection, and with fuller facilities than have been given under any Act that has yet been passed; but the Government refused to accept the more prosecutions? amendments proposed by another place.

The postal vote has this defect, bad that it must he recorded some time .prior to the actual election day. If it is recorded a week prior to day, between the timethe postal vote is given and the day on which the takes place, something may be or done by a Government or by a not party which would actually change the vote of half the people who had voted by post.

719,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATIO N,"Melbourne Ports) [10.32] - I am sorry to detain honourable members and the officials of the House at such a late hour, but private members have no chance of introducing any matters to the House except on the motion for adjournment. My object in rising is to ask if it is not possible for some arrangement to be made hy the Defence Department in regard to certain cadets, who are quite willing to perform their military duties, but who are compelled, by reason of the trade or profession they 'follow, to absent themselves from parades at certain times. Many such cases - have been brought under my notice, but I wish to draw the attention of the House to one case which seems to me to be particularly hard. A young fellow writes to meDEAR SIR, I wish to draw vour attention to the inconvenienoe I am put to by attending compulsory training. I attend the Working Men's College four nights a week for carpentry and stair' building. I have to attend drill the first Thursday in eaoh month. Thursday night is a lecture night at the college, and by going to drill I miss the lecture, which I cannot pick up on any other night. I am in the Naval Reserve. Last year I had to put in seventeen days' continuous drill in June. By attending that drill I missed the half-yearly examination. This year I drilled in April. My employer at work had on important piece of roofing work to do at the time, and he wrote to the District Naval Officer to postpone my drill until a later date in order that 1 Bhould not miss it. He explained it was adifficult piece of work, and it would be an opportunity I should, perhaps, not get again while serving my apprenticeship. He received an answer from the District Naval Officer stating that it was not convenient to alter the drill, so I missed the chance of learning something. I bave heard that we. will drill again in November. If so, I ' will be away from the final examination at the college, and so lose my chance of obtaining A diploma. I think consideration should be shown in oases such as these. Trusting you will use your influence in my direction, &o., It is very evident that cases of thissort will discredit the - system of compulsory training more than anything else. On the introduction of the Defence Bill , nearly four years ago, I pointed out that these cases would occur, and I said that the Department should make arrangements to meet them. The Department has not done so. I ask any honourable member in this chamber whether it ds fair to COOK.) procast on the defence system the blame and responsibility for retarding a young man in his trade or profession when he is young? I hope the Department will issue an order of some .character, so t h at cases of this sort may be dealt with , and the interests of the cadet considered as well as the interests of the system. If not, through these cases continually comingbefore us, a system which most of us are in favour of will be discredited. I trust that the Prime Minister will endeavour to make arrangements so t h at the omcers will see. that these young fellows have an opportunity of attending their classes and obtaining theirdiplomas.",79
720,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATIO N,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [10.36] - I will bring the honourable member s remarks to the notice, of my colleague, the Minister of Defence. | I quite agree that every, possible facility shonld be given to these young men, and what the honourable member has said shall have the fullest consideration. _.
