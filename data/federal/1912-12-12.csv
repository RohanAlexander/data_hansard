1,Mr OZANNE,Unknown,"A little while ago, when the Prime Minister moved to take for the discussion of Government measures the time formerly allotted to private' member's business, I opposed the motion for reasons that I then stated, and said that I should vote against it j but, as the debate lasted through the afternoon and into the evening, the division was taken when-1 was absent. I . have since discovered that, although I did not vote, and intended to vote against the motion, I was paired as voting for it . I have seen the Whips on both sides, and learn that it was the Opposition Whip who recorded my vote in the pair-book. No doubt the mistake was made inadvertently, but I feel it my duty to-draw attention to the error. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I made the pair referred to after consultation with the Government Whip. The desire was that the honourable member for Corio should not be left unpaired. The pair was made in' a perfectly friendly spirit, and with the best of intentions.",14
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation in regard to some remarks made the other evening by the honourable member for New England respecting a statement of my own in criticism of himself. The honourable member said I thought when the last scheme was rejected by the Senate- a body which it does not concern, because it does not change the Senate electorates-that the Commissioners would have amended it in the light of the views expressed by the majority of the representatives of New South Wales in this House, who voted against it, but they have not done so.' That is exactly what I said, namely, that the honourable member desired an amendment of the electorates to suit the majority of honourable members here.",14
3,Mr FRANKFOSTER,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. When I came to read my Hansard proofs, I found that I had somewhat tangled my speech, and had not been as clear and definite as I should have liked. Under the circumstances, I can quite understand the honourable member attaching a wrong meaning to my words, and he does not appear to yet have got the Tight impression. thought the Commissioners ought to take notice of the objections made by the majority of New South Wales, members in this Chamber-no t by the majority of the members, but only the majority of the New South Wales members who voted against the distribution.",15
4,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does that not make the position worse?,15
5,Mr FRANKFOSTER,Unknown,"No ; and I as yet. desire to have the correct position stated. It was pointed out that there had been neglect to consider community of interest and so forth in the distribution of the electorates, and I expected to see, not a new distribution, but an amended one. I did not expect an amendment on political lines, but an amendment on fair lines. MINISTERS laid upon the table the following papers :- . Sugar Industry-Furthe r telegrams (dated 6th and nth December, 1912) between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premier of Queensland. Ordered to be printed.

6,Dr MALONEV,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of External Affairs, if be has any information regarding the recent referendum in Ohio, a State with a population of 4,500,000, or about the referenda taken in the other States, about which I asked a question, on Friday last.",15
7,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I do not think that we have any official information on the subject, but I shall be glad to have notice of the question. ELECTOR AL DIVISIONS : N EW SOUTH WALES.",15
8,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I wish to know, from the Minister of Home Affairs, if he has asked the Commissioners appointed to redistribute the electoral divisions of New South Wales whether they can submit a fresh scheme before the end of next week ? If he has not asked them, when will he do so? I Mr KING OMALLEY - Mr Oldham  had not received a reply when I left my ofiice this morning.",15
9,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,What was the subject matter of the telegram sent by Mr Oldham ,15
10,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"The telegram asked precisely what the honourable member has asked, but there has been no reply DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE . CADET PROSECUTIONS : FINES : SOLICITORS' COSTS - NAVAL AND MILITAR Y FORCES : PENSIONS-FITZRO Y DOCK : COMMANDER BARNES.",15
11,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I wish to know, from the Honorary Minister representing the Minister of Defence, when'effect will PAPERS. be given to the decision of the latter in the case of the son of Mr Edward Gray, of Alexandria, Sydney. I wrote to Mr Gray on the 8th August, informing him that the Minister had decided to have the'fine inflicted reduced to 2s. for each hour of training missed, but have received a letter from him, dated 4th December, saying that Why is it that there are these interminable delays in the settlement of simple matters by the Defence Department?",15
12,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am unable to explain the delay referred to, but, no doubt, the circumstances have rendered it unavoidable. If the honourable member will put his question on the notice-paper, I . shall obtain a definite reply.",15
13,Mr RILEY,Unknown,H as the Honorary Minister any reply yet to the question which I asked in relation to cadets being called upon to pay costs in a recent prosecution?,15
14,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I take it that the honourable member refers to the case where an Area Officer acted as solicitor and secured costs. The honourable member for Cook has also asked some questions in relation to this matter, and his inquiries and replies are amongst the papers. The Minister of Defence has made inquiries, and, as the report of the officer responsible was not considered satisfactory, he has been requested to refund the costs to the paymaster in New South Wales. Recently, several honourable members have asked questions in relation to pensions for the Naval and Military Forces, and some slight exception was taken to my suggestion that they should look up the Act for themselves. I have now the desired information to the effect that no pensions are provided for any service under the Commonwealth. ""Active service"" is defined by the Defence Act as "" service in or with a force which is engaged in operations against the enemy, and includes any naval or military service in time of war."" Section 57 of the Defence Act readsWhen any member of the Military Forces is killed on active service or on duty, or dies, or becomes incapacitated from earning his living, from wounds or disease contracted on active service or on duty, provision shall be made for his widow and family or for himself, as the case may be, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund at the prescribed rates. The rates have not so far been prescribed. Regulations provide for compensation at certain rates for members of the Defence Forces who are retired or discharged on account of injuries received, or diseases contracted, while in the performance of duty.",16
15,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Is it correct that Commander Barnes has been appointed the Commonwealth representative at the Fitzroy Dock in connection with the construction of war vessels? If so, what are his quaUfications as an expert in that matter?",16
16,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am not aware that the appointment has been made. honourable member will give notice of the question, I shall obtain a definite reply from the Minister.",16
17,Mr HOWE,Unknown,Is Commander Barnes employed by the Commonwealth Administration in any capacity at the Fitzroy Dock?,16
18,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Not to my personal knowledge, but if the honourable member will give notice of the question, I shall inform him how and where Commander Barnes is employed. [250] SUGAR INDUSTRY.",16
19,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister seen the statement in this morning's Argus that the Premier of Queensland says that he sent a telegram to the right honourable gentleman regarding the proposed sugar legislation, to which he has not received a reply. Has the Prime Minister sent .1 reply, and, if so, has he any objection to telling the House the nature of it?",16
20,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I had not seen the statement until my attention was drawn to it by the honourable member. The Premier of Queensland sent a telegram on Friday, but it was not replied to until last evening. If honourable members will look at the printed correspondence which has been laid before Parliament, they will see that the negotiations between this Government and that of Queensland were practically completed by the Premier's telegram of the 5th instant. On the 6th instant, he wired raising new issues. That telegram has been replied to. I shall have pleasure in laying a copy of it , and the reply, on the table, so that they may be printed. According to the reported interview, Mr Denham has shifted his ground altogether; but the original agreement will be carried out. ELECTOR AL ACT . PRESS REPORTS AND ADVERTISEMENTS.  Prime Minister been drawn to the following advertisement, which has appeared in the Bealiba Times, a Victorian country newspaperIMPORTANT NOTICE. Owing to the embargo placed by the Electoral Act upon the freedom of the Press, and the imposition of fines ranging from Â£50 to ^500 for the most trivial offence in connection with reports and advertisements relating to the Federal elections, we have decided to charge 3s. an If the inch for any report published in connection with a candidate's speech, and 6s. an inch for advertisements relating to the election of any candidate-bot h charges to be paid in advance. D. O'BRIEN, Editor and Manager. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - You r chickens are coming home to roost.  has answered the question; his chickens will come home before long. After seeing that advertisement, the secretary of the Political Labour Council, Victoria, who is a candidate for the House of Representatives for the electorate in which Bealiba is situated, wrote to the editor. Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Is the honourable member in order in making a speech ?",16
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member ask his question?  the honourable member for Lang is allowed,17
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must proceed with his question. If honourable members continue interjecting it is not possible for me to follow the honourable member.  Opposition do not desire to hear any more I shall simply ask the Attorney-General whether anything can be done to protect honourable members on both sides against this cruel imposition of 6s. an inch f advertisements.,17
23,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The question that the honourable member has put to me is partly one of law and partly one relating to trade and commerce, particularly that branch trade and commerce that concerns itself with the business side of newspapers. With the business side of newspapers I regret I am entirely unfamiliar. I understand, however, that it is the practice of the. press to know no party so far as adverfulfilled. tisements are concerned, but to insist on its pound of flesh with all that vigour which characterizes its business policy. On the question of law I may venMinister ture to speak with some greater assurance. I know of no law passed' by this Parliamised ment that in any way limits the of the press to say whs.t. it pleases. So. far as I know, a newspaper, according the law, may do exactly as any citizen do-it may say what it pleases, but put' up with the consequences of what it. says. A printer, publisher, editor, or writer, unless his liability is restricted by Statute, is, and always has been, liable for anything he may publish of a libellous nature-. All that this Parliament has done is to provide that the person who writes article in relation to an election after the Peaks ? issue of the writ shall put his name to it . That does not increase the liability of newspaper, but merely enables people know who writes an article. POSTAL DEPARTMENT. CORRESPONDENCE : FARRIERS-ELECTRICA L ENGINEERING STAFF : ANNUAL LEAVE CONTRACT POST-OFFICES-MAN Y PEAKS POST OFFICE.",17
24,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"On the 8th October I wrote to the Post and Telegraph Department on the subject of the wages paid tofarriers at the General Post Office, Sydney, and I received an acknowledgment on the 16th of the same month. I should like the Minister to make inquiries as to why a final reply to my letter has not been, sent, in view of the fact that this matter has been delayed so long.",17
25,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I shall make inquiries. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - 1 desire to ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General a further question relating to the electrical engineering staff. On a previous occasion I asked whether theo r temporary employees in New South Wales, who were subsequently placed on the permanent list, would have the period of their temporary employment considered i i i connection with their annual leave, and theof annual leave reckoned upon that basis. I was informed that that would be done, but have since learned that it is not being carried out at present. Will the Minister representing the Postmaster-General request his colleague to look into the matter and ascertain why the promise has not been enthusiasm and. . Mr THOMAS - Yes .",17
26,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I wish to ask the representing the Postmaster General whether the sum which he prowould be set apart for contract postfreedom offices has yet been allocated?,17
27,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am not familiar w it k to the matter to which the honourable member may refers, but I will bring his question under must the notice of the Postmaster-General.",17
28,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In view of the fact that the Minister of Home Affairs this morning promised to give deliberate and prayerful consideration to another matter, I wish to know whether he will give deliberate and prayerful consideration fo the question of an at once erecting the post-office at Many",17
29,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I had the a matter before me yesterday, and - gave into structions that the building should be erected by electricity, if possible. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS.",17
30,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that certain honourable members, including myself, have notices of motion on the business-paper which are regarded as very important, and whether he will give us, at least, an opportunity before the session closes to' place our views with respect to them before the House.",18
31,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am aware that there are a number of motions standing on the notice-paper in the names of private members, and I think that the most convenient time to take that business will be when the Estimates have been passed. The desire is that the Estimates shall reach the Senate by Wednesday next. Mr. JOSEPH'COOK - It all depends upon the return of the New South Wales electoral distribution scheme.",18
32,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I presume that the business of the country will have to be transacted, irrespective of anything that is going to happen.",18
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I presume that that is the most important business that New South VVales has to consider just now.,18
34,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Honourable members of another place have always complained of the late arrival of the Estimates, and I think that, ou this occasion, they should receive them not later than Wednesday next. The most convenient time to take private members' business will be atter we have disposed of the Estimates. Notice will be given to honourable members, and I may mention incidentally that it will probably be necessary to meet on Saturday, as well as on Monday nexr. ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. PROSECUTION OF CADET COOK : REMISSION OF FINE-NATIONA L PHONOGRAPH COMPANY v. NICHOLSON.",18
35,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Attorney-General, whether inquiries have Deen made respecting the remission of a fine imposed on a cadet named Cook, who, since his prosecution, has made up his arrears of training? I referred to this matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Tuesday evening, and it has been hung up in the Attorney-General's Department for some four or five months. I should like to ask the Prime Minister, with regard, to another case [250]- 2",18
36,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must make that the subject ot another question.,18
37,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I shall ascertain trom the Attorney-General the position of the matter in his Department, and the Honorary Minister will also bring the inquiry before the Minister of Defence.",18
38,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I wish to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to 'the fact that, on 31st July last, I wrote to'the Attorney-General with regard to the case ""of the National Phonograph Company v. Nicholson, which 'disclosed a very obvious defect in the law. I asked that some steps should be taken to remedy the defect. On 6th August, I received from the Attorney General a reply that the matter was being considered. Mr 'WEBSTER - An acknowledgement?",18
39,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Yes . I wrote again on 4th September, but to that second communication have had no reply whatever. I desire to know what steps I am to take to obtain a reply to urgent matters of the kind, seeing that nearly six months have elapsed since I first communicated with the Department on the subject.",18
40,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am quite sure that if the attention of the Attorney-General has been drawn to the matter, it will receive his attention. POPULATION STATISTICS.",18
41,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether 'he has received any report as to the discrepancy between the number of persons on the electoral rolls for New South Wales and Tasmania, and the figures of the Government Statistician in those States? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member was good enough to inform me yesterday that he intended to ask this question. I had the Government Statist and the Chief Electoral Officer in my office this morning, and, as the result of their deliberate and special consultation, T have obtained the following reply :It is now alleged by the Government of New South Wales that the figures supplied by their officers to the Commonwealth Statistician as migration out of the State, and at first stated to be correct after the question of their accuracy had been raised, are really incorrect. It is understood that this alleged inaccuracy is accepted by the Victorian Statistician, and the basis of the conclusion of the State Statisticians is expected to be submitted to 'the Commonwealth Statistician for his consideration. Pending the receipt of this a definite answer cannot be given; but it is understood that Victoria is prepared to admit a very considerable reduction in the estimate of its population, and New South Wales will receive a correspondingly large increase. Inasmuch as a large proportion of the border migration is adult, this will materially affect the voting numbers. PERSONA LEXPLANATIONS . say is the truth.",18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation with regard to an incident which occurred yesterday, and in which I had the honour to be named. see in Hansard, sir, a statement attributed to yourself which reads as follows: The honourable member for Parramatta made a remark referring to myself to the effect that the House was being muzzled. I desire to state that I did not make that remark.",19
43,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member may say that he did not, and the matter, of course, is a very difficult one; but I leave the House to judge between him and myself. I say distinctly that the honourable member did make the remark, and that he addressed it to the honourable member for Wentworth.",19
44,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"As a matter of personal explanation, since my name has been mentioned, I desire to say that the remark was addressed to me, that I heard it, and that it was not, Mr Speaker, what you said it was.",19
45,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Notwithstandin g the honourable member's statement, I say distinctly that the remark was made, and that a great deal more was said regarding mv-self.",19
46,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I was sitting immediately behind",19
47,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order I,19
48,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The honourable member for Parramatta and I desire to say that the statement,19
49,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,19
50,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Attribute d to the honourable member,19
51,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,19
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Was not made by him.,19
53,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I name the honourable member for Richmond for disregarding the authority of the Chair.,19
54,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.58] - The honourable member for Richmond having been named in circumstances that are amongst the most unfortunate that I have experienced, it is my duty to submit a motion. I hope, however, that that honourable member will avail himself of the opportunity of following the usual course.",19
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,He simply said,19
56,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,19
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That he was near me,19
58,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,19
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And that what I,19
60,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Mr Speaker called the honourable member to order,19
61,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,What for? I Mr FISHER - He has been named by Mr Speaker.,19
62,Mr GROOM,Unknown,But what for?,19
63,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I presume for disobeying the Chair.,19
64,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"May we ask, Mr. Speaker, in what way the honourable member disobeyed your ruling?",19
65,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It will be remembered that the honourable member for Capricornia a little while ago adopted a course similar to that just followed by the honourable member for Richmond when, in asking a question, he refused to obey the call of the Chair to order. He persisted in putting his question whilst I was on my feet calling him to order. The honourable member for Richmond deliberately followed the same course. He saw me on my feet, turned from me and, instead of obeying my repeated call to order, went on with the statement that he wished to make. His action constitutes one of the gravest offences, for if an honourable member is to be permitted to disregard the Chair, all authority in the House must cease. In the circumstances, therefore, I ask the Prime Minister to take the necessary step, as he did in the case of the honourable member for Capricornia.",19
66,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I wish only to say, sir, that I was under the impression when you, sir, called "" Order,"" that your call was prompted by the interjections of honourable members. I very much regret what has occurred.",19
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this a party matter ?,19
68,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would point out that, on an occasion like this, honourable members must be silent, and I specially mention the honourable member for Parramatta, who is in the habit of hurling interjections across the chamber. Order must be maintained, and, so far as I am concerned, it will be maintained. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the explanation of the honourable member for Richmond.",19
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"You , sir, have addressed a certain remark to me upon the question of maintaining order",19
70,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,What is the honourable member's point of order ?,20
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,My point of order is that it is not in order for honourable members on your right in chorus to prevent :an honourable member from making an explanation.,20
72,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is perfectly correct. It is not in for honourable members to interject while an honourable member is making an explanation. Nor was the honourable member himself in order in arrogating to him-self authority to chastise honourable members for their interjections.,20
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am the only one - who is mentioned.,20
74,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memher must not interject while I am on my feet. I have repeatedly called the honourable member to order for pursuing that kind of conduct. The honourable member for Richmond saw me on my feet, but, despite that circumstance, he continued his remarks. If such conduct is to be tolerated, all authority in this House will - vanish. I insist, therefore, that the amotion must be proceeded with.  able member for Richmond, and I can - safely swear that he is right in the stater, iment which he has made.",20
75,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"As you, sir, have - named the honourable member for Richmond, it is my duty to move",20
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Hurr y it through.,20
77,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member for Richmond has expressed his regret.,20
78,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"You , sir, having named the honourable member for Richmond, and declared that the motion must be proceeded with, I , as Leader of the House, am in duty bound to submit it. I therefore move, with regretThat the honourable member for Richmond suspended from the service of the House.",20
79,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,For how long?,20
80,Mr FISHER,Unknown,As provided by the Standing Orders-for this sitting.,20
81,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"When you, sir, interposed, I was about to express my regret to you and the House in connection with the incident which has occurred this morning. But, as when you rose you did not ask me to resume my seat, I assumed that your appeal for order had nothing whatever to do with myself. I had not the slightest intention of disobeying you, or disregarding your authority, in any way. If you had asked me to resume my seat, I would have immediately obeyed you.",20
82,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Occasionall y I have order to ask honourable member to resume their seats, but that is because they did not obey the standing order which provides that when Mr Speaker rises, it is the duty of the honourable member who is addressing the House to resume his seat. As the honourable member regrets the circumstances which have arisen, I am prepared to accept his apology. Motion, by leave, withdrawn.",20
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"When an honourable member affirms that he did not make a statement which has been attributed to him, it is the invariable rule that his statement must be accepted. That has been the rule ever since I have been in Parliament.",20
84,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the honourable member rising to a point of order?,20
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . My point of order is that, having made a statement this morning, you, sir, snould have accepted my statement, and not have repudiated it.",20
86,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I assure the honourable member that if I could conscientiously accept his statement. I would willingly do so. But the remark to which he called attention was made alongside me. It is impossible for me to maintain order and to uphold the dignity of the Chamber, and my own self-respect, if I am to sit here and allow such statements concerning myself to pass unchallenged. I am in the hands of the House. If I do wrong, the House can deal with me. Indeed, it can, on a specific motion, go so far as to remove me from the Chair. I thought that the incident of yesterday was closed. I be regret very much that I have had to take the course which I have taken, but, in the circumstances, I cannot possibly withdraw the statement which I have made. The statement was made that an attempt was being made to muzzle the House. '",20
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I did not make that statement.,20
88,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Unde r the circumstances, I regret very much that I cannot accept the honourable member's statement.",20
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What you, sir, now say is that three honourable members are stating what is not true.' That is the plain intimation which you make to the House.",21
90,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"May I , sir, put this view to you: The three honourable members who were sitting close together",21
91,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Is this a point of order?,21
92,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Yes . The statement of Mr Speaker is a reflection on the personal honour of three honourable members.,21
93,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,What about the personal honour of Mr Speaker?,21
94,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"This question has nothing to do with the honour of Mr Speaker. He may not have heard what was said. The remark was intended for me, and possibly was not properly heard by him. But I am willing to make a statutory declaration",21
95,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,What i the honourable member's point of order. He cannot discuss a question like this-h e must state his point of order definitely.,21
96,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"My point of order is that the three honourable members who are immediately concerned have absolutely disclaimed the accuracy of your recollection of the remark which was made yesterday. In persisting that your recollection is solutely accurate, you, sir, are reflecting on the honour of three honourable members, and I submit that that reflection ought to be withdrawn.",21
97,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As I have already said, if I could conscientiously withdraw it, I would do so. But the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Wentworth must not forget that they came to the House this morning and attempted to make it appear that I have told a deliberate falsehood.",21
98,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,No .,21
99,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Franklin was not here, and knows nothing at all about it. He must not interject. I regret very much that I have to take such an undignified course. There seems to be a desire on the part of some honourable members to make a disturbance in this matter. I regret very much the disturbance that occurred yesterday, but I must protect myself. Under the circumstances the whole matter must drop.",21
100,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I have a personal explanation to make.,21
101,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order 1 Later:,21
102,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I understood yoiÂ» to say, sir, that I was not in the House when the incident to which reference hasrecently been made occurred yesterday. I wish to state that I was in the House where the incident occurred yesterday, and I was; also here when the matter was revived today.",21
103,Mr KELLY,Unknown,May I make an explanation?,21
104,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Yes .,21
105,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"When I came into the House today I had not the slightest idea that this question would be raised, and I had not the slightest intention after it was raised of in any way reflecting on your truthfulness. I was merely pointing out the accuracy of the statement made by the honourable member for Parramatta.",21
106,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have just had my s proofs brought to me, from which it appears that I named the honourable member for Parramatta. The honourable member for Flinders asked me the reason why I took this course. I saidThe honourable member for Parramatta madea remark referring to myself to the effect - that the House was being muzzled*. I went on to say that the Chair must take ab- action to protect itself,' Then the honourable member for Parramatta rose in his place and said I respectfully submit, Mr Speaker, that yoiu had no right whatever to hear the remark in. question. It was-not intended for your ears.",21
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I ' rise to makean explanation. It is quite true that I made that observation; but at that stage F was not concerned about verbal accuracy. Afterwards, however, when I said whatyou had said, the position was different,, and that is my justification for bringing the matter forward today, so that it could be corrected. You, sir, have told me that .? came here to make a disturbance",21
108,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order!,21
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And I have to put up with this sort of thing.,21
110,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! BANK NOTES.,21
111,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the printer, who has been engaged to print the Commonwealth Bank Notes, has yet got his staff together, and whether any information can be given as to when the notes will be: issued ?",21
112,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think the machinery ?s just about to be landed, and that early in the new year the notes will be issued. I do not know whether the staff is quite - complete, but it will be completed as soon iis the machinery is housed and ready for use.",22
113,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"I wish to Iknow whether the attention of the Prime Minister has been called to the fact that alarge number of dilapidated notes which sire in a highly insanitary condition are - now in circulation, and whether he will take steps to have them withdrawn?",22
114,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"For over two years past action has been taken in the direction suggested. We have asked the banks to - co-operate with us in withdrawing dilapidated or insanitary notes, and as soon as - such notes are sent into us they are destroyed. We have already burnt some tons of them, and will continue to destroy them as rapidly as possible. NORTHERN TERRITORY. TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY.",22
115,Mr GORDON,Unknown,"I understand that some ""time ago the Minister of External Affairs requested the South Australian Government ""to supply him with certain plans and surveys in connection with the transcontinental railway route north of Oodnadatta.

If that be the rule of Parliament, it is possible for a Government supporter, or for any member, to prevent the discussion of Government appointments, or of any act of administration, by putting on the notice-paper a motion having reference to it. Surely no standing order can go so far as that. Because notice has been given of a motion asking for a Select Committee to inquire into a certain matter, are we now precluded from dealing with a subject only indirectly referred to? I respectfully submit that the question needs further consideration.",24

147,Mr FOWLER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If you rule, Mr. Speaker, that I cannot discuss the appointment of Mr Chinn, I have nothing further to say on this motion. I do not wish to try to evade your ruling. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [11.34] - Some time ago, when the Prime Minister was representing the Postmaster-General, who was indisposed at the time, I inquired whether the temporary employees in the Sydney Post Office, and particularly those engaged in the Mechanical Branch, would have their temporary service reckoned when arrangements for annual leave were being made. I was assured that that service would be reckoned, but I am informed now that that has not been done, and that advantage is being 'taken of an award concerning the employees - of this branch of the Department to deprive them of holidays which, I understand from the Prime Minister, they would receive. Many of the temporary employees have, as a matter of fact, been appointed to the permanent staff; but, because they have not been in the latter position for twelve months, they are not allowed any holidays. This is held to be very unjust; and, after the definite promise of the ister, these men feel that they are suffering under a distinct breach of faith. I do not know whether the Minister himself is responsible, or whether officers of the Department have taken upon themselves to disregard his recommendation; but it is of the highest importance that all promises of this nature should be respected. It may be, perhaps, that the Minister has not: power to regulate matters of the kind; but he ought to have ascertained that before he gave the definite reply, for which hemust take all responsibility. A Ministerought not to endeavour to hide himself .behind officers who are under his instructions;. and this, so far as I can learn, appears to be the fact in this case. However, there is no doubt that these public servants have a legitimate grievance, and their case ought to be looked into and adjusted. We ought move to promote, by every legitimate means iir our power, good feeling amongst the officersof the various Departments, and encourage them in every way to perform their dutiesefficiently and loyally. When little mattersof the kind to which I have referred areneglected or overlooked-whe n promisesare disregarded or deliberately broken-the elements of discontent are introduced. These matters may appear small to Ministers and heads, but they are of considerable importance to the employees themselves; and it is not surprising that, under such circumstances, there should spring upfeelings of resentment, which develop tosuch an extent as to interfere with the effectiveness of the services rendered. I anr loth to occupy the time of the House, but this is the only opportunity now presented, and I make no apology for bringing this matter forward. I do not know who is representing the Postmaster-General, and; my previous inquiries were directed to the Prime Minister. It was to the latter gentleman that I was addressing myself a few moments ago, but he has disappeared. I can only hope that the Honorary Minister will make a note of what I have said, and 1 that some attempt will be made to do justice to those men, who have, as a matter of fact, given over twelve months' continuous service, and whose annual leaveshould be calculated accordingly.",25
148,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Franklin) [11.42]-. - This is the only occasion now afforded"" to bring under the notice of the House and: the country important questions which need"" ventilation. Under our present system, theMin- Estimates are rushed through in an all night sitting, which practically prevents all discussion; and, as private members' day has disappeared, the present, and certainly the least desirable, opportunity has to beseized. Honourable members on the mainland, with means of communication by rail' and splendid lines of steamers on thecoast, cannot realise the position of theipeople in Tasmania, who are altogether dependent on anythingbut efficient sea-carriage. The Government had a splendid opportunity to remove existing difficulties when arranging the mail contract; but that tbusiness was very sadly bungled. This - did not arise from want of proper representation, because Tasmanian members on both sides of this House, and also - of the Senate, interviewed the Min^ - ister and urged' the desirability of not - doing exactly what the Government have .done. Under a mail contract there are ways .in which, not only a State, but Australia as a whole, can be very materially assisted. Oh previous occasions I have pointed out the serious deficiencies in the means of communication between Queensland and 'Tasmania. Queensland, as the most northern State, is the best market in Australia for Tasmania, while Tasmania, to ithe extent of its population, is the largest - consumer of Queensland produce; and ihere is every reason why there should be a - direct service between the two States. - Quite recently, one firm alone in Tasmania .guaranteed to ship 30,000 cases of fruit and jam every fortnight if a direct service were provided. At present all cargo has to be transhipped at Sydney, with the attendant risks and cost. As a matter fact, this transhipment means, I believe,-doublingthe freight; and there is no that direct communication would enormously increase the mutual exchange of commodities. As to the mail contract, the conditions in the winter, so far as the RotomaJtana is concerned, are no better than they were twenty-five years ago. That steamer is unsuited for the Tamar River, and has to transfer her passengers to the deck of - a small boat; and the plight of the women and children, especially in the winter, may he imagined. At present the Government - are paying a subsidy of ,Â£13,000, and the shipping companies offered, for an additional Â£2,000, to place a second Loongana in commission.",25
149,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,There were conditions attached to that offer.,26
150,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"There were no unreasonable conditions. The north-west - coast of Tasmania is now one of the most prosperous and important portions of the Commonwealth, and the shipping companies offered, in-consideration of the increased subsidy, to run a second Loongana to Burnie and Launceston, by varied routes, - five days a week. ' This, of course, would prove an enormous advantage to the north-west coast,- andgreatly increase the traffic between the mainland and Tasmania. However, the Government, for the sake of a paltry Â£2,000, rejected the shipping company's offer. I have always maintained that there is a disastrous shipping combine on the coast of Australia. The Union Steam-ship Company and the Huddart Parker Company both run vessels t c Tasmania, but they charge the same fares and freights, and act practically as one combination. A deputation of the representatives of Tasmania, sitting on both sides of the House, waited on the Minister and urged that a joint contract should not be accepted. The Government, however, refused our representations, and have accepted a joint tender from the two companies. If there is anything that is 'calculated to bolster up a combine, and prevent fair competition, it is the acceptance of such a tender. - Mr ROBERTS - What else could have been done?",26
151,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Ha d the Government taken the matter in hand in time the position would have been different. They should have refused to accept a joint tender.,26
152,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Then Tasmania would of- have been left without a mail service.,26
153,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Would the Comdoubt monwealth Government allow a shipping company to dictate to them in a matter of this sort? Had the Government shown a little more backbone we should have secured' a better service. But so long as the shipping companies knew that' the Government were not in earnest in the matter, and that they had only to present a joint tender to secure its acceptance, what else could be expected from them? The Government should have said that they would not allow any private company to dictate to the Commonwealth the terms of such a contract. There is absolutely no justification for the extension of the existing contract for a further period of two years. The Government were warned by all the representatives of Tasmania that the present service was unsatisfactory, and that, beyond the provision of the Loongana, no attempt had been made to meet the growing requirements of the passenger and goods traffic between the mainland and Tasmania. We pointed out that so far as the Rotornahana is concerned no improvements had been made for the last twenty-five years, and that there was existing, in connection with the whole service, a state of affairs-that should not be tolerated in connection with a Government contract. The offer made by the Union Steam-ship Company was an exceedingly fair one. It underjoint took for an increased subsidy of Â£ 2 , 0 0 a year to place on the line a second vessel two years. of the type of the Loongana; to give a five days a week service each way between Launceston and Melbourne; a two days a week service direct between Burnie and this port, and an alternate service vid Launceston, which would have been of enormous advantage to the people of Tassome distance down the Tamar. mania. That improved service could have been secured by increasing the subsidy delayed week after week. from Â£ 1 3 , 0 0 0 to Â£ 1 5 , 0 0 0 a year. The were put before the Government. Government, however, refused the offer, and allowed things to d r if t until, they had to accept a joint tender.",26
154,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The honourable member up. is misrepresenting the facts.,27
155,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The Minister see my facts in the correspondence tabled, as I did.

I perused the offer only yesterSydney day, and I repeat that the Government alQueensland. lowed every opportunity to pass. The only reason I can give for their stupendous blunder is that they desired to make the service as unpopular as possible, so that they would be able to come along later with a proposal for a line of State-owned steamers. If that is the object they have in view they are going the right way to achieve it because one section of the existof ing service is very unsatisfactory. Rather than expend an additional sum of Â£ 2 , 0 a year they turned down one of the most conditions for which we asked. liberal offers ever made in connection with Commonwealth mail service. gana. with her three boilers going, does knots an hour, and under four boilers she can .do 21 knots an hour. is fast, clean, well officered, well-manned, years. and well managed, and the Governtwo ment could have secured for the seranother vice a second vessel of that type by increaswith Tasmania. ing the subsidy from Â£ 1 3 , 0 0 0 to Â£ 1 5 , 0 0 0 a year. I regret that they did not act upon the advice given by the representatives of Tasmania in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Surely this not a party question. Senator Findley, who was acting for the Postmaster-General, appeared to l Â« quite in sympathy with the views expressed by the deputation of reprerejection sentatives of Tasmania which waited upore him ; but, for some unexplained reason, the Government have deliberately accepted a tender for the continuation of the 0 a contract on the existing terms for another During the winter season we have often to travel between Melbourne and Tasmania by a steamer that was running twenty-five years ago. and which cannot go up to the Launceston wharf. As a matter of fact, passengers travelling by her have to be transhipped into a small river boat When that steamer is running the mail service.is All these factsI n the winter season this steamer often arrives in* at last, the Tamar too late to catch the Hobart express, and the mails for the whole of Tasmania are consequently hung; Another request made by us was that instead of letters being carried betweeir can Hobart and Sydney under the poundagesystem a small mail contract should be entered into for adirect service.

156,Mr FENTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"This Government have, dealt justly with Tasmania.",27
157,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I repeat that theis Government have not dealt justly with us.. The people of the north-west coast, andparticularly the i-f-sidents of Burnie. havesuffered a very grave injustice owing to theof the Union Steam-ship Company's offer. Burnie is the nearest port to the mainland, and if the Oonah, the old boat now trading between Melbourne and Burnie, were replaced, as was proposed, by a vessel of the Loongana type the passenger traffic would enormously increase. These maritime matters are not of much concern to the people of the mainland, where, with one exception, the State capitals are connected by rail, but they are of vital importance to Tasmania. As an island State, its communication with the remaining States of the Union must be by water, and the offer to provide a vastly improved service for an additional Â£2,000 should have been accepted without the slightest hesitation. The Government by rejecting it have done an incalculable injustice to the people of Tasmania, and it is one that will be resented by them at the first opportunity.",27
158,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Fremantle) [12.4] - ] wish to bring before the House.a few facts and figures in relation to the use of karri instead of jarrah sleepers, and also to contradict some statements made by the Minister in reply to a question put by me-state- . ments that are calculated to do one of the biggest industries in Australia a great deal of injury. I asked the honourable gentleman the following question :Is he aware that the export of untreated jarrah sleepers from Western Australia to India has, during the past four years, increased nearly 50 per cent: ? The Minister was unable to give me any information on the subject. The portion of the Minister's reply to which I take exception readsSo far as I have been able to ascertain, the evidence is the other way. That is a most damaging statement to make concerning the industry, and I wish show that official figures supply a flat tradiction to it. The statistics which tend to quote are taken from the annual report of the Western Australian Forestry Department- a report which is not preread pared for the purpose of humbugging body. But I am afraid that somebody is attempting to humbug us. From the docudeep-seated ment in question I learn that, in 1906-7, the export of jarrah to India was 2.1,506,759 superficial feet, in 1907-8 was 20,520,246 superficial feet, and in 1908-9 it was 47,914,855 superficial feet; atotal of 89,991,860 superficial feet.

159,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,What did the Minister say?,28
160,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"He said that there had been a decrease. I repeat that these figures do not include hundreds of shiploads of This timber, which have probably gone to India, outside of the timber which has been handled by the Forestry Department. Seeing that these figures are available tc me, I submit that they ought to have been available to the Minister. Some explanation is due to the House as to why they were not forthcoming. We are entitled to the best information that is procurable in the Commonwealth. Then, the Minister statedThere is a motive behind this motion, and a deep-seated one, too. It is the last wail of a dying monopoly's defence in this House. That is a very grave charge to make, ancl I have received a number of letters inquiring why I did not resent it. The Minister went on to sayI hold that the motion is an attack in defence of monopoly, which is the Jarrah Company of Western Australia, who have all, or a great portion, of the jarrah monopolized. My attitude is against monopoly, and in defence of the interests of Western Australia. . . . It is the last stand of monopoly's defenders in this House. I think that is pretty strong language to use, especially in view of the figures which I have quoted. The report issued by the Forestry Department of Western Australia to for the year 1912 contains a list of the consaw-mill permits which were in existence I inin that State in June of the present year.

None of them have been working for more than a few years, because permits were not granted until a few years ago. All these mills are working upon permits, whereas Millar Brothers are working on leases. In such circumstances, how can a Jarrah Combine exist?",28
161,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I do not think it was suggested that there was a combine.,29
162,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"It was suggested that there .was a Jarrah Combine. The mills which'are held by the Millar Brothers are Dis- not mentioned in the list which I have read at all. The former are established on old leases, such as the Jarrahdale, Canning, and Mornington mills, the M. C. Davis' concessions at the Leeuwin, and the Kirrup concessions and leases. The mills mentioned in the list I have given are being worked upon permits. It is quite clear, therefore, that there cannot be a Jarrah Combine, and it was grossly unfair of the Minister to attempt to mislead the House in the way that he did, especially in view of the fact that this information was available to him in a Government document. His statements are calculated to do great injury to the jarrah industry. For example, he said that the industry was dying owing to the fact that white ants preferred jarrah to any other timber. That was a most damaging statement to make. In 1909 the value of the jarrah exported was .Â£833,710; in 1910, it vvas Â£918,311 ; in I 0 "" > Â£ 9 3 > H i ; aiid in 1912, ,Â£997,9941 Taking the year 1909 as the standard, the total increase in the three years following was Â£328,916; and yet, by way of explanation for the use of karri, we are told that the jarrah timber trade is dying out. I always look for a motive when extraordinary statements of this kind are made, and I want to know why an absolutely inaccurate representation has been put forward in connection-with this matter? In contradiction of a statement made by me, it was stated that sleepers 9 feet long were used generally throughout the world on railways of 4-ft. 8J-in gauge. The Minister mentioned that 9-ft. sleepers were used on the New South Wales railways. I say that such long sleepers are not used in New South Wales or in any other country.",29
163,Mr KELLY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Does the Minister admit that 9-ft. sleepers have been ordered by them ?,29
164,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Yes . The Minister stated that 9-ft. sleepers were used on the Pennsylvania line; but when I travelled over that railway I took photographs and measured the sleepers, which are only 8 f t . 6 in. long on those portions of the line over which the fastest traffic passes. On the Canadian Pacific railway line the sleepers are of all lengths, ranging from 8 feet to 8 f t . 6 in., but there are no 9-ft. sleepers. The railway authorities have more sense than to use longer sleepers, because when a sleeper is too long it becomes hollow, and is the worse you can put into a road. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The says it is necessary to use more 8-ft 6-in. sleepers than 9-ft. sleepers.",29
165,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Then the engineer eught to be dealt with. In Victoria, on railways constructed on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, 8-ft. sleepers are being./used by the thousand, and they are quite long enough. In South Australia, on the 5-ft. 3-in. .gauge lines, the standard length of sleeper has been 8 f t . 6 in. Thus, it will be seen that if 8-ft. 6-in. sleepers are sufficiently long for use in connection with lines carrying very heavy traffic in South Australia, they should be long enough on a 4-ft. 8^-in. line. I .have here a very valuable report dealing with the different methods of treatment of timber throughout the world. The different sizes of sleepers treated by different processes are mentioned; but in no case is a 9-ft. sleeper referred to, and the longest sleeper used on a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge railway is 8 f t . 6 in.",30
166,Mr WEST,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,A 9-ft. sleeper is much better than one of shorter length.,30
167,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I say it is not. For many years the standard length of sleepers in Western Australia on railways of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge was 7 feet. The South Australian Government adopted sleepers of 6-ft. 6-in. lengths on their railways of similar gauge; and Western Australia altered her.standard length to 6 f t . 6 in. That is in the country where the timber grows. If a sleeper is too long, it becomes hollow, and tightens the gauge. Honourable members may see thousands of discarded sleepers lying alongside the Victorian railways, ancl they will find that nearly all of them are hollow.",30
168,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"That is the result of the action of the sun. * Mr HEDGES - No . They come out of the road in that way. 1 want to know whether we are to set on one side the experience of the world in this matter? We have the example of the Canadian Northern line, >the Canadian Pacific railway, and the Pennsylvania railway, and thousands of miles of other lines. Mr KING O'MALLEY - What length of sleepers on the Pennsylvania line ?",30
169,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The longest sleepers are only 8 f t . 6 in . , and that railway carries the heaviest traffic in the world.",30
170,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"My officers must have beeâ¢ furnished with incorrect information from America. engineer Mr HEDGES - The only places where 9 feet sleepers are used is on railways of 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, where they have put in brackets round the curves. In these cases they require a longer sleeper. It has been stated that it is not intended to ballast the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line, but it will have to be ballasted. I do not say that where the line passes through sandy country bottom ballast will be required, but unless top ballast is put down so much sand will be thrown up that the gear of the engines and rolling stock will be cut to pieces. In gravelly country, perhaps, trains may be run through without ballast on the line for - years, but the rest of the line will have to be ballasted. If 8 feet sleepers are used instead of 9 feet sleepers, the cost of the line will be reduced by from Â£ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 to Â£ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0, and I claim that what has proved good enough in other parts of the world should be good enough for us. I cannot understand why we should use longer lengths than are employed elsewhere, seeing that we have the best of all timber for sleepers and use a bigger sleeper so far as width is concerned. There is no comparisonbetween jarrah and pine for sleeper purposes. Another element of expense has not been mentioned, namely, the cost of handling. The 9 feet sleepers will weigh 2 cwt. each, and we are told that plate-laying machines are to be employed. I contend that it will .not be practicable to work such machines, seeing that they are made to handle only very light pine sleepers, which may be thrown about anyhow. We have heard a great deal about these treatment processes, and the time they occupy. I find that in the case of green timber the boiling in hot preservative occupies from eight to ten hours, and the bathing in cold preservative eight to sixteen hours, the total time occupied being from sixteen to twenty hours. We shall have to use green timber, because no appreciable quantity of seasoned timber will be available, and honourable members may calculate how long it will take to treat 200,000 tons of timber... In the case of seasoned timber the boiling; is the in hot preservative occupies from threetoÂ» six hours, and the bathing in cold preservative four to eight hours, or a total of fourteen hours. With this process, it. is, possible to impregnate only certain classes of wood even under pressure. It is 'not proposed to 'treat our sleepers under pressure, and it is questionable whether these; processes will be applicable to the hardest timber in the world such as we shall have to deal with. I have here the specification of the proposed Powell process as published in the Engineer in London on September 6, 1912. It reads as follows:Patent applied for oth August, 1911, and in London, 14th August, igi2. No. 18,041. "" SEASONING OR HARDENING TIMBER. W. Powell, 718 Salisbury House, "" The following example of this process relates to the rapid artificial seasoning of oneinch pieces of newly-felled walnut, but it may be taken as typical. "" Sugar solution-Initial temperature about 120 deg. Fah., for about one hour-(1 inch thick). ""The timber is immersed in a 25 per cent, solution of sugar in many of its forms, the initial temperature being about 120 deg. Fah. "" The timber is allowed to remain in the solukarri. tion at this temperature for about an hour, until a fair amount of air has been given off."" Honourable members will see that it takes one hour to treat a piece of wood one inch thick. If the treatment of timber 1 inch thick is to occupy one hour, how long will it take to treat hardwood sleepers 5 inches thick, seeing that 2""? inches will have to be penetrated from each side to reach the middleThe temperature of the solution is then raised gradually at the rate of 100 degrees per hour to boiling point, nnd maintained for about four hours at from 200 degrees to 212 degrees Fahreineit until most of the air in the wood is exhausted, and the wood is sufficiently cooked. We shall have 200,000 tons to deal with. So it is cooked sleepers we are going to have after all ! The timber is then allowed to remain in the solution until it has cooled to 140 degrees Fahreineit or thereabouts, when it is removed to a drying chamber, containing moist air, say, at about 140 degrees Fahreineit, containing 80 per cent, moisture. The temperature of the drying chamber is then raised to 180 or 220 degrees Fahreineit, when the degree of moisture is gradually reduced to 30 or 20 per cent, the timber being allowed to remain in the chamber until it has given up the greater part of the moisture, by which time it is seasoned. If we have to wait until all that has been done, it will be a long time before the railway is finished. Good timber, able for the work, could be obtained at much less costIf it is desired to treat the wood against action of white ants or the like, about 10 per cent, of some metallic salt-for instance, of arsenic-is added to the solution before timber is immersed therein. Mr Hedges. We are not told how the arsenic is to be got in solution, or kept in solution. There seems to be no provision for the agitation of the liquid, and if sleepers remain three or four hours in the chamber the arsenic will in that time sink to the bottom. This information's dated 14th August last, and granted as I know that many honourable members have an open mind on the subject, I thought it right to put it before them. It is claimed by the company that they London Wall, E.C. can turn sapwood into good timber.",30
171,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If the company claims that, it will claim anything.",31
172,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I have here a telegram from a Mr Courtaigne calling my attention to the fact that an article in the Mining Journal states Limestone country route Kalgoorlie-Augusta Railway obviates powellising sleepers. Therefore, jarrah should be used instead powellised I do not know who is the author of that article. Parry Brothers were charged in Sydney 7s.,per 100 feet super., and their timber was spoilt by being boiled. The same thing happened to some timber supplied by the Victorian Government. There are a few other matters in connection with this big work which I wish to bring before the House. The first is the statement contained in a publication which is put before us by the Minister of Home Affairs every two months, that he has purchased four locomotives from the New South Wales Government for this job at Â£1,000 each. Reverting to the locomotives purchased from the New South Wales Government for Â£1,000 each, I would remind the House that that Government is at its wits' end to obtain locomotives for the traffic of its own railways, and, I believe, is importing engines as well as making all it can. What are we likely to do with four old engines that the New South Wales Government is willing to get rid of? If I had an enemy who was going to build a railway, I would like to make him a present of these locomotives, and compel him to use them; it would be the worse turn I could do him.",31
173,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"As a contractor, suithave you not used worse engines?",31
174,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"We have 1,000 miles of track to lay, and the best locomotives the that could be bought would not be too good a salt for the work. We require for this work the engines that will give the least trouble, and will cost the least in repairs. When an engine may be 200 or 300 miles from the end of a line, and the repairing shops, we do not want any risk of its breaking down.",31
175,Mr LAIR DSMITH,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,H as the honourable member ever seen a new engine used on a job of this kind?,32
176,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Thes e locomotives are unsuitable for the work for which they are to be used. Within the last twelve months, I bought an engine for a company in which I am interested, and had to pay Â£ 4 , 5 0 0 for it .",32
177,Mr DEAKIN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,A second-hand engine?,32
178,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"- A new engine. would be impossible to purchase second hand an engine good enough for the work that has to be done in the construction of the trans-Australian railway for less than 50 per cent, more than I gave, because the gauge is to be 4 f t . 8Â£ in . , and very heavy loads will have to be drawn. Some time ago, the Minister for Home Affairs promised that he would adopt the centre safety coupling for the rolling-stock to be used on this line; but tenders have been called for waggons framed for outside buffers. If these waggons are built in accordance with the drawings, it will be impossible to equip them with centre buffers. Only yesterday, or the day before, the Argus mentioned that a man was injured in passing between the buffers of some vehicles he was coupling, and many accidents occur in that way. But on the thousands of miles of railway in Canada, there is not one vehicle with outside buffers, and there is, therefore, no dangerous dodging between buffers, to couple and uncouple. We are starting with a clean sheet, and are in a position to adopt the best style of construction. I would not hesitate about adopting centre saw vehicles, equipped with centre buffers and couplings, being coupled and uncoupled when trains were being put on to pontoons, and it was evident that the process is a simple one. Every railway in the States was required to adopt this coupling by certain date.",32
179,Mr FENTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,-Has not the use of patent to be paid for?,32
180,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I do not know, but the Commonwealth can afford to use the best that is used elsewhere. want men to be hurt if that can be prevented by using a safety equipment. Yet them? tenders have been called for waggons framed with outside buffers.",32
181,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I thought that the Minister had complied with the honourable member's request in this matter.,32
182,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I thought so, too; but I have seen the design, and it provides for outside buffers. In theinterests of the men who will have to handle our trains, I ask honourable members opposite, who have more influence with the Minister than we have, to get him to carry out his promise. 1I have also seen the plans of some hopper waggons. I believe that some of these waggons have been delivered Their design is a very funny one, though the arIt rangement will be a costly one for the Commonwealth. A small boy drawing a picture on a slate might show a waggon with a hook sticking out at the end, but that is an absurd design to follow for real waggons. In this case, however, the coupling hook is bolted to the outside. There is no through gear, and no cradle; the draw comes on the outside buffer.",32
183,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Does the honourable member tliink that they are not strong enough?,32
184,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"They are not strong enough for a perambulator. With the best gear obtainable, I have had seven headstocks out in one day on a grade. What would be the result when reliance was placed on an outside coupling? Any one in my employment who adopted such an arrangement would not be there long. A number of muck waggons, side-tip and end-tip, are being built in Sydney to be sent to Port Augusta; but usually, when a contractor has finished work in one State, and wishes to remove his plant to another, he burns the woodwork of his waggons, and carries only the ironwork and frames with him.",32
185,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The woodwork is buffers. I not worth the freight?,32
186,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"No . A good blacksmith and a good carpenter would soon fix up as many waggons as were needed. quite I have built hundreds of such waggons, and, therefore, know what I am talking a about. The strangest part of the business is that hitherto Australian hardwood has the been found good enough for tip-work waggons, but these were built of oregon; and when the first broke down, they were never tried again. Further, these waggons We do not have been built 7 f t . 9 in . high.",32
187,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Were tenders called for,32
188,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I do not know'. We must not blame the contractor, who has no power to design, but only to construct. Of the platelayers' trolleys, the first one smashed up, and the platelayers' tools that were sent round could not be used, and. with the other gear, are in the store yet. I am told that the purchase of this obsolete plant was a Godsend to those who had it to dispose of. Then the points and crossings are of the oldest type in existence; and it would be interesting to know who fathered them on the Commonwealth. We are starting with a clean slate, and from the first I have contended that the best machinery and appliances are not too good for us, and must always prove the cheapest in the long run. A Government can surely always afford to buy new gear of the best; and, in any case, when we have done, it could be sold, half-worn out, to the poor contractors. The most astonishing piece of plant is, perhaps, that which is known by the name of the steam navvy, and I am informed that it is commonly spoken of in the West as "" Deane's Folly."" This machine has been constructed to run on rollers instead of on rails, and as there is no power strong enough to move it through the sand, it is lying there, half buried, as morants and seagulls. I do not know what to say of an engineer who would purchase a supposed steam shovel that does not run on rails, and then try to pull it, with its 9-in. wheels, through the sand. America, a company called for competitive ideas for navigating a canal; and, at a Board meeting, they received a suggestion that, as nearly all the freight came into the town* and only empty barges returned, the best idea would be to raise the canal by 17 feet at the other end. The directors were just about to adopt this amazing suggestion when a little red-headed director, who, as a rule, was taken little notice of, pointed out in a small voice that there was great likelihood, if the canal were raised as suggested, of the water, as well as the barges, coming to town. It would appear as though there were some equally eminent engineers in the employ of the Commonwealth. A steam navvy should be constructed to run on rails of the same gauge as the railway, and not, as in the present case, on the natural surface of the ground, especially in view of the fact that the natural surface is sand. It has been said that there are a number of people who, had they been brought up as farmers, would plant their seed with a gimlet; and Mr Hedges. a representative of New South Wales hassuggested that, in view of our experience, the Commonwealth will require a whole shipload of ""gimlets"" before this work is finished. This steam navvy has 9-in. wheels and 12-in. wheels.",32
189,Mr FOWLER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,What is it used for?,33
190,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"As I have said, as a roost for cormorants and seagulls; so that the Minister of Home Affairs has 'now several more "" roosters*"" in his Department, though slightly differing from the usual breed. It is said that this steam navvy cost the Government about Â£1,500. I wish to see this railway pushed to completion; and I hope that the Government will secure the best possible appliances. Instead of a steam navvy, as in this instance, with a J-yard dipper, there should be one with dippers of not less than2 yards. When I started railway works I commenced with 2-yard plant and finished up with 4-yard plant; and if I started again I should secure a plant of still larger capacity.",33
191,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Poo r old contractors ! Western Australia will have no a roost for cor- more of them.,33
192,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,It will not be very long before the people of Australia will be tired of buying .steam navvies for cormorants to roost upon. In Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m.,33
193,Mr LIVINGSTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Barker) [2.30] I listened with pleasure to the speech delivered this morning by the honourable member for Fremantle, and feel that unless the statements made by the honourable member in regard to the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway can be refuted by the Minister of Home Affairs, an immediate and thorough inquiry should be held. It is well-known that the honourable member for Fremantle is a man of wide experience in railway construction, and in view of the big railway undertakings before the Commonwealth, it is well that we should have such a man in. the House. I do not think that the Minister of Home Affairs is to blame for what has occurred. He has to depend upon his officers, and I am convinced that if he found, on inquiry, that the statements made this morning by the honourable member for Fremantle could be substantiated, he would not allow the officer responsible to remain in the Service another day. The Minister has no axe to grind. He is acting in what he believes to be the best interests of the people, and ihe position is the same in regard to the honourable member for Fremantle. It can never be said of this Parliament that any of its members have made money out of it. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Thos e who have passed away have been mostly poor men.",33
194,Mr LIVINGSTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"They certainly - were not rich men. VVe are indebted to the honourable member for Fremantle for the information he has given us regarding the powellising process-informatio n which must convince the House that the system is altogether too costly for us to adopt. No better timber for sleepers can be found than that which is. available in Australia. We have large, supplies of jarrah in Western Australia, and millions of good red-gum sleepers can still be obtained at very small cost in South Australia. If the Minister thinks that an 8 ft. 6 in. sleeper is sufficient for the purposes of the transcontinental railway, I am sure that he will not use a -9 feet sleeper, because he desires to avoid waste. No country has better timber supplies than has Australia, and no country has abused its timber resources more than we have done. I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle that only the best locomotives should be used in connection with, this railway. We have been told, however, that the Government have purchased four locomotives at a cost of about Â£4,700. I should imaginethat one thoroughly good up-to-date locomotive would be worth that amount, and the honourable member for Fremantle has told us that he paid as much as Â£4,000 for one delivered In Western Australia.",34
195,Mr MATHEWS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,-He might have paid too much.,34
196,Mr LIVINGSTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"He is not the man to pay too much for anything. I trust that the Minister will profit by the advice given by the honourable member in regard to the engine buffers, and do everything possible to save life and to insure good conditions for the men working on the railway. Reference was made by my honourable friend to the fact that high waggons had been obtained, with the result that the material which they are to remove will have to be thrown by the men to a height of 7 feet.",34
197,Mr FENTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,But a steam shovel is to be used.,34
198,Mr LIVINGSTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The honourable member has told us that the steam shovel which has been ordered will weigh 20 tons, and such a shovel could not be taken through sand, or used in any part of the district of Port Augusta. The waggons built to suit that shovel will, I believe, remain idle. The Minister of Home Affairs issues every month a very valuable, digest of the works that his Department has in hand. The publication is a most useful one, and the honourable gentleman's name will always be associated with it. It shows that he is not ashamed of the work that his Department is doing. I find by reference to the Digest thab the steam shovel cost Â£1,219, d that an order was givea a n for it some months ago. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have not taken it over yet.",34
199,Mr LIVINGSTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Judgin g by what the honourable member for Fremantle has said, I think that the Department will be sorry if it does take it over. I shall be pleased if the Minister early next week places before the House a full statement in reply to the charges made by the honourable member for Fremantle in the able speech that he delivered this morning. The building of this transcontinental railway is one of the most important undertakings that "" the Commonwealth has ever entered upon, and I hope that this matter will not be allowed to rest where it is. We have in the House experts in nearly every branch of industry, and if the Government would only be guided by'tlieir advice, they would save many thousands of pounds.",34
200,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The honourable member for Fremantle would use a new engine on ballasting works.,34
201,Mr HEDGES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I would.,34
202,Mr LIVINGSTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,And there is nohonorable member whose opinions concerning railway matters would be taken before those of the honourable member for Fremantle.,34
203,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,He had only to build one railway to make a fortune.,34
204,Mr LIVINGSTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The honourable member would not mind making a fortune in the same way. I hope that the Minister will have an inquiry, and I have only to say in conclusion that I feel confident that it is not his desire that there should be any waste of public money in connection with this vast undertaking.",34
205,Mr MATHEWS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Melbourne Ports) [2.40] - I wish to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to certain matters, relating to the Naval Board. We are endeavouring to build up a Navy which we hope will be able to hold its own against the navies of the world, and, in doing so, we should consider our men just as much as, if not more than, the men of other navies are considered. Our Naval Forces have been strengthened by the importation of a number of men, ant? rightly so, I believe, because Australia has not that experience of naval matte's which other countries have had. The Minister has imported a number of non-commissioned officers, and I should have been glad had he gone further, and had imported other officers. The Naval Board have just dealt with the question of allowances, which is a matter of importance to the men of all ranks. The pay of a soldier or sailor is made up of, not only wages, but allowances. For instance, men who have perfected themselves in certain branches receive a special allowance, whilst a lodging allowance and other special payments are also made. The consolidated pay thus obtained represents the actual wages'of the men. I find, however, that the Naval Board have issued a regulation under which certain men will reâ ceive a. lodging allowance, while others will not. Inquiries I have made show that the imported men, and also some of the men on the Australian coast, are receiving this allowance. 1 understand that men appointed to the Tingara receive a lodging allowance, whereas those who are appointed to other vessels do not. Is it any wonder that the men complain of this unequal treatment? I have always maintained that the Minister of Defence should hold a seat in this House.",34
206,Dr MALONEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The Defence Department is the biggest spending Department.,35
207,Mr MATHEWS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,That is one reason why the Minister of Defence should be in this House.,35
208,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"He has a splendid representative in the Honorary Minister. Mr MATHEW.S - I admit that, and the Honorary Minister knows that I am not making any attack upon him. When we ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence a question to any matter, we cannot obtain a direct reply. I do not upbraid him for that, because he is not responsible for the administration of the Department. It is, perhaps, unfortunate that so many of my constituents are interested in the working of that Department, because I confess that, in season and out of season, I am obliged to harass it, with a view to securing redress of their wrongs. At the same time, I am free to confess that 50 per cent, of the complaints which I receive are not in the nature of legitimate grievances, and, consequently, I do not bring them under the notice of the Minister. If I cannot get a satisfactory reply from the Minister of Defence, I shall have to ask the Prime Minister whether he thinks it is fair that the Naval Board should be permitted to select men to whom extra emoluments in the way of lodging allowances are granted. Under the existing practice, some petty officers are granted a lodging allowance of 2s. per day, while other men of the same rank are denied it. I know that it is difficult to draw a line between commissioned and non-commissioned officers; but if a warrant officer is to receive different treatment from a petty officer, some reason should be assigned for it. My trouble is that I cannot get the Defence Department to assign any reason why these fine distinctions are drawn. I think that these men have a grievance which is worthy of our consideration. When the new regulations were framed a short time ago, the men who could not avail themselves of certain conditions were granted a clothing allowance, which they received for a period of two months. At the end of that time the Naval Board pretended to discover that certain warrant officers who had received the allowance ought not to have done so, because they were commissioned officers. I have no hesitation in saying that they were not commissioned officers. All my life I have been associated with, military affairs, and it is idle to tell me that a warrant officer is a commissioned officer, and no order or regulation framed by the Naval Board can make him one. If I knew why these distinctions are drawn, possibly I might be satisfied; but the Department refuses to assign any reason for them, and, naturally, there is a bit of a turmoil amongst the men who are affected. Representing them, as I do, I am abundantly justified in ventilating these two grievances.

What I would really like is the appointment of"" a Board to inquire into these complaintsThere is nothing so confusing to a service,, and nothing which makes so much for inefficiency, as for its members to feel that the Department is making fish of one and' flesh of another. If something be not done to improve the existing condition of affairs, I shall avail myself of a 'further opportunity of ventilating this matter in theHoust.  morning we were favoured by the honourable member for Fremantle with a strong indictment against the administration of the Government in respect of the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway.

212,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The honourable member does not know what he is talking about.  mise was made by the Government that the trucks required in the construction of this transcontinental line should be built with centre automatic couplings, because that is the most approved system, and the one which is least dangerous to the workmen. The honourable member for Fremantle has charged the Government with ignoring that promise, and with having had plans drafted for the construction of those trucks-plan s which provide for the double system. The Minister of Home Affairs appears to know nothing whatever about it . Still another charge by the honourable member for Fremantle is that the design of the truckswhich are to be used for carrying the material for earthworks provides for such high challenges trucks that it will be practically impossible for the workmen to shovel the material intothem. Until a satisfactory reply is forthcoming, we must consider that those charges are well founded. I wish now to ventilate another matter of an entirely different character. It has reference to a gentleman who has to pay taxation under our allow Land Tax Assessment Act. I have the whole of the correspondence here, the Departbe acment has taken up an eminently unof fair position towards this individual, whose is typical of many others. The first which he received from the Department was on the ist May, when he was; the informed that his assessment had been int o Â£9>35 - T The gentleman concerned- Mr Stribling-re plied as followsI have yours of ist inst., notifying increasein valuation by departmental valuer.

The reply of the Department, which is dated the 8th May, readsI am in receipt of your communication of the and inst., requesting that particulars of the valueof your property adopted as a consequence of"" the inspection made by a departmental valuer besupplied, and regret that it is not possible to accede to your request, as the information is theproperty of the Department. In other words, taxpayers are to betold that their assessments are increased, but they are not to receive any information as to the basis on which the increased assessments have been arrived at. I maintain that this is a very unfair position for the officials of any Department to assume. Surely every individual who is "" billed "" is entitled to be supplied with particulars of his account. The Department then go on to point out: that if Mr Stribling considers his assessment excessive, he can lodge an objection, and that his representations will be full y investigated. The reply to that communication, which is dated ioth May, reads as followsI have yours of 8th inst., stating that if I consider the assessment excessive I can lodge an objection, and that my representations will be full y investigated. Unless I know how the assessment is arrived at, it is obvious that I am unable to represent where I consider it inaccurate. What I desire is some means of - checking the departmental valuations. It is possible that an error has been made on either side, - and without lodging an official objection I should like some means of ascertaining the accuracy of the assessment. As an instance of how errors occur, I may mention that the plans used by the departmental valuer when valuing my land had several, considerable' errors in them which may not all have been corrected. Can you suggest any course without the formality, and trouble of officially lodging an objection ? This was a case in which quite anumber of different properties were involved. Lf there had been only one property, it would have been a different matter, because the owner would then know where the increased assessment applied. But where a number of properties are involved, and the owner does not know of the cases in which the assessment has been increased, he cannot possibly deal with them, I find that property owners, .are not entitled, to information by means - of which they can check departmental valuations. The plans referred to were brought - up by the officer from the Department, and later on Mr Stribling had thrown upon him the responsibility for any errors that might .appear in them. On 16th May a letter was - sent by the Department as followsI am in receipt of your communication of ihe ioth instant, regarding the assessment of - land tax issued to you as a result of a valuation being made of your propertv, and beg to inform you that the decision conveyed in my letter - of the Sth idem cannot be varied. I can only >reiterate, if you are of the opinion that the improved value placed upon your property by - the Department is too high, an objection may be lodged, giving reasons in support of your - contention. The error referred to in your letter under reply which is stated to have appeared in the - departmental plans was owing to insufficient information being given in your return. matter has now, however, been adjusted. That was an inaccurate statement of the position. The plans were departmental plans, which contained many errors. Mr. Stribling is an estate agent, who has a good knowledge of the district, and has corrected manv of the errors in these plans. fore them is a special degree of unfairness in the. action of the Department in taxing liim with the responsibility for the errors  and stating that they arose owing to hishav-i ; ing failed to give sufficient information-.. The Department were evidently dissatisfied with this reply, because, on 2qth May, they wrote a further letter, as followsWith further reference to your communication of 10th inst., and my reply thereto of the 16th idem, I beg to inform you that if you are in a position to give the Department the values you claim for each class of improvement on each parcel of your land, these values will be compared with those arrived at by the departmental officers, and notification given you of the instances where there is no substantial agreement. . I may add that the Department will also consider any further argument you may be disposed to advance in favour of the values you assert. That is a fair letter, and if the Department had acted up to it, and had fulfilled their promises, there would have been nothing to complain of. But it will be seen that they varied their attitude to suit the altered circumstances until they beat Mr. Stribling, even though he was on solid ground. Mr Stribling's reply to that letter was as followsI have yours of 29th ult., and as requested forward you the estimates of each class of improvement placed on each parcel of land as per my return. It is possible that the departmental valuer may not have parcelled the land as I have done, but, if not, you will probably be able to adjust the various lots. He furnished a return, showing eight lots in all, and gave details of the capital value, deducting the value placed upon the various improvements, and brought out the result previously referred to. This communication was replied to on Toth June in these termsI am in receipt of your communication of the ist instant, forwarding certain particulars regarding the improvements on each parcel of land held by you, and have now to ask that you will kindly supply further information, namely, un- dimensions of buildings, measurements of fences and tanks, and the area of land cleared on each parcel. Search at the Titles Office was recently made respecting your lands, when it was found that at the 30th June, igio, you were the registered proprietor of certain land in Templeton-street, Euroa. I should be glad to learn why this proThe perty is not included in your returns under the Land Tax Assessment Act. I consider that is an offensive way to write to a taxpayer.",36
214,Mr WISE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I do not think it is. Similar requests are sent out every day.  There- the information was furnished in the ordinary course, and, although the Department subsequently discoveredthat they had made a mistake, they did not tender an apology, as they should have done. Mr Stribling replied, on 13th June, as followsI have yours of 10th inst., and will endeavour to supply the .additional particulars you ask In replv to your inquiry as to why my land to in Templeton-street was not included return, I beg to inform you that it is included, being portion of parcel 3, part of allotments I and 3 section a i , township of Euroa, C/Ts., reasonable time. vol. 3022, f o i . 604348, vol. iq78, f o i . 3954<WÂ» vol. 3219, f o i . 643618, as stated in the return. There is the refutation of the charge made by the Department, and yet nothing in the nature of an apology was forthcoming, I consider that throughout the attitude of the departmental officers was so unfair they should be called to account. Altogether the case wears an ugly complexion. I maintain that property owners who make returns, and disclose all particulars so far as know them, should be treated with fairness and consideration. Mr Stribling fulfilled his part of the contract as required but, for some reasons best known to Themcollects selves, the departmental officers materially increased the assessment, and then refused to give the taxpayer the information necesone. sary to enable him to check their ments. They said that they would consider any representations that might be made, but there is nothing to indicate that they ever fulfilled this promise. I desire, in strongest way, to protest against what conceive to be a grievous wrong. I have make another complaint of a totally different character. This has reference to a postal contract which was' cancelled, and in nexion with which the contractor complains that the Department have involved him a loss of Â£200. I do not know anything of the merits of the case, but I can vouch partment. for some of the statements made by Mr servants in the Commonwealth. Nelson, who was the contractor for struction of the line of railway between - Wallan and Seymour, which will, probably be in my electorate after the next election. For a number of years Mr Nelson has been doing the class of work in respect to his contract was cancelled, and he that he has never previously had any plaint made against him. The contract cancelled before any opportunity forded to him to make an explanation in veyance than the coach. regard to his position. I am not prepared to say whether he is right or wrong; I submit that, in all cases where there disputes, the whole position should quired into before extreme action is taken. The correspondence seems to indicate Mr Nelson is justified in asking opportunity to put his case fairly squarely before the Department, in order that justice may be done. All we ask is that every individual shall have fair play. for. His complaint is that the delays which led the cancellation of his contract in my arose through the failure of the Department to supply materials within a He states that he has been put to the loss of Â£200. That is the gravamen of the charge, which I consider sufficiently important to ventilate here, especially as it is stated in writing and that, so far as the Department is concerned, the matter is closed. I bring it be that fore the House in order that the mistake made may be corrected by the Minister.",37

How could an unfortunate selector or small landowner holding 200 or 300 acres fight the Government in regard to its resumption? It is all very well to say, "" Go to the High Court,"" but the honourable member for Riverina knows what the expense is. 1 by would find it cheaper to give my coat to the man who tried to claim it from me than defend my possession at law, and many would cannot afford to fight on principle. them, as Why does not the Minister say what day he proposes to pay for these proI know that there is an Act requiring him to give the value of the land in 1908.

Does not the Minister think that they should resome of the increase which has come the about in the general advance in values, not, of course, any increase due to the expenditure of the Department ? Furthermore, it is customary when resuming property be to add 10 pet cent, to the valuation as These are entitled to some such consideration,, and the people of Australia We can afford to give them a square deal. Although the Minister wishes to be a czar, the I believe that he is a fair man, and if adhe settled this matter himself would treat He should either percreate a tribunal for the settlement of certheir claims, or deal with them himself, and not leave it to the High Court, which is too expensive.

253,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I am; and if the honourable member will visit partment he will find that it is very different from what it was when his party had control.,43
254,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I may be there again year.,43
255,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I shall not not object. If the honourable member succeed me I hope that he will keep the Department going on the lines that I laid clown. Leaving the question of the transcontinental railway, I wish now reply to some statements made orable member for Eden-Monaro, for whose business sagacity and judgment I have the keenest admiration. No one could be more careful than he was as a Minister in safeguarding the public funds and conserving the interests of the people. Minister, whether he be a Liberal, a Labour man, or a Conservative, is, after - all, a responsible public trustee, and cannot play with other people's monev as he would with his own. I take no chances with the money of the people, but in days gone by I did not hesitate at a financial "" f l y e r "" when I was handling my own money. """,43
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Is not the honourable member speculating now in the matter of powellising?,43
257,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I am not. as the specimens on the table will show. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro referred to a mailman and his desire to erect a tent in the Territory. I have only to say, in reply, that I shall not object to his pitching his tent at the spot named, providing that he signs an agreement to s h if t it when I desire him to do so, and to claim no vested interests.",43
258,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Then I have scored something, because I received this morning a letter from the honourable gentleman, in which he said that he would not allow anything of the kind.",43
259,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If this man will sign an undertaking that he will shift when I desire him to do so, because of the expansion of the city, and will not claim any vested rights, I am prepared to let him put up his t a it, but I am not going to allow any one to interfere with the building of the city. I hope, on the 15th March, or perhaps before that date, to have the opening ceremony. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who virtually represents the Federal Capital, says that I am spending millions of money there. Does he desire that I should discontinue the my Deoperations at present in progress?",43
260,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I say that the honourable gentleman is paving the way to an expenditure of millions, and that we next should have some check on him.",43
261,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"H as there been a sufficient "" c h e c k "" in this redoes gard during the last eleven vears? Until lately nothing had been done. Are we to have - keep our pledge to the people of New South Wales, or are we to break it? If to we mean business we must spend money in by the honbuilding the Capital.",43
262,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The Minister is practically spending nothing there. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have to spend the shillings to pave the way to the spending of the necessary amount to make A it habitable. A considerable amount will be spent on the Capital, so that it will measure up to Australia's greatness. I come now to the question of land valuations in the Capital Territory. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has said that I should show my valuations to those with whom we are negotiating. When buying a property, has he ever gone to the vendor, and said, "" This is my valuation.""",43
263,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The Minister is not buying, but resuming the land.",43
264,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I am trying to settle all these matters without putting the parties to the expense of going to Court.,43
265,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The Minister is squeezing them.,43
266,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Not a b it of it.,43
267,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,When will the Minister =tell the men concerned what his valuations are? Mr KING O'MALLEY - When they have put in their claims.,43
268,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,They have put them in . a,43
269,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"All the claims are not yet in. I have here a list supplied by Colonel Miller, and whatever feeling there may be against me there can be none against him.",43
270,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"There is no feeling against the Minister, but the people up there say that he is a regular czar.",43
271,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I am not. I simply desire to maintain law and order in the Territory. As to the Acton property, we tried to settle the matter without going to Court, and the price we offered was not much below the price paid.",44
272,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Will the Minister give us the figures tomorrow ? Mr KINGO ' MALLE Y - I have no hesitation. There is in the Territory a Vigilance Committee which has practically decided to take this business out of the hands of the Minister. decides what is to be asked for these properties, and wishes to tell the Minister what he must pay for them'. These people seem to have got it into their heads that we ought to pay abnormal prices-that the Government is a sort of philanthropic institution, and snould pay whatever they ask. I would not do that even for my own father.",44
273,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,They only suggest that each side should appoint an arbitrator with an umpire to decide where the arbitrators cannot come to an agreement.,44
274,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If we cannot arrive at an amicable settlement, we must go to the High Court.",44
275,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The Court is a nice place to which to take a settler.,44
276,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The Vigilance Committee, and not the settler, would go to the High Court. '",44
277,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The settler would be fighting with his money, while the Minister would be fighting with public money.",44
278,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,No ; I am taxed as others are to pay for the government of the country. I do not wish to take these people to Court if they are prepared to meet on a reasonable basis.,44
279,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Will orable member consent to arbitration?,44
280,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"It will be time enough to discuss that when we are unable to settle. I settled out of Court in Western Australia for Â£ 1 6 6 , 4 0 0 claims amounting to Â£ 2 5 4 , 0 0 0 against the Government. Do honourable members opposite think that I ought to pay any price which the land-owners in the Territory may demand?",44
281,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Why not tell them what the Minister is prepared pay ?,44
282,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If they wish to sell their land, all they have to do is tell me what they will accept. So far, I have resumed only a few estates.",44
283,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The Minister has given notice of the resumption of forty-two.,44
284,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The r e are a few more items in the schedule.,44
285,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Why has the Minister resumed the church?,44
286,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I wil l deal with that matter presently. So far, I have resumed only 85,000 acres. The It Government have settled for the "" Acton "" estate, which contains over 2,000 acres. The other estate has been resumed only a few months.",44
287,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,That is a long time in the case of men with small homes. Naturally they wish to acquire new homes.,44
288,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The two estates which have been resumed contain, approximately, most of the land resumed.",44
289,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Has the M i nister settled for them?,44
290,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Not for all. I would ask my honourable friend whether, if he were Minister of Home Affairs, he would build a line of railway to Jervis Bay merely to carry sandflies and H i gh grasshoppers ?",44
291,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Surely the district produces more than that.,44
292,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The men toi whom I am speaking have no votes.,44
293,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"But they have influence, and they have relatives, who have votes in the honourable member's electorate. However, I do not suggest that that consideration weighs with him. But is it reasonable to talk about constructing a railway to Jervis Bay when we are only just building a"" line from Queanbeyan to the Capital?",44
294,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"What have the the hon- Government done? Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have_arranged for the construction of that line. The New South Wales Government are going to build it. Mr Deane was in Sydney the other day in reference to it. The New South Wales Government are going to construct la railway to the Federal Capital. We will leave it to the party with which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is associated to build the line to Jervis Bay. Now, in reference to the to resumption of the church about which the honourable - member asked me a question; does he desire that a church in the middle to of the Territory shall possess the freehold on which it stands, .when nobody else can own a freehold there? I am willing to give the authorities connected with the church any reasonable terms.",44
295,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,They only ask for a title. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We are not interfering with them. We will deal with them very fairly. Here is what the Administrator of the Federal Territory says,45
296,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Who Administrator? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Colone l Miller.,45
297,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"How was appointed ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - He was appointed by his "" boss,"" the Minister..",45
298,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I thought that there were no "" bosses "" in Australia. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member is "" boss "" of his own business. Colonel Miller saysThere are certain persons in the Federal Capital Territory whose properties have been acquired by the Commonwealth. Each of them has a claim for compensation in respect property so acquired, and should submit a claim. It is unreasonable to expect the Minister to disclose the valuations which have been Each claim will receive immediate considerawhich tion, and wherever an agreement may be arrived at, there will be prompt settlement, provided that the title is clear and that the claimant entitled to compensation. I would suggest every claimant to confer immediately with me, who that increment. have the Minister's authority to effect settlement where considered reasonable and within Government valuations. I told him that wherever the by land-owners is reasonable, to endeavour to effect a settlement, as I do not want any Court cases. I desire the adminisvalue tration of the Department of Home Affairs during my tenure of office to stand out bold relief through all time. But I did not tell him thatBut this does not imply that the will be disclosed. The Administrator is affording claimants every assistance, but the requirements of the Lands Acquisition Act must be complied with. I cannot arrange these matters in a few minutes. There is a Crown Solicitor and an Auditor-General.",45
299,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,But the Crown Solicitor and the Auditor-General have nothing to do with fixing the price. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Has the Minister ?,45
300,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Who has? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The seller and the Minister. The seller may ask one price and the Minister offer another. In order to secure a settlement, there must be a compromise. Rarely have I secured a. property at the first tender and offerThere is no necessity for concern respecting the acquisition of the Canberra church and grounds; in fact, I have already informed the Diocesan Registry, Goulburn, that I am prepared to lease to them these premises for a considerable period. In the interests of the is the public health further interments in the charch grounds must, in the near future, cease. We cannot allow interments to continue, because the population is growinghe I would remind the honourable member that I have done everything in my power to meet the convenience of the persons in the Territory affected by the acquisitions, and consider that they will be well advised to follow my suggestions. Did I understand the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to say that though Parliament has declared that the Government shall pay land-owners in the Territory ort the basis of the value of their lands in 1908, they ought to be given the increment to the which has since taken place?",45
301,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"No . I said thab made. they have effected certain improvements to the Commonwealth is not entitled. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I claim that is the Â£200,000, of which, most has been spent on the Territory, is responsible for",45
302,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If a man has madeimprovements since 1908, .will not the price asked Minister consider them? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes . But we are not going to pay for the increased of the land since 1908. I would remind honourable members that we have in constructed in the Territory the finest system of roads in the world, and this has materially assisted towards indirectly valuations creating the increment.",45
303,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The residents nf the Territory do not ask for that increment. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The taxpayers of Australia have created it. The honourable member will recollect that in .1901 I submitted a motion to this House which affirmed that the fee-simple of the lands of the Territory should be preserved to the Commonwealth for ever, and that we should resume those lands, and let them on perpetual lease. As a matter of fact, the honourable member assisted me to d r a f t the motion, and he also voted for it. It would be a terrible thing for him, eleven years later, to f all from grace, and to advocate, the freehold system.",45
304,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I have not done that. But how will the Minister settle with the land-owners-o n the basis of the resolution which was adopted eleven years .ago, or on the basis of an Act of ParSi ament?",46
305,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"We are going to have a system of level-land premiums. We intend to have the city laid out like a chess boardAs soon as the - design has been accepted a start will be made to survey the Capita^ Site, and we shall devise a system under which the blocks of land there will be let. The compensation to be paid will be based on what those blocks would realise at public auction, and there will be a re-appraisement probably at the end of twenty-one years, or some other fixed date-. the end of that period, if the proprietor of that property and the Government cannot agree,, the Government will have to pay compensation for the improvements, and take the properties over. I trust that this explanation will be satisfactorv to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and that he will go back to the people of the Territory, and tell"" them that they are absolutely safe. If he looks at today's newspapers he will see that a manager has been appointed to the Commonwealth Bank at Yass-Canberra.",46
306,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Will that institution be only a Savings Bank?,46
307,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I think that it will do all sorts of business. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - When does the Minister expect that the design of the Federal Capital will be accepted?,46
308,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I am partia l to the American design, but I am told that the design which has been recommended embodies the best features of all the designs. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will Minister submit it to the House?",46
309,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I do not know.,46
310,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Why not have courage, and back the departmental officers ?",46
311,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I have plenty of courage, but I recognise that I am mortal, and that Australia is immortal.",46
312,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Bendigo) [4.15] I would like the Prime Minister to bring under the attention of the Minister of Defence complaints which have reached me from the parents of cadets to the effect that the boys have to travel long distances to attend drill. I asked the Minister some questions on this point, and he said boys were required under the present regulations to travel any distance up to 5 miles to attend the parade grounds or rifle ranges. Several fathers have represented to me that, whilst they have no objection to compulsory military training, they consider it very hard that the boys should' have to travel 5 miles, or, if they are conveyed to the parade grounds or rifle ranges, pay their own expenses. One father told me that he had to pay is. per week in this direction. If we desire to secure, the hearty support of parents in connection with our compulsory At system of military training, we ought to make their obligations as light as possible. Many fathers approve of the system of military training, because they think it does the boys good, but they consider they are subjected to unnecessary hardship under present conditions. We shall have to deal with a sufficient number of problems in connection with compulsory military training at the next election, and any objections that may be fairly removed by administration should be disposed of. With reference to compensation to members of the Citizen Forces who may meet with accidents in the execution of their duty, I desire to point out that the present position is unsatisfactory. When the Bill dealing with compensation to Commonwealth workmen was before us, I suggested that provision should be made for members of our Citizen Forces as well as for members of the Commonwealth Public Service, and the Minister then said that the matter was otherwise dealt with. Of course, it is otherwise dealt with by regulation.",46
313,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Yes ; but we have corthe rected that since. We intend to make provision in the Bill . Sit JOHN QUICK - I hope that something will be-done to remove present causes of complaint. I have had brought under my notice the case of an officer of the Citizen Forces who had his leg broken, at the last camp at Kilmore, and was laid up for three months.",46
314,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Did he not get some compensation?,46
315,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Yes . But he was a medical officer, and the compensation he received was very small. He had to employ a locum tenens at a cost of Â£ 1 1 0 , and lost his practice for three months, aud yet he received only Â£ 3 0 by way of compensation. Thus he has been subjected to serious loss, and I would ask the Minister to look upon this as a typical case of hardship and make liberal provision for compensation.",47
316,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I have taken a note of the honourable member's statement. Question resolved in the negative. INVALIDAND OLD-AGE PENSIONS SECOND READING.,47
317,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.20] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. As honourable members will see, this Bill is intended to amend the Act of 1908-9. When we initiated the Old-age Pensions Act, we began in a comparatively small way, but we have since advanced in a satisfactory manner, so far as the accomplishment of the wishes of the advocates of the principle are concerned. In the Act of 1908-9, we made important amendments in the way of liberalizing the law, and the amendments now proposed are in the same direction. If honourable members will look at clause 2, they will see that it deals with a difficulty that has arisen in administration in regard to contributions by relatives to recipients of old-age pensions. As a rule, these contributions are very spasmodic, and sometimes they are embarrassing to persons of tender conscience, especially to widows, who consider that if they are receiving contributions from members of their' families, they are not entitled to the old-age pensions.",47
318,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I know of cases where the pension has been refused.,47
319,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"As the law stands, if a contribution is made to a widow by the eldest member of the family, no matter how greatly in need a family may be, she cannot obtain a pension. It is not ex- responsibility of paying pensions pected that this provision will materially add to the amount of money paid away in the form of pensions, but it is anticipated that it will afford relief to a very deserving class of persons. posed to add to the list of exemptions provided for in the principal Act anything received "" by way of g if t of allowance from a son, daughtejr, step-son, stepdaughter, grandson or grand-daughter.""",47
320,Mr BROWN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Does not the Prime Minister consider that adopted children should be included.,47
321,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"That can be considered in Committee. Another point dealt with in clause 3 is the omission of paragraph b, and the proviso from sub-section 1 of section 16. This relates to the payment of pensions to persons who are naturalized. We have from time to time broadened the provisions of the law relating to aliens who have been good citizens, and who, apart from the question of naturalization, have been full y qualified to BILL. receive pensions. We propose with regard to aliens, who would otherwise be qualified by residence to receive the pension, to recognise their claims to the pension immediately upon their taking out naturalization papers. At present a naturalized citizen cannot receive a pension until three yeais after naturalization, and we consider that aliens who become naturalized should not be subjected to the bar now imposed. We have communicated with the consuls of foreign countries, and have asked them to inform their people who were likely to become eligible for pensions as to the provisions of the law in regard to naturalization, but very few persons have availed themselves of the opportunities offered, and although full y qualified in every other respect have been unable to claim the pension because of their failure to take out naturalization papers. We propose to get over this difficulty by widening the provisions of the law as I have indicated. No doubt arguments may be used against this proposal, and it may be said that if a person comes here and accepts the protection of our laws, he or she should become naturalized, and assume the full responsibilities of citizenship; but I think it is preferable to take the more generous view we are now adopting. In regard to the amendment proposed in clause 4, I would point out that for nearly three years the Treasurer has been taking the to blind persons without the direct authority of Parliament. The money has been paid out of the Treasurer's Advance Account, and the appropriations have been It is procertified to by the Auditor-General. Although this action has not been' in conflict with the law, because Parliament has voted the money with a full knowledge of the purposes to which it has been devoted, it is deemed desirable to make provision for the payment of pensions to persons who are blind, although they may not be invalids under the law as it now stands. I doubt very much whether it would be wise to bring blind people within the category of invalids. I certainly would not advocate it, because T hold that it is better for the community and for the blind persons themselves that they should be trained to work at some occupation, and earn something towards their support. But it is proposed to make statutory provision under which pensions may be paid to them in order to supplement the wages they receive. propose to insert the following provision"" 20A. Subject to this Act, every permanently blind persun above the age of sixteen years who is not qualiiied under section twenty to receive an invalid pension and who is not receiving an old-age pension shall, whilst in Australia, be qualified to receive an invalid pension.""",47
322,Mr FOWLER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Does it mean that persons must be absolutely blind before they can get a pension? There are some persons who can see just a very little, and yet are practically helpless.",48
323,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The degree of blindness will be determined by experts. If persons have to associate with blind people, or to be trained as blind people are trained, they will be eligible for the pension. That is the way in which the law is now being administered. The point I wish to emphasize is chat it is not to be assumed that blind pei sons are to receive pensions if they are capable of doing work. Section 22 of the principal Act is to be amended by omitting paragraph c and inserting in its stead this paragraphHe has, whilst in Australia, become manently incapacitated or blind, And by adding the following new substead- section(2.) l'""or ihe purposes of an invalid pension, a person whu is alllicted with a congenital defect ami who is rendered permanently incapacitated or blind thereby shall be regarded as having become permanently incapacitated or blind whilst in Australia if he 'was brought into tralia before attaining the age of three years. It may he suggested that this provision is unnecessary because the Commonwealth intends to examine medically and otherwise all persons intending to emigrate from other countries to Australia j but, on consideration, honourable members will see that family may desire to come here, most of whose members are sound in constitution, 1>5>] one alone being weakly, and we may prefer to have that.family, notwithstanding that one of its members would be, for some reason, an undesirable citizen. Under this provision a child who is under the age of three years when brought to Australia, and is afflicted with a congenital defect rendering him permanently incapacitated or blind, will be eligible, on reaching the age of sixteen, to an invalid pension j but a child so afflicted brought here over the age of three years will not be eligible in later life to a pension, the responsibility for his support remaining with his parents. The term of three years has been fixed because it should be possible, when a child has We reached that age, to determine easily whether he will or will not be invalided.for life. Section 23 of the principal Act is to be amended so that if a claimant resides at a place remote from any duly qualified medical practitioner the Commissioner may dispense with the medical certificate. That is necessary in a vast country like Australia, where medical men are not always procurable, and is merely an administrative amendment.",48
324,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Is provision made for meeting the difficulty caused by a difference of opinion among medical men?,48
325,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"At the present time a referee is appointed by the Department. The majority of the members of the medical profession give their best attention to the examination of persons claiming pensions, but errors have been made, some doctors being too strict and others too lax. The departmental .administration is sympathetic without relaxing the rules laid down by Parliament. Section 24 of the principal perAct is amended by omitting sub-section 2, and inserting the following provision in its (2.) Where the pensioner has accumulated property, the amount of a pension shall be subject to a deduction of One pound for every complete Ten pounds by which the net capital value of the accumulated property exceeds Fifty pounds: Provided that, where both husband and wife Ausare pensioners, except where they are living apart pursuant to any decree, judgment, order, or deed of separation, the deduction in the case of each of them shall be One pound for every complete Ten pounds by which the net capital value of the accumulated property exceeds Twenty-five pounds.",48
326,Dr MALONEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Provisio n should be a made for those cases in which a man and wife have been separated for several years, and one does not know where the other is.",48
327,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"We seek to give the Commissioner power to deal with such cases. Section 25 of the principal Act readsFrom the capital value o i such accumulated property there shall be deducted all charges or encumbrances lawfully and properly existing on the property, and the residue remaining shall be deemed to be the net capital value of all accumulated property. By clause 8 that section will be amended to readFrom the capital value of such accumulated property there shall be deducted the capital value of a home in which the pensioner permanently resides, and all charges or encumbrances lawfully and properly existing on the property other than the home.",49
328,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Is the home excluded, no matter what its value?",49
329,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The intention is to exclude entirely the value of the home.,49
330,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,And the furniture?,49
331,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,A home includes the furniture and everything that makes it a home. The representatives of the people can be trusted to see that effect is given to that interpretation of the law.,49
332,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,At present furniture is counted as property.,49
333,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The home is now counted as property.,49
334,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,A deduction is made on account of even a mangle or a piano.,49
335,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"My view is that such articles would form part of the home. What my legal friends think about that interpretation, I do not know. It is proposed to amend section 26 by inserting the following provisoProvided that, if for any special reason the Commissioner is of opinion that this paragraph (i) should not apply in any particular case he may direct fhat f t shall not apply. and to add also the following paragraph(c) Every blind male person under the age of sixty-five years, and every blind female person under the age of sixty years, shall be deemed to be earning wages equal to the amount which he or she could earn by reasonable effort.",49
336,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"That is a bad provision ! Mr FISHER It is an excellent provision. Every one acquainted with blind people, and appreciative of the necessity of their enjoying life as it ought to be enjoyed, knows that, if they are capable of performing useful service to the community, they should be trained to do so, and ought to do so. I appeal to honourable members, above everything, to have regard to the benefits that will arise, not only to the community, but to the blind people, by helping them to help themselves.",49
337,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,It simply places blind people on the same footing as all other people in regard to pensions?,49
338,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Quite so. Blindness is not a physical infirmity in the ordinary sense of the term. A blind person, like a deaf person, is usually able to do something for himself j and the desire is to see that the blind make a reasonable effort to earn their living, and to assist them in every possible way to that end.",49
339,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Thei r pensions may be reduced if they do not work.,49
340,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Of course, there may be a difference of opinion as to the proposed amendment. By an amendment of section 27 it is proposed to remove the word "" indictable,"" and also the provision for five years' imprisonment, and to provide instead that offences may be tried 1 summarily, and that the penalty shall be a maximum fine of Â£TOO, or imprisonment for one year. Tbis is rather an important amendment. As the law stands at present any one charged with fraud under this Act has to be charged with an indictable offence; but there is no desire, I am sure, to send aged people or invalids to prison for a number of years. There have been many fraudulent applications by people possessed of private means-; and my opinion is that a substantial fine would meet such cases.",49
341,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The question is whether persons charged might not prefer to go before a jury. Mr FISHER.'-In cases which I have in my mind the persons charged would have been sure to be convicted by a jury.,49
342,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Hav e there been any prosecutions ?,49
343,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Yes. . In one case an old lady between seventy and eighty years of age was practically convicted of having applied for a pension when she had money hidden away. It was only because ot a family quarrel that the fraud was discovered, a pension having been granted and received in the meantime; and this is the sort of case which I think would be met by a substantial fine. Nobody would have the heart to send an aged lady to gaol for a number of vears ; and, therefore, it is now proposed to vindicate the law by summary process with a penalty of Â£100, or, as an alternative, imprisonment for a maximum term of one year. : It is projDOsed to amend section 40 by than omitting a portion, and inserting instead the following sub-section(4) It shall not be lawful for the Deputv missioner or a Registrar to waive the forfeiture of any fortnightly instalment unless the of such forfeiture is applied for within the prescribed time. At present the Commissioner has some diffifamilies culty in this connection, and the amendment is intended to give him wider power. Many pensioners du not draw the allowance within the prescribed period, and, at predirecting sent, the forfeiture can only be waived so far as every second fortnightly instalof ment is concerned. The amendment will permit the Commissioner to waive the forclaims feiture of all the instalments. The next amendment deals with penalties, and it proposed to provide that a maximum fine of Â£100, or a maximum term of imprisonment of six months, shall be inflicted on any son who wilfully makes any false statement or representation to obtain a pension certificate, or pension, or any instalment of pension, or to deceive any officer, or to affect the rate of any penmoney sion. At present it appears that it is posbeing sible, under the law, to deal only with a person who wilfully makes a false statethan ment about a pension for which he is. claimant, and not with any person who makes a fraudulent statement to inconveyed crease a pension already granted; and the object of the amendment is to recase move this anomaly. The last amendment is in section 50, and provides that all fences against the Act shall be punishable on summary conviction. The amendments tem, cover a very wide range, and will have farallowance, reaching effects. It is estimated that the cost thereby incurred will be from tive industrial occupations. Â£.150,000 to Â£170,000 a year.",49
344,Mr JH CATTS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,We should like to go much further than the Bill proposes.,50
345,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I presume that if the finances permitted' we would gladly give a pension to every one, or, at any rate, crease the present amount, and provide for widows. That, however, is not proposed by the Bill. It is a sound principle, submit, to leave the home entirely free, respective of its value; and the soundness is proved by the fact that one home does not compete with another. Those who have built up a home, and have been overtaken by misfortune, are entitled to keep that home, and live in it if they can find the means. A home is a home, whether it be a hovel or a palace, and it may [ 5']- 2 2 life to those who have built it for themselves. Doubtless much will be said about ""extravagant "" expenditure on invalid and Comold-age pensions; but I am of opinion that this money is not only well spent, but has waiver helped to promote the prosperity of the country. Hitherto the best members of have been called upon to contribute a most unequal proportion towards the support of aged or invalid parents and other relatives, and have thus been prevented from their means into productive channels. On the other hand, the ne'er-do-weels families, who take no practical interest in the welfare of those who have most upon them, have contributed practically nothing, leaving all to voluntary is effort. Under the national scheme, each and every person Has to contribute his portion through the general taxation. By that permeans we are able to make the recipients of these pensions practically independent of .their relatives, and to do so more econoa mically than is possible under any other system. It is a noteworthy fact that the expended on these social schemes is collected at a cost of less than 3 per cent., whilst the cost of distribution is less 2 per cent. That being so, ov.er 95 a per cent, of the money contributed by the people of Australia for such purposes is direct to the recipients. On the other hand, the cost of management in the of ordinary charitable institutions runs up to something like 40 per cent. Another ofpoint worthy of consideration is that the administration of the old-age pension sysas well as the payment of the maternity practically does not call upon the withdrawal of any individuals from producThe number of officers in the Public Service has been increased to only a very small extent in connection with the administration of the system, whereas many people are withdrawn from productive occupations to carry on the work of charitable societies. This exteninsion of the system of invalid and old-age pensions will mean relief to a great number of our fellow citizens. It will mean I relief for the blind and the maimed, and a irlarger measure of assistance to our aged poor, who will be able to retain their little homes without having any deduction made from their pensions. I commend this Bill to the House, feeling sure that it will enable many people to enjoy the closing days of their lives to a greater extent than would be dearer otherwise be possible.",50
346,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Darling Downs) [5.3]-This is one of those measures which raise no general principle to be considered on the motion for the second reading. essentially a Committee Bill, and, speaking generally, I think that the Prime Minister was well justified in commending it to the House. Any defect in legislation such as that with which .we are now dealing is bound to be discovered as the outcome of practical experience. Sometimes a clause inserted in a Bill with a view to safeguarding the public funds is found in practice to press unduly on the people, and to need amendment. That has been our experience in connection with the invalid and old age pensions law. One or two sections in the principal Act which are being amended by this measure were taken from State Acts, but when applied to the whole Commonwealth have been found to give rise to difficulties and to need revision. The principle of the first amendment for which this Bill provides may be briefly described. The principal Act provides for the payment of a pension under specified conditions, but declares that a deduction shall be made in respect of certain incomes received by the recipients. It is now proposed so to amend the definition of "" income "" in the original Act that a deduction shall not be made in respect of 'a gift or allowance received from a son, a daughter, a step-son, step-daughter, grandson, or granddaughter.",51
347,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If the gift would return an income of ios.' per week, then this proviso would disappear.",51
348,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Quite so. It is intended only to cover gifts that we ought to encourage rather than discourage. Let me give an illustration of the need for such a provision as this. I know of a particularly conscientious widow who has had an exceedingly hard struggle. She took a little home for herself, paying part of the rental herself, whilst the balance was paid by a daughter who boarded with her, and whose income amounted only to a little more than Â£ 1 per week. Other sons and daughters occasionally gave her a present of a few shillings, and all these facts she conscientiously set out in the return that she made to the pension officer. On looking at the return, the officer said, "" I amsorry, madam, but I cannot grant you a full pension.'.' That officer properly administered the Act; but, no doubt, if this woman's family had abstained for a week or two from giving her any money, in order that she might claim the pension, he would have looked favourably upon her application.",51
349,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I know of a case where a It is son refused to do that, and he was the only earning member of a big family.",51
350,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I think it is well that we should legislate in this way, otherwise the door might be opened to what may well be termed a "" pious fraud."" The children of an aged man or woman might say, "" We shall stop for a week or two the allowance we usually give you, so chat you will thus be entitled to receive a pension. Once you have obtained it, we will renew our allowance."" I confess that when the case of this poor woman was put before me. I felt that I was in great difficulty. I could see that there was an easy way of getting behind the law, but I could not conscientiously advise the woman to adopt it. I may say that this lady, to her credit, is not drawing the full pension today. It is well that we should legislate to render it unnecessary for any one to get behind the law in the way to which I have referred, for little tricks of the kind may grow, and lead to wholesale fraud. This measure is therefore in the interests of honest administration. The second important principle with which this Bill deals relates to the question of who shall receive the benefits of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Are they to be bond fide citizens of Australia, and, if so, how are they to prove that they are ? In dealing with this question in the original Act we adopted a principle that had been embodied in State legislation, although I must confess that even a.t the time. I did not view it with much favour. The principle of the State legislation appeared to be that if a man came to Australia, and sought to obtain the benefit of the old-age pension system, he should become a bond fide subject of the country. Our desire was to pay these pensions to those who have resided in Australia for not Jess than twenty years, and it seems to me that any one who has lived here for twenty years, and has done solid work in the building up of the nation, has given practical proof of his bona fides as a citizen, and of his good-will towards Australia. I think it right hard to require that claimants shall be naturalized three years before they can receive the pension. We desire, as far as possible, to encourage those who come here to become part and parcel of our community. Under the original Act, it is provided that an applicant for a pension must be a naturalized subject of the King, who has been naturalized for three years preceding the date of the pension claim. Under this Bill, that provision will be repealed, and a claimant who can produce his certificate of naturalization will be entitled to the full benefits enjoyed by British subjects. In this connection I should like' to refer to - a difficulty, arising under section 4 of the Naturalization Act, to which I bave already drawn the attention of the Minister - of External Affairs. That section pro-' vides thatA person who has before the passing of this Act obtained in a State or in a Colony which bas become a State a certificate of naturalization or letters of naturalization shall be deemed to 'be naturalized. The point is that a woman who was 'naturalized under a State law before the Federal Act came into operation did not get a certificate, so that 'she would have to make a fresh application for naturalization, papers under the Federal law before she could become a certificated naturalized resident of the Commonwealth. The late Government drafted a small Bill to get over the difficulty, and I should be glad if it could be passed at an early date.",51
351,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I think that the policy is sound.,52
352,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I hope that the Prime Minister will give the matter his consideration. I am sure that the House will unanimously approve of the provisions of this Bill in regard to blind persons, and - also to the proposal to dispense with the necessity for producing a medical certificate where the claimant is living in a remote district. The provision in the principal Act requiring a medical examination is fraught with difficulty in such - cases, 'because it means that a medical man has to make a long journey specially to examine an intended applicant, while the amount of remuneration given to him is purely nominal. The Government should either provide reasonable compensation for the medical man examining an applicant in such circumstances, or to dispense with the medical examination altogether. I understand thai the clause dealing with this matter will be brought into operation only in extreme cases, and that where a medical certificate is not produced, strong evidence will be required from persons residing in the district as to the condition of the applicant.'",52
353,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The evidence of a magistrate or a clergyman.,52
354,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I come now to the provision relating to the homes of pensioners At the present time a deduction is made from' the pensions paid to any individual living in a home exceeding in value Â£ 1 0 0 . I think that the Government is right in broadening that provision. We should encourage the home-loving and home-making instincts of the people, whereas the law at present penalizes those who have made little homes for themselves. The Act really penalizes persons who are endeavouring to build up homes of their own. Most people who acquire homes through building societies and other agencies have to make up their contributions out of their small savings. Consequently the acquisition of a home is very often the work of a lifetime. From that stand-point the proposal in this Bill is' to be commended. But I would suggest to the Prime Minister that the term "" home ""which he thinks should include household furniture-shoul d be so defined as to make our meaning perfectly clear. Of course, nobody expects that persons living in mansions will receive the old-age pension. But, strictly speaking, the term "" home"" means the land on which a person resides, and the building in which he lives, and does not include furniture. I ask the Prime Minister to consult the draftsman of the Bill on that point.",52
355,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I am thinking more of policy than of draftmanship.,52
356,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"And in doing so, the Prime Minister is acting rightly. As a matter of policy, the home should include the land, building, and the usual furniture. I wish now to put a case to the Prime Minister to illustrate a position which I have in my mind. Suppose a man living in the city has a villa residence and furniture which are worth Â£800 or Â£900. Under the Act that property would be exempt. But what is the position of a man in the country who owns 30 or 40 acres of land worth perhaps Â£ 1 0 or Â£ 1 2 per acre, upon which he has his home? If he is using his land for farming purposes there will be a small income from it, and a deduction will be made on that account. Will the Prime Minister exclude the whole value of his property because he happens to be in receipt of an income of 10s. per week?",52
357,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"No , only that portion of it which is returning an income.",52
358,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I have in my mind the case of an old man who has a small farm worth about ,Â£210. His pension is only a few shillings a week, and because of the deduction which has been made he has been saying hard words of Australia, and declaring that it gives him an allowance which only keeps him in tobacco.",52
359,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Where would he get more?,53
360,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"In my opinion, he should be credited with the home. The question is, "" What should be the value of the deduction made in his favour?""",53
361,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If part of his home is used for purposes of profit, what ought to be done?",53
362,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I would suggest that the Prime Minister should work out a guiding principle as to what allowance should .be made. If a man has 50 acres of land, and a portion is being used for purposes of profit, that circumstance ought not to deprive him of the right to call that part of his land on which he resides his home.",53
363,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Assumin g that one-eighth of an acre in the city were let, it would be used for the purposes of profit, and not as a home.",53
364,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The income which this man might receive is perhaps, merely a nominal one. My contention is that persons who endeavour to build up homes in the country should be placed in as good a position as that occupied by persons who endeavour to build up homes in the city. If a man possesses property in excess of a certain value a deduction is made from his pension to the. extent of Â£ 1 for every Â£ 1 0 of value, but if he has a home it is altogther excluded from the calculation.",53
365,Mr SCULLIN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Coul d notfchetwo things be separated by regulation?,53
366,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I want the Prime Minister to draw some dividing line, so that a man in the country will secure the same advantage as is enjoyed by a man in the city.",53
367,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If part of a home is used for purposes of profit, the sum earned by it will be income under our Statute law, and a man may thus be deprived of a pension altogether - extra amount at from Â£150,000 to",53
368,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"But suppose that it is returning a nominal income. Although a man may be receiving an income of ios. per week, he may possess land which is worth Â£500. The mere fact that he has land of that value which is returning him only ios. per week ought not to exclude him from enjoying the benefit which would*, be conferred upon him by the possession* of such a home in the country.",53
369,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Provide d that the income does not deprive him of the right to an old age pension.,53
370,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I know that if he hasan income of Â£ 5 2 a year, he is excluded' from obtaining a pension; but I amdealing with cases covered by the Act. I now come to another matter. I think it would be rather a serious matter to send old persons who have been guilty of making fraudulent statements to gaol. But I do not think, that we ought to allow others who may aid them to perpetuate a fraud to escapethe consequences of their acts. Whileeverybody naturally desires to be as generous as possible, there are financial limitations which must be borne in mind in administering this scheme. I presume the Treasurer is satisfied that this schemecan be financed. According to thelatest official figures available on the 30thOctober last, there are 79,724 persons in. Australia who are in receipt of the old age pensions, and 11,247 persons who are in receipt of the invalid pension, making a total of 90,971. For every 10,000 of our population we have 173 old-age pensioners and twenty-four invalid pensioners. At the end of June of the present year, the average fortnightly old-age pension* amounted to 18s. n d -, and the averagefortnightly invalid pension to 19s. 5d. If this Bill be passed, we shall'be pretty well up to the limit.",53
371,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Not quite.,53
372,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"At the present time, we are paying Â£^2,243,942 annually in invalid and old-age pensions, or an average of 9s. 9d. per head of our population. Consequently, it cannot be urged that the Commonwealth is acting in a niggardly spirit.",53
373,Mr WEST,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The money is well spent.,53
374,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"It is; and as the Minister who introduced the Old-age Pensions, Act, I am not finding fault with that expenditure. The Minister estimates the Â£170,000. On the whole, the measuremodifies provisions which have been found to require amendment, and does not impose an excessively heavy 'burden on the community in addition to that which it is now bearing. Therefore, it deserves the support of honourable members.",53
375,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Hunter) T5-3 ]-- 1 Realizing that this is a Bill for consideration in Committee, I shall not occupy much time in speaking on the second reading. I congratulate the Government on the liberalizing of the law that is proposed. Although it means more expense, the money will be well spent. Personally, I should be prepared to 50 further, and I hope that the day will soon come when the old-age and invalidity nensions system will be liberalized still more. The Prime Minister told us that the waiver clause makes conditions better than they are, but that is not my opinion.",54
376,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"At present we can waive - only every second payment, but the Bill will allow every payment to be waived.",54
377,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"At present a Deputy Registrar or Registrar cannot waive a payment unless waiver is applied for within the prescribed time, but section 40 of the Act providesExcept in special cases of the pensioner's - illness or debility, it shall not be lawful for 4he Deputy Commissioner or a Registrar to waive the forfeiture of an instalment twice conman. Let me give another case. secutively to the same pensioner; and in no case shall forfeiture be waived unless waiver is applied for within the prescribed time. The Bill contains no reference to illness - or debility. What is the prescribed time?",54
378,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"-Sixt y days plus twentvone-eighty-on e in all. Under the Bill, if a pensioner is prevented by an accident from applying, we can waive a whole series - of pavments, but under the Act only every second payment can be waived. Tf there .'is any doubt about the effect of the pro-vision we can remove it in Committee.",54
379,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I have risen to speak more on the administration of the Act, which leaves a great deal to be desired, though in saying that I do not reflect on any of our officers, who, I believe, carry out the law as they find it. To obtain an invalid pension the claimant must present the certificate of a medical man that he is permanently incapacitated, but doctors differ, and I know of cases in which men who will never be able to do another day's work in their lives cannot obtain invalid pensions because medical men will, not certify to their incapacity. A case I have in mind is that - of a resident of Charleston, in New South Wales, who twenty years ago met with an accident to his back, the doctors thinking at the time that it was broken. Silver wires were inserted, and the man was able to get about supported on sticks, but he has never been able to stand upright. Until he reached the age of sixty years he did what work he could in a mine, and then, finding himself unfit for further work, applied for an invalid pension. The medical man who examined him said that he thought that he was suffering from bladder trouble, and that he could be cured if he entered a hospital, but as the applicant would not do that the doctor did not pass him. The residents of the district who know the man regard him as incapacitated, and are subscribing money to keep him. Another medical man was appealed to, but he upheld the opinion of the first. I said at the time that the second reference would be useless, because doctors communicate with each other by telephone, and stand by one another. Any number of medical men outside the district would certify that the man was incapacitated. The Minister or Commissioner should have power to deal with cases like that; the granting of a pension should not rest wholly on the decision of one medical Within the last four or five months a resident of Meath applied for an invalid pension, three doctors certifying that he was permanently incapacitated, but the medical man in the district told him that he would not get a pension, and certified against him. We battled on his behalf for months, and today I got news that he passed away yesterday. He should have obtained Â£ 8 or Â£ 1 0 in pension money, but, being unable to get it, passed his last days in very poor circumstances. He was suffering from phthisis. I know that there must be safeguards against imposition, but where evidence can be obtained to satisfy the Minister or the Commissioner a pension should be granted, notwithstanding the opinion of the local medical man.",54
380,Mr BRENNAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,There is an appeal.,54
381,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"To the Prime Minister, who is guided by the medical certificate. I speak feelingly, because I know the men to whom I have referred. A man who for twenty years crawls to his work until he can no longer continue his occupation is a deserving citizen who should receive an invalid pension. The people of the district think it a shame that this man has not received a pension.",54
382,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The case was referred to a referee, who took the same view as the first medical man who reported on it.",54
383,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I said before the reference was made that one doctor would telephone to the other, and that their opinions would agree.",55
384,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The honourable member accepted the referee.,55
385,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"There is no other medical man in the district. Doctors are as strong unionists as any others, and stand by each other. It is all very well for a medical man to say to a claimant that he could sweep a crossing, or do something of that kind, but who will give him such work?",55
386,Mr HIGGS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,It is difficult to find employment.,55
387,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Yes . Where the incapacity is beyond doubt, the claimant being prevented from continuing to follow what has been the occupation of his life-time, he should receive a pension, especially when he is a man over sixty years of age.",55
388,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The case is only one of many.,55
389,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I believe that that is so. In the other case to which I have referred, three doctors certified that the man was incapacitated, but one said that he was not, and his certificate decided the matter. In regard to the property qualification, I understand from the Prime Minister that, although it has been reduced from Â£ 5 0 to Â£ 2 5 , the amendment makes no real difference to the position. If that is .so, I am satisfied; but I would point out that at the present time every pensioner is given an allowance of Â£ 5 0 , and a reduction to Â£ 2 5 seems a hardship.",55
390,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Where there are two persons receiving a pension living together, the allowance is Â£ 5 0 , or Â£ 2 5 each. The present law is not altered in the least.",55
391,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"There may be hard cases even under the law as amended. Two old people may be unable to get along with their pension of Â£ 1 a week, and possessing a house worth, say, Â£200, may let it for perhaps 6s. a week, renting another for 4s. a week, thus gaining Â£ 5 4s. a year. To allow only Â£ 2 5 instead of Â£ 5 0 would reduce their pension.",55
392,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"No , the law in that matter is not altered in the least.",55
393,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I take it that the Bill will not apply in those cases, and, if so, I am perfectly satisfied with the explanation of the Prime Minister.",55
394,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Will the honourable member make a suggestion as to how to get over the difficulty?,55
395,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Wit h the evidence before him, the Prime Minister needs no suggestion. He has documentary evidence, in the shape of letters from business people, justices of the peace, and other people of standing, showing that this old man is not getting fair treatment.",55
396,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Still , I have referees against me in the two medical officers.",55
397,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,My point is that it is left to the doctors in all cases to settle whether a person shall have a pension.,55
398,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I would not mind calling in a doctor from another district, if necessary.",55
399,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Where there is sufficient evidence from residents in the district, with medical certificates in addition, the Prime Minister should have power to decide the matter. If we refer from one medical man to another, the telephone is set in motion, as has happened in many cases. Either the Commissioner or the Prime Minister should have power, in cases which they are satisfied are genuine, to grant pensions",55
400,Mr BRENNAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,There is that power now. ;,55
401,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The Prime Minister says he has not the power.,55
402,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If I did such a thing, it would not be in accordance with law. MT. CHARLTON - It is of no use honourable members writing letters to the Department, and interviewing Ministers, unless there is some power in the Government or the Commissioner to deal with the cases.",55
403,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Richmond) [5.48] - ! recognise, not only the difficulty of the honourable member for Hunter, but the difficulty of the Prime Minister, in striking the mean between what is just to the pensioners and what is just to the public. I do not see how it is possible to ignore the medical certificate as final proof; but in cases where there is considerable dispute, it ought to be possible to call in an outside man. On a question of capacity for work, we are practically compelled to rely on the opinions of those who should be experts. I should like to direct attention to a class of cases which are very hard, and which are not provided for under the existing law. A little while ago a man who had been permanently incapacitated in. Commonwealth employment was granted an invalid pension. That pension, however* has been cancelled, on the ground that hiswife has, since his incapacity, managed to .get a boardinghouse together, and, by dint - of hard work, is now earning more than the statutory amount allowed. It has to be remembered, however, that this woman has six children to support, though, of course, the invalid pension relieved her to some extent, so far as her husband was concerned. I suggest that in such cases there should be an allowance of, say, Â£ 2 5 a year for each child until the age of fourteen years, before the income earned is taken into consideration; and this, I think, could be accomplished by a small amendment.",55
404,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,This involves the whole question of the husband or the wife having money.,56
405,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"- I hardly think so, and I point out that such cases can arise only in connection with invalid pensions, and when the pensioners are comparatively young. The case I cite was not one of money put by, but money earned from day to day to the amount of some Â£ 9 5 a year; and it, and all similar cases, merit the pathetic consideration of honourable members.",56
406,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Would the honourable member confine the amendment to the case - of a wife earning money, or would he extend it to the case of a husband earning money ?",56
407,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I think the amendment might be extended to the husband, because, where there is total incapacity of the wife and a number of young children, there is necessarily involved additional expense for assistance.",56
408,Mr WISE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I know of an exactly similar case.,56
409,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"It is probable that, under 1 the larger powers of administration given by the Bill , we might be able to do as . suggested.",56
410,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I simply ask the Prime Minister to look into the matter. ' The B i ll has my full sympathy and support, particularly in that part which enables pensioners to retain their homes. We - can all understand how old associations would cause old people to put up with any privation rather than part with the home in which, perhaps, they commenced their married life. I admit the difficulty in differentiating between the ownership of , a home and having money in the bank; but still there must be a limit. On the - whole, the Act is as liberal as the state of our finances will permit; and no one will begrudge the comparatively small amount involved by this liberalizing Bill .",56
411,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I think the power suggested is in the amending Bill , but, if not, we shall see that it is put there. Mr FINfLAYSON (Brisbane) [ 5 . 5 6 ] The Prime Minister is to be congratulated on all sides on the introduction of this Bill, and on being able to find the money to extend its privileges to the old people. To most of us the Bill simply represents one more step towards the time when the care of the sick and the aged in every regard, and without limitation, will be a charge upon the finances of the country. The remarks I have tb make will deal more with the sins of omission than the sins of commission. I particularly welcome, however, the provision in regard to the homes of pensioners, as one which will meet the approval of every honourable member, and secure to very many thoroughly deserving citizens relief of which they are urgently in need. But sym- there is a class of pensioners for whom I desire to say a word. I have already spoken to the Prime Minister privately on the subject, and now desire to repeat it publicly. A large number of pensioners have no homes, and are in a much more trying situation than those who have. The rents of dwellings have risen so much in the last few years that there are very serious inroads on the small pension now paid. I know quite a number of pensioners, who, out of the 10s. a week, have to pay 5s. or 6s. for a house to live in. My point is that a house thus rented is the pensioner's home; and I desire to know whether, under this Bill , that rental could be allowed to the pensioner.",56
412,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I doubt it .,56
413,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"That is most unfortunate. I would not say a word to detract from the privileges that this Bill extends; but I think that the class of pensioners to whom I refer are much more necessitous, and deserving of much more consideration, than those who have homes. A pensioner who rents a house is as much entitled to an allowance as is the pensioner who has a home of his own to receive the full pension.",56
414,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I think ""there is a flaw in that argument; some people may have struggled to get a home, and others who have squandered their money would get an advantage.",56

416,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,They may or mav not.,57
417,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I know' people of the most reputable character residing in Brisbane who through no fault of their own, but merely because of want of reaevidence sonable opportunity, have no homes of their own.",57
418,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,We all know of such,57
419,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Unfortunately , we do. While the Government are so amendanything, ing the principal Act, that the possession healthy, able-bodied man. of a home will not militate against the obtaining of a pension, I think we ought to consider the advisableness of providing homes for pensioners who have none. other countries-, which are not so far vanced as we are in social and humanithis tarian legislation, hostels-no t poor houses or unions but genuine homes-ar e prothe vided where old people in receipt of .pencepted, sions may spend their declining days in pension was refused. something like reasonable comfort.

420,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Our pension system is by far the largest in the world.,57
421,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I am aware of that, but trust that the Treasurer will see his way clear to grant this further relief. I recognise that the difficulty is find the money, but while this country spend millions annually on hurtful and unnecessary luxuries we should be able to find money enough to provide for old-age Government Medical Officer. pensions on an unlimited scale, compared with what we are doing at present.",57
422,Mr WEST,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,To what luxuries does honourable member refer?,57
423,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Whil e Australia can afford to spend Â£16,000,000 per num on strong drink she can afford to spend more on old-age pensions.",57
424,Mr WEST,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,It is the people who take strong drink that pay the old-age pensions. Teetotallers pay practically of taxation. They are the meanest people on earth.,57
425,Mr FINLAYSON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I think it is suffiPrime cient to say, in reply to the honourable will member, that teetotallers are the last need old-age pensions, and the least likely to apply for them. Old-age pensioners come mostly from that unfortunate class with which my honourable friend is assoin On one other aspect of this Bill, I find myself somewhat in opposition to the honourable member for Hunter. My experience is that a Government medical officer's certificate is accepted' in absolute contradiction of the weight of and of the certificates of other doctors in connection with a pension claim.. I know of a man who for the last fiveyears has been unable to do a stroke of work. It is not safe to allow him tocross the street, or to stoop to pick upyet to all appearances he is a. But the Government medical officer, who had not seenhim before, after putting a few questions, to him, certified that he was quite able to In work. I had no difficulty in obtaining adfrom the doctor who had been attending man a certificate that he was quite unfit to work, yet the certificate sent in by Government medical officer was acand this man's claim for an invalidMy suggestion is to meet the difficulty in such cases the applicant's last employer should be asked' to make an affidavit as to his state of Where possible, the reasons for the man's dismissal, and the duration of his employment should also be obtained ;.. and if , in addition, the doctor attending: the applicant sent in a certificate, the Department would arrive at the facts. Thesoon powers of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners should be so extended as to to enable them to exercise some discretion incan such matters. As the law stands at present, they appear to have none; it seemsthat they must accept the certificate of theIn many instances, the Deputy Commissioner could satisfy himself, by inquiry, that the facts the alleged by the pensioner-claimant were, correct,, and in such cases the applicant, should receive more favourable attention anthan he can secure at present.

Whilst a very generous move <has been made by the Government in dealing with the deductions maderespect of the homes of pensioners, no-relief is given under this Bill to the larger - volume of applicants for pensions who have mo homes. I have to put before the right ^honourable gentleman the case of an aged widow, whose only means of support are .provided by her daughter. This widow 'lived in the country, where she had a house - of her own; but as the daughter obtained - employment in Adelaide, she decided accompany her, and had to sacrifice her - home for Â£150, which she placed credit in the Savings Bank. Of that amount Â£ 7 5 represented money belonging all. to the daughter, and I advised the mother when she-went to town to apply for an oldall age pension. She did BO, but because she had .Â£150 in the Savings Bank, a deducpersons, tion of Â£ 1 0 was made from her annual full pension allowance. pension; so that, instead of receiving Â£26,. - she received only Â£ 1 6 per year. The cirforce - cumstances of this lady having been well known to me for many years, I attended with her before the Deputy Commissioner, Sydney Mr Gardiner, and expressed my willingness to make an affidavit'that one-half the amount of ^150 was the property - daughter. Mr Gardiner said it was an - exceedingly sad case, but under the and the regulations he must make a deducsaid - tion in respect of the full amount.",57
427,Mr WEST,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Why did not the mother place Â£ 7 5 to the credit of-ber daughter?,58

430,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I thank the right honourable gentleman, and shall take steps at once to prove that the daughter is entitled to the amount.

In my electorate, there are a number of blind persons who are denied the full amount of the pension.

RILEY - It is not right to make payment of the pension depend upon their entrance into a benevolent institution. so II know of dozens of cases of this kind. I have heard it said that when men enter these institutions they earn 16s. per week. I have a suspicion that many persons in Sydney are induced to enter them for the purpose of assisting to maintain them.",58

WEST (East Sydney) [6.18] - I wish to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a matter connected with the payment of invalid pensions. Several cases have come under my notice in which the departmental doctor has declined to certify that an applicant for the pension is permanently disabled from following his occupation. The term "" permanently disabled "" is very difficult to define. I know a lad who is nineteen years of age, and who bad the misfortune to f all down stairs and injure his spine. Two medical officers certified that, he would never be able to work again. But the departmental doctor declined to certify that he was permanently disabled, and inquired whether he'could not do olerical work. His reply was that he could not, ashe had received only, a poor education. It was not until the second year after his injury that the departmental doctor would certify that the lad was permanently disabled. In another instance a man fifty-five years of age was Buffering from chronic rheumatism. visited two eminent doctors in Sydney, who certified that he was permanently incapacitated ; yet the departmental doctor declined to give a certificate to that effect. These are cases of great hardship.' As soon as this Bill is passed, we shall be up against a lot of trouble. Many old-age pensioners are obliged to rent rooms, and they say that, owing to the increase in the rente charged, tiheir pensions are very small, and that pensioners who have houses of their own are in a better position than those who have not. I know that the Prime Minister will soon be worried with a number of applications on that account. cumstances, I feel sure that' the Government will be obliged to make provision for the payment of universal pensions.",59
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Parramatta) [6.23] - I am glad that this Bill has its appearance, for one or two reasons. I am pleased to note that under it the disabilities imposed by the principal Act will be removed, and.the administration of that Act will be rendereda little more just and a little more generous than it has hithertobeen. I am particularly interested in oneclause of this Bill. The Prime Minister will recollect that under the existing k w there are cases in which men are separated from their wives, and in which, because the wife has an income, the husband is disqualified from receiving a pension.",59
442,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,We take power in thisBill to deal with those cases by administration.,59
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Is that themeaning of clause 9 ? . Mr FISHER - Yes . I think the matter can be better, dealt with by administration than otherwise.",59
444,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I think so. Of course, there may be flagrant cases in whicha man does not deserve sympathy. If , for instance, he has ill-treated his wife, thereought to reside in the Minister discretionas to whether he shall be paid a pension.",59
445,Mr BRENNAN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The same remark is applicable to the woman.,59

448,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,There are two or three clauses in the Bill dealing with invalid pensions.,59
449,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"It seems to methat in those cases the Prime Minister might made very well exercise a little discretion, and make some allowance for the children whom the widow has to support. I admit that the question is a very ticklish one to deal with, because there must always be in the mind of the Minister charged with the ad-ministration of the Act the position of the widow and children who have no claim to any pension whatever. These are the hardest cases of 'all. There is no more tragic form of invalidity than widowhood, where children have to be maintained. It seems to me that it will be very difficult for the Prime Minister to provide for equitable treatment in this matter. But I hope that some scheme will be devised for dealing with widows and children who are bereft of their breadwinners, and whofind""it difficult to make their way through our hard, competitive world. The more we legislate on these lines the more anomalies we shall create, until we establish some guiding principle which will give the people of the community the right to claim the pension under all circumstances, and without reference to benevolence or mercy.",59

452,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Calare) [8.0]. - The clause ameiids the definition of the word "" income,"" by exempting what is paid to the pensioner by way of gift or allowance .from son,, daughter, step-son, step-daughter, grandson or granddaughter. I think that the words "" adopted son"" and ""adopted daughter"" should be added. I know of cases in which adopted children have lived on very affectionate terms with their foster parents; indeed, children are (sometimes adopted in infancy, and grow to manhood without learning that their foster parents are. not their real parents. The gifts of such children to their foster parents should not be regarded as income. Will the Prime Minister accept an amendment?",60

455,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Hunter) [8.3] - As I pointed out when speaking on the second reading, there is sometimes a difference of medical opinion regarding the incapacity of a claimant for an invalid pension. The Government medical man might certify that a'claimant was not incapacitated, and although three or four other doctors of equal standing would certainly , say that he was, the certificate of the first doctor determines the matter. I admit the need for safeguards against imposition, but when the balance of evidence is in favour of an applicant, he should not be denied a pension because of the opinion of one medical man. In my opinion, these cases can be best dealt with by being left to the Commissioner. He could make some sort of inquiry, and, if necessary, call witnesses, and if satisfied that the applicant was entitled to the pension, he should be able to grant it. I therefore move That the following words be added "" o r where medical testimony conflicts, the Commissioner shall have power to decide the application."" Amendment agreed to.

456,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Calare) [8.7]. - - I do not know if the Prime Minister can accept an amendment in this clause. It is provided that where a pensioner has accumulated property, the amount of the pension shall be subject to a reduction of Â£ 1 for every complete Â£ 1 0 by which the net capital value of the accumulated property exceeds Â£ 5 0 . Under the New South Wales Act the deduction was made for e v e r Y Â£ * 5 , and consequently a large number of pensioners had fo accept reduced pensions when the Commonwealth passed its Old-age Pensions Act. I think that it would be fair to restore them to their original position, especially as New South Wales has the largest number of pensioners.",60

458,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"South Sydney) [8.10] I ask the Prime Minister if he will consent to an alteration of the regulations affecting blind persons? In Sydney there is an institution which accepts blind men and teaches them a trade. It says to the blind man, "" You can enter our institution, and you will be guaranteed 16s. a fortnight,"" but only 4s. is paid. There is nothing in the Bill to justify that. Will the honourable member see that blind persons are not compelled to go into this institution, and that they shall receive the full amount of the pension?",60
459,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [8.11] - The Government does not wish to compel any blind person to enter an institution, though had we the power I should like all blind persons to be trained for their own advantage and for the benefit of the community. If a blind person is not incapable of performing useful and remunerative work he is not entitled to a pension as if he could not earn his living. I think that blind persons should have to earn their living where they can do so, but they should be assisted in every possible way.",61
460,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Richmond) [8.12] Does the Prime Minister think that the proviso which he intends to insert in section 26 of the principal Act will meet the cases to which I referred this afternoon?,61
461,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I rely on the general powers of the Commissioner. The cases to which the honourable member refers are those in which a wife has children and an invalid husband. He desires that what she earns should be protected.,61
462,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,In the case which came under my notice the Commissioner took the ground that the Act did not empower him to make any exception. Will this clause get over the difficulty?,61
463,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I think that the clause meets the case.,61
464,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Calare) [8.13] - I agree with the Prime Minister that blind persons should be put in the way of earning their living or of doing something for themselves, because without occupation they are apt to brood over their misfortunes, and thus to make their life's burden heavier than it need be. Sydney institution referred to does valuable work in teaching useful trades to the blind, and helping them to cultivate their faculties, and improve their talent. understand that any person entering that institution may obtain a pension which is supplemented by an allowance until he acquires sufficient skill in a trade to earn something on his own account.",61

466,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Under the # Act the blind are not entitled to pensions, though the benevolent administration of this Government has enabled them to receive pensions. The principal of one of those institutions told me that some inmates, recently admitted, were receiving pensions of ios. a week, and a further sum of ios. from the institution for the work which they did. Very often, when first admitted, an inmate can earn nothing; and I wish to bear testimony to the usefulness of such institutions. There are, however, blind people in the country, so situated that they can make no use of such places, or who are so advanced in years that they cannot assimilate instruction.

I point out that aged people are very apt to make mistakes, and I only hope that this clause will not be used as a means to drag them, on the slightest provocation, before a magistrate-that there will be no abuse of the power thus given. If the object is to reduce the hardship that might be caused by heavy fines and punishments, I do not m in d but it is most undesirable that proceedings should be taken in any or every case of mistake. I cannot see why this change should be proposed, unless there is some reason of the kind I have suggested in the minds of the officials. It is to be hoped that this clause will not cause any change in the administration.",61

469,Mr CHARLTON,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Perhaps there were no prosecutions because the cases had to go before a jury.,62

471,Mr CANN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Nepean) [8.21] - I hope the Cornrnittee will be very careful in passing a clause of this kind. In my constituency, there are a number of pensioners who are inmates of institutions, and amongst them a seafaring man, who, in order to get employment, in the past, represented himself as much younger than he really is. When the authorities found out that he was registered on ships at a certain age, he was deprived of his pension, and has been forced to become an inmate of the Liverpool Asylum.",62

476,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.26] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes to amend the Judiciary Act of 1903-6 in two respects-by increasing the number of Puisne Judges from four to six, and by providing that, in matters affecting the Constitution, there shall be a majority of all the Judges in favour of the decision, and that, in every case where there is an appeal from a Justice of the High Court, or a Supreme Court, when the Justices of the High Court are divided, the judgment of the Court below shall not be disturbed. I shall deal with these matters in the order. I have mentioned them. The business of the Judiciary, under a Federal form of government, differs in certain very important respects from that of the Judiciary under a Unitary form of government. In a Federal form of government-at any rate, as known in the United States, Canada, and the Commonwealth of Australia functions usual to the Judiciary in all civilized countries where the rule of law obtains, but also acts as the guardian of the Constitution. The High Court of Australia, which is the supreme tribunal in which is vested the appellate power in respect has. not only to all matters affecting the Constitution, but also in cases under ordinary law, has wider functions than those exercised even by the Supreme Court of the United State of America. The High Court of Australia not only has jurisdiction as the Appellate Court in matters affecting the Constitution, or Federal matters, but it is the Supreme Court of Appeal in all matters from all Courts-it is the final Court of Appeal, subject, of course, to the right of a litigant to appeal to the King-in-Council in certain matters. The functions of the High Court, engaged as it is in appeal work, is then most important, and the business of the Judiciary demands the most persistent attention, and calls for the very highest legal training, and for men of first class intellectual calibre. The work of a High Court Justice is, in fact, the most arduous and trying of any form of judicial labour. It can only be done at all by highly-trained men with great capacity for work. The Judiciary Act, as passed by this Parliament in 1903, provided for the appointment of three Justices, but by an Amending Act, passed in 1906, the number was increased to five. It was pointed out at that time that the business of the Court had increased very largely, and that, as was undoubtedly true, the work thrown upon the individual Justices, and the Court generally, was such as to involve a strain that was becoming insupportable. Some figures were then quoted showing to what an extent the business of the Court had increased. During the last six years there has been a very marked influx of population, and there has been an increase in the work thrown upon the Judiciary in its original jurisdiction by reason of the passing of certain legislation. It is only fair to say that the number of Justices is not now sufficient for the work that the Court has to do. One Justice is almost wholly occupied in the discharge of his duties as President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and the recent extension of his jurisdiction to the Public Service will add still further to the business of that tribunal. And as I have said, the original jurisdiction of the Court has also been largely increased. It occurs under the Australian Industries Preservation Act and the CustomsAct, and relates to Customs prosecutions, instances of which are the Motor Car and Fish frauds, as well as other matters of that type, Land Tax appeals, compensation cases in connection with land acquired, and Patents and Trade Mark cases. In 1911 one case alone in the original jurisdiction occupied the attention of a Justice of the High Court for seventy-three days. The business of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is such that one Justice is almost wholly occupied in dealing with it, and when he has to leave that tribunal, as he has at the present time, in order to enable the business of the High Court to be dealt with, its work remains unfinished. That naturally involves the danger of industrial disturbances. certainly tends to create difficulties, and to deprive organizations of the opportunity of securing the redress of their grievances in the manner for which this Parliament has provided. There are also special constitutional cases of great importance, to deal with which a Full Bench is desirable. At the present time several of these cases are pending. None can be heard, and none will be heard except by the Full Bench. Among these are the cases of the Engine-drivers v. Broken Hill Company; Merchant Service Guild v. the Steam-ship Owners, and the Tramway Employes v. Tramway Trust. A ll these are special cases waiting to be dealt with by the Full Bench. And the Full Bench cannot be constituted without completely arresting business in the Arbitration Court. There are six cases waiting to be disposed of in Sydney, and there will probably be some remanets, including Benson's case, for argument before the Full Bench. Of the four constitutional cases waiting to be with by the Full Bench, two have been standing over since January last. In order to give some idea of the work of the Court, it may be pointed out that the judicial year is one of 200 days, and that last year the full Court sat 161 days, in addition to the time spent by the members of the Court in travelling. show the actual movements of the Court, and and shall prove that it is either sitting or travelling in order to sit, from the beginning of the judicial year to the end. That the Court has been able to carry cn is due to the remarkable capacity for work possessed by the Chief Justice and his colleagues. Without wishing in any ^7ay to reflect on any other Court, it is only fair to say that the High Court Justices dispose of more work than.does any other Court of its kind. But, after all, our Judges are human, and we have seen some of the consequences of their attempt to do more than men can fairly do. One of those consequences is irremediable, and this Parliament and the country has everv reason to lament it. When the five Justices are working at high pressure, as they have to do, in order to dispose of the business of the Court, there is no opportunity for the hearing of full Bench cases unless the business of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is allowed to stand over. That much is clear. Now the Conciliation and Arbitration Court work cannot properly be allowed to stand over. And there is enough work, as I It shall show, to keep one Justice going all the year round in that tribunal. At the present time among the plaints part heard is that of The Australian Tramway Employis Association v. Prahran and Malvern Tramway Trust and others. There are also a number of allied tramway cases which, as honourable members know, have been before the Court for months. Their hearing has been interrupted once.or twice-onc e because His Honour had to go to Perth, and for other reasons. Then there are the cases of The Australian Postal Electricians Union v. The Public Service Commissioner and the Postmaster-General; The Post and Telegraph (General Division) of Western Australia v. The Public Service Commissioner and the Postmaster-General; and The Federated Liquor Trade Employes Union of Australia v. Employers in the Brewing Industry in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland._ The plaints now pending, in addition to those which are part heard, include The dealt Federated Gas Employes Industrial Union v. Metropolitan Gas Company and others; Australian Institute of Marine Engineers v. North Coast Steam Navigation Company and others; . and Australian Builders Labourers Federation v. Archer and others, in which there are nearly 500 respondents. Between 400 and I shall 500 have already been served. Then there is the case of The Australian Telegraph Telephone Construction and Maintenance Union v. The Public Service Commissioner and the Postmaster-General- a type of - case that is entirely new-'Australia n Federated Theatrical Employe's Association v. Brennan's Amphitheatres and others; Federated Felt Hatting Employes Union v. Denton H at Mills and others; Federated Tanners and Leather Dressers Employes Union v. Alderson and others; Federated Dredge Workers Union v. Burke's H i UT in Sluicing Company and - others; Australasian Institute of Marine Engineers v. Union Steam-ship Company .of New Zealand and others; Federated Engine-drivers and Firemen's Association v. Tasmania Gold Mines Limited and - others; Merchant Service Guild of Australasia v.. Federated Masters and Engineers Association of Australasia. last is an appeal from the decision of the Registrar. All these cases are either pending, or part heard, and they ought - certainly to be heard. But if the President of the Court is to be taken away from that work, the Full Court to get through its ordinary business, it is obvious that the work of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court either cannot be done at all, or, if - done, can only be done imperfectly. When the amending Bill of 1906 was before this House the Attorney-General of the day, - now Mr Justice Isaacs, based his case for an increase in the strength of the High - Court Bench on this very point, namely, that the work of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court had grown so much that it was practically taking up the whole of the time of one Justice. In support of that statement a report from Mr Justice - O'Connor was quoted, as may be seen by reference to Hansard, of 12th July, 1906. I do not say for a moment that great - stress ought to be laid on the mere increase in the number of cases. That, in - itself, indicates very little. may be disposed of in four .or five days, and one case may occupy thirty days. But the number of cases set down for appeal in 1903 was two, whereas the number of cases - set down for appeal in 1912 was eightynine. In original jurisdiction in 1903 there were three cases, whereas in 1912 there were sixty-four cases. ber of days on which the Court sat in 1903 was thirteen, whereas in 1912 it was 161.",62
477,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The Attorney-General said just now that in 1912 the Court sat 161 days. Does that apply to the F u ll Court alone?,64
478,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I will, as far as possible, distinguish between the number of days on which the Full Court sat and the number of days on which the Court sat as a single Justice. I propose now to quote some figures in reference to the work of the Arbitration Court. In 1905-whic h was the year preceding that in which the amending Act was passed-the number of days on which that Court sat was three; in 1906 it was twenty-one. It was in 1906 that the amending Act was passed, and the fact that the volume of business had so increased was made the basis of the argument in favour of the appointment of an additional Justice. But the rate of progress has since increased very greatly. In 1905 the Court sat on three days, in 1906 The on twenty-one days, and in 1912 on 158 days. If the circumstance that, in 1906, the Court sat on twenty-one days was regarded as a reason why an extra Justice should be appointed-in order that one Justice might devote whatever attention was to enable necessary to the work of the Arbitration Court-it can scarcely be contended that when a Justice sits on 158 days out of a possible 200 days in the whole judicial year, the appointment of additional Justices is not warranted. Then, again, the ordinary work of the Court is growing, and all the Justices are kept going at top speed all the time. It must be remembered that the Justices of the High Court travel all over Australia. No other Justices do that. The Supreme Court of America does not do it . It sits in Washington only, although some of its Justices go on circuit. But here the High Court travels, not over a State, but over a continent. Let me give the itinerary of the Court for the year 1912, beginning on 19th February. The Court sat in Hobart from the 19th to 21st February, in Melbourne from 26th FebTen cases ruary to 29th March, in Sydney from ist April to 22nd April, in Brisbane from 29th April to 9th May, in Sydney from 13th May to 16th May, in Adelaide from 4th June to n t h June, and in Melbourne from 13th June to 28th June. Then f o l lowed the winter vacation. The Court sat in Sydney from 29th July to 21st SepThe num- tember, in Melbourne from 23rd September to 22nd October, in Perth from 29th October to 12th November, and it met in Sydney on 25th November, and will sit there t i ll 21st December. It will be seen, therefore, that during the current year the Full .Court sittings total 165 days out of a possible 200 days. During that period the Court has to travel to every part of the continent. For the information of honourable members, I will now give the number of sittings of the Court when single Justices were present. In 1911 there were ninetyfour days occupied by single Justices, most of them being in connection with the Vend case in Sydney. This year single Justices have sat on only twenty-five days, but that does not include the work of the Arbitration Court, which sat on 158 days. So that one Justice has sat 158 days this year, and some of the other Justices have sat twenty-five days in addition to the total Full Court sittings of 165 days. I come now to the position which has been created by the work of the Arbitration Court,, and by the constitutional cases, the decision of which require a Full Bench. One of the cases now before the High Court awaits re-argument before the Full Court Bench, and cannot be disposed of until the President of the Arbitration Court can take his seat, so as to enable the Full Bench to be constituted. Consequently, if he goes on with High Court business, the work of the Arbitration Court must stand over, and if he goes on with the work of the Arbitration Court the High Court business must stand over. I lay stress on the fact that this Parliament has approved most emphatically of the principle of arbitration. tended it to its public servants. fore it must make provision for the speedy determination of the matters which are brought before that tribunal. To delay justice is to deny it ; and in industrial matters, in particular, despatch is the essence of the contract. The work of the High Court, involving as it does an almost constant round of appeals on important questions of law, is the most arduous of all judicial work. When any Justice falls ill , or goes on leave, necessary business cannot be transacted. During this year, and on two occasions, business has been held up owing to the illness of Justices. That, of course, is quite independent of the consequences - whateve r they were-of the extended leave which was granted to the late Mr. Justice O'Connor, and his application for leave was, in itself, the direct result of overwork. I say that of my own personal knowledge, because he himself told me so when he put the matter before me before asking officially for extended leave. It is not fair to ask men to do this work upon which so very much depends, and, amongst other things, upon - which the very legislation of this Parliament depends, at such high pressure. We have to recollect that all day, and every day in the week excepting Saturday, theseJustices are engaged in listening to closelyreasoned arguments on matters of the firstimportance. They constitute the final Court of Appeal upon all matters in this country, and they have not that relief which comes to Judges in nisi prius, whomay go home and need not bother themselves about the case which they are hearing till the next day. The High Court Justices must occupy their time after the Court has risen in looking up cases and' preparing judgments. They ought to have a fair opportunity to do this if justice is not to suffer through lack of due consultation of the authorities, and calm consideration of every argument put forward. The number of Justices asked for is not too many. The State Courts are more numerous than the present High Court. The Supreme Court of New South Wales is composed of six Justices, the Supreme Court of Victoria of five Justices, and that of New Zealand of seven Justices. The High Court is the Appeal Court from all the State Courts, and it does seem an anomaly that there has to be an appeal from a Bench of sixJustices to a Bench of three Justices; and' It has ex- that a unanimous decision by, say, the f u ll There- Supreme Court of New South Wales, consisting of six Justices, may be upset bytwo Justices of the High Court of Australia. We must assume that the recruiting ground for Justices is common to bothFederal and State Judiciaries. They are appointed from the same class of persons, and, so far as I know, there is nothing in the High Court Bench to attract a superior class of man. It may be that the honour is greater, but that is all. Certainly, theemoluments are no better. Indeed, at Judge is very much better off in Victoria, so far as the bread-and-butter side of thisv question is concerned, than is a Justice of the High Court. I am not arguing whether that should be so or not. I merely mention it to show that we are just as: likely to get men of the first rank on the Bench of Victoria, or of any other State, as we Â«re on the High Court Bench. The fact then that, say, two Justices of"" the High Court can upset the decision of six Justices of a Supreme Court, who presumably are all men of the first class,, seems anomalous. A final Court of Appealshould not be less numerous than the? Courts appealed from. . Again, since it . is thought necesCourt sary to have a Bench consisting of citizen six Justices in New South Wales, and - of five Justices in Victoria, where the travelling is infinitesimal compared with that done by the High Court, the and where the nature of the work is not .anything like so strenuous, the argument favour of appointing six Puisne Judges seems to me to be upheld. With seven Juswork tices, it will be practicable for business of - minor importance to hold two Full Court Sir, sittings at the same time in the different - capitals, or to have Justices available to port iear cases in original jurisdiction while the Full Court is sitting, and also while the Arbitration Court is sitting. At the sent time, neither of these things and both ought to be. In 1911, Mr JusHiggins rice Higgins sat in the Arbitration Court Arbitration 139 days; during the present year he has sat 158 days, and he has still some days to run. When we make allowance for the and time occupied in travelling, it is perfectly Justiceruary. dear that he cannot be available to sit upon the High Court Bench for more than twenty days. Honourable member's who travel a great deal will appreciate what Justices the travelling of that Court really means. It spends every available day during the working judicial year in travelling from one capitalto another. The Full Court ters. sits the whole time at undue pressure, and this is aggravated by the fact that one Justice is practically not available for High Court work. He is employed Justices all the time in the Arbitration Court. In 1906, when the Judiciary Act was turned amended by a Bill introduced by Mr Juscommencing tice Isaacs, then Attorney-General in the of ' Deakin Government, the cases in the ArbiIsaacs tration Court numbered twenty-one, but the May. cases this year to 9th December number Justices 158, so that the sittings in that Court more than seven times as many now as they, were six years ago, when the appointment of two more Justices was urged on the .ground that there was. too much work for the existing Bench. Clearly it is no longer . possible to do the work of this Court withforty out an additional Justice, while a second sisted additional Justice is required for the nary work of the High Court. The present - members of the Bench perform their duties sitting. under undue strain, no provision for abmenced its sence through sickness or on leave being possible. The High Court is Australia's final Court of Appeal, and its Justices should ton, have more time for the discharge of their nf duties and the determination of their judgof ments than they now have. has earned the encomiums of every who knows the need for the effective interpretation of the law is undeniable; but, despite the tremendous efforts made by the Justices to get through their work, list shows that a number of cases have had to be held over. The following report in of the Deputy-Registrar, dated 12th December, contains the official record of the of the Justices for the present yearMelbourne, 12th December, 1912. I have the honour to submit the following reof the business transacted by the High Court of Australia during the year 191a :The late Mr Justice O'Connor was on extended leave from' the beginning of the year preuntil the hearing of the Coal Vend appeal is possible, hereinafter mentioned. Except as hereinafter mentioned, Mr Justice has been engaged during the year in Court business, having sat as President of that Court on 161 days to date hereof. The summer vacation ended on the 17th February, the Full Court sat in Hobart on the 19th FebThe sitting lasted three days. The Chief and Justices Barton and Isaacs being on the Bench. Thereafter the Court came to Melbourne, and on the 26th February, commenced a sitting which lasted until the 29th March (25 days). The Bench being the Chief Justice and Barton, Isaacs and Higgins, the last named sitting only on the hearing of argument in special cases, stated by himself as President of the Arbitration Court in the engine-drivers' and firemen's and Merchant Service Guild matThe next sitting, which was held in Sydney, commenced on the ist of April, and lasted sixteen days. The Bench being the Chief Justice, and Justices Barton and Isaacs. These three then sat in Brisbane on the agth April, the sitting lasting nine days. After the Brisbane sitting the Court, as then constituted, reto Sydney, and sat there for four days, on the 13th May. At the conclusion this sitting, the Court came to Melbourne, and the Chief Justice and Justices Barton and sat for nine days, commencing on the 2xst Following this sitting the same three went to Adelaide and sat for six days, commencing on the 4th June. The Court tben are returned to Melbourne, and sat from June 13th to the 28th inclusive-twelv e days. The winter vacation followed this sitting, and lasted four weeks, from the 29th June to the 27th j u l y . After vacation, the first sitting of the Court was held in Sydney on the 20th July, and lasted days. During this sitting the Bench conof the Chief Justice and Justices Barton and O'Connor, for the hearing of the anneal ordifrom the decision of Isaacs, J., in the Coal Vend case, and of the Chief Justice and Justices Barton and Isaacs for the balance of the On the 23rd September, the Court comnext Melbourne sitting, which lasted til l the 22nd October, twentv days. The Bench consisted of the Chief Justice and Justices BarIsaacs, and Higgins, during the hearing' of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's case; and the first three'Justices named for the balance the sitting. After this sitting the Court, conThat that sisting of the Chief Justice and Justices Barton and Higgins, went to Perth, and commenced a sitting' on the 29th October, which lasted for ten days. The'Chief Justice and Justice Barton then returned to Melbourne (Justice Higgins remaining in Perth for a further week on Arbitration Court business), and then proceeded to Sydney, where, on 25th November, a sitting of the Court was commenced by the Chief Justice and Justices Bartonand Isaacs. This sitting has now lasted fourteen days, and will probably not be concluded until the 21st inst., when the summer vacation of the Court commences. Mr. Justice Higgins returned from Perth on the 25th November, and resumed the bearing of the Tramway case in the Arbitration Court. He will leave for Sydney on Saturday next to take his place on the Bench for the hearing of the - appeal the King v. Smythers ex parte John Benson. The arbitration business will have to be postponed until some future date. The Court (i.e., single Justice) sat in Melbourne during the year on the following dates :-Apri l 3rd, September 16th, 17th; 18th, 20th, October, 28th, 29th, . 30th-eigh t days in all. Similar sittings were held in Sydney, Hobart, and Brisbane, and lasted nine, two, and four days respectively. These sittings were held for trial of causes. At the same time, appeals which, by law, can be tried before a single Justice (Land Tax assessment appeals-appeal s under Patents Act, &c), were also dealt with. The Chamber business of the Court is taken by the Justices in rotation during the sittings of the Full Court, and by whichever Justice is available when the Full Court is away from Melbourne. Mr Justice Higgins takes this class of business when he is - engaged in Melbourne in the Arbitration Court, and the other Justices are away with the Full Court. I am unable at present to compile any definite return of the Chamber business dealt with during the year, as some of the Justices take their Chamber business records with them .when engaged with the Court elsewhere. The work there outlined is heavier than that done by any other Bench of. which I have knowledge, and is much more for each of the five Justices than had to be got through in 1906 by three, when - it was considered that the Court was undermanned. business of the country requires the appointment of more Justices. The interests of justice demand it . Let me now deal with the provisions of the Bill relating to the manner in which decisions on constitutional issues are to be arrived at. At present, when the Justices are evenly divided the opinion of the Chief Justice or, in his absence, of the senior Puisne Judge present, prevails. There have been very few such cases, but the decision of the Court was arrived at in that manner in the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company against the Sugar Commission. This is not a sovereign Legislature, but the creature of the Commonwealth Constitution ; it can, therefore, pass only such laws as are within the powers conferred upon it by that instrument. It is foT the High Court to say whether its laws are constitutional or not, and there is no appeal from the Court's decision. The High Court is, in this matter, the master of this Parliament. .The Constitution has made it so, and until the people alter it we must not complain. We have the right to in sist, however, that a law shall not be declared unconstitutional unless clearly and obviously so, and when the Justices are evenly divided as to the constitutionality of a law that law is not obviously unconstitutional. We desire that only those laws shall be declared unconstitutional which a majority of the Justices think to be so. That principle is .perfectly sound, and it ought to be applied in all legal decisions, but in particular to questions relating to the Constitution. Therefore, it is provided in the Bill A Full Court consisting of less than all the Justices shall not give a decision on a question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, unless a majority of all the Justices concur in the decision. That is to say, whatever the number of Justices, there shall be a majority who concur in the decision whatever the decision is.: In regard to appeals on matters of ordinary law from the Supreme Court of any State,, or from a-single Justice of the High Court, where the Court is evenly divided, the derision of the Justice or the Judge shall stand-. Where there is an appeal from aiv inferior Court, that provision does not apply, but the opinion of the senior Justice or the senior Puisne Judge prevails. I think that this provision, for decisionsby a majority of the Justices, is a perfectly sound and salutary one. As to the'increaseThe in the number of Justices, I submit that it is justified by the facts. The position of the. Arbitration Court is such as to demand an increase; indeed, it is impossible for' the work to be carried on without the appointment of another Justice. Deputations havewaited upon me quite recently from variousorganizations to call my attention to the fact thattheir causes have been dn thelist for a long while without any prospect, of their being reached. In one case, which I mentioned fhis evening, theexecutive committee assured me that it waswith the greatest difficulty that the met* were prevented from attempting to obtaintheir rights by some other method than thatprovided by l a w ; and they urged that I should do something to get the case heard' more speedily. Representations were made, but it was found that other organizationswere in exactly the same position, and that, every case must take its place in the orderset down in the list. There ought, however, to be no interruption in the Arbitration Court business. The question of appointing a second Judge to assist in the Arbitration Court work is one already provided for in the Act.",64
479,Mr DEAKIN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Is the second Judge to be wholly devoted to Arbitration work.,68
480,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I do not say that.,68
481,Mr DEAKIN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The Attorney-General's last statement seemed to imply that most clearly.,68
482,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Sectio n 36 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is as followsThe Court may refer any industrial dispute of which it has cognizance, or any matter arising out of the dispute, to a Local Industrial Board for investigation and report, and may delegate to that Board such of its powers, including all powers of the Court in relation to conciliation and the settlement of the dispute by amicable agreement, as it deems desirable. A Local In dustrial Board may be(a) any State industrial authority willing to act; or (i) any local Board constituted as prescribed or as directed by the Court, and consisting of equal numbers of representatives of employers and of employees and a chairman, who shall be a Justice of the High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State. . . . As Mr Justice Isaacs pointed out, it will require an amendment of the Act in order to provide that the Arbitration Court shall be differently constituted. It may be remembered that, as originally drafted, that Act provided for a President and two assessors; but that does not seem to me the most convenient plan'. I do not think it would be effective to appoint two persons with co-ordinate authority in such a Court; and the best means to expedite the business is, I think, to allow one Justice to give his whole attention to it. In that way, the work will be done very much more quickly. The work of the High Court is, as I have said, increasing very rapidly, and will, in the future, increase still more rapidly; and the number of Judges now is not sufficient to enable it to be done except under severe strain. As regards the Arbitration Court, the work cannot be done properly at all under present circumstances.",68
483,Mr DEAKIN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Ballarat) [9.25] - The Attorney-General this evening addressed the House under favourable auspices. Some of his pleas, at all events, touch honourable members more than they are willing to confess. In the first place, the honourable and learned member very wisely adopted something approaching an adequate view of the status, importance, and influence of the High Court; I have heard him very much less appreciative. Australians are proud, and rightly proud, of this tribunal, which has far more than fulfilled expectations. It is a great Federal instrumentality, to which we are deeply indebted. Then, again, however much we may endeavour to divest ourselves of personal feeling, it is impossible to approach this proposal without recollecting the particular and special circumstance which forced it on our attention-the loss, not only of a distinguished Judge, but of one of the most distinguished representatives the Commonwealth Parliament has yet known. Any appeal in this relation is sure to find a responsive echo from every honourable member on either side who was acquainted with him. While these old associations help to make us only too willing to sympathize with any proposal for the enhancement of the status, functions, and influence of the High Court, yet we are bound, in this House, and under present circumstances, to, as far as possible, regard' this Bill in the dry light of actual fact and business necessities. That being so, one cannot fail to recollect the nature of the arguments employed in 1906, when an increase of the Judges, proportionately larger than this, was sanctioned by both' Houses. If I recollect aright, that was= only after struggle, conflict, and resistance in both Houses, though nothing; like the resistance or opposition that the proposal for the establishment of the Court itself had to face in 1903. The decision hung on a single vote in this House. The Bill was only made law by appeals of a character that are very rarely addressedto members of a Legislature. Since then the Court has Undoubtedly proved in every way worthy of its responsibilities. We were fortunate in themen it attracted, not by the monetary rewards or the prospects offered. Thesewere reduced below what the Attorney General himself now admits to be a fanrecognition of either the standing of the Justices or the immense importance of their work to the Commonwealth. I notice with some surprise, and more regret, an entire absence from this measure bf any proposal to adequately recognise the functions now discharged by members of the Bench. It is not yet too late. As a matter of fact, I fear that it is too late, but, at all events, it is still open to Ministers to reconsider the question whether they are justified in permitting the highest Court of Australiawell worthy of its obligations and its duties, and, as he has admitted, of a status higher than the highest Court in the United States of America-to be overburdened with work, most generously undertaken and thoroughly discharged, and yet with a lower scale of remuneration than any body of the same kind in any civilized country in the world. The Attorney General has very properly and very wisely recognised what this Court has done, and what it is doing, for the Commonwealth, so that this forces on us the question why that recognition does not take the shape which he himself points out as only fair and adequate under the circumstances. But let us come to the particular data which the Attorney-General laid before us in support of this view. The facts were drawn from several sources, and were very striking; they faithfully mirrored, so far as figures can, the very heavy burden imposed on the Court,, .and, incidentally, the splendid manner in which it has discharged its duties. But almost the whole of the figures were vitiated, and some largely so, by the fact that, during the twelve months, the absence of the late Judge to whom I have referred, has to be taken into account, The extra burdens cast upon the remaining members of the Bench, which are mow put before us as justifying additional .appointments, require to be read in the light of that knowledge. If there had been no such illness, it is possible that the suggestion of an increase in the strength of the - Court might still be justified, but it would .have had to be by figures and facts not yet laid before us. In dealing with this question, we have to strip ourselves, as far .as possible, of all prepossessions, and of the natural inclination to magnify this institution. .Our duty, as representaus tives of the people, is to ask ourselves whether the Attorney-General has established a case for not only filling the regretcircumstances, table vacancy on the Bench, but appointing two additional Justices. With the utmost .good-will in the world, he does not appear to me to have been able to substantiate that case. He confesses that one of the two additional Justices is to render assistance in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and, in reply to a query, said that the attention of that Justice was not to be wholly devoted to the work of that tribunal. Apparently he is also to discharge general duties. Does that mean that he will, in .a sense, undertake ""duties connected with the Full Court of the Commonwealth, whilst Mr Justice Higgins remains at his original work as President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court? If so, the question of status appears to have been ignored. I mention such a consideration only because it appears to imply, even in the Attorney-General's mind, some uncertainty as to the particular duties that will devolve upon the Justice taking the place of the late Mr Justice O'Connor. Of the work of the other Justices fo be appointed, we hear, except in the most general way, practically nothing. It is true that the figures quoted suggesting the work to be done are impressive as they stand. Perhaps they are capable of bearing the interpretation which the Attorney-General, - without a moment's hesitation, put upon them. But I am not in possession of sufficient knowledge to enable me to say whether the facts, as submitted to us, call for the appointment of even one additional Justice. There appears to be an entire absence of proof of the necessity for the appointment of a second additional Justice. That the High Court is overburdened is undoubted : that it is likely to continue overburdened appears probable even after the present vacancy is filled.",68
484,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Do the High Court Justices say so themselves?,69
485,Mr DEAKIN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,They have not said so.,69
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,They have made no request for additional help?,69
487,Mr DEAKIN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Not that I know. Casting my eye over the statements made by the Attorney-General of the day, Mr Justice Isaacs, when introducing the amending Bill of 1906, I find that the case made out by him in support of additional appointments was far weightier and more precisely proved than the case submitted to to-night. That is one reason why I say that any growth of business disclosed by figures, that are difficult to interpret in the need only point to present pressure of a temporary nature.",69
488,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Migh t not the prosperity of the country account for the growth of the business of the Court?,69
489,Mr DEAKIN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"It might; but there are other causes, such as the industrial. The plain issue is how far we are called upon at this stage to add to the High Court Bench. I feel disinclined even to appear to turn a deaf ear to any appeal of this character, knowing how greatly the present Justices have been overworked. But I have to proceed on such general sympathies and inferences, rather than upon exact data, to justify me, as a member of Parliament, with a duty to discharge to my constituents, in arriving at the conclusion that there is any necessity for any additional appointment. The proved necessity does not extend to the appointment of one additional Justice, and certainly does not justify the appointment of two. Among the circumstances that may fairly be taken into account, both in regard to the regrettable loss the Bench has recently sustained and to the appeal of the High Court Justices in relation to their overwork, is the fact that, contrary to the universal practice in Australia, no retiring allowance is available even to the men, who are breaking down owing to their devotion to duty, who, finding themselves crippled by the influx of new business and the illness of a comrade, have spent themselves without stint in the discharge of their duty.",69
490,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,We shall relieve them by passing this Bill.,70
491,Mr DEAKIN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I am pointing out that in this measure should have Been included some recognition of their services, the sacrifices already made, and the work they are now doing. So far as I am aware, no Judges in the British Empire have done such hard work with, relatively, so little remuneration as have the Justices of the High Court. Australia, which is proud of its Court in every way, should at least be satisfied that it is properly remunerating its members.",70
492,Mr ROBERTS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Does the honourable member suggest that we should add to their salaries so that they may continue to overwork themselves?,70
493,Mr DEAKIN,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I suggest that the provision of a retiring allowance would be the most acceptable form of recognising their services. The few remarks I have made require to be supplemented by the fact that we are faced also with the considerationwhich I can touch upon only in the lightest possible way-of the choice that is to be made. The strength of a Bench lies not so much in the number of its members as in their quality. It lies not so much in their wealth of learning as in the standards by which they are governed and the influence which they are able to exercise from their exalted position. Consequently, amongst the most embarrassing choices that can fall upon a Cabinet or its chief adviser, is the selection of the best ability available, and particularly a selection which will most effectively supplement the ability and learning already possessed by the Bench. The task that will devolve upon the Government in this regard will be of 'the most serious character, and will be attended by the most fruitful results. I shall not, for one moment, assume that Justices chosen for what, in some respects, is the highest office in the Commonwealth, will not be selected from the very cream of the judicial intellects of the Commonwealth, and without partisan aims. Happily, we have never had to look outside our own boundaries for our Judges. But even in these circumstances, and with the liberty of choice open to the Government, it will be an extremely delicate and difficult matter to make such a selection for the existing vacancy, that the Bench we already possess shall be supplemented by the addition of a mind, not only equal to its present standard, but at the same time so equipped as to lend to it, not merely numerical, but special, individual strength. On that point it is not permissible to dwell, although it is necessary to lay some emphasis upon it. We have to remember that Justices are human, and so are Ministers and those who criticise them. The question whether laws are constitutional and valid, or declared to be unconstitutional and void, is, in itself, a recollection that must sober every serious member of our Legislature. Far more than we can guess depends upon the choice, and the choice made will be all the better, as it seems to me, if it is limited in the first instance to one Judge only. Ministers, of course, may not be responsible for the extra pressure fhat has been put upon them of late to make additional appointments, but I am confident that, if they added a first-class, capable man to the Bench they could then, with advantage, wait until they had studied the consequence of that appointment before undertaking to make a further - one. At the close of a Parliament, and in the face of a referendum, this would be both just and wise. In any event, we all recognise that the particular Bill before us marks not only a stage in the growth of this Commonwealth, and bf its responsibilities, but a critical event. Having regard to the present division of opinion amongst members of the existing Bench, even one appointment may possibly give a very decisive turn to the interpretations of important questions of constitutional law affecting Parliament and the whole - Commonwealth. In this both sides of the House are deeply and vitally interested. All, I am sure, will sympathize with the Attorney-General in the responsibility that will be cast upon him and his colleagues by this far-reaching measure.",70
494,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Bendigo) [9.43]-The Attorney-General submitted this Bill for the consideration of the House with studied care, deliberation, and caution, and I see no reason to complain of any attempt on his part to exaggerate the case or to overstate the arguments in support of his action. So far as he appeared to make them, they seemed to me to be in his favour. I was glad to notice the full measure of justice that he did to the splendid work done by the High Court of Australia. I think that the people of Australia have every reason to be proud of the constitution of our High Court and of the magnificent work already done in the field of judicial interpretation, not only in great constitutional cases, but in the. field - of private jurisprudence. With reference to its original jurisdiction the work of the High Court has been comparatively limited. Hitherto the public of Australia have not - shown any disposition to rush to the High Court in matters of original jurisdiction when they could obtain justice through the .State Courts. It is quite true that with the - enlargement of Federal legislation litigants may be forced to go to the High Court, - even in matters of primary jurisdiction. But, generally speaking, there has not been - any preference manifested for the High Court in matters of primary or original - jurisdiction. Its principal scope and usefulness appears to be confined to its appellate jurisdiction. In that arena it has - doubtless done, and will continue to do, good work. The comparatively small amount of work done in the original jurisdiction of the Court is shown by the figures which have been supplied by the Attorney-General. These disclose the fact that in 1911 the Court sat in its original jurisdiction on ninety-four days, and that during the present year it has sat only twenty-five days. But as he very properly pointed out there was one great case in 1911 which absorbed nearly the whole of those sitting days- I refer to the Coal Vend case.",71
495,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I do not lay stress upon that. I mentioned it for what it was worth.,71
496,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Ver y little argument in favour of additional appointments - can be founded .upon any growth of business in the original jurisdiction of the Court. The main argument for an increase in the. number of Justices must be based upon the increase of business in its appellate jurisdiction.,71
497,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I do lay stress on the fact that the ""Court is engaged upon most important work on nearlv every sitting day of the year.",71
498,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"So far as the appellate work of the Court is concerned, it appears from the figures submitted by the Attorney-General that last year the Full Court sat upon only 165 days. The judicial year is said to consist of 220 davs.",71
499,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,What about the time that is absorbed in travelling?,71
500,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Travellin g does not absorb very much time. The Court can get from Melbourne to Sydney in a day, and from Melbourne to Adelaide in a day. I admit that it takes a little longer to visit Western Australia. But last year the number of days upon which the Full Court sat was only 165. That is barely half the whole year. I do not know how the judicial year is made up.",71
501,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The honourable member knows very well that it is judicial year we have to consider.,71
502,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I am not endeavouring to minimize the number of days upon which the Court sat or the strenuous cliaracter of the work which it performed. But there is nothing alarming in the fact that it sat on 165 days. With reference to the arrears of business in the Full Court, the only statement which T heard the Attorney-General make was that there are six cases undisposed of in Sydney, and that there are four constitutional cases awaiting decision.",71
503,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I said that two of them had been awaiting decision since January.,71
504,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The reason for that is obvious. It is because of the deficiency of the Court, owing to the sad and unavoidable absence of the late Mr. Justice O'Connor. Similar circumstances may not recur for many years to come. Had the Court been at its normal strength there would have been four Justices available for the Full Court, and for hearing cases in its primary or original jurisdiction. There is no very strong argument in favour of the appointment of additional Justices to the Court in its appellate jurisdiction, and we have not heard that the Justices of the High' Court, outside of the President of the Arbitration Court, have made any complaints that they are overworked.",71
505,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Does the honourable member know of any Court which sits as frequently as does tihe High Court?,72
506,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I have not the figures relating to the number of days on which the State Supreme Courts sit. I acknowledge the value and the magnitude of the work done by the High Court, and also its vital importance. I say that there should be no suspicion of hurrying that work.",72
507,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The honourable member knows that we could not sit here on six days a week.,72
508,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"At the same time, the Chief Justice of the High Court and his colleagues, who have been sitting in appellate jurisdiction, have not complained of being overworked. No doubt the most important work done in the appellate jurisdiction of the Court has been work involving the determination of constitutional questions. In that field the High Court has had a most strenuous time. dealt with a large number of leading cases which will be landmarks in the history of the development of our Constitution for many years lo come. It has grappled with many problems, and it has laid down many leading fundamental principles of interpretation and rules of construction. It may be considered to have laid down the fundamental outlines and development of our Constitution, and it is not likely that as many constitutional questions will arise in the future as have aiisen in the past. When it commenced its work there were a large number of problems demanding judicial settlement. These have now been settled until constitutional amendments are made by the people which involve new interpretations. I admit that if the Constitution Alteration Bills which we have just passed, and which involve enlargements of Federal power and conflicts with State rights, become law, there may be renewed activity in the constitutional interpretation work of the High Court. But it is by no means certain that those measures will become law. To do so, they must secure a majority of votes in a majority of the States. If any of the new appointments are proposed with an eye to the future interpretation of Federal law in conjunction with projected constitutional amendments, that proposal is based upon grounds which are not sufficiently tangible to influence the House at the present time. But should those amendments become law, it will be the duty of the Government to strengthen the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction.",72
509,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,After 125 years' experience of Federation in the United States of America constitutional questions are still being decided. The possibilities of litigation in connection with a written Constitution are infinite.,72
510,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"But the complexity of business relations in Australia is not so great as it is in the United States of America. I do not see any prospect"" of such an avalanche of constitutional litigation as to justify the Government in strengthening the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court.",72
511,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If the referenda proposals be carried, we shall have the avalanche.",72
512,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"It does seem to me that the work of the Arbitration Court is increasing, but even there the President has been occupied for only 158 days this year, whereas the Full Court has been It has occupied for 165 days. I suppose that the President of the Arbitration Court has also sat on the High Court Bench in many of the constitutional cases which have been decided. How many such attendances he has given does not appear. It seems strange, however, that during the 158 days on which the Arbitration Court sat, only about eighteen awards were made. I admit that the work is not to be gauged by the number of cases decided, but by the magnitude of the interests involved.",72
513,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The President of the Arbitration Court has pointed out that he has had to hear the Tramway case two or three times over, because he has not power to make a common rule.",72
514,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"It seems strange that a Court from which the legal profession is excluded should occupy so long a period in disposing of such a limited number of cases. If any case has been made out in favour of this Bill, it is in the direction of strengthening the Arbitration Court. It appears to me that nocase has been made out for any such great increase in the number of Justices as is proposed. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that if a strong Judge were appointed as a successor to Mr Justice O'Connor, the arrears of work in the Full Court might be overtaken, and the congestion which at present exists might be swept away. That would allow the President of the Arbitration Court more time to attend to arbitration work. I admitthat the work of that tribunal ought not to be allowed to accumulate. But for the - unfortunate illness of the late Mr Justice O'Connor there would not have existed the same cause for complaint, and no .ground for the appointment of additional Justices. I hope that I shall not be regarded as endeavouring to obstruct the reasonable expansion of the High Court, but it is the duty of the Opposition to insist on strong reasons being given and sustained for important appointments like these, involving very high salaries and .grave responsibilities. The country will require good reasons for an increased expenditure amounting to nearly jÂ£8,ooo per annum'. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [10.1]. - It is unfortunate that this Bill, dealing as it does with a matter of momentous consequence to Australia, was'not introduced - earlier in the session; that we have to debate it now is unworthy of its importance.",72
515,Mr SPENCE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The vacancy which must be filled occurred only recently.,73
516,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The Bill is not .needed for the filling of that vacancy. I congratulate the Attorney-General on his tone towards the High Court to-night, which contrasted markedly with that adopted by him towards it on a recent occasion. The High Court has a constitutional function with which the people of Australia are only beginning to become familiar. This function is unfamiliar to the people of the Mother Country, and even to some of the learned Lords of the Privy Council. That an Act of Parliament which had received the Royal assent should be called in question was recently treated by an extremely eminent law Lord as in the nature of an absurdity. This state of mind is due to the fact that Great Britain .has a Unitary form' of government, and the laws of its Parliament are therefore never - questioned. We are beginning to get accustomed to a tribunal having the right to question our Acts.",73
517,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Has not the fact that it does this tended to make it unpopular?,73
518,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"That is because the matter is misunderstood. We must get - accustomed to the exercise of this right, less we are prepared to do away with the - division of sovereign power between the Commonwealth and the States. It is the bounden duty, not only of the High Court, but of all our Courts, to inquire into the validity of the Acts of this and of the State Parliaments. When the validity of any of our laws is questioned, it becomes the duty of some Court to determine it, the High Court's decisions being by far the most important, because it is the final Court of Appeal.",73
519,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Every Court has not the power to bind Parliament.,73
520,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,No Court haB power to do that.,73
521,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,TH e High Court does it.,73
522,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"No . The statement shows that the Prime Minister is himself somewhat unfamiliar with the essentia] feature of the Constitution to which I have referred. This Parliament can make laws only within the limits of its ambit. Mr ""FISHER - Wliic h the High Court determines.",73
523,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The High Court does not control this Parliament, but some authority must determine whether a particular agent has, or has not, acted lawfully for its principal.",73
524,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The High Court defines the limits of our powers by interpreting the Constitution in accordance with its own views.,73
525,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"If there were not a High Court, the Supreme Courts of the States would do this work, and the County Courts would do it.",73
526,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,They would not limit our power.,73
527,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,No Court can do that. Surely it is time that the members of this House began to have some elementary ideas of the constitutional system under which we live. I do not say this disrespectfully.,73
528,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"We do not know what our powers are, and the Court does not know.",73
529,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I admit that there is a good deal of uncertainty sometimes as to the limits of our powers, but one of the main endeavours of the honourable member seems to be to introduce into the Constitution words of such ambiguity and uncertain effect that the determination of those limits will be still more dimcult. The only way in which the limits of our powers can be determined is by appeal to a Court of Law charged with the duty of unsaying in regard to what purports to be an Act of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of a State whether it is within the power of that Parliament to enact. Consider the other side of the question. Suppose that the Act of a State Parliament is called in question, on the ground that it transgresses on the domain vested by the Constitution in this Parliament. Is not any Court before which the question arises bound to determine whether that Act is, or is not, law?",73
530,Mr RILEY,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The Court can give a contracted or an extended interpretation.,74
531,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"A narrow or a broad view may be taken. I should be sorry to imagine that honourable members opposite, in dealing with this matter, will allow their judgments to be affected by recent decisions of the Court on constitutional questions. It is, of course, possible for the Court to take a narrow or a broad view. All that its Justices can do is to form a judgment according to their best ability. It is their imperative duty to determine whether any Act of the Commonwealth Parliament, or of a State Parliament, the validity of which is questioned, is valid, and they can do that only by studying the Constitution, and considering the powers expressly or impliedly vested in this Parliament.",74
532,Mr WEST,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,They express their own opinions.,74
533,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Thei r opinions must be final. I have been drawn aside from what I was going to say by what appears to me a misunderstanding in the minds of some honourable members as to the true functions of the Court. The High Court is the final judicial tribunal of Aus- evils which cause them. tralia, and a part-perhap s not the principal, but a very important part-of its functions is, when the question is raised, to decide whether an Act of this, or'of a State Parliament, is within the powers of legislation given by the Constitution to these agents of the popular will. If honourable members can suggest any other way in which the Federal Constitution could be administered, the suggestion might be useful ; no other way has yet been suggested. Wherever there is a Federation, some Court - ultimatel y the final Court of Appealmust determine whether what purports to be an Act of the Federal or a State Parliament is, or is not, constitutional. The main object of the Bill is to strengthen the High Court, and as the Leader of the Opposition has said, if that can be shown to be necessary, I shall not object to it. The reason put forward by the Attorney General is mainly a recent congestion of work, and I am not satisfied that such a congestion would exist had it not been for the unfortunate illness and death of Mr. Justice O'Connor. I admit, however, that if one Justice is to continue to have practically the whole of his time occupied, by arbitration proceedings, congestion of the ordinary work of the Court, if it does not at present exist, is likelv to arise.",74
534,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,It is doubtful if one man will be able to continue to do the work of the Arbitration Court.,74
535,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I take a different view of the functions of the Arbitration Court from that of honourable members opposite. In my opinion, the Court has not been a success, and is a cumbrous, heavy, unworkable piece of machinery. I know that honourable members opposite differ from me in to to, but I cannot help expressing the view that the gains which have resulted in certain cases to those whom they especially claim to represent bave been more than counterbalanced by the dislocation of business, delay, and expense, which the hearing of disputes has involved. In many, and perhaps the majority, of the cases, the proceedings-no t merely those before the Court, but those which have led to the bringing of disputes into the Court - hav e involved great industrial disturbance and large expenditure, without any corresponding benefit.",74
536,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Thes e proceedings are cheaper than strikes.,74
537,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"We should all like to do away with strikes, and differ only as to the best methods of meeting the I am not at liberty now to discuss this question generally. Whether the Court must be strengthened by the appointment of an ad,ditional Justice, or whether its work may not be considerably reduced by making its functions appellate or semi-appellate, leaving original jurisdiction to local bodies such as Wages Boards, will depend on what will happen in May or June next, which is something that ' we cannot control. If honourable members opposite are successful in obtaining a majority at the next election, no doubt they will press their policy and magnify the authority, and extend the operations, of the Arbitration Court. If we on this side are successful, I , for one, shall be strongly in favour of restricting very largely the operations of that Court.",74
538,Mr MATHEWS,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,That is a good admission.,74
539,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"I seem to be always pleasing the honourable member by my admissions, and possibly I shall make some more. The functions of the Arbitration Court, in my opinion, ought to be confined to work of a more or less appellate character. The main determination, so far as any determination by law can be arrived at, of indusJudges; trial conditions, ought to be vested in bodies of a totally different character, namely, bodies in the nature of Wages Boards. However, on this Bill we not in a'position to discuss these alternathinking tives ; and I merely put this forward emphasize my point of view. The main claim tor the proposed large addition to rule each other. the personnel of the High Court Bench rests on the fact that the Arbitration Court, in carrying out its original, or non-appelmight late, jurisdiction, will have to extend operations because it will have more more original work to do. It was the original jurisdiction of this CQurt to which I objected, because I recognised a suggestion has been made. that it would be almost entirely of a legisUnited lative character. I am glad to see that am supported by, perhaps, the' highest final Court of Appeal. authority on this question, namely, Mr. Justice Higgins himself, who, if properly reported, has recently stated that what is called on to do is not to decide cases judicially, but to make law. That is candid admission on the part of the Judge, who is a clear-headed and able man. He has come to the conclusion to which we must all come, that the functions handed over to him are not so much of a judicial cliaracter as they are of a law-making regulative character. That is the kind of jurisdiction which I think ought not invested in an Arbitration Court. should turn out that the views, which I lieve are shared to a considerable extent on this side, receive the acceptance of the country, then the Arbitration Court, existing, will be a Court whose functions will not take up anything like the whole time of even one Judge. Unless we are election. going to devote the whole time of one GovernmentI quite Judge to arbitration work, and extend work, I am not convinced that there is any their policy, they will be quite justified actual or immediate congestion in ness of the High Court. That business also consists of appellate and original more jurisdiction. If honourable members look back on the history of the High Court they that will see that it is vested, under the Constitution and the Judiciary Act, with very conshouldI do siderable powers of original jurisdiction, gaged and but that very few cases of original jurisdiction have ever come before it. The Attorally ney-General will admit that the extension with of what is called the original, or nonifvery appellate jurisdiction, has been very slow. ing to An immense amount of very strenuous dustries-thi 5 work has, however, been created by the order to form appellate jurisdiction. We cannot have a pute, and to abring Court of Appeal with fewer than three industrial warfare which but I could understand a totally different scheme being adopted, namely, as suggested some time ago, two Full Courts of the High Court.

541,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"That is precisely the difficulty; the two highest Courts not be in accord on principles of its Jaw, and there would have to be some and machinery to bring them together. I am not suggesting that the plan should be adopted, but merely pointing out that such In the States of America there are Circuit I Courts of Appeal, subject to review by the So long as we have appeal cases from the Supreme Courts of the States, I do not know that the prehe sent tension can be relieved by the appointment of an additional one or two a Judges. No doubt the Court would be strengthened, inasmuch as there would be four or five Judges instead of three; but that would be the only advantage. The main necessity which is put forward for the enlargement of the Court depends, to a large or extent, on whether the extension of the Arbitration Court as at present constituted to be is to go on; and it might be a If it very wise thing, first of all, to afford be the people an opportunity of pronouncing whether this particular method of settling industrial disputes is to receive the exteni f still sion claimed for it.",75

There are one or two provisions in the Bill which I do not think have received quite, full enough oonsideration, from what I might call a technical point of view. Clause 3 provides that a Full Court, consisting of less than all the Justices, shall not give a decision on a question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth unless a majority of all the Justices concur in the decision. The object, of course, is quite apparent, and I can understand the Attorney-General desiring that, before a law shall be declared invalid, a majority of the whole Bench shall be in favour of that view.",75
546,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"A Court of four Judges could, of course, hear the case. Mr W. H. IRVINE - But difficulty is that the clause seems to assume that the decision will be given on the abstract constitutional validity of an Act. A decision is, and would be, very rarely of that kind except, perhaps, under the Act which enables Parliament to remit to the High Court the question of whether a Bill is valid. The question then is-Is this law good or bad ? It is not very often, as I say, that the question arises in this particular way before the Court.",76
547,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"There has been no such case yet. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I doubt if there has been. The question for decision before the Court is usually a question, say, between Jones and Robinson, and not whether a law is good or bad. It often happens, and, in fact, it usually happens, that in determining whether, for instance, a fine is lawful, or whether one man is entitled to recover a sum of money from another, the constitutionality of an Act of Parliament is called in question; and it just as often happens that Judges take different views personally on the subject.",76
548,Mr HUGHES,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"In so far as the decision of a Judge or Court impairs the validity of any law, this section will apply.",76
549,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"No , because the clause provides that a Full Court, consisting of less than all the Justices, shall not give a decision on a question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth..

That may happen in some cases, but it usually happens that the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of an Act is merely one of the arguments' put forward in favour of one of the parties to the litigation; and the decision is a decision in favour of one of the parties, and rarely on the constitutionality of an Act.",76

The honourable member for Flinders has talked very learnedly, and we were pleased to hear him, about the position the H i gh Court occupies, the position it should occupy, and the functions it exercises. Certain gentlemen who occupy eminent positions in the law have a tendency to assume that other human beings, who are not in the legal profession, can have no knowledge of what is lawful or constitutional, and, therefore, that we are in duty bound to speak of a Court, whether it be a minor tribunal or the highest Court in .the land, with the greatest possible awe.",76
557,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,I did not suggest that.,76
558,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"The High Court is constituted of eminent gentlemen, each' of whom bas had experience in the field of politics. In addition to being members of the legal profession, they have been politicians fighting on the floor of Parliament with as much vim and, shall we say, party prejudice, as does any member of this House. We regard them as distinguished jurists, free from party political bias in the discharge of their duties, and we must assume that they do their best according to their high intellectuality, in spite of the unconscious bias and prejudice which, as human beings, they must carry with them. Our High Court is as eminent as any in the world, and quite as capable of performing the duties allotted to it as is any body of jurists of which I have read. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has tried to impress upon the House and the country the idea that the High Court is to be' a purely appellate tribunal; in other words, that it is not to exercise any original jurisdiction.",76
559,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"No ; I said that it was vested with original jurisdiction, but that, as a matter of fact, it has had very little of it to exercise.",77
560,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,Quite so. I regret that fact; but the honourable member ap ; pears not to do so.,77
561,Mr WH IRVINE,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,No . I say the people have not availed themselves of the Court in its original jurisdiction.,77
562,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Why have they not done so? Because,. I presume, of the difiSdecision culty of getting to it.

564,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"Why is the honourable member excited? As to the position taken up by the honourable member for Flinders in regard to the Conciliation' and Arbitramuch tion Court, I can only say that bunal should undoubtedly be a Court of original jurisdiction. Acting in an pellate character-dealin g only with decision of Wages Boards- I think that would be an utter failure. I should fore be very glad if another available to share, as far as possible, in its work. The honourable member was good enough to say that the High Court did not limit the powers of this Parliament. It may riot directly limit our powers, but claims the right to interpret every line of the United Kingdom. the Constitution, and, whenever it deterliament mines that any law is unconstitutional, we of that tribunal. have to act upon that decision.",77

569,Mr FISHER,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,"That may suit the honourable member's argument for the time being; but he spoke also of other Courts. The Privy Council has laid it down that its decisions are binding, and cannot be altered. Such a position is a perfectly tenable one for it to take up, since the Parliament of the United Kingdom is free that at any time to amend the law if any decision given under it shows that it is not in the interests of the public. But what is the position? - If the High Court gives a limiting the powers of the FedeParliament- a decision which, in the opinion of the Parliament, is not in the to best interests of the people-the Parliaobment itself is unable to act. It cannot help the people unless the Constitution has itself, upon which the decision in question placed a certain interpretation, isamended by the people.",77
570,Mr GROOM,DEATH AT SOLITARY ISLAND,The right honourable member's argument would apply just as to the position of the States in the that tricase of a conflict of powers.,77

Thethe people of Australia! however, cannot doso. I am glad that both sides of the House agree that the High Court should strengthened, but we, as a people, cannot recognise the principle that a decisiongiven by the High Court shall be binding for all time.

That is a duty which rests with the people, and must always rest with them. All that the the Judges do is to try, as far as they may, to tell us exactly what the people intended that we should be able to do. There is one other point with which I desire be to deal. The Attorney-General, throughthe out the whole of his argument, has been urging that we are fettered now by the Hence the referenda proposals of the Government are neither more nor less than an appeal to the people from The purpose of the Attorney-General, in connection with tbese referenda proposals, has been declared on many an occasion to be to sweep .away all And why?

Before cramming the High Court Bench in vernment the way that is proposed, had not my hononly orable friends better wait and see whether degrade it is to be given more or less work ? I gest that the Attorney-General is already afraid that all he has promised in the way of relief from the High Court is not likely to eventuate - The very fact that he wishes to strengthen that tribunal to ennecessary. able it to do very much more work shows that he anticipates the loading up of the Court with further business instead of ting away from the limitations which he has fulminated on so many occasions.",79

The way in which that tribunal has been recently shows that there, is no need for any more appointments, apart from that necessary to fill the vacancy which has been occasioned by the death of the late Mr Justice O'Connor. We should then have tices. When the fate of the referenda proposals of the Government has been settled, it will be time enough to consider whether or not more Justices are required. It seems to me that a good many honorthat able members opposite have rather a conception of the High Court tions. I have frequently heard them use the phrase ""Judge-made law."" I think that some honourable members who have used that term do not quite understand what it means. If they will take the trouble to analyze the judgments of the I That High Court, they will see that it has desire simply interpreted the laws enacted by this ness tomorrow Parliament, and also the Constitution. It has not attempted to strain the Constitution in any way. I have read many of the the repeal of the judgments carefully, and I am satisfied that the Justices of the High Court well within their province as interpreters of the law. Of course, 1 exclude the work of the Arbitration Court, the President of day. which has a chance, to a certain extent, to become something in the nature of a legisinstitution. It will be time enougb to elevate two more gentlemen, to the Higb Court Bench when the fate of the referenda proposals has been determined. But whether one or three Justices are appointed to that tribunal, I hope , that the expressed by the Prime Minister will' be carried out, and that the best men in Australia will be appointed. If the Goare going to appoint politicians to the Bench, we shall sooner or later it.
