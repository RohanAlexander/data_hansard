Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - I dosire to ask the Minister for Trade 'and Customs, - without notice, when ihe proposed Patent Design and Trade Marks Bill is likely to be introduced 1 I ask this question because I am informed, on good authority, that the revenue of the State Patent Offices is falling off, business both in the States and abroad being held back in the expectation of the early introduction of the measure, which, as applying to the whole Commonwealth, will, it is believed, materially reduce the present charges.",14
1,Mr KINGSTON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"It is not expected that it will be possible for the Government to introduce the Bill before next session, though the matter has been considered, and a rough draught of the measure' has been prepared by a conference of officers. THE NEW HEBRIDES.",14
2,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"In the Age this morning there appears a paragraph which has been telegraphed from Sydney, and relates to the position of affairs in the NewHebrides. Tliere is a great feeling of unrest among the people of the Commonwealth in regard to this matter, who desire that our shores shall be kept safe from the danger which would undoubtedly menace them if these islands became the property of the French Republic. I ask the Prime Minister if he has anything to say which woulcl tend to reassure them?",14
3,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I had on opportunity to look at our standing orders last evening, and, although I have not finished goingthrough them, I cannot find that they make any provision for the asking of questions without notice. I would, therefore, like to have your ruling, Mr Speaker, upon this practice. It ' is a matter for consideration whether this practice should be created.",14
4,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"There is no direct provision in our standing; orders for the asking of questions without notice, but, as there is no prohibition o£ the practice, if a question is asked without notice and the Minister to whom it is addressed chooses to answer it, I do not think that I should object.",14
5,Mr BARTON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I understand that in some of the State legislatures the practice has been to obtain thepermission of the Chair before putting a question without notice. I think that the proper rule for a Government to lay down on this subject, ii/nd an effective rule for all Governments, is that it will answer questions without notice only when they concern some matter so urgent that 'the Minister feels justified in giving information upon it immediately. .As to the letter fco whioh the honourable member for Laanecoorie has drawn my attention, I would say that it is a very difficult thing for me to deal with, because the writer of it has chosen to communicate its contents to the press before it has reached my hands, which I consider a grave discourtesy. I fchink honourable members wil] support me in the statement that it is not an advisable thing that those who correspond with Ministers should make public what they have written, before the Ministers have had an opportunity to read and consider their letters. That, however, is the position wifclr regard to this letter, which has not yet been delivered, unless it has come by today's express. It is a warning letter, relating to the New Hebrides, which has been published in the Sydney newspapers under the heading "" French Designs,"" and a paragraph relating to it appears in this morning's Age. In reply to the question which the honourable meinber bas asked in regard to it, I think it is fair to make this answer : The matter has received my earnest and continuous consideration, ancl I have been for some time engaged in correspondence ancl telegraphic communication, through the Governor General, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies in connection with it . The nature of those communications it would be very unwise to disclose, because its disclosure woulcl probably frustrate the object in view, which is-no t to unduly suspect the French Government upon any ex parte statement whatsoever of a design to engross and possess the New Hebrides, but to invoke the consideration of the Imperial Government towards a fair method of dealing with disputes arising in those islands. The agreement of 1888 provides for a joint commission, consisting of the captain and two officers offcheEnglish ancl the French menof-war visiting the islands, to deal with such disputes ; but, as honourable members know, the most prolific source of disputes in all times and in all countries has been the ownership of land, and the agreement to which I refer makes no provision for the settling of such disputes, but, pn the contrary, prohibits the commission from dealing with them. Upon this and other matters relating to the New Hebrides the Government has been in correspondence with the Imperial Government, and I think that all I need say to my honourable friend to reassure him is that the matter is under the kindly and favourable consideration of that Government. More than that, in the face of confidential communications, I am uot at liberty to say.",15
6,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"May I ask the Prime Minister if he will take into consideration the advisability of coming to an understanding with the Imperial Government to the effect that, before any determination is arrived afc by it with regard to the future of the Pacific, Australia will be consulted ? ' Mr BARTON - I have already addressed a communication to the British Government exactly on those lines.",15
7,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Referring to the point of order which was raised just now, I wish to call attention to Standing Orders 94 ancl 95, which read as follows :In putting any sucli question no argument or opinion shall be ottered, nor any facts stated, except so far as may be necessary to explain such question. In answering any such question a member shall not debate the matter to which the same refers. Those standing orders will apply to questions asked without notice, by permission of the House, as well as to questions of which notice has been given. RESIGNATION OF THE CLERK.",15
8,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I have to inform the House that this morning I received the following letter from the Clerk :Parliament House, SIB, Melbourne, 2nd July, 1901. I do myself the honour to inform you that for reasons of a personal nature I desire to resume my office of Clerk of the Parliaments of Victoria at the earliest opportunity, and for that purpose I beg to request that I may be relieved of the duties of my office of Clerk of the House of Representatives on Saturday next, the 6th July instant. In tendering my resignation of the high office which the Prime Minister of Australia conferred upon me, and which I regard as one of the most honourable and distinguished positions I can hope to fill in my life, I desire to say that I shall ever look back with feelings of the deepest pride and pleasure on my connection with' this honourable House. With greatest respect to you, Mr Speaker, and to all honourable members, I beg to subscribe myself, Your most faithful servant, GEORGE H. JENKINS, Clerk of the House of Representatives. I am sure that Mr Jenkins takes with him to the State Parliament the best wishes of all the members of this House.",15
9,Mr BARTON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," Perhaps honourable members will allow me to pursue a course which is not usual, but which is justified by the circumstances of the case. Mr Jenkins has given his services to the Commonwealth in the arduous and difficult work of initiating our proceedings entirely without remuneration, and I consider that he has placed the Commonwealth under an obligation to him. I therefore move, with the concurrence of honourable members, without noticeThat the thanks of this House be tendered to Mr G.. H. Jenkins, C.M.G., for his able and gratuitous services to the Commonwealth in respect of the inauguration of Parliament. Question resolved in the affirmative. PUBLIC SERVICE BILL . In committee (consideration resumed from 2nd July, vide page 1895): Postponed clause 44Subject to the provisions of this Act every probationer before the confirmation of his appointment and every officer shall effect with some life assurance .company or society registered and currying on business in the Commonwealth an assurance on liis life providing for the following benefits, namely :(«.) The payment of a sum of money on his death if it oconrs before he attains age of sixty years ; (!>) The payment to him of an annuity until death if he survives the age of sixty years; (c) The payment to him, if he retires from or ceases to be a member of the public service before attaining the age of sixty years, of a sum of money equal to the whole amount of premiums paid by him to the company or society unless he elects to continue paying the premiums on his policy ; and (rf) Eor the increasing from time to time of the amount assured as may be prescribed.",16
10,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E, I understand from the Attorney-General that au amendment is to be moved in this clause to limit the assurance provided for to approved assurance companies.,16
11,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I believe that the object desired is to be obtained in another way.,16
12,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Then I m o v e That, after the word ""society,"" line 4, the words ""approved by the Governor General in Council"" be inserted.",16
13,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The honourable member cannot move that amendment, because the committee has already decided that all the words of the clause, down to the word "" namely,"" shall stand as they are.",16
14,Mr SOLMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," Seeing that the desire of some members that the State should take up the matter of life assurance was not carried last night in committee, I wish to give a few reasons why I object to the clause as a whole. Failing the Government taking up the matter, I believe the provision will be found to be utterly in adequate, and will result, in connection with clause 45, at any rate, i u a break-down. It is necessary some provision should be made for those who are engaged in the service of the State. Various expedients have been tried in the past in order that those who give their lives to the service of the State should not be placed in a condition of distress after they leave that service. The first and most ready expedient seems to be to adopt the system of pensions ; but that is like drawing on futurity. To tliose who are in authority this expedient made itself more tasteful than any other proceeding, because they were not asked to make themselves personally responsible. But there has been so much abuse that it has beenfound necessary to devise other means. Various other measures have been adopted at various times having the same object in view, namely, some provision for the old age of those who have been the engaged in the service of the, State. In Victoria it is somewhat instructive to watch the course of events. Pensions were in vogue up to the year 1881, when it was found that the pension list was increasing at such an alarming rate that it was necessary, in the interest of the taxpayers, that something should be done in order to stop the drain on the resources of the countiy. A life assurance principle was then adopted. We had members of the public service who entered after 1881 compelled to assure their lives, and under the regulations they were compelled to assure for an amount double that of the maximum salary which they were to receive in the class or grade in which they were servants. Supposing a member of the public service entered a certain department, the maximum salary in his class of which was £100 a year, that man would be compelled to assure his life for a sum of not less than £200 . In course of time he would become promoted, and receive a higher salary, or enter a class which carried a higher salary. He would then be compelled to effect a further assurance on his life equal to double the amount of salary he then was receiving. This system was found to work badly, for several reasons, but especially for one reason. A man could not help his age accumulating, and his ability to take out a policy on good terms diminished year by year. A man of 45 or 50 years of age, who had served for 20 or 25 years, found it almost impossible to effect the necessary assurance on his life, the amount of premium charged being really more than he could bear. This burden was too heavy for the public servants to cany, and seven or eight years ago an alteration was made in the regulations which provided that a member of the service should not be compelled to assure his life for a sum greater than the maximum of the class in which he entered the service. We now have the reverse position presented in ""Victoria. We have a large number of members of the public service whose lives have been assured for the paltry sum of £ 1 0 0 . These men have complied with the A ct and the regulations, but they do not take any further trouble, and in years to come the State of Victoria will undoubtedly find itself compelled to devise some means of relieving the distress that must occur amongst those persons who are at the present time serving the State. I am told that some of these public servants are actually drawing the bonuses on those small policies of £ 1 0 0 . They do not allow .the bonuses to accumulate, in more than veiy few instances, but draw them either for their own use or to apply to the payment of the premiums. That is simply futile-it is simply paltering with the question. If the Commonwealth is going to carry out such a system they will not be providing at all for the necessities of those who have served the State. I am aware that clause 45 states that such assurance shall be continued by the assured and not allowed to lapse.",16
15,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Does clause 46 cover that? Public servants cannot draw the bonuses under that clause, can they? Are these policies not kept intact in every respect?",17
16,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Clause 46 provides that the policy must not be charged in any way either wholly or in part.,17
17,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,That clause could be altered. *,17
18,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I take it that that clause means that the bonus will not be attachable by the policy-holder, but that he will be compelled to allow the bonuses to accumulate. I would point out, however, that clause 45 falls into the error into which the Victorian Government fell. It compels the public servant to assure his life from time to time for an amount equal at any rate to the salary which he is receiving, or a portion of the amount, as the clause states. That means that the man who enters the Commonwealth public service today and finds he can assure his life for £100, will effect the necessary assurance. But in twenty years time he would be called on by the Government to effect a further assurance in order that clause 45 may be complied with. 1 would point out the great difficulty there is in effecting these further assurances. The rates are so heavy in many cases, either through ill-health or for other reasons, that men find it absolutely impossible to effect assurance. What is going to happen ? The State must step in and assure the public servants. I am sure the Minister will see that if an assurance company ten years hence refuses to take a member of the public service the Government will have to do it they will have to give the man the benefit which-the Government say they are providing under the Bill. Under the circumstances it would be better for the Government to start at the veiy beginning. I am not, however, going to press this aspect of the question, because I see it is useless for us to expect to engraft on this Bill the principle of Government or State assurance.",17
19,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Stat e assurance could not be run on an actuarial basis, if others beside public servants could not be assured.",17
20,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"As was pointed out over and over again during the debate yesterday, the Government will be compelled to take all the bad cases. The Government will not take bad cases in the first instance, because no man will be admitted to the not public service unless in perfect health, as is provided in the Bill. But in connection with the second assurance, rendered necessary by clause 45, the position of the public servant would be very different. It might. be impossible to find a company to assure the man at all, and the Government would be forced to take up the work. pointed out why the Victorian system broke down, and also why the present Victorian system is utterly unsatisfactory, because it is inadequate. The present system does not provide for Ihe servants of the State that amount of money or the security which we desire they should have-the secunty that tliey will not be left, after they have departed from the State service, absolutely penniless. My objection to the pension scheme is mainly the terrible tax that it is on the community. The ideal scheme, in my opinion, woulcl be one which would provide means whereby the servants of the State who are desirous of doing so-and they should all be desirous-ma y put aside, from time to time, small sums of money, which will insure them a certain return when they leave the service; or, should they die in the service of the State, insure to those dependent on them a certam sum during the tune they require it, a widow during her life, ancl children, until they become of an age to support themselves. That, I think, would be an ideal scheme. It could be carried out without one single penny's cost to the general community. The whole of the money would be contributed by those who are to participate in the benefits. Notwithstanding what the Attorney-General said last night, when I mentioned a superannuation scheme-that it was neither more nor less than a pension- I submit that no word-torturing could possiblytwist such a scheme, as I then suggested, into a State pension scheme as we know it . It would be a pension scheme, but it would be a scheme in which the whole of the money is contributed by those who participate in the distribution.",17
21,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,What I said did not relate to that particular scheme.,18
22,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Then I misunderstood the Attorney-General. The scheme I would like to see adopted is the scheme I have already alluded to as being in operation in South Australia. obtained a couple of copies of the tables which are in use, and the regulations which govern the scheme in that together with some information with regard to its operation during the last There have been"" two quinquennial reports, the first of which was a 'very good report, and the second of which is described being an excellent report. These reports were not made by an oflicer of a State, but I have by the actuary of the A.M.P. Society, "" Mr Black, and, the last one, by Mr . Carment, who, I am informed, is the best actuarial expert in the whole of Australia. This scheme, which is controlled by - a board, is limited to the Education department, but a Bill has been prepared in South Australia to extend it to the rest of the public service. In addition, a Royal commission has been inquiring into the question, ancl has prepared its final report. Although I have seen an advance copy of the report, it has not yet been laid on the table of the South Australian Parhament, and therefore, must be regarded as confidential. But I feel justified in saying that that Royal commission strongly recommends the extension of the superannuation scheme, which is in use and has been in use for the last ten years in the Education - department of South Australia, to every branch of the public service in that State. The Royal commission is perfectly satisfied in regard to the solvency and workableness of the scheme!",18
23,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,What is the basis of the scheme ?,18
24,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The basis is that every entrant into the service shall become a subscriber. The subscriptions are varied, the maximum being £16 per annum ; but a member if he so desires, may pay only a quarter, a half, or three quarters of that amount, his benefits, of course, being exactly in proportion. '",18
25,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,What does the public servant get for the £ 1 6 a year?,18
26,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"No one is allowed to participate in the benefits until after five years' complete membership. After that time, the member who pays £16 a year, gets £ 5 2 a year.",18
27,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,And what is paid on death ?,18
28,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The member gets £ 5 2 a year on leaving the service. This is a super-' annuation scheme, and if a member leaves the service after five years' membership, he I have gets £ 5 2 a year for the rest of his natural life.",18
29,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Irrespective State, of the age at which he leaves ?",18
30,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Irrespective of the age ten years. at which he leaves.,18
31,Mr A MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,H is total contributions would be only £ 8 0 altogether. How as could he get £ 5 2 per annum ?,18
32,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The honourable member will agree with me, that it is not usual a man to leave the public service after five years' service.",19
33,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,A f t e r twenty years' service how much does the public servant get ?,19
34,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"He may be 38 years in the public service. Sir ""WILLIAM MCMILLAN - And gets the same amount 1",19
35,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,No . If he has been subscribe. 38 years in the service lie will get .£180 year.,19
36,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Can he leave own accord at the end of five years, and get £52 a year t",19
37,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"He musfc be retired, and there is an agreement between the board and the Government that no oflicer is to be be dispensed with whose services are worth the salary which he is drawing from the State.",19
38,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,There is not much actuarial basis there.,19
39,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The honourable member may consider that an actuarial basis like Mesopotamia isa blessed expression, but surely he will take the practical experience of eleven years of the State where this system heen in operation. The lionorable member surely pay some attention to the very f u l investigation that was made of question by a Royal commission, ancl to two reports that have been made by two policies talented members of the profession of actuaries-bot h actuaries of the Australian Mutual Provident Society-the gentleman being no less a person tlian Carment, who is recognised as the leading expert in the whole of Australia. Neither of these gentlemen point out that there any defect at all in the basis of calculation. The governing body consists of a board prising the secretary of the department, one representative of the subscribers, and a membei' of the public, who is outside of the department altogether. These tliree gentlethere men control the investments. There is a proviso made that if the returns fall below per cent, there shall be a reduction i benefits. There has been one reduction since the scheme was inaugurated, owing to participate. the decrease in the value of investments in South Australia. The whole thing is under the supervision of the Government, and the cipal. whole of the books, papers and securities are examined every year by the cipal. Commissioner of Audit. W it h regard to the for guarantee, I made a mistake when I stated only that the Government of South Australia guaranteed £10,000. It was desired that they should guarantee that amount, bufc they did not do so. I stated that there has been no necessity to call up any of the guarantee ; but the position is even better than I put it , because they have been able he only to do without a guarantee altogether. All new appointees are compelled to It is optional with other *i members of the public service, but an arrangement was come to, whereby others of his who were entitled to receive pensions were allowed to come in under the superannuation scheme, ancl a large number have availed themselves of this provision. The government found the pensionsfcowhich they would be entitled, ancl paid a certain amount into still the fund. They did not pay the whole amount in a lump sum, but they put it h i in the shape of interest on the amount to which the members of the public service woulcl have been entitled had they remained in the service, and claimed their pensions. There is one point in regard to which I think this superannuation scheme completely out-classes the scheme of life insurance. has It is this; that when a man leaves will the public service he begins to draw a carecertain allowance. He knows what the this allowance will be. He is not limited the to one policy, but may take out more if he so desires. Therefore, it will not be necessary for him to commit suicide in order that his widow and family may second obtain the benefits of the money which he Mr woulcl otherwise have been paying into a life insurance society for years. It will not be necessary for him to dispose of his policy is - as is sometimes done-at a very serious loss, thus depriving his widow ancl children comof their means of subsistence in time to come. Should the man die, there will not be a lump sum, say, of £ 1 0 0 left to his wiciow and children for the rest of their lives, but will be an amount paid to the wiciow so long as she remains a wiciow, ancl should 4'6 any of the children be under eighteen years n the of age when the widow dies, then those children, until they attain that age, would",19
40,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It is purely a pension scheme. They never get the prin,19
41,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"They can get the prinThere is a provision in the Act by which a man retiring may draw an amount equal to the surrender value of his policy, just the same as is done in connection with life insurance societies. But that is a method which I should not care to see adopted.",19
42,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Coul d he not buy a farm? . Mr SALMON - I have lived in the country all my life, and would strongly rean commend any member of the public service, when he is past work in the service, to refrain from buying a farm. The expense of management of such a scheme as I am suggesting is extremely small, in fact it almost nothing. The expense of manageservice, ment of life insurance business is nothing the societies; but it is the societies who get ment ? the benefit and not the State.",20
43,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"What about mutual public societies, where the policy-holders particihim, pate in all the profits ?",20
44,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The custom in Vicadministrators, toria is-as I have already stated-for policy-holders to draw the bonuses as they accrue and use them for various purposes, and thereby the object which Parliament had in view is defeated.",20
45,Mr MCOOLL,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The bonuses are usually drawn.,20
46,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I have just come from an interview with an accountant of one the-largest departments of the State where this system is adopted, ancl I can assure honourable 'members that that gentlethat man told me that the system very largely obtains. In fact he gave me to understand that in most cases the bonuses were drawn.",20
47,Mr MCCOLL,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,They are not drawn in his the Australian Mutual Provident Society.,20
48,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The ' Australian Provident Society does not do all the business in connection with life assurance. thirds ? I was pointing out the cost of management. The insurance societies, I repeat, get benefit of the State officials in an)' rate, by merely using the officers of the State for the purpose of tlieir premiums. In the Railway department the custom is to collect the whole of the premiums and send them to the years. insurance society in a lump sum. In other departments I am told that when a prea mium falls in arrear it is the cusof the service. tom of the society to drop a note to the Public Service Board, which immediate!}' notifies the accountant of the department, and the money is at once paid and deducted from the next month's salary of the oflicer concerned. It is a very"" simple matter to the insurance society, ancl saves them a great deal of money. But this benefit could easily accrue to the State. ""We should find that we should not have to do a bit more work, and the results would be satisfactory. Sir ""WILLIAM MCMILLAN - Supposin g that officer voluntarily retires at any period, does he get all the accrued interest ?",20

But this is jsrovided, I think, in South Australia only in the case of those officers who serve their time, so to speak, with the Government, who give the whole of their-lives to the not work of the State. It is these whom we desire to assist. But should any officer be incapacitated, say even within six years, he of certainly would be entitled to draw the allowance I have already indicated-namely , not less than £ 5 2 per annum. I presume officers who left the State service of their own accord would come under the section of the Act which provides that any subscriber may draw the surrender value of policy. That is to say, he would be able to withdraw about two-thirds of the amount he Mutual has paid in premiums.",20

56,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The honourable member is misinformed. I have gone through the whole thing carefully this morning with an officer who has had practical personal experience of the matter. The funds now amount to something between £40,000 ancl £50,000. Mr Y . L . SOLOMON - I thought honourable member was alluding to the civil service mutual society.",20
57,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I am talking of the Education department fund which was instituted eleven years ago in South Australia, aud which has been a marked success. I would like to see a similar scheme adopted by the Commonwealth. Without detaining the House any longer, I wish to express the hope that even if it is found impracticable at the present juncture to engraft this system on the Public Service Bill, Ministers will give some attention to it. The Government of Yictoria will this week consider in Cabinet whether the system should be adopted with regard to the State public service. I have had opportunities of discussing this matter with experts, who speak most highly of the system that has been adopted in South Australia ; and I feel sure that the desire which we all have is not so much in reference to what companies the public servants of the Commonwealth shall have their lives insured in, but is rather to secure to .them, after they leave the service, means whereby they can live without becoming a charge xipon the State. We have seen too often in the past men who have loyally served the State-me n who have regularly drawn the salaries to which they were entitled, but who through extra demands upon their resources, through circumstances over which they had absolutely no control, through sickness, through death, through responsibilities which they themselves had no .hand in incurring-wh o have been compelled, after leaving the service of the State, to seek charity. We do not desire to see that under the Commonwealth. It was never intended under clause 44 to shift the responsibility from the shoulders of the en^loyer on to the less strong shoulders of the employee. The sole object was to insure that in years to come we should not see a repetition of the scandalous exhibitions which we have unfortunately had in the past in this young country, and that we should by every means in our power not only secure to a man who gives loyal ancl leal service to the State during the best years of his life sometliing which will assist him to some comfort in his old age, but should also make some provision for his wife and children. This is not charity, or anything of that sort, but it is something which will provide a fund into which a man the may pay small, sums by way of contribution which will insure him relief ancl assistance in his old age, and give that help to those who are dependent upon him which, unfortunately, they too often require. Sir "" WILLIAM LYNE - I do not think that upon the explanation the honourable member has given the committee can adopt the suggestion that has just been made, because it is altogether difierent to a proposal for life assurance. It may work well in South Australia, and may, as the honourable member says, have worked well for eleven years, but I should certainly want to make some further investigation before I woulcl be prepared to say anything in its favour. .What I particularly rose to say was, that a suggestion has been made to me by the honor which I am rather inclined to think is a good one. He has suggested that the clause should be amended to read tis follows :Subject to the provisions of this Act, every probationer, before the confirmation of his appointment, aud every officer shall effect with some life insurance company, registered and carrying on business in the Commonwealth, or otherwise as may be prescribed, an assurance on his life, providing for such benefits as may be prescribed, and for increasing from time to time the amount insured. That would be the whole of the clause, and we should leave out paragraphs (a), (/>), and (o).",21
58,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The Government would require to approve of the policy in that case.,21
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Yes . Eegulalations would have to be framed, and it may be necessary to introduce some slight amendment in clause 71, to provide for the case. There is doubtless some difficult} in 7 connection with paragraph (c) in reference to the point that was raised at the time of the previous debate. I have a communition from the actuary or the manager of the Australian Widows' Fund, in which he says The provision undersection (c), is that which requires most consideration, as it renders a life assurance society liable under certain conditions for a payment in excess of the amount hefd in reserve against its liability under a policy. From one point of view, it stipulates for a larger surrender value than a life assurance society would be able to pay; but, on the other hand, it may be regarded as an additional benefit, which eould be provided for by charging a somewhat liigher premium. - Mr Bruce SMITH - Thaf c means higher premiums.",21
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Tlii s is what it comes to. I do not think we wish that, if we can avoid it. I have also a similar communication from another company, as far as this paragraph (c) is concerned, and it seems to me, therefore, in view of the debate that has taken place, that it would be better to allow this matter to be thoroughly considered. I admit, as I have said before, that as far as the amendment that was proposed last night is concerned, it will be many years before any great number of the public servants will be affected. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - About 1,500. Sir AVILLI AM LYNE - The uumber Avas stated at about 1,500, but if we take the result of the working of the New Zealand system they have only had 290 policies issued under the compulsory clauses in the course of six years. . Mr Mahon - That must be a mistake.",22
61,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Is the gentleman sure it is compulsory 1,22
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Yes , I looked up the matter last night.",22
63,Mr BEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It must be compulsory only as regards a very few officers.,22
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"This would only affect the new servants as they come over from the States, and therefore it will be a long time before the operations become very large, under the suggestion that is made byfchehonorable member for Tasmania, Mr. Piesse. The scheme could be veiy much better carried out after a conference with actuaries, and ascertaining exactly what has been done in South Austraha. We could also get further information from other sources on the whole subject, and then by means of regulation decide as to what course we had better take. . I think that this ought to meet the views of those members who are so much opposed to ordinary life assurance, because, as I said last night, the Government are not opposed tofcheState taking the matter in hand, and this will give a further opportunity to the Government to consider it . If it did not look too serious a matter, the Government could undertake what is outlined in the new clause in the first instance, and they could arrange for a general life assurance system in the future.",22
65,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The amendment proposed does not limit assurance to approved societxes,22
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"No ; but I think that should be done. An attempt was.made to propose an amendment in that direction, but the clause had got beyond the point where such an amendment could come in. If , however, the committee will agree to the suggestion to amend the clause in the way I now propose, I will see that the other amendment is made in its proper place. Just a word or two in reference to clause 49. I think honourable members are somewhat mistaken with regard to that clause, because it has been referred to many times as a * clause under which the Government would have to provide for what has been called the derelicts. Honourable members, however, will find that this is a very small matter, and that a very small proportion of the officers would come under that clause.",22
67,Mr MAIION,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But the principle is the same.,22
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I will just honourable tell the honourable member what the principle means. It means that certain sums would be paid by those who could not be assured except with a loading of five years, and the State would undertake to pay that nioney back again within certain periods, with interest added. All that the State would lose would be the cost of dealing with and looking after that money. It would not amount to any great sum, and, therefore, I say that it is a very small matter indeed. In dealing with this clause, I obtained the information that, in order to make it pay the State, after the payment of five premiums, we could return only 2 i times the premiums. That is, we should be at a loss of 2£ times the premium in five years ; in ten years we would be at a loss of sixtenths j in twenty years at a loss of three-fourths, and in twenty-five years, four-fifths.",22
69,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I do not see the application. Sir AVILLI AM LYNE - That is we obtain from the individual a certam amount of mone\ , and guarantee that the whole of r that money is to be paid back, and we should lose the difference between that amount and the amount that we could afford to give to make it pay the Commonwealth, as an insurance office would make it pay. I admit that it is a very small matter, and I do not think it is one that any stress should be laid upon.",22
70,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,A man at 25 years if loaded might have to pay the rate for a man of 30.,23
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Yes , but I am not including the loading at all. Now we have had two nights' discussion on this particular question, and I think that those members who last night voted in favour of the State dealing with this matter should extend tlieir support to the present proposal, because it will give the Government time to prescribe what shall be the course of action taken, and will give an opportunity for the consideration of all the Arguments' used, and such information as can be obtained from actuaries and other sources.",23
72,Mr FE MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I am inclined to support the Minister for Home Affairs in the amendment proposed, but it appears to nie that in conferring upon the Government the power to provide for a system of assurance, and in prescribing the nature and the amount of the policies, the public servants must be to some extent protected, by limiting the proportion of their salaries that they will be compelled to pay in premiums.",23
73,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"That would be done under this proposal. If the honourable member looks at clause 71, paragraph (m), he will see .that regulations may be made prescribing the lowest .amount for which the lives of officers shall be assured, having regard to their annual salary.",23
74,Mr FE MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I only want to make certain of it. I think our experience has been that officers as a rule do not care to be burdened with the payment of premiums exceeding at any rate more than about 5 per cent, of their annual salaries, and I question whether all the benefitsthat are contemplated' by the provisions as they appeared in the original Bill could be secured for 5 per cent. However, provided that we have the assurance of the Attorney-General and the Secretary for Home Affairs that the public servants will be protected-against being called upon to pay an excessive portion of their salaries as premiums, I would be inclined to support the new clause that has been suggested. I prefer a system of compulsory life assurance to any system of superannuation such as that outlined by the honourable member for Laanecoorie, Mr. Salmon. It seems to me that all the States have found it impracticable to carry out their superannuation schemes.",23
75,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It is just the reverse in South Australia.,23
76,Mr FE MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But that refers to only one department.,23
77,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But it is to be extended to the whole service.,23
78,Mr FE MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I understand that the honourable member for Laanecoorie quoted the results achieved in one department, and saw that, owing to the success achieved there, it was proposed to extend it to the whole service. Mr SALMON. --Yes ; on the report of a Royal commission which inquired exhaustively into the whole system.",23
79,Mr FE MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I am bound to say that I do not see any special reasons why State servants should be required to adopt any other method of providing for their old age, or for the support of those depending on them after death, than that followed by other citizens of the Commonwealth. I think the Government has a perfect right, and is within its legitimate functions, in seeing that a reasonable provision is made against old age or death, and, so long as we insure that the provision made is the same as other good citizens are making for themselves, I tliink we are doing all that we are required to do.",23
80,Mr MAHON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,We do not compel private citizens to insure.,23
81,Mr FE MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But most of them insure of their own accord.,23
82,Mr MAHON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,And so might some of the public servants.,23
83,Mr FE MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"That is quite possible, but the Commonwealth is quite within its rights in requiring that all public servants shall do what the best and most prudent of our citizens do, thus preventing them from hereafter becoming claimants for Government assistance. But I am not prepared to go beyond a system of compulsory life assurance. I prefer that to any system of superannuation, and if we receive a guarantee from the Attorney General and the Minister in charge of the Bil l that the public servants shaU not he required to submit to excessive taxation in the way of premiums, I am inclined to vote for the amendment outlined by che Minister for Home Affairs. . Mr HUME COOK (Bourke) - Some of us are not quite clear as to the terms of the amendment which the Minister proposes to accept, and as to its exact meaning. As I understand the proposal of the honourable  paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), and to substitute for them a provision whioh will have the effect of. allowing the Government to take up the business of insuring its public servants, or, if it chose to prescribe certain assurance companies with which the public servants shall assure.",23
84,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,And certain forms of policy.,24
85,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Yes .,24
86,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Unde r the amendment the Government might even adopt a superannuation scheme.,24
87,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I am inclined to support that amendment, but I would suggest that the Government, at the same time, should accept the proposal which has been put forward by both the honourable member for Coolgardie and the honourable member for Bland, that only purely Australian and mutual assurance societies shall be prescribed.",24
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"That is what amendment means, and if after it has been carried it is seen not to have that meaning, I shall have the clause recommitted.",24
89,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E, I wish to know what the position of the public servant who has mortgaged his policy previously to entering the service of the Commonwealth will be. Is there any provision for assisting him to pay the extra premium? Under the Bill he would have to take out a second policy.,24
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Tlier e is nothing in the Bill which would allow the Government to advance money to an officer who had mortgaged his policy before entering the Commouwealth service.,24
91,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"But such a man would have two premiums to pay, and only a certain amount of salary to pay them with.",24
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The Government could not advance money to an officer to enable him to pay off the mortgage, nor could it increase his salary to enable him to do so. An officer entering the service would have to satisfy the Government that he was able to comply with the requirementa of the measure in regard to assurance.",24
93,Mr CRUICKSHA NK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," Dur ing the whole course of my public life, 1I have advocated that public officials should be paid salaries which would enable them to insure their lives and to make provision for their old age. Persons in private employ do not get larger salaries than public officials, and they are required to do this, because private employers cannot afford to pension their servants when they become unfitted for their duties. But although I am opposed to the giving of pensions, I shall support the proposed system of insurance, though I hope that a Bill will be introduced in which the whole question will be dealt with on sound and broad lines, and which will allow private individuals as well as the employees of the Commonwealth to participate in the benefits of a Government insurance system.",24
94,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I am sure that honourable members who are anxious that an opportunity should be afforded to try the experiment outlined in the. proposal of the honourable member for Bourke last evening will support the amendment, and that they will also support the suggestion that only purely Australian and mutual societies shall be prescribed. Aver y the large amount of money is now sent out of the Commonwealth to payfor life insurances, and in my opinion we should keep as much money here as we can.",24
95,Mr MAHON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," It is always a great pleasure for any one who sits on this side of the Chamber to be able to congratulate the Government, and I think that we are entitled to congratulate tliem upon having seen a virtue in the numbers that ranged themselves on these benches last evening. I think that the Minister has shown a wise discretion. I had intended to propose the addition to the clause of the following wordsBut such company or society shall be one of which the head office is within the Common-. wealth, and shall be conducted wholly on the mutual principle, and shall when required so to do permit the Minister to authorize an indepen-. dent valuation of its assets.",24
96,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,- I have given instructions this morning for' the preparation of a Bill dealing with all the companies.,24
97,Mr MAHON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"In that case I shall not move an amendment. But I would like to ask the Minister what provision he proposes to make for persons who leave the public service or who are dismissed, and arc compelled to surrender their policies.",24
98,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Such persons should be allowed to go on paying their premiums.,24
99,Mr MAHON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"But they may not be able to do so. At the present time, if a man who is insured surrenders his policy, he will not get back more than 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, of what he has paid in premiums; the actual amount depending upon the liberality of the company and the length of time during which he has been insured. According to the Australian Bamkwig and Insurance lteccrd, the total liabilities, under the head of life endowment and annuity funds, of the twelve Australian insurance companies last year was £30,100,000 odd, and of that amount nearly £500,000 represented surrendered policies. J. do not know whether the £500,000 was the face value of the surrendered policies or the amount which the cornpan ies repaid to those who surrendered ; but the figures indicate that in these tunes a large number of people find, themselves obliged to surrender thenpolicies, and that being so, 1 think we should make provision for the return of a largerproportion of the premiums where a policy has to be surrendered than is returned now.",24
100,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I think that could be provided for only by loading the premiums in the first instance:,25
101,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E, I wish to know if the Minister for Home Affairs is prepared to accept the suggestion that the companies approved of shall be purely mutual.,25
102,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,He said so.,25
103,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I do not think that we are justified in prescribing other than mutual offices, because we know that the operations of such offices are carried on solely with a view to the protection and benefit of their members, whereas, when a company is being managed to obtain profits for shareholders, there is a temptation to an over valuation of assets, and unsafe dealing, which does not exist where mutual societies are concerned. I would point out that in prescribing certain companies the Government will practically guarantee the payment of the amounts insured in the event of the failure of those companie.8, and it will be impossible for them without a very complete Act to make a thorough investigation of the - affairs of the various societies so as to - ascertain which of them are solvent and which are not. A - number of these institutions have only recently' come into existence, and are in a comparatively easy position because of their new business, but how long they will continue in that position it is difficult to foresee. I trust that the - committee will insist that only mutual societies shall be prescribed. Unless that is done I shall feel inclined to vote against the set of clauses providing for insurance, and allow the public servants to make provision for their futures as best they may. ' In any case they will have nothing to thank us for, if we require them to pay the premiums out of their salaries, and .unless we can give them absolute security 1 do not think we are justified in asking them to make these payments. I would ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether he cannot see his way to consent on behalf of the Government to a limitation of approved societies to those which are conducted on the mutual principle 1 Otherwise I shall feel inclined to vote against the whole set of clauses.",25
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I think the effect would be as the honourable member states, though it is really not stated in the Bill, that if the Government approve of a company as one in which officers can insure, the Government will be bound to' stand behind the officer. That would make the Government very cautious as to the insurance companies of which tliey approve. I am quite agreeable to the provision that the offices approved should be Australian offices, and I should feel inclined to agree with the proposal that they should be mutual offices. I should like, however, this latter point to remain over until the clause is recommitted. I do not kuow what companies there are, but if a proprietary company were very strong, and there were no danger, I really do not see any reason' why such a company should be excluded. I feel inclined, however, to agree to the proposal that the companies should be mutual companies, but I shall, be able to say definitely when the clause is dealt with on recommittal.",25
105,Mr BEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E, Does the Minister for Home Affairs say that he is in favour of the Government approving of mutual societies only'!,25
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"No . I said I felt that unless a company that was not absolutely a mutual company, was a very strong company, I should feel inclined to agree that it should be excluded. But I desire to refrain from giving an absolutely definite reply until the clause is recommitted.",25
107,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I quite agree with the honourable member who spoke before the Minister, that if we are going into any of these distinctions at all, the suggestion is a very good one. There is no doubt that the effect of being in a mutual society, if it be a sound society, is to assure to the person assured all the money which he is entitled to-aU the benefits ancl all the money. doubt these assurance companies have to frame a scale of charges which for a margin of safety. In a mutual society, sis we all know, the individual assured is given the benefit of that margin afterwards, in bonuses. It seems, therefore, a suggestion, worthy sideration. The proposals Governinent have seemed to accept, namely, that we should assure only in Australian societies, suggests to me the fact that it is our own fault that these large British and American companies are not societies. If our legislation were as it should be, we should attach to their operations in Australia conditions which would make theni Australian societies. In other words, we would require a proper deposit of tlieir funds in Australia, and we would have the right to inspect their books, which conditions would also be extendedto other Australian societies. I do not like to use the word "" foreign "" in respect of British societies for instance, because I suppose that would be obnoxious ©ven to a Victorian protectionist, and I will sjieak of them as "" outside "" societies. But I should like to say that we are all deUghted with the result of the division which was taken here last night. We now have discovered how to galvanize the Government into prompt action. ""We must just give them a majority of one, leaving them safe, while what we want is achieved. That is I should hope the ideal in the present Parliament. Government, as the result happened last night, evidently - no time in sleep, hut held a midnight Cabinet meeting, and suddenly agreed on a matter which was very much in doubt until that division. The Minister is prepared now to say that already this morning - what hour of the morning we do not know-the whole of this gigantic scheme was set going. That is a great encouragement to honourable members opposite, who occasionally come to this side on a division, because tliey will find they will sometimes do a great deal of good so long as they leave a safe margin, and insist on a majority of one. As in some of the parliamentaiy meetings we have lieard of, it has the effect of a grand declaration of independence without auy annoyirfg instability to our political institutions.",25
108,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The right honourable gentle- man is speaking from experience, I suppose. Mr Uriel.",26
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"He is speaking of No the party to which the honourable membei"" for Bland belongs. provide Mr Reid - I feel we should not intrude too much here on experience in New South Wales. But I hope the Government will as soon as possible take up the t matter of the insurance companies in Ausof con- tralia, in the sense of requiring those comwhich the panies who do business here with head offices elsewhere to safeguard their financial position here in a proper - business like way. ' The inspection which we should apply to those societies and the Austrahan conditions we should apply to them, we woulcl probably be willing to apply to our own societies. I think the books of all these bodies should be open to Government inspection at any moment, and that there should be thorough oversight and thorough inspection in the interests of the public. A great deal of confusion has arisen, ancl a great deal of time has probably been wasted over this clause, owing to the fact that the true object of the clause does not appear in the position in which it ought to appear. We have been talking about life assurance for a long time, but the object of the clause is not life assurance at all. The object of the clause is to make provision in the shape of an annuity, and I suppose nine-tenths of the observations which have been made are absolutely wide of the clause we are discussing. It is a very proper thing-in fact, it is inevitable-in life assurance that somebody should get some The money when the person assured dies. There of what is nothing novel in that feature of the spent clause ; but the real object is not found in sub-clause (a) but in sub-clause (&.) We desire that when officers attain an age at winch they must retire from the public service, and are suddenly deprived of an income of a regular and stable character, something should be done to give those persons cast adrift from the public service means of supporting themselves and their families in ' decency. That is the object of the provision - the payment of an annuity from the age at which the officer retires until the time when he dies. That object must be constantly kept in view. We do not at all save the public servants or the Government from the evils which we wish to avoid if we assure an officer with the result that when he dies his family are entitled to a certain amount, because he has to live decently after he leaves the service until he dies.",26
110,Mr MCCOLL,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,If c is an endowment assurance,27
111,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Wifc h an annuity.,27
112,Mr MCCOLL,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,W it h an annuity. The principle is that the assured may draw either at 60 years of age or at death.,27
113,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I am glad to hear the word "" endowment"" at last. It is Hke a flash of sunshine over a dreary waste. I hav.e heard nothing about ""endowment"" until now, though, I suppose, it may have been mentioned in a former debate. That is really the true object of all these clauses, although it is a word never, I think, used in connection with these debates, except of course by the honourable member for Echuca. Let us keep clearly in mind the object of these provisions. We know that in some of the States, when public officers arrive at the time when they should retire, they are kept in the service when they cease fco be useful rather than that they should be driven into the streets-to beggary. That is the state of things which has compelled some of the States to speud hundreds of thousands of pounds in abortive superannuation schemes. We shall find ourselves put to exactly the same trouble and expense with all these fancy schemes of assurance, unless provision be made for the support of the public officer and his family when he must retire. Take the case of a man who is sent out of the public service without an income, .but with an assurance policy Eor a certain amount payable at death. I suppose tliere will be a provision to the effect that the benefit under the policy shall not be liable to mortgage, otherwise this starving man would naturally have to mortgage the policy which ought to be a provision for his family at his death, in order to keep himself and his family alive, so that whsn death did come, the policy would be gone. The main object of the provision is clearly to keep the public servant and his family in a state of decency in the interval of old age between his retirement from the service and liis death. That object cannot be too clearly kept in view. At the same time, it means a much liigher premium, and I must say frankly that, unless - with very young oflieers, I do not see how any annuity which would be of a reasonable amount and calculated to keep a man and his family in decency, can be secured except with a very large premium. The provision about returning to a man all he has paid in if he ceases to be. a member of the public service - foi - that is introduced into the scheme as shown in the clause-woul d be an intolerable wrong to the great body of public servants. Not one in 50 would be in that ' position, but the insurance companies would load that 50 with much higher premiums, because of the risk of the whole 50, or one of them, or a large number of them, ceasing to be members of the service before the proper time and applying for the return with interest of what they had paid in.",27
114,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Mutua l companies do that now if the assured has been long enough in the society. The policy has a surrender value after a certain time.,27
115,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"We are familiar with the principle of surrender value, bufc I neverheard of a surrender like this-payin g a man back with interest everything he has . paid in. ",27
116,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,If a man pays for i the can get a policy of any kind.,27
117,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"That is what I am pointing out. It is a mere matter of money. AYith foreign societies, though not with Australian societies-in that case it is patriotism. . . If that be made a feature of the arrangement the charge will be much higher in order to provide for a casual event, an accidental event which would ha]?pen only once in a hundred cases. 1 feel sure that the Government, even at the risk of spend ing another sleepless night, will take this matter into consideration, so that' we shall have a thoroughly sound system. The salaries of public servants are not veiy high, and we do not want to load them in any injudicious way. I should like to have the benefit of the views of the hon who has taken such a deep and useful interest in this matter. Would it not tend to load the payment by the public servant, if the condition be attached that'when a man leaves the service all he has paid is returned to him with interest-that that mav happen to any man who is assured.  I shall not be able to follow my right honourable friend in admiration of the Uttle fairy tale ho told us in the earlier part of his remarks. It is hardly true that this plan was thought of only this morning, or that the Minister for Home Affairs made up his mind so suddenly;",27
118,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I forgot that the honourable member is an honorary member of the Cabinet. Mv. PIESSE - However , I will turn to the question which the right honourable member for East Sydney has done me the honour to submit to me. I believe he is quite correct in assuming that, in order to - secure the benefit of the return of all premiums, those who are the subject of insurance, namely, the j>ublic servants, would have to pay more. That is, I beheve, understood by every assurance society which has considered the subject. have to make an extra charge to all who are the subjects of the provision. Mr - Rv.iv - Would it not be very hard on the great bulk of the public servants 1  by the Government undertaking to make the payment for the public servants, or by the servants who have the benefit of the provision paying for it themselves.",27
119,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,If starts early it is a small matter.  in some cases that the amount returned equals the premiums paid.,28
120,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The assured gets it back in bonuses.  member for East Sydney has hardly quite correctly quoted the position. There is no mention of interest.,28
121,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"No .  the premiums, and, of course, that would make a very great difference. After a considerable number of years the capital may very well be returned, because the interest will have made up for the risk. I hope that this question will be settled in a way that will meet the views of those who advocate State life insurance. At the same time. I feel that State life insurance is hardly attainable within the tune in. which it is necessary that some provision shall be made. There will be civil servants appointed veiy shortly, ancl, unless the Government are ready with their scheme, those oflieers will not be able to have their lives assured immediately they enter the service. If we accept the proposal, with some slight modification, I think that the clause might be made to read as follows :Subject to the provisions of this Aot, every probationer, before the confirmation of his pointment, and every officer, shall effect assurance on his life, eitlier with some Australian mutual life assurance company, registered and property. carrying on business in the Commonwealth, or as may be prescribed. Thus there woulcl be an alternative presented. The Government can then insist upon an officer who is appointed before they are ready with their scheme, insuring his life with some company which is registered ancl carrying on business in the Commonwealth. They will thus be able to prescribe the benefits that are to be obtained either from the company in which such an officer is insured or under the scheme which They would they themselves promulgate.",28
122,Mr MCCOLL,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E, No public officer assures for death only if he is compelled to insure by the Government. All the pohcies which publio officers take out are endowment policies. The question of death does not enter into the matter at all.,28
123,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"T f a certain amount is payable at 60 years of age that is scarcely satisfactory as an annuity; because we know how a man money goes very often, and how it leaves the assured just as poor as ever.",28
124,Mr MCCOLL,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I do not think that the suggestion that public servants should be compelled to assure only in colonial mutual companies is wise at the present time. The Government should not put its imprimatur upon any company until it has made the strictest investigation into the affairs of that company. It might be found upon inquiiy that what are termed "" foreign companies "" are very much better for assurers than are some of the colonial mutual societies.",28
125,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,How can we investigate the affairs of foreign companies ?,28
126,Mr MCCOLL,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"In just the same way as we can investigate the affairs of others, if they are allowed to do business here. But, as a matter of fact, some of what are termed foreign assurance companies doing business in Victoria have to submit yearly to the most searching investigation by a Government actuary that is conducted in regard to any assurance company in the world. In the State of New York there is a superintendent of assurance, who has to value the assets of every company doing business in that State. He has to consider every mortgage, and every penny that is laid out on security of any kind has to be specially valued by him, and he tells us y i a public apdocument what is the value of the property an on which the money has been lent, and also the amount that has been lent upon that Tliat is the system of supervision that we require here. Until we get that system it will be very unwise for the Government to put its imprimatur upon any office, Australian or otherwise. Our first aim should be to secure a strict inquiry into all the offices, in order to ascertain whether we cannot have a system of Commonwealth assurance. I believe that such a system must come. It has been a great success in New Zealand, and it must in time come here. It is perhaps a little premature just now, and the discussion that we have been indulgmgin has been largely academic and doctrinaire. I wish to point oufc that there are mutual companies doing business here who are paying over 200 per cent, for their new business. They are joying two years' premiums in order to get one policy. Therefore, we ought to be extremely careful in what we do at the present time.",28
127,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," The suggestion made by the Minister for Home Affairs can be accepted by me, at any rate. feelfchafcinvestigation will only show him the manifest advantages of the system which I have endeavoured all too feebly and incoherently to lay before the committee. It s a system which has borne the strictest investigation, and one with which I am very much in favour. I feel sure that after investigation on the part of the Minister, that system will so commend itself to him that we shall soon find him bringing down to the House a Bill which will provide for its initiation in the Commonwealth. Clause ""agreed to. Clause 45Such assnrance shall be continued by the assured and not allowed to lapse, and the amount thereof shall be increased by the assured from time to time in proportion as nearly as practicable to his salary as may be prescribed.  This clause provides that the amount of the assurance may be increased from time to time. In order to protect the employee, who has to take out several different policies, I desire to move That the following words be added tofcheclause: ' - "" Such increased assurance may be effected with any approved company without regard to the original policy or policies."" It has been found that where a person who had insured with a certain company when young, afterwards had to go to the same company, he has been loaded much heavier than would have been the case had he been at liberty to assure with some other company. I think fchafc the words which I [125] have proposed will afford protection to the employees without in any way hampering the working of the Bill.",29
128,Mr SOLMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I would point out that this clause makes it mandatory that the increase shall take place. I have endeavoured to show the committee what the result of that system has been in Victoria. The result was that the burden which had to be borne by the members of the public service was too heavy for them. As'tlieir salaries increased, their ages also increased, and their effectiveness as members of mutual insurance societies had correspondingly decreased. They could not take out policies on anything like the same terms as those upon which their first policies were taken out. I ask the Minister if it is intended to penalize the members of the public service for every promotion which they receive 1 So soon as they are promoted from one class to another they will, under this provision, find that a further demand is made upon them in the way of an assurance premium. Those who are better able to discuss this matter than myself, by reason of tlieir further personal experience, will bear me out that the time will naturally arrive when men will find it impossible to effect assurances on the highest scale at their increased ages. Under the circumstances, we are asking the public servants to do sometliing which they are incapable of doing, and the result will be that which has been so often outlined, viz., that the State will be compelled to take up this matter. I hope that the Minister will allow the clause to be struck out altogether. Under the amendment made in the previous clause he will have full power to deal with this matter, aud I think it is better to leave it in his hands until a full and comprehensive scheme is brought down to the House.",29
129,Mr A MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I think the difficulty can be got over to some extent if the amount of the assurance according to salary were prescribed in the first instance so as to give the person who assured for the first time the option of assuring for the higher amount. An y prudent jnan, if he could pay the premiums,- would adopt the course rather than trust to being able to assure when he was much older.",29
130,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,There would always be an option of that sort.,29
131,Mr A MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"It appears to be man datory that he should increase"" the amount from time to time, irrespective of what the first amount may be. If an officer assured for an amount proportionate to the larger salary in the first instance, he ought not to be required to increase the amount as he grows older.",29
132,Mr MCCOLL,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The rule is that a man must insure for the maximum salary of his class.,30
133,Mr A MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But he might go into another class. He might assure for maximum of the next class.,30
134,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E, I wish to ask the Minister if it is intended that this life assurance shall apply to the general division as well as to the clerical division ?,30
135,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Yes .,30
136,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"May I direct the honourable gentleman's, attention to one particular point. In clause 44 there is no provision as to the amount of assurance, and, as far as I can see, the provision for prescribing the amount is in clause 71.",30
137,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I said just now that if my suggestion with regard to clause 44 is carried out, clause 71 will have to be amended to meet it .",30
138,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,In what way ?,30
139,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Because it does not give sufficient power in the making of regulations.,30
140,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"But it appears to Tae confined to the clerical officers, because clause 71 says that the regulations shall, prescribe the lowest amount for which the lives of officers shall, having regard to their annual salary, be assured. That provision will not cover wages. I think that the Minister ought to be very caref ul that the words used shall cover the general division as well as the clerical division of the public service.",30
141,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I wish to point out to the honourable meinber for  amendment assumes a great many things that have not yet been determined. Eor example: he uses the words ""approved companies."" Clause 44 does not suggest that there shall be approved companies, and indeed I think it would be unwise to say that companies should be approved.  word "" approved.""",30
142,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"But for what the honourable member for South Austraha said, I should not have thought that these clauses implied that the increased assurance must be effected in the company in which the original assurance was effected. I think that the clause carries no such implication, and that the danger which he apprehends is purely an imaginary one. There is no fear of the Government falling into the error of compelling a man to increase his assurance in the same company when everybody knows that by doing so the assured might be placed in a very unfair position. ",30
143,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"As it is drawn the amendment might do a great deal of harm. I might take exception to other words. in the proposed amendment, but I do not wish to do so. There is no use in providing for protection against danger in a clause where danger does not exist. Sir, WILLIAM LYNE - I would ask the honourable member to withdraw the amendment, because under the clause as it will be framed when recommitted there will be power to give effect to exactly what he wishes ; and as far as l a m concerned I will take care that that is done. It would be very unfair to compel a man to go to the company in which he originally assured in order to increase the amount of his life assurance policy, because the company might try to load him beyond the extent to which he should be loaded, and he might be able to go to another assurance company and get his j>olicy increased at an easier rate.",30
144,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Supposin g he could get the additional assurance at a cheaper rate from an equally sound company that does not happen to he an Australian company ' Sir . WILLIAM LYNE - I will make a statement regarding that on clause 44. - Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",30
145,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I invite the Minister in charge of the Bill to say whether he considers we are justified in passing a clause which will be mandatorywhich will not be optional-unde r which a member of the public service, in order to retain his position, will be absolutely compelled to effect a further assurance on his life when he gets an increase of salary. I do not for one m<jment doubt the advisableness of the course in so far as it will help a man to meet the responsibilities which he will encounter after he leaves the service; but that is not the question so much as the ability of the man himself to comply with the requirements of the clause. I contend that it will be found impossible--and the Minister knows well enough that it will be found impossible-in some eases for a man to effect any further assurance on his life. I have already referred to the breakdown that occurred under the Victorian system, which had to be altered some eight or nine years ago. That was a system of increased assurances with every addition to salary, but it was found impossible to cany it into effect, and it had to be abolished. Now the system is just as bad, because it requires an assurance equal to the amount of salary which a man receives on his first appointment to the service. If members of the Commonwealth service are to be burdened with such conditions as these, they will prefer to be out of the service altogether. I really think that Ministers have not sufficiently considered the matter.",30
146,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The words ""as prescribed"" are sufficient-that is the safety valve.",31
147,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But that is only the proportion which may be prescribed.,31
148,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"It is not only the proportion, but also relates to the increases.",31
149,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Of course, I take the Attorney-General's opinion as to the meaning of the clause; but certainly it did not appeal to nie in that way. I should be very sony indeed to see the committee fix conditions in a Bil l like this, which would be found impracticable, and which it has been found impracticable to carry iuto effect in Victoria.",31
150,Sir WILLIAMMCMILL AN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," Surely the principle witli which we start any assurance at all must be carried out as a man's salary increases, and if the additional assurance is fixed in an absolutely fair proportion, there is no more reason to cavil at it tlian at the assurance itself at the outset. The increases must be in keeping with the jjrinciple of assurance that may be adopted in the first instance, whether it be under a system of State assurance or of assurance with outside offices. The point is that a man on his retiring from the service should have an amount provided for him, equivalent to the salary attached to the position which he occupied in the service. Because, after all, in some positions £ 1 0 0 a year would lie nothing to a man who had been accustomed to certain luxuries. It seems to me to be perfectly fair, under any circumstances, now that we have decided to await further developments from the Government's consideration of this matter, that we should pass these clauses as they are.",31
151,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I do not see how the hardship comes in in the way the honourable and learned member for Laanecoorie would persuade us that it does. Where a man has £ 1 0 0 a year, and £ 1 0 is deducted from his salary for life assurance, he is more hardly dealt with than is the man who has £200 a year, and who has to pay £ 2 0 out of it for hfe assurance.",31
152,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,How do we know that a man would get the extra assurance for an additional £10 ; it might cost him £301,31
153,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Eve n if the contention of the honourable and learned member be correct, the hardship would not be very great. If the principle of life assurance is may lie sound-and we have agreed that it is-the officers ought to add to their assurances as their salaries increase. Clause agreed to. Postponed clause 4:6-(Polic y not assignable, and to be exempt froin insolvency laws, ite).

Under the Bill as it stood before, there no other course but to get rid of him ; this new clause will give power to have him put in the general division in - the position my name :which, perhaps, he ought to have been in from the very first.",31
159,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I should hke to have an fully understanding, about that. Is it intended that the officer should retain his salary ?",32

167,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I presume that an the amendment which has just been moved intended by the Government as a fulfilbe ment of the promise that they would consider an amendment which I - moved the was other day upon clause 18, and which, as but amended, to meet the wishes of the Government, .now stands upon the notice-paper in No male person who has served for seven years in the general division, and whose services are employed therein, shall be paid a lower salary than £110 per annum. The proposed new clause, however, does not the desire of the committee, because it a gives too much power to the Governor General in regard to ' the granting of this salary. A very different provision was' inserted in clause 21 in regard to members of the clerical division, sub-clause (6) of which Every officer shall be entitled on reaching the age of 21 years to a salary of £110 per annum. Sii' WILLIAM LYNE - Does the honourable and learned member wish to provide that a - - man either must get £ 1 1 0 a year or be, I underhunted out of the service ? Mr CROUCH.'- I wish to insist that the Government of the Commonwealth shall to pay a fair wage for a fair amount of work, the inasmuch as some of the State Governments require outside employers to do so. In my a reopinion the amendment which I have proposed is the least which the committee",32
168,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"South Australia) I am surprised that the Government have paid not brought forward a more liberal proposal. had an idea 'that they were in favour of fixing a minimum wage at least as high as arguing that now in force in New South Wales and in most of the other States.' But, under this proposed new clause, a man who may have entered the service at the age of twenty to or thirty years must remain in it for seven to years before he is entitled to the minimum one division wage of £ 1 1 0 a year.",32
169,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"That is not so. The intention of the proposed new clause is that no who has served seven years shall receive less than £ 1 1 0 per year unless through be his own fault. It has been pointed out by a of honourable members that there general may be a number of men who, through no fault of their own, may not have a chance of earning more than £ S 0 or £ 9 0 per year, and it was contended that a minimum wage should be fixed to provide for such cases. The proposed new clause provides that no one who has been a certain length of time in the service shall receive less than-£110 per year.",32
170,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"T n the clerical division every officer who has been in the service for three years wil l be entitled to a salary of £ 1 1 0 per year upon reaching the age of 2.1 years, but with regard to the general division the Government provide that an officer must be seven years in the service before he can obtain that salary, and there is no limitation of age to 21 years. I understand that the principle underlying the idea of a minimum wage is that if you employ an adult you must not pay him less than a living wage, which in this case is fixed, at 7s. per clay. If three years is long enough for an officer of the clerical division to serve to become entitled to £ 1 1 0 per year., no person in the general division should be compelled to serve seven years. What was intended by the committee was that no public servant whohad reached the age of 21 years, and had been any length of time in the public service, should receive less than £ 1 10 per annum, and that being so, the proposed new clause will not meet the views of honourable members.",33
171,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," The proposed new clause does not seem to get us anyf urfcher ahead, because the Bill already provides that the Governor General, on the recommendation of the commissioner, may increase a man's salary whether he has or has not been seven years in the service. But, as I understood the desire of the committee, it was that there should beno question of "" may,"" but that it should be absolutely imperative that eveiy adult person in the service should receive at least 7s. a day.

They are disgraceful.",33
172,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I wouldsuggest that, instead of accepting the proposed new clause, we should repeat in regard to the general division the provision which we have passed in regard to the clerical division.",33
173,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The members of theclerical division must subject themselves toexamination, to prove their fitness for their positions.",33
174,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The very fact that a man is continued in his position must be taken to show that he is doing his work properly, and if a man is 21 years of age,, and has heen in the service for three years, he should not receive less than 7s. a day.

176,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Certainly; I think that that should be one of the governing features of the measure. We do not want the public servicefcobecome an asylum forincompetents.,33

178,Mr WATSCN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I am Sure the great majority of the public servants would nob thank us for encouraging that idea-. We should insure that a man shall be decently paid for the work he does, and if he is not fit for his work he should go. I trust that the Minister will see the wisdom of providing that as soon as a man who has been a reasonable length of time in the service reaches the age of 21 years he shall bepaid the minimumwage. Siu WILLIAM LYNE - The position of the-men in the general division is-somewhat different from that of the men who comeunder clause 21. The officers of the clerical division have to establish their qualifications by passing examinations.",33
179,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But we cannot examinefche men in the general division upon thekind of work they do.,33
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Quite so, and therefore the circumstances are different. If we provide that a man who has been three years in the service shall receive £ 1 1 0 a year, men who are under the age of 21 years, ancl who enteredi t at the age of sixteen, will be entitled to that wage.",33

As better originally framed, the proposal readThe Governor General may direct that an officer in the general division, who shall have served for the seven years, shall be paid a salary of £110 per annum, provided that the commissioner shall recommend on the ground of good conduct and that such officer receives such salary. As there worded, it was practically a maximum salary provision. It was practically fixing a standard in this unfortunate general division in which there are none of the annual increments that attach to the clerical division. In connection with the in the public service of Australia, we "" or have a most ingeniously devised scale of constant increases of salary until a certain it maximum is reached. That is a provision in of this Bill carefully classified and thought year. out by the Federal Ministers.

Here is a deliberate proposal that the able-bodied men in the federal service of Australia-me n perhaps 30 or 40 years old-shoul d serve a period of seven years, rather a scriptural sort of period it sounds like, of good, faithful, and effective service before they can look forward to what is the wages of the unemployed of New South Wales today.

I can assure the honourable member that, whilst the great bulk of the unemployed no doubt give a fair and honest day's work for all they get, it is well known that there is a considerable fringe of worthless persons who hang on - to the genuine and honest unemployed, and simply make a farce of the work from one week's end to the other. These casual unemployed labourers get seven shillings a day, and here is a proposal that the labourers of the Commonwealth after seven years' faithful service, shall be able to look forward to the same magnificent return. Is the Cabinet a mere clerk who comes to the table every afternoon to be v instructed by any member who likes to get up ancl say a few words ? Can we have anything like wise legislation if the policy of a clause or of an A ct is changed every moment by every conceivable influence which causes an amendment to be interjected? Is that the way in which legislation is to be conducted ? I have passed by, as honourable members have passed by, a number of instances of this kind. This is a matter which one would think had been fully thought out. But here is a proposal which has only to be mentioned to be scouted. You do not need to pose as a Collingwood democrat to scout a proposal of this sort. Any man, whatever his position in politics, would look - on a wage of 7s. per day in the federal empl03'ment as a fair minimum wage. While I cannot express the feeling I have as to the mischief which is clone to the community by giving higher wages to unemployed persons than are paid to persons in the ordinary steady employments of the countiy-wage s which come out of the pockets of those unfortunate employed working men-whil e I cannot speak too strong!}' against a suicidal policy of that sort, which tends to make the ranks of the unemployed a popular resort for the genuine labourers of the countiy, there is a wider distinction to be drawn between questions of that sort and the standard which is set up for the persons employed in the Commonwealth of Australia. I do not suppose I raise questions as to politics when I say that I do not suppose tliere is a man in Australia, even the rankest conservative, who woulcl contend that 7s. a clay is too high a minimum wage for an able-bodied man in the service of the Commonwealth. It is right the Commonwealth should set up a high standard-it is right the Commonwealth should be the best employer, because the Commonwealth want to have the best services and the best men.",35
199,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,We have been saying that.,35
200,Mr BEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,What does the honourable member say to the proposition of the Government ?,35
201,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,We have already said what we have to say. The honourable member for East Sydney is too late.,35
202,Mr BEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I have not risen now. to deal wibh this particular matter, nor did I rise to make any sort of political capital out of it . Honourable members will recognise my proper position in this Chamber, and will admit that 1I have just as important a duty to discharge sitting on this side of the table, in the working of the Constitution, as the Ministers, with their private secretaries, have to discharge. I hope honourable members will recollect that. In the performance of my duty as a censor ancl critic of the actions of this Ministry, it is time. I pointed out that, after the most ample opportunities for thinking this matter out, the Government have come down- I am sure they have shown a most ter, complaisant and liberal desire in every way - and asked the House to accept supporter a monstrous proposition of this sort. Wliile a boy who has just attained the age of 21, and who drives a quill pen, is to get 7s. day, a man in the general division of service has to serve seven years before the same remuneration. This is a monstrous piece of inequality deliberately thought by the Ministry. Are we to understand, the Ministry simply fly kites here in the of amendments to attract the notice of bers in order to have members put the amendments right ? Is that the function assurance of Ministers ? Is that not exactly the state of tilings we are reduced to ? moment this monstrous proposition was understood by honourable members the demoi cratic influence behind the Ministry volleyed and thundered, and the democratic influence too, perhaps. in front volleyed and thundered, and nothmischief ing was left of the gallant 600. We find two Ministers tiunbling over one another at the table in order to effect a transthe formation scene-in order to. bring the amendment into some sort of harmony with the structure of the Bill. I want to and I hope the Minister for Home Affairs will enlighten me-o r if he does not feel equal to it , perhaps liis learned and gifted colleague will do so-ho w it is that, with reference to the clerical division, this has been so carefully thought out in all gradations, wliile in referenceto the bulk of the working men under the Federal Government this proposal was thought enough.",35
203,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"It was exactly the same in connection with the clerical division, the honourable and learned member was here.",36
204,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Was it ? I can accept the authority of the honourable member. I understand tliere was an equal fiasco in that ?,36
205,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,No fiasco.,36
206,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,That is what the honourable member means.,36
207,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,No .,36
208,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Because if a similar state of things occurred with reference to the clerical division, does it improve the position of the Government to say that the Government are always doing it 1 It is a wonderterra f u l piece of political justification when has to criticise a Government for want of thought in a most important mataffecting the interests of several thousands of persons, and when a Government thinks it a sufficient reply to say that the Government have been doing the same all the time; If they have been doing a the same all the time, the honourable member o the has incurred a grave responsibility. he gets When they tried this on the honourable member, it was found too much. opt But I wish to call the attention, not only that of this House, but of the whole public of shape Australia, to the way in which these memmatters are being dealt with.

214,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Wlios e fault was it that it took so long?,37
215,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Well , I have not been here. It is of no use abusing me for taking up time in one breath, and abusing me for not being here in another. Idnisterial. supporters must not give way to logic of that sort. But if this were a mere trifle there woulcl be an excuse for it Why, this Bill which I have before mo is full of black-letter provisions with reference to one class of the service. Tliere the clauses are, most carefully reconstructed. The original proposal of the Government has got into another form. Most careful provisions have been inserted, and at the end of the Bil l this clause is t-lirown at the committee in such a form that Ministers have had abandon it without the slightest delay. The Attorney-General- a gentleman whom we all respect as a very good political navigator-trie d to stem the tide witli some ejaculation about ""Oh, these gentlemen have to undergo an examination."" That is a position which the honourable and learned gentleman suddenly dropped; because, what a farce it is to try and discriminate between two classes of men in the Commonwealth, by saying that one class passes some examination as to where a certain island is in the German Ocean, or as to how one would pasrse a certain sentence. Because something of that sort is clone, is it to be suggested that that makes the most marvellous difference, and that the matter therefore requires the most careful consideration 1 The Attorney-General puts that forward as a reason for compelling, men in the general division to serve seven years in order to get £ 1 1 0, and then as a certificate of extraordinary merit on the part of others, he ejaculates "" Oh, but there is an examination !"" He has given that position away uow. He abandons this feeble little attempt to keep alive that utterly hollow distinction between one class of the service and another-betwee n the clerical and manual division - ancl after abandoning that utterly ridiculous attempt we find Ministers within five minutes turning the proposal absolutely inside out. If honourable members do not understand the difference between a man having to serve seven years in order to get £ 1 1 0 per annum,, ancl having to serve three years in order to get it, I think .that the men themselves do. I think that the time has come when Ministers [3 JULV, 1901.], BUL 19 it should carefully think out matters of this sort before submitting them for the consideration of this House. May I suggest, too, that if honourable members oppositewho have been doing all tliey can to help Even the Ministry-coul d only spare a little time to consult with the Government before these measures are introduced,, it really would result in valuable saving of the public time. The less carefully a Bil l is drafted the more time will necessarily be required to consider it. Whilst we are taking up time on this Bill",37
216,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Hear , hear.",37
217,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Yes, whilst honourable members opposite have been droning but tlieir opinions about life assurance they were perfectly happy. They thought that au to astonished world was listening to them. x But now that another honourable member, who has not spoken for a month,, and who, I may say, possibly represents a larger number of members than the individual members to whom I refer",37
218,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,That is a little bit low.,37
219,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I do not think it is, because it is a little bit low to endeavour to interfere with a man in my position when he is discharging his duty. That is mv idea of the matter. Of course, some honourable members would like to go on in this quiet state of mutual admiration, but that is not the condition that should characterize any Parliament which is properly conducted. I have given way to it t ill I reached this",37
220,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The honourable and learned member could not stand it any longer. Mr Reid.;- I do not wish to engage in a conversation with the honourable member, because that is a misfortune which I am not compelled to undergo, but T do beg the Government, in the interests of the public time,, to think these things out more carefully before they submit them to this. Chamber. .Time will be saved by the few minutes which I have occupied this, afternoon. And now that the matter has been put to the Minister for Home AfTairs, I would ask him if he can give a single reason why he submitted this proposal ? It will be more satisfactory to the House and to the country if the honourable gentleman will begood enough to reply to this one question, witli which I conclude my remarks, ""Can the Minister give one single valid reason which will appeal to any intelligent memberwhy this proposal was put before this Sir WILLIAM "" LYNE (Hume-Minister schedule for Home Affairs) - The right honourable and learned member has had his little say, and blown off steam a little bit. I am not at all surprised, knowing him as I do of old. I knew by his maimer yesterday that something of this sort was coming. The honourable and learned member has made an attack on the Government. He is the gentleman who, as Premier of New South Wales, paid the workingmen wages as low as os. I raised that amount to 7s. a day, a of things which he was afraid to bring about, and l a m not likely here or anywhere else to attempt to bring the wages of the labouring man of the Commonwealth ""down to 5s. per clay. If the right honourable and learned member had been in his place, and had known what led up to this position, he woulcl know perfectly well that the principle was acquiesced in by the Government. I have had a great deal on my hands whilst the Bill has been under consideration, ancl have not been able carefully to analyze every amendment or new clause submitted to me. This new clause was prepared hurriedly, ancl the object of the draftsman was no doubt to deal with cases where boys came in at thirteen or fourteen 3 ears of age. We had no time to print these amendments, or I should have submitted them in printed form. I received them just as the House met. and did not have an opportunity of going through them in order to ascertain whether their wording carried out the intention of the Government. The moment that I saw this proposal did not carry out that intention I accepted the condition and agreed to the amendment.",37
221,Mr MAUCJBH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,They are very sorry that the honourable gentleman did.,38
222,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Possibl y they are. I agreed the other night that the minimum wage to be paid should be 7s. per day or £110 per year, and the Government are not going back on that promise. But the draftsman thoaght that the Bill had to be safeguarded in the case of boys, and thus the trouble arose. The right honourable and learned member for East Sydney twits honourable members witli gemg before their constituents and talking about a minimum wage, whilst sneering at the matter when they come to deal with it in Parliament, behind the backs of the electors. That is a nice thing to say in a committee of this kind. The right honourable and learned member then turns to the scale in the at the end of the Bill. If he had been here earlier he would have known that tliere was an amendment submitted which obviates the necessity for altering that schedule. It can be altered in certain cases by the Governor General on the reright commendation of the commissioner, but it was not thought wise to put that into the schedule, and therefore his remarks have no point. I should not be one in the a day. future, any more than I have been in condition the past, to ask men to do work such as was done under the right honourable and learned member's Government in Nesv South AVales at 5s. and 6s. per day. That work was not done by the general unemployed, but by men who had irregular work created for them. Honourable members will very soon know how much weight to attach to the right honourable and learned member's remarks when he assumes a virtuous and indignant manner. He has twitted me with accepting the recommendations from the committee. AVhat is a Bil l submitted to a committee for? It is not to be supposed that a Minister or Government can provide for everything that is to be seen r afterwards in intricate measures of this kind-on e of the most important and intricate Bills that could be submitted to Parliament. As long as the committee do not interfere with the main principles of the Bil l I am only too glad to accept suggestions which may improve it. If I refused to do so, I might just as well not submit it . The right honourable and learned member has said that the Government should have this Bill in a better and more complete form than that in which it appears at this particular stage. But be forgets that he submitted a B i ll dealing witli the public service of New South Wales which was riddled from beginning to end witli amendments, ten times more so than this Bill has been.",38
223,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"And deahng with only one State. Sir AA ILLIAM LYNE - Yes ; although r there are a great many amendments in the Bill, there are only half-a-dozen or so of any importance. The others are merely consequential, yet the right honourable ancl learned member takes up the Bill ancl flutters it as if the black type showed important amendments. He knows very well that it is not so. It is only a little way that he has. I do not think the Bil l has been so very seriously altered from the main principles that were brought clown for the committee to consider. I say again that I do not wish to be speaking to the gallery here, ancl I do not wish at this early stage of the Commonwealth to commence speaking to the public outside-whe n there is no occasion for auy such thing-as we heard the right honourable gentleman .doing a few minutes ago. I wish to deal with legislation seriously, and to ask the committee to assist us in improving it in every possible way. If that is done it musfc be in the best interests of tliose whom it is going to affectin this case a very large section of the public servants, aud when I refuse fco consider ordinary and useful recommendations by the committee-man y members of which have, perhaps, had more intimate dealings with this question in all its intricacies than I have had- I shall not be fit for the position which 1 occupy at the present time. I hope that we shall not again see an exhibition such as we have had from the honourable member opposite to-night, as I think we should allow all such matters to remain in abeyance ancl deal with legislation in a common-sense business-like way.",38
224,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I should like to make one observation in reference to a statement b} the honourable Minister for Home Affairs. I nes'er hold him seriously responsible for any statement about facts, but there is one statement the honourable member made in his excitement which I must correct. The honourable member has stated that when I was at the head of the Government of New South Wales I paid 5s. a day wages for labour under the Government.",39
225,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,So the right honourable member did-for painting the railings.,39
226,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The statement is untrue.,39
227,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It is perfectly true.,39
228,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The statement is absolutely untrue, and I am sure if the honourable member knew the facts Honorable MEMBERS Order, order!",39
229,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I am sure the right honourable and learned member will see that he has infringed the standing orders in making a statement that the Minister has told an untruth.,39
230,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"It is the interruption, Mr Chairman, that has made you take that view. I was going on to say that if the honourable gentleman had any knowledge of the facts he would think differently, when I was interrupted by honourable members on the other side, who seem so ready to surround the Minister, as if he could not take care of himself",39
231,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I beg to draw your attention, Mr Chairman, to the fact that the right honourable gentleman has not withdrawn what you declared to be a disorderly remark.",39
232,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"If the honourable member for Corio will allow me, I will go on. I may say that I was interrupted by disorder, in the middle of a sentence, and that it was made to appear, not designedly, that I was making a disorderly remark. I was not allowed to finish the sentence. I was ""about to say that if the honourable member had a knowledge of the facts-and surely it cannot be said that there is anything offensive in that remark-the honourable member cannot be personally aware of the multitude of facts regarding which he makes statements, and the last thing I would impute to the Minister, or to any member of the House, would be the ability to make a statement knowing it to be untrue. What I desire to say is thatthestatementis untrue, not that the honourable member is untruthful; the honourable member has been true to himself in every r respect. The statement is untrue, and it is mischievouslyuntrue. Ibis a piece of political electioneering, which might have been left in the State where it has served its turn. The fact is that in all my administration of the publie affairs of New South Wales I have laid down the principle that Government servants of all ranks should receive the highest and the best wages; but, rather than leave a number of embarrassed and poverty-stricken persons without anything to do- I refer to the time alluded to by the honourable member- I provided work for them. At one Christmas time- I think it was then-ther e were two or three or four hundred old men, who were incapable of doing any hard manual work, ancl, in Chair, chair ! order to put a few pounds into their pockets, I gave them employment which left them probably 5s. a day. I say it was much more courageous to give these men some work they could do, at the rate of 5s. per day, than to have paid them a higher rate. 1 could easily have given them 7s. a day. A blackfellow could do that if he were in power. I could easily have given them 10s. per day, but I knew my duty to the country better. I did not wish to make the ranks of the unemployed move attractive than steady employment, but that is what the honourable Minister done, and he has left behind him a legacy of disaster, which will probably be acknowledged today when the results of the polling in New South Wales are known. I say we should always, in this Commonwealth, draw a line between steady and fixed employment under the Government and methods of relieving casual distress. I did so in New South Wales, and I am sure that honourable members will do so here. Now, in reference to the remarks of the honourable meinber that no main principle of this Bill has been altered, I would say that tliere is not a member of this Chaniber who does not know that that statement is another mistake. The honourable member has fallen into another mistake, because this Bill, as it was introduced in committee, was radically and in its principles a different Bil l from what this committee has made it. In that vital point as to the true centre of authority in the service, the Bill, as it came to this Chamber, provided, for three possible conflicting authorities-the head of the department, the commissioner, and the Governor General, which really means the Ministry. That was the vital basis of this Bill as it was brought down to this Chamber.",39
233,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Fa r from it .,40
234,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I admit I . must be wrong i jhe honourable member says that.,40
235,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I am glad the honourable gentleman feels that.,40
236,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I should like to say that I have had the ad vantage of lookmg at the alterations made in the Bill, and although I lack the confidence of the honourable member for Corinella- I amnot offended at the honourable member's confidence at all, because it is perfectly characteristic-so far as I can observe the alterations in the Bill, I consider that a very radical change has been made, and a wise change- a change that will be invaluable in working this measure-and that is that the commissioner has been placed, witli reference to the head of the department, in a vastly different position from that which he would haA'e occupied under the Bill as it originally stood. I think this is a vast improvement in the Bill. As I said before, I do not at all complain of the Government listening to any amendments - I do not complain of their ready desire to listen to amendments, and to accept all those that are useful; bufc what I do complain of is that tliere have been a multitude of matters, some of them perhas haps matters of detail which ought to haA'e been foreseen, and which, if they had been foreseen-, Would haA'e saved a great deal of discussion. That was the criticism I A'eivtured to make.",40
237,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I must confess-Avhethe r it be clue to my eyes alone, or my eyes Will my imagination addedthat I have seen a great cleal of difference in the mode of conducting the business i u this Chamber during the present Aveek as compared Will previous Aveeks.",40
238,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Hear , hear. I should think so.",40
239,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,And the right honourable gentleman is responsible for it .,40
240,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I hope so.,40
241,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The right honourable gentleman congratulates himself upon it , and no doubt from his point of vieAv it is a matter for congratulation, but from my point of A^eAv, ancl from the point of A'ieAv of the public, it is far from being a subject for congratulation. When the Ministry brought doAvn this Bill they told the House frankly that it Avas not a party measure, and that they looked to both sides of the House to assist them inmaking it perfect. The acting leader 6f the Opposition, adopting the sameview, said that as far as he was conf cerned, and he believed as far as the Opposition was concerned,, it Would be regarded as a non-party measure. Mv. REID - Hear , hear.",40
242,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The Ministry further stated that suggestions coming from any part of the HouseAvould be Avelcomed, and AA'ould be giA'en due weight and consideration, and'ever since the Bill has been in committee until yesterday Ave had no speeches that bore a j?arty complexion. Since then, hoAvever, Ave haA'e had continual reminders from the right honourable meinber for East Sydney, Avho has toldus half-a-dozen times that he Avas sitting on that side of the table instead of on this side. We all know that it Avas a most deplorable mistake on the part of the CommonAvealth that the right honourable member should be on that side of the House instead of this, and we are all still at a loss to understand why such a disaster should have been permitted. Further, Ave are not altogether Avithout hope that some of the consequences of that disaster may be averted, and that the Commonwealth will still be able to survive that inevitable shipwreck, which to the keen eye of the pilot on the other side, seems impending. We hope the chance may arise which will put the helm of State in the right hand, and we cannot accuse the right honourable member of losing any chance of seeing that the right is done and the wrong is remedied. He has done his best to bring this matter, which was beyond the realm of party politics, within that realm, which is the very worse place it could be in. I rise, not to pursue the work the right honourable membei' has been doing, but because I think that in the interests of the public service of this Commonwealth and of the Commonwealth itself, the sooner we learn whether the right honourable leader of the Opposition is going to allow measures to come into this House as non-party measures, the better it will be for the Parliament and every one else concerned. If the honourable member persists in the attitude he has adopted during the last day or two it will be distinctly against the interests of the whole community.",40
243,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Why last night I was as able as I could be.,41
244,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"A man may be perfectly amiable and still be pursuing his own objects as well as by being irate or excited. That is understood, and the honourable member's amiability of manner is no guide as to the amiability of his intentions. I say that the right honourable member has half-a-dozen times, in connection with proposed amendments and remarks he has made, drawn attention, not to the faults of the Bill, not to the thing which ought to be done in the interests of the Commonwealth, but to the faults of the Government and to the bad way in which they are doing their work. We are not so much concerned witli the merits or - demerits of the drafting of the Bill as with the merits or demerits of the Bill as it may leave the committee, and I think the honourable member even without reflection will realise that. We all know that there is a certain game that some honourable members play-that there are two parties, the ins and the outs, - and that the outs are always trying to secure the places of the ins. That is an aspect of politics which was well known in New South Wales whilst it was a colony, before it became a State, as well as now, and it is an aspect of-politics that the right honourable member for East Sydney is perfectly well acquainted witli, because we have heard from him continual resurrections of the dead bones of past politics in New South Wales. This Parliament has heard as much of New South Wales politics during the last month - I admit that it was the same even while the right honourable member was away - as it has heard of Commonwealth politics. I believe that it will be as injurious to the interests of the community for honourable members of the Opposition to draw inferences as to the willingness of the Government whenever an amendment is suggested to them to accept it, as it will be for honourable members on this side of the Chamber to allow their allegiance to the Government to blind them to the demerits of the measure. I believe that the leader of the Opposition has on halfa-dozen occasions during the last few days made remarks about the Government which, whether true or false, were not in the least degree calculated to produce good legislation. But I trust that in the future we shall deal with the measure in the business like manner in which it was originally. proposed that we should deal with it, and ami- that we shall not have cause to feel, whenever an effort is made to improve the Bill, that an opportunity will be taken to attack the position of the Ministry. Let us deal with the Bill and not with the Ministry. Let us have more of the fact that we want to enact'a good law than of the fact that we want to have surprisingly good men at the head of the Administration.",41
245,Mr FE MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I am sure that the leader of the Opposition must be very much obliged to the honourable and learned member for Corinella for his exceedingly kind and wise advice, and I have not the slightest doubt that it will have its due effect upon him.",41
246,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I doubt that.,41
247,Mr FE MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The honourable and learned meinber when he talks about party tactics seems to forget that it is quite possible to deal with the Bill in a non-party spirit, and still hold the Government responsible for bringing it before us in proper form. The honourable and learned member is quite content to accept the measures of the Government in whatever shape they bring them forward.",41
248,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I have not shown that I am.,41
249,Mr FE MCLEAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"He appears to be quite satisfied with slipshod Bills, so long as however battered, tattered, and torn they may become, they are in the end brought into harmony with his way of thinking ; but it does not occur to him that his attitude is quite as much dictated by party spirit as is that of the members of the Opposition when they feel it their duty to criticise the Government for bringing forward ill-digested legislation. The Minister for Home Affairs has absolutely failed to reply to the criticism of the leader of the Opposition, and to show why, when it was fired on from the labour benches ancl by members on his own side, he abandoned the clause within ten minutes of bringing it forward. Although, like the leader of the Opposition, I have not been here during the last week or two, I have read the report of the debates very closely, ancl I have come to the conclusion that the Government are absolutely without a policy, and are prepared to adjust their measures to suit honourable members in any part of the chamber whose amendments appear to command a majority. opinion the leader of the Opposition was perfectly justified in calling public attention to the want of backbone on the part of the Government, and to their lack of intelligence and knowledge of the subject with which they are dealing. excuse for Ministers to tell us that these Bills were prepared by the draftsmen in a hurry, and were introduced before Ministers could make themselves thoroughly familiar with their provisions and with the difficulties to be met with. We know that there has been ample time to consider these Bills, ancl Ministers must be held responsible for any ill-digested legislation they introduce. I shall vote for the proposed clause as amended, ancl I am quite satisfied to let this little game go on, because the inevitable result will be that the people of the Commonwealth will see-as they are beginning to see already-that the intelligence of the Chamber is not centred in those who occupy the position of Ministers of State. In saying this I do not mean to deny that a considerable amount of ability has been shown by certain Ministers in the discharge of their duties; I am referring only to the maimer in which certain measures have been introduced and amendments have been accepted from all quarters by this exceedingly accommodating Government. I hope that they will continue to accept the amendments which are thus showered upon them. The particular matter with which we are now dealing is one which the committee might have  expected would receive consideration at the hands of a professedly democratic Government above all other matters. We have seen in New Soutli Wales, in Victoria, and in the other States, what great dissatisfaction results from making distinctions in matters of salary and privileges between officers of the clerical ancl officers of the general division of the public service. I believe that in connection with the administration of the public service in New South Wales this has been a great source of dissatisfaction, and as Ministers have this experience to warn them, one would have thought that they woulcl have approached the question with special caution, and would have provided that persons in the general division should not be subjected to difficulties and disadvantages which are not imposed upon persons in the clerical division.",41
250,Mr CRTJICKSHANK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I am In my veiy glad to see that we have an Opposition here today, because yesterday there was not a man-jack on the Opposition benches, but I cannot allow the remarks of the leader of the Opposition to pass without notice, seeing that the provisions of a measure which he It is no fathered in New South Wales have been the cause of the difficulties and hardships which have induced the Government to insert this clause. Many employees in the general division of the Government service of New South ""Wales found that they could not get thensalaries increased beyond £ 7 0 or £ S 0 per year, and they have asked members of this Parliament to See that, when this Public Service Bill is passed, persons in their position will receive consideration. I am surprised, that the leader of the Opposition, and other honourable members, who are so busily criticising this B i ll at this advanced stage of its consideration, do not see that the clause will give relief to tliose who are complaining of the want of a minimum wage provision in the Public Sendee Acts of the States, and that it meets with the unanimous approval of the committee. The lionorable meinber for Lang division, states that he has read all the speeches which have been delivered, bufc, although he comes back dissatisfied with the Bill, he has no amendment to propose. The Government have received no assistance from the Opposition, and the leader of the Opposition has neither spoken upon the second reading nor offered any suggestions for improving the Bill.  what the honourable member has done.",42
251,Mr CRUICKSHAN K,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I have discussed the clause with other honourable bers round about me as much as any honourable member in the Chamber.,43
252,The CHAIKMAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I have not rigid in the performance of my duties as perhaps I ought to have been, in allowing this debate to proceed, because, honourable member is aware, the rule is that in committee the discussion fined entirely to the question before the Chair j but, having allowed the leader of the Opposition to make a statement, thought it due to the Minister in charge of vate 1 the Bill that he should be allowed to reply. I recognise, however, that if the discussion is allowed to proceed further it may lead confusion and disorder, and, therefore, I ask the honourable member to confine himmitted, self to the clause.",43
253,Mr CRUICKSHANK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I think that we might peaceably come to a division now. The passing of the clause as amended will satisfy the people to whom I have referred that there is a provision in the Bill making it emphatic, ancl not problematic, that shall receive consideration. Proposed new clause agreed to.",43
254,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I move That the following new clause be inserted after clause 42 :- "" When any charge against an officer is submitted to a board of inquiry, board shall have the right to direct that inquiry shall be held in private. In any case where such board finds that the charge proved the board may recommend that the reasongive able expenses, or any part thereof incurred such officer in meeting such charge, amount of such expense to be mentioned in such recommendation. Every such recommendation shall be considered by the Governor General. In any case where a charge against an officer mitted to a board of inquiry a copy of all the documents intended to be used at such inquiry shall be furnished to such officer at least days before such inquiry is held."" This new clause is to meet an understanding board ? arrived at in committee, and I think it embodies every suggestion made in reference to the improvement of the procedure of boards of inquiry as provided in the Bill.",43
255,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"East Sydney). - Fre e as we must all be from party feeling, I am very much afraid that the language which the Attorney-General has used in the clause is scarcely strong enough to meet the object in view. I understand the object is that if any officer against whom a charge is so desires, he will be entitled to have the inquiry in private. , . . Mr DEAKIN. --No ; that was expressly memrejected in committee.",43
256,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Then what is the use of the officer having the right to demand that the been so inquiry be held in private 1,43
257,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It is left to the judgment of the board whether the inquiry shall as every be held in private.,43
258,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It is entirely within the must be conjudgment of the board.,43
259,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Is it not provided that the oflicer charged shall have the right to deI mand that the inquiry be held in pri,43
260,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,That is not so.,43
261,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It is very inconvenient to not having copies of the proposed clause.,43
262,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The Bill is to be recomso that there will be further opportunity for challenging the provision. This clause is drawn to cany out an understanding arrived at with practical, if not absolute, unanimity in committee; ancl though there has not been time to have it printed and.circulated, it was considered uot worth they delaying the Bill on that account.",43
263,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I see the clause provides that the board shall have the right to direct the inquiry be held in private. The provision as to expenses is really in the nature of giving a certain award as to costs. Would regulations be sufficient such ' authority for the recovery of the costs ? the The mere fact that the board awards is not an officer a certain amount does not the officer the money, ancl some proby cedure is required in order that payment be paid, the may be compelled. Mr DEAKIN. - Iti s the State which is liable for the costs under the circumstances, and is subthe State is bound by its own Act.",43
264,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Then there will be no necessity for any machinery of that kind. seven The intention is that expenses will be paid from the public funds, if directed by the",43
265,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Yes .,43
266,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I think the expression used in the latter part of the proposed new clause is that an officer charged shall be furnished with all documents intended to be used. I was wondering whether that is sufficient to cover a case in which confidential reports might be used, reports which, though having no direct connection laid with the particular charge, might influence the head of a department in causing an inquiry. It ought to be laid down that everything in writing against an officer should be submitted to him. Sir WILLIAM. LYNE - Everythin g but confidential reports. This point was discussed the other night, and it was decided that, in the interests of the inspector, confidential reports should not be submitted. I then stated that I would not agree to prepare a clause to allow confidential reports to be submitted, but only such documents as are provided for in the new clause.",43
267,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The board does not see confidential reports.,44
268,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"It depends to some exteut on the constitution of the board. So long as the board does not contain among its members any officer who has had access tq those confidential reports, there is no objection. I do not know whether there is any provision to insure that no such officer shall be one of the board.",44
269,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,No such officer concerned would be appointed on the board.,44
270,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I do not mean the officer making the charge, but some officer who has had access to confidential reports some time prior to the charge being investigated. If there is any possibility of such an officer getting on the board it would be a bad thing, unless the officer charged had an opportunity of replying to confidential reports. What I desire to insure is that any officer will have a chance of replying to any charge which is the subject of investigation.",44
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,That is provided for.,44
272,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I think the honourable member for Bland has raised a very important point. The suggested clause provides that a copy of all documents intended to be used shall be furnished to the officer cliarged, and I quite understand the difficulty there is in the matter of showing confidential reports. At the same time, seems to me that an officer is scarcely put in a fair position by the present terms of the clause, which will amount to a warrant to the head of the department to select papers.",44
273,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,No ,44
274,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"We will suppose that a permanent head makes a charge against an officer, and that the matter goes to a board of inquiry. The position of the head of the department is that the law will tell him he may select documents-""documents ' intended to be used,"" because he will practically be the prosecuting authority making a charge against a subordinate. If the words "" documents intended to be used "" remain, the permanent head will select the documents he intends to use, and will say that the Act places him in a position to do so. The Act - will point out to the prosecuting authority that he has the discretion of selecting documents to use against the officer.",44
275,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"What he does not select, will not be used against the officer.",44
276,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But perhaps documents not selected would be of the greatest value to the officer cliarged.,44
277,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The officer could get them.,44
278,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,How ?,44
279,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Because the officer charged is entitled to prepare his caseas much as are those who make the charge.,44
280,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Does the Attorney-General mean to say that an officer charged could get confidential reports ?,44
281,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,No ; but he can get any other documents.,44
282,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"What is the use of the Attorney-General saying that the officer charged could get documents which I was pointing out were beyond the reach of the officer? I admit the difficulty of breaking through the rule of the public service that certain documents must be confidential. It is a serious difficulty, but, at the same time, from any experience I have had-and I have had a fair amount of experience in the public service- I doubt wliether the expression in the clause may not be used in such a sense as scarcely to bring about a full investigation of the matters in dispute. Is there anything in the Bil l which entitles an officer charged to demand, as a matter of right, copies of all documents? We all know that even permanent heads are human beings, and may perhaps be put on their it trial-that a trial although nominally that of a subordinate, may really be the trial of a superior officer.",44
283,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Tak e the case in the Statistician's department in New South Wales, where there was a dispute between a subordinate and the head.",44
284,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Honourable members will see that the under-secretary of a department may practically be involved in the matter, the subject of investigation. He is in a position of authority, and he, under the words of the clause, may say, "" I intend to use these documents a, b, and c."" There may, however, be a document d, which this particular officer may think it unnecessary to produce, but which, if produced, might enable the person accused to bring the strongest possible evidence in his favour against the particular officer. It would seem AS if an officer who is bringing a charge would practically have an advantage over the accused person, and that, I think, is unreasonable. A superior officer has sufficient advantage over an inferior officer at .all times; and an under-secretary bringing a charge against an. officer in his department, starts with a certain additional force which the man below him cannot exercise. I Appeal to the Government to consider whether a man, who is being practically tried for his life-becaus e it may be a - charge involving his dismissal and degradation-shoul d not be entitled to see all documents which in. any way relate to the particular charge.",44
285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"He may, so far as am concerned; but certainly not confidenwith tial documents.",45
286,Mr BEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I would point out how much this power could be abused by the head of A department, who, knowing that confidenthe tial documents must not be produced, may put into confidential documents all sorts things, which practically place an officer his trial. An accused person may ask for minute, which is perhaps a minute to Minister. I do not know what the machinery will, be-whethe r the permanent head will, report to the Minister.",45
287,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The permanent head will report to the commissioner.,45
288,Mr BEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I do not think we would that the commissioner should not see - confidential documents. Surely the commisrecord sioner will have a right to see every docuto ment ; and yet, if the commissioner has right, the accused person would be in - odiously unfair position of being tried by judge, who has in his possession documents relating to the accused, but which'the accused person himself caunot see. That would intolerable ""sort of inquiry. said if such a state of things existed in any - court of justice?",45
289,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,That is just what exists At this time. Orders may be made for covery of documents.,45
290,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,May I point out to the honoraccused Able and learned member that a Judge sitting on the bench does not get confidential [126] reports from the person who is prosecuting a man on trial. AJ udge does not get confidential reports to guide him in trying a man while that man is not aware of the documents.,45
291,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The board of inquiry is not supposed to see any of those documents. Mr.RELD - Surely the worldly experience of the honourable and learned member is sufficient to enable him to know that thepermanent heads of departments have many ways of letting the inspectors know things. In a matter of law, I should have the most profound deference for the opinion of my honourable and learned friend ; but having been twenty years in the public service, I perhaps have gained some little knowledge of the ordinary incidents of the life. Perhaps my friend will allow me, on a subject of this sort, like Middlewick on the subject of "" Dosset,"" to have a certain amount of experience. My own experience teaches me that even the best of permanent heads are liable in I matters of this sort to come into close touch high officials, and I do not know that it is an improper condition that they should be able to have communication with the man in' the position of chief inspector. Of course board might be a perfectly independent body apart even from the inspector, but I of certainly think that there should be some on provision by which an accused person would a be enabled to see every line that has been a written connected with the offence with which he is charged. I , do not mean that he should see every line that has been Written after the case has begun, because then he is upon his trial, and has no right to see the brief of the other side. But all the say documents relating to the charge which is such brought against him, and which are upon in the department, should be accessible him. . I think it is a question, at any this rate, for serious consideration whether an the accused person should be kept in the dark a as to a single word that has been written in connection with liis alleged offence.",45
292,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Would the right honourable be an and learned member apply that to all AVhat would be accused persons ?,45
293,Mr BEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"It is sufficient at present to deal with this particular matter. I do not think that the question of the honourable and dislearned member for Indi is a relevant one: I would further suggest that the right of an person to see everything that has been written against him, would be likely to exercise a healthy effect. If that were his right, men would be less likely to put upon paper things which were prejudicial to an officer. Every man who puts his pen to paper for the purpose of injuring another ought not to know that by the use of the little word "" confidential "" that paper can be screened from the observation of the man whom he accuses. If he knows that it cannot be so screened from the accused, it is one of the strongest securities we can establish for a satisfactory state of things.",45
294,Mr CHOUCII,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,dFo r want of discipline.,46
295,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"If a man is being tried practically for his life we have to consider his position a little. It is not a mere matter of discipline, but a matter of character.",46
296,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,What does the right honourable and learned menber suggest to get over the difficult)'?,46
297,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I suggest that not a single document on record in the custody of a public department relating to a charge against a man should be withheld from that man. If that were the rule established by the law, people who make charges against jjiiblie officers would make them with more care and discretion, and with more regard to the consequences. Do we not know the difference in the ordinary affairs of human life between referring to a man under the word "" confidential,"" and in a letter that is written otherwise ? In the ordinary affairs of human life it makes all the difference in the world, although I admit that it ought not to. But the supreme interest in this matter is the interest of the accused, who has a right fco know aU that is alleged against him. Let me put a case. Let us suppose that in a confidential report to a Minisfcer an under-secretary makes two distinct charges against an officer, and fchafc the Minister approves of one of those charges being sent on to an inquiiy. The Minisfcer might perhaps say to his under-secretary- "" I think you have been led away to make charge number one against this officer. It revolts my better feelings. I do not think it is right, and I will not allow youfcopufc it."" Then the under-secretary goes before the board of inquiry with one charge, whereas it is of the greatest importance to the accused to be able fco show the board that the under-secretary was so inaccurate in his treatment of him that the Minister had actually refused to proceed with one of the charges.",46
298,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,How wouldfchafcaffect the matter ?,46
299,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Surely the honourable and learned member for Indi is not a tyro. Surely he can see that an under-secretary's evidence as between himself and his inferior, is of greater weight. At any rate, there is a tendenc}'fcoattach greater weight to it . Let us suppose that an undersecretary put his own testimony against a subordinate's-and we know very well that many of these charges may not be the subject of documents at all. Thej' may refer to a matter which relates to an interview between the under-secretary and this officer. The two give tlieir evidence. Let us further suppose that the subordinate has no opportunity of getting behind the evidence of the under-secretary in order to show the history of the occurrence, and to prove that the under-secretary had been accusing him of matters that the Minister would not let him bring before the board. Surely that would be important for the board to know in such a case. The genius of the matter is, I think, that there should be the fullest inquiry. There is inconvenience, I admit, in submitting confidential documents, but I think that in matters affecting a man's position the inconvenience is not so great as the injustice of keeping that man in the dark. It is not. as if these matters were matters, of international policy. After all, it is only a question of a charge between A and B, but still it is a matter of very great consequence to both A and B. As one who has had a good deal of experience in connection with the public service, I feel that the subordinate deserves all the information he can get fco enable him to show that the charge preferred against him is not a correct one.",46
300,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," May I point out to the righfc honourable and learned member for East Sydney that he is not only conjuring up almost impossible cases, but I do not think that he has quite gathered the course of procedure which is to be adopted. I do not wish to refer to the procedure in New South Wales in regard to such cases, because I am not sufficiently well acquained with it . But our own procedure in Victoria, so far, has been very satisfactory indeed.",46
301,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Is the Victorian procedure adopted in this Bill t,46
302,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Yes ; the Victorian system, very much improved in the interests of the accused. There are honourable and learned members i u this House who have practised before boards in Victoria, and who will say that these scrupulously independent boards, unacquainted as they are with any facts, except such as are officially laid before them, have adjudged in the case of civil servants almost invariably with great satisfaction.",46
303,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,To the man who has dismissed as well 1,47
304,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Yes , so far as having a fair trial is concerned. There has been no difficulty in regard to the production of documents. We have placed in this measure a power which has been found almost invaluable in the interests of public servants, viz., the power of being represented by any attorney or agent.",47
305,Mr EEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But the accused wants the evidence also.,47
306,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The accused's attorney or agent is perfectly competent to decide what papers are necessary for his case. It has been the practice in Victoria to place practically the whole of the papers before the attorney or agent.,47
307,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It is not so provided here.,47
308,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I have not come to the procedure yet. I am only pointing out that on the whole the Victorian system has worked satisfactorily. But in this Bill we have greatly improved upon that system. Under its provisions we have an outside body appointed' to. constitute a special board. of inquiry which knows nothing of any charges except those that are placed before it , and that board, consisting of honourable men, will refuse to know anything beyond such charges.",47
309,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I want to put a case to the Attorney - General. Supposing that an accused is represented by counsel, and that the accuser in the person of the permanent head of the department is in the box under cross examination. If the accused wishes to ascertain the statements made in any confidential report in order to show malice and to prove that the permanent head had preferred another charge against him, which the Minister had refused to entertain, could not the witness in reply to a question, say"" I refuse to answer,"" or "" I am not allowed to divulge the contents of a confidential report""?",47
310,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The Victorian practice in such cases has been that if any importance is attached to a document of that sort, application for it is made to the Minister, and in nineteen cases out of twenty the document is given. But uuder this Bill we have provided that each man upon liis trial shall have a man chosen from his own division of the service as a member of the board of inquiry. The other two members of the board are selected from the public service, and been selected fairly. The man from the accused's own division of the service, who will, so to speak, judge him, is there to take care of the interests of the accused.",47
311,Mr BJEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,He cannot see these documents either.,47
312,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"He sees everything that comes before'the board. If he asks for more papers they are rarely refused. The board are allowed to see all the documents. We have also accepted the suggestion of the honourable member for Bland, and have inserted a provision to enable copies of the whole of the papers to be placed in the hands of the accused seven days before the inquiry.",47
313,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,That is all I ask.,47
314,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Of course I mean all the papers except confidential papers.,47
315,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Then they are not all the papers.,47
316,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"There may be a case in which a confidential report is involved, and in which we could not permit the document to be brought forward. In such a case, however, the report would not influence the board. The board know nothing about it .",47
317,Mr OMALLEY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It implies that there is something behind.,47
318,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Not at all. In a case, in which a confidential document is refused, that point is used with veiy good effect by the counsel representing the accused, just as the right honourable and learned meinber for East Sydney invariably does with a jury, when some piece of evidence which he has called for is refused him, ancl when he makes a mountain out of a molehill. n appealing to an independent board, the officer is perfectly safe. If the honourable member for Bland turns to the power for making regulations, he will find that the laying down of the procedure of the court and all the circumstances in connection with the board of inquiiy are provided for by regulation. Those regulations will be drawn, if the present Government remain in office, upon the most advanced lines in this regard, and care will be taken that absolute justice is insured in regard to the conduct of these inquiries by every reasonable latitude that can be allowed. Our practice has been to give the board the powers of a court, and they practically obtain all the information they require.",47
319,Mr WATSON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,In what way would an officer accused receive through his agent documents of a confidential character t,48
320,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"O u r practice has been that he gets them upon application. It is inherent in the nature of the case, but if there is any doubt it can be provided for by regulation. It has never been our custom to refuse any of these papers.",48
321,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Even confidential papers 1,48
322,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Except .confidential papers; but that does not occur once in a hundred times.,48
323,Mr HIGGINS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Are the judges allowed to see the documents 1,48
324,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Yes , in every case that I have known of. I will not say there has not been a case of refusal, but I have never known of it .",48
325,Mr HIGGINS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"If the board can see the ment 1 documents and the accused cannot, it will be unfair.",48
326,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I thought that the honourable member meant some confidential report that the accused person desired to have put in evidence, thinking that i might help him. If it is a confidential document it cannot be put in in evidence; or crirninal trial. but in these cases the court will allowed to see the most confidential docuduce ments, although such documents could not be put in in evidence. wish to point out to the honourable member for Bland is- I really think we are taking more time over this matter than it deserves, although anything affecting the liberty rights of a public servant merits the most careful consideration-that we have gone beyond anything that has been attempted under any other Public Service Act in any State. We have made the law more considerate in every manner possible, and public servants are fairly dealt with they will be in a much better position under this measure.",48
327,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I think this is very important matter indeed, as it involves not only the thousands of servants now i the Commonwealth service, but all who come after them. The question thoroughly deto any inquiry. serves the prominence given to it , but as I can see there is no ground whatever for alarm, and a very little consideration show that to be so. An inquiry takes place under clause 40, sub-clause (4). The board 3 inquiry is the body to make the investigation, and is constituted of three persons, one of whom is the chairman, and any two of whom may exercise all the powers of the board. Now, if we take clause 10 of the Bill, under sub-clause (2) we find that it is provided that a chairman of any board of inquiry, under Part 3 of the Bill, shall, unless otherwise prescribed, have all the powers conferred on the commissioner or any inspector. When we turn to the first sub-clause we find that the commissioner and the inspectors, and therefore the chairman of the board, have power to summon any witness or to call for any official books, documents, or writings within the custody or control of any witness that may be material to the inquiry. That gives the amplest power to call for the production of every document of any kind whatever.",48
328,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Even a confidential docu,48
329,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Tlier e is only one thing that could prevent the production of a confidential document, and that is an expression of the Minister's opinion that it would be detrimental to the interests of the public, t and the position in that case would be just the same as in any ordinary civil There the head of be a department could be summoned to prosuch a document, and the. only tiling that would protect thatdocumentfrom being What I produced in court would be the exercise of the privilege of the Minister, who has the up right to say that in his opinion it would be detrimental to the best interests of the or public to have it produced in court. The committee surely would not put in this Bill any provision that would compel the production of any document, however inimical it might be to the interests of the public to produce it, and surely we can trust the if Minister of the day to say whether the pronow, duction of a document would be dangerous to the public interests. Unless the Minister is prepared to so certify-and the a court would not be satisfied with any tiling else-it seems to me that there is ample n power on the part of the board to compel the production of every document material as far - Mr OMALLEY (Tasmania) - I think this is a very important question, and that will the right honourable meinber for East Sydney deserves great commendation for of having raised this point. Now, confidence is the parent of tyranny, and every Governwhat ment rests in jealousy. If document were only seen by the one person and then hermetically .sealed, tliere might something in the position taken up by Government. Generally, however, the person who has seen a confidential report winks at somebody else, and somebody at a third jserson, and it gradually becomes bruited about that there is something the document which, if it were only known, would put the man concerned in gaol. have been through the mill myself and know something about it , and I say that any man who puts his pen to paper about another man ought to be held responsible for it, and made to answer for it. If he not, he is a sneaking coward who is ing injury in the dark. I say, furtlier, that no man ought to say in this House many years.. words that he will not say. on the steps. I am prepared to act up to that. This serious matter, because some unfortunate oflicer may under a confidential report charged with a veiy serious offence. I is anything in such a document we should get at it , and if the right honourable man will move in that direction he willhave my support.",48
330,Mr EEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," The honorinfluence able and learned member for Indi has thrown a great deal more light on the Bill than has the Minister in charge of it, and pay him the compliment of saying that he placed the matter much more clearly before the committee than it appeared before. Furthermore, I recognise that the statement he has made improves the matter considerfor ably, because 1 understand from the position taken up by the Attorney-General that confidential document is privileged.",49
331,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Oh , no.",49
332,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I think the Attorneybetween General put the same view as I did, only in other words.",49
333,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Then I must congratulate the honourable and learned member for or Indi upon having put the matter so fair? that some one else can understand it. Even the statement of the member for Indi does not touch the point I am dealing with at all. AVhat word is there in the Bil l that enables an accused person to see the docuinto ment produced by the head of the departever3'thing ment to the court 1 The document which official may be placed before the court may be confidential report to the Minister, and under authority has the accused person the a confidential right to see that ?",49
334,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"He could compel the probe duction of any document he pleases, subject the to the one restriction I have mentioned.",49
335,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,May I say that the power of production of a document is not given to else winks the man who is accused?,49
336,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,He can ask for its produci n tion if it is in his favour.,49
337,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Who is to judge whether it I is in his favour? How will he have a I chance of judging whether the document is in his favour or not ? I have been in the same official grooves as the honourable member,. and I have ""also been in the civil does service, and I can, therefore, look at the workquestion from both points of view.",49
338,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I also was in the service for,49
339,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I am glad to hear the is a honourable and learned member had that distinction ; but there is no service in the be world in which, however high-minded and f there honourable they may be, two men start on equal terms if an under-secretary makes gentlea charge against a subordinate. Where an under-secretary makes a charge against a subordinate we know the weight of the exerted by the man who sits at the right hand of the Minister compared with that attaching to the clerk downstairs. I We are so perfect, all of us, sitting here; has but I know enough of the public service to know that there is nothing in the relations between the permanent head and the subordinate which makes it of less importance that subordinate to know everything relating to the. charge against Mm than a it would be under other circumstances. A man does start fair in a court of justice, but he does not start fair where the issue is himself and his under-secretary as to who is to go. Let us suppose the issue is whether the under-secretary is to go, for making a wrong charge against the officer, whether the oflicer is to go. Do they start",49
340,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But the board honourable is an independent court.,49
341,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I know that. Of course the board can do anything, but I am talking about the accused person before he goes the inquiiy, and his right to know that an official has written on paper in the nature of a report with a reference to him, and I say that the mere putting of the word "" confidential"" on that report ought not to protect the person who has brought the charge from the inspection of his accusation by the accused before the trial.",49
342,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Would the right honourable and learned member |have the accused's papers produced 1,50
343,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I do not look upon official documents as private. Honourable members may depend upon it that all the official documents of the accused, all his writings to the head of his department that would tell against him, will be produced, and I ask why should anything written by the accusing oflicer against the accused be screened from the public gaze 1 I say that there is no fairness in it . It is bad enough for the accused officer to start as he does at a great disadvantage without nmking the position worse. It may turn out from the nature of a particular caseancl it is no wild supposition-that a concealed confidential report might enable an accused person to show in black and white under the hand of his accuser that the charge is the product of malice or misunderstanding.",50
344,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The honourable and learned member must assume that the Minister is in the conspiracy.,50
345,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Why should all the assumptions tend to deprive a man of the thing he has a right to see? We could assume that a Judge would be a fair jury to try people charged with criminal offences, but that does not answer the question of trial by j u r y ; so I say in this particular case that it is a matter of common fairness that any confidential repprt affecting any particular officer should be shown to that man before he is tried. Proposed new clause agreed to. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM agreed toThat the following new clause be inserted after clause49:-""Allofticer s of adepartmenttrausferred to the Commonwealth, aud all officers in the public, railway, or other service of a State so transferred, who, by any law of a State, had to contribute to a superannuation fund, or to insure their lives, shall continue to be liable to pay the sum imposed by such law into the Treasury, and to continue to keep up such insurance according to the provisions of such law.""",50
346,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I move That the following new eiause be inserted after clause 52 :-""Any oflicer of a department transferred to the Commouwealth and any person in publio, railway, or other service of a State so transferred, who has qualified / position in the service of a State prior to such transfer, shall in the service of the Commonwealth retain all the rights to promotion he possessed in the service of the State at the time of such transfer."" That clause has been drafted to deal with the cases of officers - of a State who by passing examinations have become qualified to obtain certain positions in the service of that State. There has been some doubt as to Avhether such officers, if transferred to the CommonAvealth. would retain that right where their appointment had not been actually made before the transference.",50
347,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," A certain number of men in the general division of the public service of Victoria passed an examination qualifying them for positions in the clerical division ; but they were not appointed to the clerical division prior to the transfer of their departments to the Commonwealth ; and, upon the matter being pointed out to the Attorney-General, the promise Avas made that a clause Would be introduced to continue that right to them under the Commonwealth Government. Has this clause been drafted to meet that case ?",50
348,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Yes , to meet that case and some others. Some of the officers of, I think, the Telegraph department came to me yesterday and told me that they had passed examinations but had not been appointed to positions for which they had qualified, and this clause has been introduced to deal with their case and all similar caseswhere rights have accrued in State departments through the passing bf examinations.",50
349,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," May I suggest to the Minister that the clause which I have prepared, and Avhicli has been circulated Will other proposed amendments, more LYNE) fairly meets these cases 1 I propose to insert after clause 51 the folloAving new clause :If any officer has done any act or passed auy examination by which he has under the law of any State the right to appointment or prior appointment to any division of the public serA'ice such right shall be conserved to him in the departments under this Act. ""Officer"" in this section shall include persons permanently employed in the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth.

353,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I m o v e That the following new eiause be inserted after clause 21:-""All persons who have served for a period of not less than five years in the naval or military forces of the Commonwealth, or of a State, shall be entitled to be employed in the general division on fulfilling all requirements as to examination and insurance for persons entering sucb division, and such persons shall be entitled to be appointed to any vacancy which. may occur, therein in priority to all other persons whatsoever except persons already in the public serviee."" The words "" except persons already in the public service "" have been put in at the suggestion of the Attorney-General. clause only conserves rights which at present exist. It was 'found in Victoria that, although a good body of men could be obtained for actual military and naval service, it was impossible to build up reserves, and therefore the privilege which this clause retains was offered to all who served for a period of not less than five years in the naval or military forces of the State. As a result, there are now in the penal, lunacy, and other departments of Victoria - a number of men who have qualified as artillerymen or in other branches of military duty, who, belonging to the reserves, in times of emergency, when the public service would be suspended, would be able to assist in the defence of their country - against foreign invasion.",51

361,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The proposal is very drastic.,51

364,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Wit h the permission of the committee I will insert the words "" as far as practicable"" after the word "" entitled "" in line 5. I would point out that' there is a similar provision in existence in The New Zealand, and that in German}' old soldiers are employed on the railways. Th© clause only preserves rights which already exist in Victoria, and in view of the provisions of section 54 of the Constitution Act, I think they should be preserved.",51
365,Mr KIRWAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I have no quarrel with the clause itself, but I think the wording ought to be in some respects altered. The clause is to the effect that all persons who have served for a period of not less than five years in the naval or military forces of the Commonwealth shall be given the priority suggested. No exception whatever is made in the clause to persons who have served thenperiod in the naval or military forces, and who, at the.end of the five years, or some tune subsequently, may be discharged for misis not a conduct or some other discreditable reason. An exception ought to be made, and words inserted to theeffect that men who have been discharged for misconduct should not come within the operation of the provision. As the clause reads now, it means that all persons who have served five years, irrespective of the reason for which they may have left the service, or how they conducted themselves in the service, would be entitled to priority in the matter of appointments. I suggest to the Minister, does the and I am sure he will accept the suggestion, that the clause ought to be altered with a view to excepting - persons discharged from the service for misconduct.",51
366,Mr MCCOLL,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I woulcl like to know when any members of the general public are going to get a chance of a position underfcheCommonwealth ? We hare already opened the service by giving priority to officers in every department of the various States. This is a practice which has never obtained before, where the railways and other services are kept separate from the ordinary public service. We now propose that any one who chooses to serve five years in the ranks in any capacity whatever, shall have the right of entrance into the Commonwealth service. I understood the Commonwealth service was to be a service open to the smartest and most brilliant young men we have. How are the farmers' sons and the smart lads throughout the Commonwealth going to get a chance if we hedgeround the entrance to the Commonwealth sendee with all these provisions 1 It seems to me we are discounting the future to far too great an extent, and I certainly think this is not a clause we ought to accept. We should have left ourselves much freer than we have done in regard to the selection of men. It seems to me that we are going utterly too far by binding the Commonwealth as to the class and kind of men we are going to take into the public service.",51
367,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," It seems to me that the honourable member for Echuca should take the opposite view if he wants to help the farmers' sons, who have shown their anxiety to do what they conceive to be right-that is, they have fought for the country in a way that commends itself fco most people of the Commonwealth.",52
368,Mr MCCOLL,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,They have no chance for the Commonwealth service.,52
369,Mr MAUGER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I differ from the honourable member. These men have a greater chance, becausetherearenotthe same number of other attractions outside the city. Surely if we mean anything by the praise we have been uttering in regard fco these men, we shouldshow our appreciation of their conduct in some practical way. It seems to me exceedingly wise and right that the men who have done the State service, and are still prepared to do the State sendee, should have any opportunity the Commonwealth has to offer them in the public service.",52
370,Mr KIRWAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"AVestern Australia) W it h the consent of the mover of the new clause, I move- ' That the clause be amended the word ""State,"" line 4, the words ""and who have not been discharged for discreditable conduct."" Sir EDWARD BRADDON - I understand that some exception is taken,, and not unnaturally, to the words which, the honourable member who has moved this, new clause seeks to introduce, viz., the words ""as far as practicable."" He might have worded the clause to the effect that such persons should be entitled to priority of appointment to any vacancy.",52
371,Sir AVILLIAJI LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,That is what I object to-the priority.,52
372,Sir EDAVARD BRADDON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Of course, if the Minister takes exception to the principle of the clause, there is an end of the matter. J",52
373,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The Minister has not done that.,52
374,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But it is only intended to say that the man who has served in the navai or military forces shall be entitled by reason of that service to priority of claim to an appointment.,52
375,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,On passing the examination and assuring his life.,52
376,Sir EDAVARD BRADDON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Yes ; all that has gone before being taken into consideration.,52
377,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"AVha t I object to in the clause is that it places the Defence department over other, departments which have been allowed to come in under the Bill. Eor instance, preference would be given to the officers of the Harbor Trust and perhaps-some other departments whom we have agreed to allow to come in, on passing the examination. The clause seems to provide that if these men have served five years, they shall be entitled to priority. There is something in the statement made by the member for Western Australia, Mr. Kirwan, that a man who has served that time would, as the clause is worded, be entitled to priority, although he may have been discharged for misconduct.",52
378,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I have accepted the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Western Australia, Mr . Kirwan.",52
379,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Then there arethe hnes :And such persons shall be entitled to be appointed to any vacancy whioh may occur therein in priority to all other persons whatsoever, except persons already in the public service ",52

381,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I know they are not in the A ct of New South Wales. 5 The servants of the Harbor Trust in New South Wales are not under the public service board, and they would certainly not have the same right that the men contemover plated in the proposed new clause have. I am prepared to allow these officers to come in on exactly the same basis as al the others-to take their chance on passing the examination and effecting assurance being selected, as many of them would probably be, for any position which might offer.",52
382,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,But there is no selecting that has been done away with.,53
383,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I do not mean selection, but passing the examination and qualifying themselves.",53
384,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,They cannot be stopped from doing that.,53

394,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I can see the l committee are ready to accept this clause if certam amendments are made.

404,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Why does not the honourable member propose at once that all public servants should be compelled to serve in the naval or military forces 1 He might just as well do that as make this proposal.,54
405,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"If the leader of the Opjiosition would, at the proper time, when the Defence Bill is before the House, make such a proposal, I should be very glad to support it . At the present time 1 must have regard to the possibility that such a proposal might not be carried.",54
406,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Does the honourable member mean that a man who has been paid for every day he has served in the military forces-the regular military forces-shall be put in the same position of advantage as a man who has given his services as a volunteer for nothing ?,54
407,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Yes .,54
408,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I do not see any fairness that.,54
409,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The reason is that there - vvould be these trained men whom we want to keep in the public service, so that we can lay our hands on them when public affairs are disorganized by war. There would then be no necessity to carry on the public service, and these men could be sent to the front when we want highlytrained military men ready to defend the State. I propose to amend the clause in the direction already indicated by me.",54

411,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The fire brigades men incur more danger than do some of the others.,54

415,Sir GEOBOE TURNER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Would it not be better to move to omit the first words of the clause ?,54
416,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Yes ; and if the committee are in favour of the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, we can then proceed with any subsequent amendments that it may be necessary to make. But otherwise it is of no use wasting time.",54
417,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I will not proceed further if my amendment is defeated.,54
418,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"But to press that amendment at this stage puts us in a false position, by making it appear that we are opposed to disgraceful conduct being regarded as a bar. If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will withdraw his amendment, I will make this question a test one. I moveThatfchewords ""all persons,"" line], be omitted. I will not repeat the objections that have been already mentioned, but I would point out to the honourable member for Corio that, to be fair all round, this clause ought to date from a future day. Every one should know the advantages which attach to naval in or, military service in the States. At the present time tliere is only one State-Victoria-in which military or naval service is thus recognised. Consequently large numbers of men may have joined the naval and military forces in Victoria with the knowledge that tliey would have this privilege conferred upon them after five years. But in the other States, where the privilege does not exist, men will be shut out by reason of the priority that is being given in Victoria.",54
419,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,They will all have the same priority.,54
420,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I quite see that the volunteers who have served in New South Wales will be on the same footing as the volunteers who have served in Victoria. But in Victoria a large number may have joined the volunteer forces with the intention of getting this, privilege, while a large number would have joined the New South Wales forces five years ago if they had known that this priority would be given to them. Mr - CROUCH - How does the right honourable and learned member propose to preserve their rights ?",54
421,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"They are not deprived of their rights. Their right was not to serve in the Commonwealth, but to serve in the Victorian military service.",54
422,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,We have taken away three of their departments.,54
423,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I do not suppose that they are veiy sorry for it. Is it not altogether wrong to make any distinction between a .man who is in the permanent force at 5s. or 6s. a day, and the volunteer who serves his - country for nothing ? Surely we should not put them on the same footing as regards priority. Certainly I would not do so.",54
424,Mr CROUCH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,« I propose to withdraw the - clause and to bring the matter up at a later stage.,55
425,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Then I will withdraw the - amendment.,55
426,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Before - the amendment is withdrawn I should like to say that the objection which I have to this clause is the same one that I have taken to several parts of the Bill-viz. , that it is an attempt to unduly restrict the choice of the commissioner. This Bill is not intended for a State, but for the whole of Australia, and it might be very difficult in <lifferent parts of Australia-if these hardand-fast rules were laid down-to get proper persons for particular positions. At first we ought not to make the Bill drastic by confining the choice to too close limits. Amendments and new clause, by leave, withdrawn.",55
427,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I desire to move a new clause - which raises rather an important question. The Bill now contains almost every provision that it should contain, with one very notable exception. There is no appeal machinery of any kind in it . There are provisions-ver y wise and proper ones-for the holding of inquiries.",55
428,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Where does honourable member propose that this clause shall come in?,55
429,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"It is immaterial to me where it is put in. I should say that it ought to follow the clauses dealing with inquiry boards. But I am simply asking for a principle. I move that the following stand a new clause in the Bill : .1. If an officer feels aggrieved by any decision of the permanent head refusing to recommend the granting of a higher rate of pay to any officer claiming to be legally eligible there for or any officer's promotion or transfer, he may within 28 days thereafter .appeal against such refusal to an appeal board consisting of the inspector the permanent head or chief officer and a representative of the division to which such oflicer belongs and elected by the officers of that division under the regulations. 2. The appeal board thus constituted shall investigate any such appeal and shall report upon the same and submit the facts together with any recommendation thereon to the commissioner whose decision shall be final.",55
430,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Does the honourable member refer to one officer who feels aggrieved at the treatment of another oflicer ?  I do not know if the honourable membei for Bourke is in order in anticipating the order in which notice of amendments has been given.,55
431,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I would point out that there is nothing in the standing orders to prevent any honourable member proposing a new clause at any time, that he may think - proper. The honourable member for Bourke has certainly placed his notice upon a paper; but not upon the business paper of the House, and his new clause is not to be treated as if it appeared upon that business paper. The honourable member is, therefore, in order in bringing forward his clause when he may think it proper to do so.",55
432,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Does the honourable member for Bourke refer to a case in which one oflicer takes exception to the treatment by another officer of himself, because, as the clause is worded, it looks as if officer A is going to champion the cause of officer B.",55
433,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I wish to point out again that there, is no right of appeal provided in this Bil l for any officer who feels aggrieved by reason of being passed over and not getting the place to which he thinks he is entitled. Under these circumstances it seems to me that some sort of appeal board must be constituted. Otherwise the Bill is as perfect as we can make it , and is certhe tainly a great advance upon any public service legislation that we have seen enacted in 'other States. But it lacks that saving clause whereby officers who feel aggrieved may take action to have thengrievances remedied. Very adequate provision has been made for boards of inquiry. If an officer has a charge made against liim it can be remitted to a board upon which there is a representative elected from that division of the service to which the accused belongs. But what right has an officer with no charge against him, but who desires to make a charge against a permanent head ? It seems to me that officers ought to have a general right of appeal. Under these circumstances I have framed a clause which runs along the same lines as the clause providing for inquiry boards, and which gives to an officer the right of appeal to a board upon which there shall be a man representing the particular division of the service to which he belongs. Some objections liave been made to the proposed method of constituting the board. I do not know that these are vital objections, but possibly they may be, owing to the way in which the clause is drawn. first objection was that this clause would require that any particular division of the service should elect an officer for all Australia - that is to say, that the clerical division could have only one man to represent the whole of Australia on the appeal board. That certainly is not what I intended, because I think that each State should have its own appeal board, and that each divisionin the State should have its representative on the board. to say, >that the Custonis department of Victoria would have its own hoard of appeal, and the officers of each division would have a representative on the board.' That would be following exactly along the lines of the board of inquiry, constituted under clause 40. The wording of my clause may not have that effect, but that is what is intended. Then it has also been urged that there is no machinery for the election of these officers. I propose to ficulty by providing that they shall be elected under regulations. I do not desire to cumber the Bill with a number of clauses which will provide machinery under which the officers shall be elected, and as to the voting, and so on. '.It seems to me that it will be much easier to draft regulations, just as it is proposed to draft regulations for the inquiry board. There are three sets of persons represented on the board. First of all there will be the inspector, who would, so to speak, represent the Government of the Commonwealth. Then there-would be the chief officer, or it might be the permanent head-whichever is the more convenient-who .would act for the department in which the appeal, case arises, and who would put forward the departmental views, and urge whatever reasons he might have in support of the promotion or transfer as against the appeal of the man who feels aggrieved. Then there would be the officer elected by the division who would represent the appellant, and who would understand his case and know all the facts surrounding it, and just because he would be so very familiar with the internal workings of the division he would be able to properly represent his client's case to the other two members of the appeal board. I do not propose to give this .appeal board the power Mr Hume Gooh. to deal finally with the questions coining before them. These must be sent on to the commissioner, who would have the inspectors to aid and advise him in coming The to a decision. I repeat that I am not particularly wedded to this proposal as it is now worded, but I think some provision must be made in the Bill whereby appeals can be heard from those who feel aggrieved. I may point out in support of this proposal that it is practically along the lines of the system adopted in South Australia. There they have two persons appointed by the Government acting for the Governinent and one man elected by the division of the That is service to which the officer making the appeal belongs. Appeals can be made to this board under such circumstances as I have detailel. I do not see how officers are to substantiate their cases unless there is some right of appeal. We have adopted, and wisely too, throughout this Bill the principle that merit shall have the first call upon the service of the Commonwealth.",55
434,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Does not the honourable meinber think this amendment will get over that dif- destroy that ?,56
435,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"No ; we have decided .that merit shall have the first claim, but we have inserted a provision that where a junior officer is appointed the coriimissioner must first certify that there is no senior officer equally capable of performing the duties and available for the purpose. It may be that even with that provision, wise as it is, some man may be pissed over who feels, and perhaps rightly so, that he has been improperly treated, that he has a right to promotion, or a right to increased pay, or a right to be transferred, which will not be supported by the permanent head or the commissioner. Under these circumstances, the officer ought to have the right of appealing to somebody, and I think the proper person to deal with the question is the commissioner in the last resource. I do not desire to labour this matter, but honourable members will see that this Bill cannot be considered complete without some right of appeal, which will give servants the right to fight out their own battles when they feel aggrieved-whe n they do' not get the treatment they consider they ought to receive, or do not receive transfers or promotions to which they consider they are entitled. I therefore beg to submit the clause, and ask for the support of all those honourable members who approve of the principle of appeal, hoping that they will decided. assist me to make the clause effective, if they consider its present wording faulty.",56
436,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Without dement laying the committee at any length, I commissioner. would point out to the honourable member who has moved this new clause, that when lie drafted it the Bill was in a very different form from that in which it now appears. was at first provided that the permanent head should make the recommendation, but now it is the commissioner who makes the recommendation to the Governor General, cases such as this clause woulcl attempt vary. Mr HUM is COOK - After report from permanent head. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Ye s ; after rebe port from the permanent head. Therefore, the effect of this clause would be to provide for an appeal from the commissioner to the commissioner, because the honourable memis ber says he wishes the board to hold an quiry and report the result to the com-, missioiier, leaving the commissioner position to say what he will do afterwards. As the Bil l is altered, there is notthenecessity ment. for this clause, which there might have been. I admit that there is somepublic thing in the statement that an appeal is provided for in South Australia from decision, not of the commissioners, because I do not think there are any commissioners it. there, but of the Mmister or the head of the department. In that instance, is no commissioner who can take into consideration everything surrounding a case is any analogy between a as there will be under this Act, so that same necessity does not exist for a board appeal under the conditions contemplated by this Bill. I wish to point out, too, that the case the honourable member refers to connection with the railways in Victoria there is an appeal board, composed of departguardian mental officers, and one officer elected by men. I copied that to some extent, and we passed an Act in New South Wales constisalary tuting an appeal board of a similar character in connection with the railway service there. The appeal in that case is from the decision of the railway commissioners which hedged round with everything to protect That is not provided with regard to missioner under this Bill. I do not think any grave injustice can be clone to officers able promotion. when the commissioner has to obtain a port and then to make a recommendation the Governor General before any matter is.",57
437,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It is because the. Governor General really makes the appointthat I have limited the appeal to the,57
438,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The Governor General makes the appointment, but in 99 cases out of 100 the report of the comI t missioner practically controls the matter. That has been my experience in the past, and no doubt it will be the same under this Bill. An attempt has been made under this in measure to clothe the commissioner with to very considerable powers, which I have agreed to mainly with the object of placing the him in a position to make appointments. The provision that recommendations are to sent on to the Governor General is intended to give the right to the Governor General-that is practically the Ministry to exercise the ultimate control, but that a power which will be exercised only in inextreme cases, ancl it is hedged round with provisions that anything that may be clone in a contrary to the recommendation of the commissioner, shall be reported to ParliaI think that there is no danger whatever to be apprehended so far as the servants are concerned, and as this clause will only provide for an appeal from the the commissioner to the commissioner, I hope the honourable member will not press",57

I do not think there ; question the of pay and a wrong being done to a of public servant, or an inquiry being held into the conduct of an officer. .Furthermore, in as the Minister has said, we have so drasi n tically altered the whole position of the commisioner, that he is now practically the of the public service, and cannot the be in any way inimical to its interests. He must see the position of every servant and the he is getting, ancl he must know that . certain men have remained at a given salary for some time, and it woulcl be ridiculous to appoint a commissioner upon is the supposition that he would not make it . inquiries into all such cases, ancl find the comout why a man has been stationary, that and why he has not obtained reasonI t seems contrary to the reprinciple of the Bill that there should be to any provision such as is now suggested by the honourable member, and I hope he will"" withdraw it .",57
440,Mr EWING,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I think the clause proposed by the honourable member for Bourke is a very laudable effort to get away from the consequences of departmental neglect. Anyone who knows anything as to the working of the State departments knows that there is such a thing as departmental neglect, and, although we do not want to overload the Bill, we want to make it a fair measure. The honourable member for Bourke proposes to eventually trust the commissioner, but we might get over the difficulty possibly by trusting the commissioner in the 'first instance, and I would suggest, if the Government would approve of it, that all the words after the word appeal, in line 5, should be struck out, and the words "" directly to the commissioner,"" should be substituted - The honourable member for Wentworth may tliink that it has no value.",58
441,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"That would desfcrov the whole discipline of the service. M i - . ' EWING - I do not know that it would. If thehonorablemeniber was an officer of a department, and considered that he was not getting that which he ought to obtain, he would not feel as he does to-night.",58
442,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,That means that the 'commissioner does not know his business.,58
443,Mr EWING,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I could quite understand a number of papers reaching the commispeals. sioner that disclosed a veiy fair departmental case. The officer recommended for promotion would be perfectly satisfied, the mail over whose head he was to be proappeals moted should be allowed an opportunity appealing and stating his case. I cannot see any objection to it . Why should not the officer aggrieved have the right of aj> peal 1 I do not desire to overlay the public ser Aace with courts of inquiiy that kiud, but I think my proposal is a reasonable one. Mir. MCCAY (Corinella) - The suggestion made by the honourable member for Richmond is hardly possible, because the amendmentput forward by the honourable member for Bourke appears to have been drawn up before the commissioner was practically substituted the recommending party in lieu of the - perhear manent head. As a matter of fact as the Bill now stands, it is the commissioner who recommends the granting of a liigher rate of pay, and who recommends promotions and transfers. Thus to say that if an officer feels aggrieved at any decision of the permanent head he should have the right of appeal would be useless because the possible permanent head does not do it now. The word ""commissioner"" would have to be substituted for ""permanent head"" in the first line of the amendment by the honourable member for Bourke. Then the suggestion of the honourable member for Richmondwould be that if an oflicer felt aggrieved by the decision of the commissioner he should have the right of appeal to the commissioner.",58
444,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,From Ciesar to Ciesar.,58
445,Mr MCCAY,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"As the Bill now stands it is impossible to substitute the commissioner for the board, because it is not the recommending party. I do not know whether that fact would influence the honourable member for Bourke in regard to his amendment.",58
446,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E, I should like to point out that if this clause is adoptedwe shall have a perfect sheaf of appeals on the occasion of every promotion or transfer..,58
447,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,And it would take half-a-dozen boards to hear them.,58
448,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I am quite in favour of having some tribunal to which officers who feel aggrieved may appeal. I could only support that proposal, however, with a proviso that some penalty should attach to appeals which have no foundation.",58
449,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Frivolou s ap,58
450,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Yes . We should have the same kind of penalty as is provided in but the case of an owner of a race-horse, who frivolously against the horse first of past the post. In order that we may have an effective and contented public service I think we must have some tribunal to which an officer who feels aggrieved may be able to appeal, but subject to the conditions and things of I have stated.",58
451,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I do not wish to force this clause, but I do desire to force the issue of the question of the right of appeal. If the Minister in charge of the Bill thinks there should be some tribunal to which officers feeling aggrieved might appeal, I will be very glad as to temporarily withdraw the clause so as to what the Ministerial proposal is. There must be some kind of appeal. It is utterly impossible to conceive of a service where no right of appeal exists for aggrieved officers, more particularly when we have taken care to enable junior men to be promoted where ever it will benefit the service. I feel veiy warm about this subject. Many a good man may be passed over because he is not known to the permanent head, who makes the recommendation to the commissioner. Such a man might be exceedingly good, and efficient and equal to the senior man who received the appointment.",58
452,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Would it not better in cases like that for the individual aggrieved to approach the commissioner ?,59
453,Mr BEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,Can he not do so at the present time?,59

456,Mr EWING,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,It - would be a breach of departmental discipline for an officer to do so.,59
457,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,He could do so through the imder-secretaiy. . Mr HUME COOK - There is no provision in clause 71 by which officers feeling aggrieved may appeal to any one.,59
458,Sir WILLIAM,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,MCMILLAN - Perhaps the recommittal of the Bill there may be something put in.,59
459,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"It may seem a very trivial matter to the honourable member for Wentworth, but there are between 11,000 and 12,000 persons in the service of the Commonwealth, all of whom might at some time feel aggrieved, and they ought to have the right of appeal. Sir WILLIAM. LYNE - Unde r this provision we might have half-a-dozen appeal boards sitting at the same time.",59
460,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"We might have two or three. I desire to see the representation of the service on the appeal board, just as we have in the railway service at the present time.",59
461,Mr SALMON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,And just as we have provided in another portion of the Bill.,59
462,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"It is quite evident that this proposal as it is laid down cannot be accepted by the committee. I should like, however, to receive some assurance from the Minister for Home Affairs that he will look into the matter before the third reading, and see if it is not possible to do something in the direction I have indicated which would be satisfactory to the service.",59
463,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I am prepared to go so far as this. If , as the honourable member for Richmond has said, it would be a breach of discipline for an officer who thought he was overlooked to approach the commissioner, I shall be quite prepared to put some provision in the Bill that it shall not be a breach of the rules for an officer feeling himself aggrieved to make his representations to the commissioner be before the latter has forwarded his recommendation to the Governor General. I do not think that would be a breach of the regulations at present. At all events I think it could be provided for by regulations under clause 71. The com- Mr Bruce SMITH - Would not the adoption of the honourable member's suggestion simply mean an appeal from the commissioner to the commissioner 1 Sir "" WILLIAM LYNE - Yes . There may be a man, however, who thinks that he has been overlooked by the permanent head in making his recommendation to the commissioner, and I do not see why he should not have the right to lay Ins representations before the commissioner. The whole matter would then rest with the on commissioner.",59
464,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I think we ought to divide this matter into more than one head. As regards advances of pay in subdivisions where the increase is not automatic, I do not think there would be much difficulty in obtaining something like an appeal from the decision of the permanent head, or whoever it may be, in refusing toreport favourably npon it . Where an officerthought he was fairly entitled to have a favourable recommendation, after asking his permanent head, or the person in charge towhom the duty was committed of making a report, he might without any difficulty in practical administration have an opportunity of appealing to the commissioner.. But I see in cases of promotion in a vast service a great deal of practical difficultySuppose some vacancy occurs, and it is proposed to fill it up by promotion, the commissioner calls upon the permanent head for a report. The latter is to considereverything and make a report. Is the permanent head at that stage to invite every officer in the service to make his claim to him 1 If that is to be done, there will be great difficulty",59
465,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"-Every vacancy is notified, and every man has aright to apply for it..",59
466,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"But is the permanent head to inform every man who applies for it that he must come in and make good his claim, because, as I would point out, the difficulty does not arise t ill he has determined upon recommending a certain individual. When he has arrived at that stage, is he to hold his hand and not report t ill every one has had a chance of appealing. Then the eommistioner, after receiving the report, can judge for himself what recommendations he will make. Is it at that juncture that this is to take place 1 Then the Governor in Council is to consider whether he should adopt the report. I should like to see an opportunity of correcting injustices, but I observe practical difficulties in regard to promotion. The chance of an improper recommendation is minimized because the case of a senior officer being passed over for a junior could hardly take place without the fullest opportunity of the injustice being corrected. To clause 38 a proviso is now added that in every instance where a junior is recommended the certificate of the commissioner has first to be issued certifying that there is no senior oflicer capable of satisfactorily performing the duties. Before he can make that certificate he must inquire carefully, and practically he will have to give every senior officer an opportunity of demonstrating his capacity. That being so, the greatest danger of .all is removed, and having in view the practical difficulty of working the departments with perfection of appeal we might very well take the position as it is. In regard to the pa}', however, where it depends not on competition but on personal merit, I think the Minister might very well see his way clear to adopt the idea of my honourable friend, and allow the appeal from the refusal of the permanent head to the commissioner.",60
467,Mr RONALD,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Southern Melbourne) It is highly desirable that there shall be - some court of appeal for cases in which a man feels aggrieved, ancl I cannot understand what objection there can be to a board on. which the man will be represented. The proposal of the Minister is altogether inadequate to meet the case, because it is simply an appeal from Caesar to Ciusar, the commissioner being the originating source, and it is not likely that, if the originating source were the permanent .head, the commissioner would override his recommendation. If he did so, then the man who is aggrieved should have the righfc to a board on which his class is represented. It is of vital importance, and I am perfectly sure no man will feel he has received justice unless he has such an appeal board. We have granted an inquiry board in other cases, and if so, why not in this, seeing that all the men are on the same plane ? I hope the committee will see its way to grant a board, aud thus complete an excellent organization for securing the rights of the public servants, and making the public service as efficient as possible.  Minister will provide that officers who desire to make a complaint' or seek promotion shall be told by regulation that fchey are to approach their permanent officer or chief officer or the commissioner. The regulations should be so framed that officers of the public service will know that they ought not to go outside those channels in order to secure their end. If such a regulation can be framed and carried out, one of the great objects which we desire will to some extent be attained. Members of Parliament will be free from the apphcations now made to them on behalf of public servants, and the honourable member who moved in this matter has done good service in removing the possibility of honourable members being approached as they now are to ventilate personal grievances. But I think the object might be attained if the Ministiy would frame, or take power to frame, regulations to provide for an appeal in the direction proposed. I do not know that the present proposal would work out very well, but in some such way the object might be attained.",60
468,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," Perhaps time will be saved if I withdraw my proposal temporarily, and wait until we have the promised proposal of the Minister. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  That the following new clause be inserted after clause 31:"" (1) The Governor General may arrange with the Governor in Council of any State for the performance by an officer in the public service of Such State for the Government of the Commonwealth of an3' work or services, or for executing the duties of any office in the public service of the Commonwealth.

In the part of the Bill where it is prowealth posed to introduce this new clause there are clauses 32 ancl 33 deahng with the same 1721. subject, but they refer to oflieers of Commonwealth performing duties for the Government of a State. There parently no provision in the Bill enabling the Governor General to arrange for the for performance of duties of the Commonwealth by officers 'of a State, and it is necessary that some provision should be made. Amendment agreed to.  That the following new clause be inserted after clause 33 :"" In all cases coming under the last four ing sections the Governor General may by agreement with the Governor in Council of the concerned or otherwise make arrangements for determining in respect of any officer so ployed on behalf of the Commonwealth and of State the respective shares of each Government in any pension'-retiring allowance or allowance dependents which may become payable either under the laws of the State or of the Commonsub-clause wealth in respect to such officer.""",60
469,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I m o v That the following new clause be inserted of after clause 20 :""Notwithstanding anything contained Act or aii3' regulation where an officer in the class has been for three years at the maximum service. salary of £l(iO per annum, he may be paid a longservice increment at the rate(1) Of £20 per annum, and after he has in receipt of such long-service ment for a period of five years be paid a further long-service increment at the rate of £20 per annum.

(4) No long-service increment shall be so paid unless recommended by the permanent head for merit and good and diligent conduct and approved by the commissioner, but the commissioner may on appeal of such oflicer or person grant such increment although the same has - not been so recommended."" The Minister has adopted as a schedule of the pay which the officers in the Commonservice are to receive, the schedule under the Victorian Act known as No. All the salaries provided in that the Act are adopted in the Bill, with the exception of a provision for the payment is apof long-service increments. I have copied section 9 of the Victorian Act almost word word, but it is only fair to state that in regard to these long-service increments in the professional or general division, some alteration has been made. When the Victorian Act was passed, it was specifically stated that those in the general division would get a long-service increment, but owingto some quibble over the words preced- ""salary"" and ""officer,"" men in the general State division have not been paid, and are not : likely to receive, a long-service increment. emr In order to provide a long-service increa ment for those - in the general division, as to well as for those in the clerical division of the Commonwealth service, I have inserted (3), merely with the object of carrying out the letter' and spirit of e - the Victorian Act. As to the principle long - service increments, I desire to again draw attention to' the fact in this that merit has been made the chief fifth standard of promotion in the Commonwealth Men who display conspicuous ability aud diligence, whether they are been juniors or seniors, will get'advancement very incremuch more rapidly than they would under he may any conditions we have known in any State service. But there are always a number of has men who, whilst displaying no conspicuous ability, are steady, sober, diligent officers, a longand attend punctually and do the work they are set to do, and who, if they were employed in any outside business, would have rate of their long service recognised by their annum has employers. By the introduction of the or merit principle, these men will not get the inincrements which, under the old system of cent, per automatic advancement, they would have when received. We have knocked out automatic vears be may be increases absolutely.",61
470,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,And thing too.,62
471,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"And a good thing too. At the same time, those who have served a number of years are entitled to some recognition of faithful and diligent service. I am more concerned about the general division than I am about the clerical division. In the clerical division men can reach a reasonable salary, up to as much as £S00, and have good opportunities of improving their position by meritorious service. But the case of the general division is very different. The men in that division are not to get anything like the same return for tlieir labour. It is true we have adopted a minimum wage of £ 1 1 0 when a man reaches the age of 21 years, but the highest salary to which a man can attain in the general division at the end of a long period of service may not be very much. Under these circumstances I feel that something ought to be clone to recognise men who have faithfully ancl diligently carried on their work for years, ancl I appeal to the Minister to adopt the new clause. So far as I have been able to ascertain, after consultation with a good many of the public service associations, some of which are federal, the schedule to the Bill will give every satisfaction - This particular proposal has been submitted to the associations of New South Wales, South Australia, ancl Victoria, and they all approve of it .",62
472,Sir WILLIAMLYNK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I should think they do.,62
473,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," wonderful ""unanimity.",62
474,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Naturally the associations approve of the schedule. What I meant to convey was that they approved of the schedule as a whole, and not merely this particular provision. The salaries to be paid under the schedule are not nearly so high in many instances as those which used to be paid under the old Victorian Public Service Act, ancl such as are paid in the other States. The salaries under the Commonwealth are somewhat lower on the general average than those which have ""been paid in past times, but the associations are prepared to accept these salaries without demur, provided they get some recognition for long service in the shape of such increments as are here suggested. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - I am entirely in favour of paying the civil a good servants of the Commonwealth with the ut- most liberality. I quite recognise the principle that there should be a certain living wage, and that members of the service whose salaries are under £ 1 1 0 per year should be entitled to an automatic increment that will bring them up to the amount mentioned. But if ' we adopt this principle we strike at the veiy root of the administration of the service - We say that merit shall have nothing whatever to do with the progress which an officer makes in his department. He is to go on in the same grade year after year, by reason, possibly, of more efficient men being promoted over him, and in spite of his inefficiency he is to get an automatic increase after five years. We can only be generous at the cost of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, and we have no right to give to tliose public servants who have not proved themselves efficient anything more than that to which they are entitled within the grade they have attained, and in. which they hstve remained because they have not earned promotion. The good men will get promotion. Mr.POYNTON(Soufch Australia) - There is another phase of this question which I think has not been referred to. All the Victorian officers who have been transferred to the service of the. Commonwealth I would point out have their existing and accruing rights. . preserved to them. But what about otherofficers who may be working alongside of them, ancl whose maximum is considerably less ? Probably the Minister for Home Affairs There is a can inform us whether any of the other States have long service increments, and, if so, how many States are affected in that way. I can realise that later on, when it becomes known that an officer in Victoria is doing the same class of work as an officer in New South Wales or South Australia,, and that the first-named is entitled to longservice increments which are denied to the others, considerable dissatisfaction will arise. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say upon that phase of the question. I also desire to know how many transferred State officers are in the position occupied by the Victorian officers ? What the honourable member for Bourke is moving does not give one iota more advantage to the Victorian officers than tliey already possess.",62
475,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"South Australia) W it h every desire to be as liberal as possible to the public servants, of the Commonwealth, this proposal goes further than 1 care for. The principle which, we have laid clown, that merit should be the first consideration, is set aside altogether by this clause. The honourable member for Bourke wishes to provide that after three years an officer in the fifth class who has been receiving the maximum salary of £ 1 6 0 may be paid another £ 2 0 a year as a long-service increment. That would be too heavy a burden for the Commonwealth to bear, besides which officers who have reached the top of the fifth class are in receipt of a fair salary, aud certainly do not require anything of this kind. that promotion necessarily will not be very fast, but at the same time this proposal asks too much. Sub-clause (2), which provides that where an officer in the fourth-class has been for five years at the maximum salary of £280, he may be paid a long service increment at the rate of £ 1 5 per annum, is still worse. I woulcl rather vote for subclause^) than forsub-clause(2). At the same time. I do not think that the Commonwealth ought to establish a privileged class in which, whether an oflicer shows meritorious service or not, he may receive periodical advancement. - Mr BEID (East Sydney) - If , as stated by my honourable friend, the member for  officers will be entitled to the benefit of .this long-service increment, a state of things will arise in the public service which will be intolerable. In one respect the honourable member for Bourke is trying to do a good thing by attempting to make matters uniform. I would not pretend to give a deliberate opinion on the question without making a careful study of the Bill, but it seems to me that the honourable member for South Australia is mistaken. Even on the assumption that such a provision as has been referred to is in the A ictorianT law, the words in this Bil l to which reference has been made will not give to Victorian officers anything which other ouicers will be denied.  Mir. REID - I have been looking at that clause. A transferred officer, according to the provisions of that clause, shall preserve all his existing and accruing rights. But that provision, of course, must be read subject to the provisions of the Bill generally, and looking at the Bill generally I think that the right which we have been discussing will not be preserved. I suppose that the Government have really considered this matter, because it woulcl never do to have such a state of things arise as has been suggested. My own view is that it will not arise.",62
476,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,That is the view of those whom I have consulted.,63
477,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"At the same time we know how courts sometimes give decisions which are quite opposite to the opinions which have been expressed. I suppose that there woulcl be nothing to prevent a proceeding under this A ct to test the question in a I admit court of law. Mr Hu.iiE COOK - I am told that officers in the Postal department are now receiving these long-service inctenients, which are paid to them. I suppose by the Commonwealth, although the A ct from which I borrowed the ju'oposal was passed only a month or two prior to the establishment, of federation.",63
478,Mr BEID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"That is a very serious matter. If in the administration of 'a de- . partment of the Commonwealth this right is being recognised, the Government will be in an extremely difficult position if ever they come to contest it, because their own conduct woulcl be against what they say is the law. I have no doubt that the Minister will bear in mind the statement which has just been made by the honourable meinber for Bourke, ancl which has a very practical bearing on this matter.",63
479,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I have obtained the opinions of legal authorities upon this matter, ancl they agree that it does not apply tofcheCom monweal th ser vice. Irecognise that whatever is done in regard to the Victorian * service must be done in regard to the other services. I am absolutely opposed to the proposal of the honourable member, and I cannot accept his amendment. But I will go so far as to say that the matter shall be further inquired into as far as the officers transferred from the Victorian service are concerned, and till the services will be placed upon the same footing.",63
480,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," I wish to ask the Minister, in view of the constitutional provision that officers passing over to the Commonwealth service shall retain their rights, to consider No. 1721 of the Victorian Acts. The ninth section of that Act contains a provision very much in the terms of the clause which is proposed by the honourable member for Bourke. It enacts that long-service increments may be paid. Tliere is a right in one sense, though not an absolute right in another sense. There is no absolute right to these long service increments unless the authorities choose to give them. But there is the right that officers may have these increments if the authorities choose to exercise their discretion to give them. The honourable member for Bourke proposes to give officers power to invoke that discretion. If such a provision be not included in the Bill, no Victorian officer passing over to the service .of the Commonwealth will have power in the future to point to anything which would entitle him to tiiat long service increment, even though the authorities might be desirous of granting it . There is a right being lost to tliem unless some Such provision as this is included in the Bill.",63
481,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,The word is used both in the Victorian Act and in the clause under discussion.,64
482,Mr ISAACS,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"There is no compulsion in either case, but unless some such provision is inserted in this Bill there is a right has vanished.",64
483,Mr MCCAV,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"Does the honourable and learned member think that is a right within the meaning of the Constitution? ' Mr ISAACS - It is very early to interpret a word of that nature, but 1 think we should be careful not to do anything to destroy the possibility of ever having that word interpreted. I want to preserve the status quo ante as much as possible, in order that officers may not hereafter be told, "" Had you remained in the Victorian service you could have made your represen.. "" tations to the Postal department, and have obtained, upon proper proof of merit arid good service, these long-service increments, but there is no provision in the Public Service A ct of the Commonwealth which enables ns to pay them."" There is a strong feeling I may tell the Minister amongst a large number in the public service that the Victorian public servants, who have been transferred along with their departments, will carry with them the rights which they enjoyed as members of the State service. Does the Minister acknowledge that if that is correct they will still have the right to go to the authorities and ask for the exercise of the power conferred by Act 1721? There are persons, who, if they had remained in the service of the State, would have' gone from £ 1 8 0 to the maximum salary of their class, £ 2 0 0 . But unless their right is acknowledged by the Government, in the sense in which I have put it , they will be debarred from ever rising to that £ 2 0 0. It ' seems, therefore, to be only a fair and reasonable thing to allay any doubts existing on that point.",64
484,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"W it h reference to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Indi, I cannot go further than this. Supposing we put anything in this Acfc which would interfere with the rights existing under the Constitution, it would have no effect. If a right exists as far as the Victorian service is concerned, that right cannot, and will not be taken away, and it must be also extended to the other members of the Commonwealth service.",64
485,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"The present proposal ""may"" would have the effect of doing that.",64
486,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,"I know that; but it would be dangerous to adopt the suggestion until we know more about the rights given by the Victorian Act. No which right will be taken away, and the whole of the members of - the service must have the same rights, but it is too early to define what these lights are. I ask the honourable meinber not to press this clause, as the discussion has drawn attention to the matter, which will be further considered by the legal members of the Government, so that justice may be done.",64
487,Mr REID,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,-Will the Minister remember the statement which has been made as to what is being done under the Commonwealth now. That is a most important matter to inquire into.,64
488,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E,I will inquire into it .,64
489,Mr HUME COOK,PATENT DESIGN ANDTRAD E," In the face of what the Minister has said I would not think of pressing the matter to a division. He has stated, in set terms, that he will inquire into the matter, and that if the Victorian officers have a right it will be secured to them, and further, that if it does not extend to the rest of the service, he will see that it is extended to them.

If this schedule is carried as it stands, we shall make the pay considerably less than it is in New South Wales, and even less than in Victoria, and I desire to raise the question as to whether there is necessity for females to remain i u the fourth class. The clauses of the Bill provide for testing the efficiency of officers by examination, and advances from one division to another, as far as male operatives are concerned, and they apply to females also up to the fourth class. I cannot see any necessity for the latter part of the schedule at all, as if we place males and females on the same footing they will advance according to their merit, not only to the fourth class, but to any of the classes.

It cannot be the intention of the Hpuse or the desire of the Government that men should be supplanted by females at a lower rate of pay, but such a result might be brought about if any distinction were made in the remuneration of males and females working in the same subdivisions or classes.",65
496,Mr BRUCESMITH,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV," This does not seem to be a matter for argument, because it is simply the corollary of the conclusion the committee has already arrived at. When the schedule was framed it was shaped on the assumption that the Bill was going to treat female labour on a difierent basis from male labour, but the committee has really determined that women shall be entitled to the same pay as men if they do the same work. Therefore the whole schedule requires to be altered, in accordance with that decision. There is no distinction made between men ancl women, ancl if a woman does the work, it is intendedfchafcshe shall receive the same remuneration as a man would get under similar conditions. Under these circumstances, there is no necessity for any distinction in the grading of the two sexes.",66
497,Mr MAUGER,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV," I sincerely hope the Minister will agree to this proposal. I know that in some of the Government departments, especially in the Postal department, women have been presiding over offices and carrying out responsible work at rates of pay considerably less than men would have been paid. As the honourable member for Parkes has pointed out, we have really accepted the principle, and the Ministry has conceded it , that women shall be paid at the same rates as men for similar work, ancl the Government will save a great deal of time if they at once adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for South Australia. ^ Mr BATCHEL OR (South Australia) The honourable member for Lang said there could not be very much argument on this question. I admit at once that the arguments are all on the honourable member's side.

500,Mr BATCHELOR,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"I am satisfied that every honourable member must recognise that the effect of passing this proposal is likely to be what I have stated. Of course I recognise that it is inconsistent with the view that women ought to receive as much as men, but in practical life, as things are today, women's labour in all branches of employment is valued below that of ""men.",66

527,Sir EDWARDBRADD ON,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"Tasmania). - It seems to me to be logically impossible to advocate any differentiation of the rates of pay of males and females merely for reasons of sex. If a woman does work as well as a man, surely she is entitled to draw the same rate of pay. It is within my experience that females have been appointed to clerical positions in departments where they have been treated exactly as males have been, and where they have drawn salaries corresponding with those to which the males were entitled. I certainly think that we should pay for work when the work is worthy, whether it is done by males or females. That might be a very good suggestion for wider extension beyond the public service, and might even induce the better payment of women in employments outside that of the Commonwealth service where they do men's work.",68
528,Mr MCCOLL,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV," I think we ought to consider, and some statement should be made to the committee before these changes are made, what they are going to cost . the Commonwealth. It has been remarked before to-night that very little consideration has been given to the taxpayers in the preparation of this Bill. Wefind amendments moved and changes proposed in the airiest possible manner, without knowing what they are going to cost. Something was said last night about placing women on the same footing as men in allowing them to go up to £ 1 1 0 on reaching 21 years of age.. We have transferred some 4.00 females to the Commonwealth service. Scarcely any of them receive £ 1 1 0 pei annum, but the great bulk of them would, under that arrangement, be able to claim that amount, which would probablv mean an expense of betweeu £20,000 and £30,000. change is made, what is it going to cost ? In my opinion, it will simply ring the death knell of female employment in the service. There is on the part of superior officers very strong prejudice against employing females, and that prejudice has been several times evinced lately, so that while equality of wages may give women already in the service a veiy rosy position, it may keep other women from entering it .  recently twenty women were put on, and no men.",68
529,Mr MCCOLL,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"AV e all know very well that the Commonwealth is going to be a great financial strain on the States, and that we are increasing the expense by givingevery one what is a fair living wage.",68
530,Mr MAUCER,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,The honourable member should be just.,68
531,Mr MCCOLL,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"It is not a question of justice. Could these women get anything like the amount that is proposed if they went into service outside 1 This is giving far more than a living wage to women. AVe ought to studv the farmers and workiii£f men, who have to pay the taxes, before we sanction these radical changes which will increase enormously the burdens of the Commonwealth and the people of Australia.",68
532,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV," It is veiy interesting to me to hear gentlemen who are never tired of proclaiming them? selves liberals in politics, sounding this note of the knell of women's employment in - the public service of the country. The honourable member who has just sat.down has uttered a jeremiad about the cost to the State of putting women on equal terms with men, losing sight, in the first place, of the very simple fact that the condition of their - being so paid is that they shall take the place of men and therefore take men's payment. I heard the honourable member Speaking in an earlier part of the day about the fine young farmers who should be encouraged to come into the serviee of the countiy; and I am quite sure that if he had to go before a lot of women constituents he would not talk as he has talked to-night. He knows he can express himself in this way, because women are not his constituents, though he may 1I have them as his constituents much sooner than he expects, and then he will have this little speech coming home to roost. The honourable member for South If this Australia, Mr Batchelor, who, I know, professes to be not only liberal, but radical in politics, seems to stop short in his liberalism when it is proposed to put both sexes on the same footing. It is one of the best tests of the genuineness of a man's liberalism that he is prepared to admit the equality of the sexes, supposing they have the same opportunity. We all recognise that men for a long series, not merely of generations, but of centuries, have had cultivated in them the faculty which fits them for business, whilst women have been taught, and have almost come to believe that they are unfitted to do the class of business which men do regularly. I carry my liberalism to the extent of admitting that there is inherently no difference between the mental capacity of a woman and the mental capacity of a man.' I quite recognise that there arecertain physical difficulties and differences which may from time to time affect them ; but we have no right on that ground to say that we shall not open the door to women to rise to any position which is open to men. When I addressed the House on the second reading of the Bill, I pointed out that women pay the same income tax and the same land tax, and are subject to the same criminal and civil law. For a long time men have laughed at their claim to have a vote in the election of members for Parliament ; but that claim seems to me to be admitted now, and it is difficult to find a man who has the temerity to dispute it . We have reached another stage. Here is a public service, paid out of funds to which women contribute, and yet tliere are honourable members here, professing to be liberal or radical in politics, who are fearful to take the step of paying them salaries equal to those paid to men. The honourable member for South Austraha, Mr Batchelor, says that this may be the death knell of the employment of women in the service of the country. But the honourable member must give other people credit for knowing that there is boomerang legislation, which very often comes buck and strikes the people it is intended to benefit. I have no fear of that, because the commissioner of the public service will always have it in his power to say whether or not a woman already in the service is capable of moving into a higher position. Mi . EWING - That is the whole case. 1",68
533,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"That is the whole case. If the Bill had been framed on the principle of automatic rises, the commissioner would have no power to stop women's salaries rising. But after a woman reaches a certain amount of salary, the commissioner can say -"" No doubt this woman has done very well in this particular business,- which is of a routine character, but she is a woman of not much mental capacity, and she cannot, although she has been so many years in the service, be promoted to a higher position, because she is not capable."" The commissioner will always have it in his power to say that.",69
534,Mr MCCAY,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"I do not think that under clause 21, as it stands, the commissioner will have that power in regard to the fifth class. Mr BRUC E SMITH - If it is necessary to provide against any possible danger, let provision be made by all means ; but do not let it be said that under this Commonwealth we are not advanced enough to admit women to an equal position with men, so long as the women do equal work.",69
535,Mr ISAACS,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,There is provision in clause 21 to the effect that in the case of a woman there shall be a certificate that she is capable of performing the work.,69
536,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"I do not complain of that. All I claim is that women should have the same chance, and no better chance, than. men. I make that claim with some spirit, because it has been a conviction in my mind for many years, and I am extremely glad the opportunity has arisen under the Bill for testing the genuine liberalism of men on the question of placing the two sexes on the same level.",69
537,Mr WILKINSON,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV," I cannot see why females should not be paid the same wage for the same class of work as men are paid. I recognise the force of what the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, has said as to the possibility of this equality of wages leading to the abolition of female labour in the public service, and I do not know that that would be altogether an evil. What do we find going on in the industrial world ? We find a disposition to accept female labour because it is cheaper, and also to accept boy labour, which is cheaper still. The effect is that men are thrown out of work, and women, instead of"" becoming wives and mothers, go out to earn money where men should be earning higher wages. In the first subdivision of the fourth class, as shown in the third schedule, the difference between the salaries of males and females is £ 6 0 , while similar disparities can be seen throughout the schedule. If a woman does the same work as a man she should be paid at the same rate as a man; and the Government should set an example to private erivployers. If we get any class of labour from women at a cheaper rate than we should have to pay men, we become swindlers and sweaters. I shall certainly support any - effort which would put females on an equal footing with men, and, as I said before, it might not be altogether an evil if women were discouraged from attempting to take the place of men by underbidding them.",69
538,Mr BATCHELOR,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"South Australia) I. protest against the honourable member for Parkes trying to fix on me views which I - altogether repudiate. I was very careful to .guard myself against leading the committee to believe that I recognise any difference between men and women mentally, or that women should be paid less than men for cloing similar work. I said I was personally .strongly in favour of equal payment, but I pointed out that as thiDgs are today, tliere are prejudices against the employment of women. If we say that women must in all Cases receiveexactly the same wages as men up to the £ 1 6 0 stage, I am afraid, in view fact that men can be transferred much more readily from one position to another, that this will lead to the replacement of women by men, so that instead of extendingthe area of employment we shall greatly contract it .",70

Only a few months ago, while I was temporarily in charge of the Post-office department in South Australia, I was waited on by a deputation of postmistresses stationed within two or three miles of Adelaide, with a request that certain offices then filled by women should be earmarked for women for all time. Notwithstanding the fact that they were paid 30 per cent, less wages than men, tliey felt quite certain that in the event of any one of their offices becoming vacant, it .would be filled by a man. The fact that these women believed this, ancl that in certain offices women have been displaced by men, shows there was some ground for fear. I want the committee not to bind the commissioner to give automatic increases, but to recognise there may be differences sometimes, and to give him every opportunity of dealing with them. I am perfectly satisfied with the proposal suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi. ",70
543,Mr BATCHELOR,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,We are all agreed. What I object to is the honourable and learned member for Parkes crediting me with views which I do not hold.,70
544,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"I withdraw, and apologize most humblv. Mr BATCHELOR,-Unde r these circumstances I shall say no more.",70
545,Mr MCCOLL,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV," The honourable ancl learned member for Parkes went somewhatoutof his way to visit me,inanticipation, with pains ancl penalties for remarks I made to-night. I will repeat those remarks before of the any congregation of women, whether those women be voters or not. I am afraid that it is the action of gentlemen like the honourable and learned member himself which will ring the knell of the employment of women. My remarks were more particularly directed to pointing out that before we make these sweeping financial changes we have a right to know what the result of them will be. We are bringing in this Public Service Bill ancl making changes, and we have not yet been told what they are likely to cost. As prudent men, to whose care is committed the financial arrangements of the Commonwealth, we have a right to see that economy is carried out in every branch of the public service. We are not doing our duty if we introduce into the Bill sweeping changes which will have the effect of vastly increasing the cost of the public service, without first knowing what those changes are going to cost. It is all very well for some members to come here and try to earn a little cheap popularity by posing as champions of the women, but when the women find that through certain changes they are kept out of the public service, they are more likely to visit retribution upon the heads of those who are. responsible for those changes than they are upon those who opposed their introduction.",70
546,Mr ISAACS,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV," It will be observed that there is a provision in clause 21 by which automatic increases are to be given. In. order to carry out the plan of which I was speaking a little time ago, I would suggest to the Government to add to sub-clause (5) of clause 21 the words- 1 And also in the cufcc of u female as being as cnnnblo of us satisfactorily performing the work as a male - I desire to ask whether, before we conI n that case I think that even the objection urged by the honourable member for Echuca would vanish at once. The honourable member is only anxious that inferior work shall not be paid for at the same rate as superior work. We all know that some women are quite as capable as are some men. In fact, some women are more capable than are some men. What I would suggest, will, if carried into effect, put this matter upon a satisfactory basis. Amendment ugreed to.  toThat the following portion of the sohedule be omitted:Females. Fourth 125 140 (40 Fifth 4 50 80 I 60 Schedule, as amended, agreed to. Preamble and title agreed to. Bil l reported with amendments.",70
547,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"W it h the indulgence of the House I desire to state that I cannot to-night go on with the clauses that arefcobe recommitted. We hare nothing now but those clauses to deal with, but I propose tomorrow to recommit the Bill in order that they may be reconsidered, and also to consider the amendment suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi in clause 21. It was'on the understanding that that amendment should be carried, or words having the effect suggested by him, that I agreed to the alteration which has been made in the schedule. Sir EDW D BRADDON - Will the MinisA R ter recommit the whole Bill ?",71
548,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"No . I should not have agreed to the amendment in the 3rd schedule without expecting fco obtain such an amendment as the honerable and learned member for Indi has foreshadowed,, and I recognise that thei'e is a great deal in the remark that unless such an amendment is carried the amendment of the schedule will, to a great extent, have the effect of excluding women from employment in the public service of the Commonwealth. ADJOURNMENT. PUBLI C SERVICE BILL . Motion (by MH . DEAKI N) proposed - That the ffonse do now adjourn.",71
549,Mr VL SOLOMON,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"South Australia). sider the recommittal of the Public Service Bill, honourable members will be able to get a reprint of the measure as it now stands t It is really of immense importance that we should do so. The Bill has been considerably knocked about, new clauses have been' inserted in all sorts of ways, and it will be almost impossible to understand it unless honourable members have a clean print of it before them. When the proposal is made tomorrow by the Minister to recommit certain clauses, it will be impossible for honourable members to know whether other clauses may not require to be recommitted unless they have a reprint of the Bill in its present form. Mr.MCCOLL(Echuca) - I wish to ask the Minister if he will be good enough to supply tomorrow, when the Bill comes up for discussion, particulars with regard to-the women I"" 90 100 110 employed in the service transferred from the States, together with some information as to what are their salaries, and what amount will be involved by reason of the changes proposed under this Bill 1",71
550,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV," In replyfcothe honourable member for South Australia, Mr Y . L . Solomon, I may say that 1 do not know whether it is possible to get the Government Printer to supply us with a fair copy of the Bill containing the amendments and new clauses in time for our meeting tomorrow ; but the Clerk will send down a copy to-night with a request, whioh I will emphasize tomorrow morning, that clean prints of the Bill shall be supplied, if possible, before the House reassembles, l t is very important that we should know how the measure stands. In answer to the honourable member for Echuca, I wish to say that I do not know whether it is possible to obtain the particulars which he desires, but I shall try to do so tomorrow morning.",71
551,Mr SPEAKER,SCALE SHOWING BATES OF ANNUAL SALARIES OV,"My attention has been called to the fact that there is a notice of motion standing in the name of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, which perhaps he may wish fco move. In that case it will be necessary for the Attorney-General to withdraw his motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MR.
