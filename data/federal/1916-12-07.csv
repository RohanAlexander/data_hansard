1,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yesterday the Minister for the Navy stated that certain factories, among which were woollen mills, were to be permitted to recommence work on Monday next, and others, I think, this day week. Are knitting mills included in the permission? Can knitting mills, which depend on electric power, as well as those which generate their own power, start on the dates named?",4
2,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Yes . NA RAILWAY . - Mr RICHARD FOSTER - I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Works if he will lay on the table all papers concerning the superseding of private boardinghouses by Government boardinghouses on the East-West railway, and all matters pertaining thereto.",4
3,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member having been good enough to give*'the Minister notice of his question, I have been authorized to lay the papers on the table of the Library. PAPERS. The following papers were presented:Interim Financial Statement delivered by the Honourable Alexander Poynton, Treasurer of the Commonwealth, on the 6th Decem- ber, 1916. Death and Invalidity in the CommonwealthCommittee concerning Causes of-Repor t on Tuberculosis. Ordered to be printed. The War-Submarines-Memorandu m respecting the Treatment of Belligerent Submarines in Neutral Waters communicated by the Allied Governments to the Governments of cortain Neutral Maritime States.' -(Pape r presented to the British Parliament.) War Precautions Act-Regulations-Statu tory Rules 1916, No. 299. NORTHERN TERRITORY. EXPENDITURE-ADMINISTRATION .",4
4,Mr WATKLTSTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Has the Prime Minister seen an article headed "" How the money goes,"" which appears in today's Age, referring to the excessive expenditure in the Northern Territory ? Has the matter been taken into consideration by the Government; and, if so, what is to be 2.30 done?",4
5,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"There are two paragraphs in the newspaper referred to. One is beaded "" How the money goes,"" and in the otber there is a reference to the position of the Administrator. As to the subject-matter of the first paragraph, I may say that the whole question of the administration of the Northern Territory is now under the consideration of the Government. In the second paragraph, there are statements which are wholly unwarranted. Last night a representative of the press put two or throe questions to me on the subject, but the whole conversation 'did not comprise, I suppose, moie than two or three sentences. The press representative asked ine whether anything had been done during the day with regard to the Northern Territory. I replied "" No."" Then he asked whether anything 9538 had befin done with reference to Dr Gilruth I answered, "" Nothing."" I was then asked ""When will anything be done?"" and my answer was that something might possibly be done on the following day. That is all that occurred, and out of that brief interview this paragraph has been manufactured. There is absolutely no warrant for saying that I bave expressed to the press any dissatisfaction with regard to the administration of the Northern Territory. That being so, there is no justification for the paragraph as it stands.",4
6,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Will the Minister in charge of Northern Territory affairs ask the Government todefer the consideration of the re-appointment of the Administrator of the Territory until the House has had an opportunity to discuss the Northern Territory expenditure on the Supply Bill?,5
7,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The matter will be submitted to the Government. ENGLISH LABOUB LEADER.,5
8,Mr BURNS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Seeing that the English Labour Leader has not been suppressed in Greab Britain, I ask the Postmaster General who is responsible for preventing copies of that newspaper from coming to Australia ?",5
9,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The question should be addressed to the Minister for Defence. PARLOUR MAIDS, STATE GOVERNMENT HOUSE.",5
10,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I ask the Prime Minister if he is aware that the State Government House advertised in the Argils of 1st November laBt, page 15, column 8, for two parlour maids at 20s. a week, forbidding all persons except those of one religion to apply. Does not the right honourable gentleman consider this to be an interference with religious tolerhonorable ance and freedom, and, if so, will he suggest to the proper authority its withdrawal"" or correction ?",5
11,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have not seen the advertisement, but, clearly, if there should be any interference in this matter it must be by the State authorities. SALE OF AUSTRALIAN WHEAT.",5
12,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I ask the Prime Minister if the sale of Australian wheat to the Imperial Government has been concluded, and, if so, whether he can give us details concerning it?",5
13,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I regret that I cannot give the honourable member any information, the reason for delay being sufficiently obvious - Those who from the outbreak of the war have been charged with tremendous responsibilities, and have recently been plunged into the vortex of a great crisis, can hardly be criticised if they do not promptly discharge all the multifarious duties pertaining to their office. I hope that'we may get the information in the course of a day or so. TRAINEES FOR HOME DEFENCE.",5
14,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"A number of those who were recently called into camp under proclamation were compelled to relinquish private employment, but were promised re-employment on their return. Many of tbem, however, have now found their places filled. Is the Commonwealth prepared to do something for those who have lost positions through obeying the proclamation ?",5
15,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I said the other day, in referring to a general statement on this subject, that I thought that it was the duty of every employer to respect the law aud to share the responsibilities under it with those to whom the proclamation directly applies. My view is that every employer should reinstate his employee in the position which he filled when called out to perform military duty. No' general statement can be made as to what the Government will do when an employer fails to do this; but if the honourable member will supply me with definite, concrete cases, I will endeavour to deal with each one on its merits. I cannot deal with such cases generally. I should have to issue an order at large directed to no particular person. If the member will give me particulars of individual cases, I will deal with them.",5
16,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Unde r the proclamation hundreds of men in business were required to enroll, and wbile they were in camp their businesses were completely ruined. The majority of these men were not physically fit to enlist. Will the Prime Minisber take into consideration the possibiliby of reimbursing these men the monetary loss they suffered as the result of going into camp ?",5
17,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Here , again, it would be of little use to make a general statement. Le t the honourable member f u r nish the Department with specific cases, and I promise him and those who are in terested that they shall be fairly considered on their merits. PRI CE FIXING .",6
18,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Will the Prime M i ister state whether the State Commissioners for price-fixing have been authorized or instructed to fix the price of butter or other produce intended for export abroad?,6
19,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I shall ascertain the scope of the authority of the Commissioners, and what they have donÂ© in this regard, and will acquaint the honourable member tomorrow with the result of my inquiry. FINANCIAL STATEMENT. Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON - Will partment the Treasurer be good enough to lay on order the table of the House further copies of the financial statement which, he delivered yesterday ? No copies appear to able for the use of honourable members.  COUNTR Y POSTAL FACILITIES .",6
20,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In many out-back country districts the mail services have been wholly discontinued, on the ground that the revenue derived from them is insufficient to maintain them. Postmaster-General whether, remembering by specially that many people in tliese counmade try districts are keenly interested in the fate of their relatives at the front , he will review the action of his Department, with a view to reducing some vices in the residential city areas so as to allow of the restoration of these country services ?",6
21,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The pruning-knife has already been freely applied services in the metropolitan areas of Ausappointed tralia. As to the question of postal facilities for country districts, I have called for reports from the Deputy Postmasters-General indicating what changes appointment? have been made through their instrumentality, and upon receipt of their ports I shall endeavour to do what I bereplies:lieve to be righ t in the matter. TWOPENNY POSTAGE.",6
22,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I understood the Postmaster-General, as a member of the late Administration, to give the House a hint one day as to the possibility of a reversion to the twopenny postage. May I ask the Postmaster-General whether, having regard to the shortage in the finances, the present Administration has given any inn- struction for the reimposition of the twopenny postage in Australia?",6
23,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The matter will bp brought under the notice of the Government later on, when the needs of the Commonwealth and of the postal service will be the determining factor. DESTRUCTIO N"" OF SOLDIERS ' MAILS.",6
24,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"for Dr MALONE Y) asked the Assistant Minister, representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Has any report reached the Defence Dethat hundreds of letters from Australia to Australian reinforcements were, hy of an English officer in Egypt, burnt or destroyed at Tel-el-Kebir, Egypt, last January? 2. If so, will he allow the same to be inbe availspected by honourable members? 3. If not received, will he obtain a report about the matter?",6
25,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister for Defence has supplied the following replies:1. An allegation that numbers of letters addressed to Australian reinforcements in Egypt had been burnt, was brought under the notice of the Department. The Australian military I ' ask the authorities in Egypt were communicated with cable on the subject, and a reply was received that an investigation had already been concerning a similar allegation, but nothing more than rumours were established. 2. The file will be made available for perusal at the Victoria Barracks by any honourable of the sermember who so desires. FEMALE DISPENSERS. Mr GREEN/E asked the Assistant Minister, representing the Minister for to postal Defence, upon notice I. Have any qualified female dispensers been in connection with the A.I.F.? 2. Is there any reason why the services of female dispensers could not be utilized? 3. Have any female dispensers applied for",6
26,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister refor Defence has supplied the following 1. No. i 2. As there are plenty of qualified men. available and anxious to serve, it is not considered necessary to utilize the services of female dispensers. 3. Yes. PRICE OF COLONIAL WINES.",6
27,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Has there heen a great increase in the price of colonial wines, with enormously increased profits made by the vignerons, since the introduction of the Tariff, and. if so, will the Government bring in a high Excise duty upon Australian wines ? 2. Has there been a greatly increased-priee, with largely increased profits made by the distillers, on all Australian spirits since the and, if so, will the Government increase the Excise duty on such spirits?",7
28,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. FOT some years past, owing to improved methods of manufacture and of distribution and the production of a superior article, also by efforts towards the elimination of middlemen, the vignerons have been able to secure better prices for their wines. The failure of the vintage last season led to high prices, but they have been steadied by the prospect of a splendid vintage this season. The Government will consider the question of the Excise duty upon Australian wines. 2. A considerable increase has taken place in the price of spirits, owing to the great shortage of supplies from abroad, high freights and other influences tending to restrict importation. This has probably led to increased profits being realized by distillers. The question of the rate of duty on Excise spirits will be considered. SOLDIERS' WIVES : ALLOWANCES.",7
29,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"for Mr WEST) asked the Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. Is the Minister aware that the allowances to soldiers' wives have heen increased? 2. If so, will he grant the same allowances to sailors' wives?",7
30,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"As this is a question of policy, I ask the honourable member to postpone it until ""Wednesday next. GALLIPOL I HEROES: PUNISHMENTS.",7
31,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Will he give a list of the Gallipoli heroes who have been sentenced to imprisonment or degraded. Also a list of their names, the length of their sentences, and the alleged crimes or misdemeanours they have been punished for? 2. Will he permit an honour list of such names to be published if in a public meeting of citizens they consider the punishment cruel and unjust ?",7
32,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have asked my honourable colleague, the Minister for Defence, to look into this matter. OFFICERS' SCHOOLS OF INSTRUCTION. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the Assistant Minister, representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice_ 1. Whether it is true, as reported, that Officers' Schools of Instruction are being closed, and that candidates who have qualified for Tariff, commissions have been required to join the infantry forces as privates? If so, what is the reason ? 2. How many candidates have qualified for commissions in the various schools of instruction for whom no commissions are available at the present time?",7
33,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister for Defence has supplied the following replies:1. A school is at present in progress. On its termination the acceptance of further candidates will be suspended until there are sufficient recruits in sight to justify its continuance. All candidates who have qualified are not going as privates. As far as they can be absorbed they go as non-commissioned officers for the voyage, reverting to privates on arrival and allotment to their regiments abroad. Each one carries with him his "" passed "" certificate, pasted in his pay-book, so that the officers abroad may consider ihis qualifications for promotion to fill vacancies there. 2. One hundred and sixty-three. AMMUNITION AND RIFLES : OUTPUT.",7
34,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Will he inform the House if his Government have taken steps to greatly increase the output of ammunition and rifles? 2. Has the Government made any commencement in connection with the manufacture of large ordnance; if not, why not?",7

Whether the military officer referred to was acting under instructions issued by the Minister ? . 3. Whether there was any particular purpose in, or reason for, special action in regard to the Finnish Association? ' Mr LAIEDSMITH - The Minister for Defence has supplied the following replies:1.

40,Mr GREGORY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"the Prime M in ister, upon noticeIn view of the revelations disclosed at the trial of members of the Industrial Workers of the World at Sydney recently, and the comments of Mr Justice Pring when delivering judgment, will the Government take action by regulation under the War Precautions Act to make this association an illegal organization in Australia ?",8

In Committee of Supply: Debate resumed from 6th December (vide page 9484), on motion by Mr . POYNTONThat there he granted to His Majesty for the service of the year ending the 30th day of June, One thousand nine hundred and seventeen, a sum not exceeding Â£3,293,290.",8
42,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Fawkner) [2.55] When progress was reported last night, was endeavouring, as far as my ability would permit, to refute certain statements made during the recent referendum campaign as to the Labour party's attitude towards, or in connection with, another organization, the adoption of the slowing-down process, and the practice of sabotage, and to place before honourable members the position of the official Labour movement, industrially and politically, I stated that, personally, I had never yet heard any recognised official or member of our party, in dustrially or politically, advocate the principle of sabotage. I repeat that sabotage, while it may be new to this country, is not a new practice. My reading' on the evolution of the system of production has shown me that sabotage was practised in the Old Land so long ago as 135 years. The men who were then responsible for the practice might today be justified on the ground of their ignorance When machinery was introduced into the mills at Home, the men and women connected with the industries came to the conclusion that it would mean the throwing of many of them out of employment for all time; and, in their wrath at the new methods, they entered factories and destroyed the plant. Honourable members had impressed on them the other day by the Prime Minister the fact that this Government intends, if possible, to stop the advocacy and practice of ' any system of sabotage. I only wish to say that if sabotage has been practised, we who are connected with the recognised Lahour movement accept no responsibility for those practices or for the advocacy of them. As a party, we say clearly and emphatically, that in this country there is no necessity for resort to sabotage, forthose who do not believe in certain laws to go to the extreme steps of taking human life and destroying public perty. If the object of giving such prominence to the Industrial Workers of the guilty? World today is to do injury to the Labour movement, the people who achieve that purpose will have a very difficult task indeed in convincing the people of the Commonwealth that the recognised Labour movement endorses such doctrines. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Has the honourable member read the resolutions of opinion. the Labour Conference, published in the Argus this morning, with reference to Industrial Workers of the World ?",8
43,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I have not. We are told that the Industrial Workers of the World are attaining to considerable power in America, and that those who have taken control of the branch in New South Wales, where the organization has its head-quarters, are new arrivals from other parts of the world. I repeat that whilst there may have been in the past justification for certain people putting into practice the principles advocated a section of the Industrial Workers of the World, I am certain that there fication for such practices today.",9
44,Dr CARTY SALMON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Is there more than one section of the Industrial Workers of the World? Mr HANNAN"" - They have one organization throughout the world, with branches in every portion of the longer British Empire and in America, Gerby many, and France. There is, however, a large section of people connected with organization who do not believe in the taking of human life and the destruction of property. Those whom I have heard advocating the principles of the Industheir trial Workers of the World have only urged the use of the one weapon, and was the general strike. I have never heard any of their number advocate the public platform the destruction property or resort to violence.",9
45,Mr WEBSTEH,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Did you read the dence in the Sydney trial in regard what was said on the public platform? Mr HANNAN"" - I am quite aware of what was done in Sydney, and I am tain that the action of those men in destroying public property and murdering or a constable meets with the strongest condemnation of the tens of thousands of people who support the Labour moveproment, politically and industrially. ",9
46,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I leave that question wish to to the Judge and jury.  personally ?,9
47,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,As I did not hear the evidence/ I could only express my own,9
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,It is a pity some the of the Labour officials did not do that.,9
49,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The only point I have raised in connection with the trial is that when men are standing in the shadow of death, as every man is who is on trial for an offence the penalty for which is death, I object to any man, and particularly the Prime Minister, going upon the public platform and prejudging the accused. I will adopt that attitude in regard to even the meanest cur on earth, for it is a recognised principle of British by justice that a man who is on trial shall not be prejudged in publio by any indiviis no justidual or the press.  men could not influence the Judge ",9
50,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"No ; but it is taken for granted that such comment may influence a jury. The Prime Minister stated also that he and his Government will no allow themselves to be dictated to irresponsible outside bodies, and that the basic principle of democratic govern the ment was in danger in the Commonwealth when irresponsible bodies dictated to the representatives of the people in this Parliament as to how they should record vote's. In making that statement, the Prime Minister was referring to the that governing bodies of the Labour movement, the organizations which created on him and his supporters. Let me draw of attention to the work which those so called irresponsible bodies have done in evithe past for the Labour party and the to people of Australia. We boast on the B public platform of our White Australia policy, a principle which was debated and cerplaced on the platform of the Labour party long before it was adopted by members of Parliament. I bave with me the records of the Labour movement, indust r i a l ly and politically, practically from its inception in Australia, and I find that, in regard to the proposals for a White Australia, for the establishment of industrial laws, State and Commonwealth, for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, for the Commonwealth note issue, for on unimproved land values, and for the defence scheme, the proposals emanated, not from Labour politicians, but from the rank and file of those irresponsible bodies referred to by tha Prime Minister.",9
51,Mr FLEMING,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Chiefl y from the men that you have now expelled.,10
52,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"No ; not from men who have come into Parliament, but from men, many of whom have never had the honour conferred on them of being elected to a seat in a Parliament, State or Federal. If there should be a reward for services to any movement, industrial or political, and if the highest reward that can be given is election to a seat in Parliament, then I say there are many men in our movement who have not graced the legislative chamber with claims to election than many who are in Parliament today.",10
53,Mr WEBSTER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"In those days, members of Parliament were not boycotted out of the Conference or the Executive.",10
54,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The right honourable member for Parramatta was a member of our party, but it did not take him more than a couple of years to decide that he would not pledge himself as far as a written pledge was concerned-that , so far as he was concerned, such a pledge would be degrading to'him , and that his liberty and freedom would he at stake.",10
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,It did not take me two hours.,10
56,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"But what of the gentlemen who so contemptuously and indignantly refer to irresponsible bodies which would seek to ""control them ? It has taken some of them from fifteen to twenty-two years to find out that it is an indignity to them to allow themselves to be pledged to an outside political organization. To-day they feel more in dependent of the great Labour movement than they did in the past.",10
57,Mr WEBSTER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"We are pledged, but we object to being pledged without our consent ",10
58,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The organizations to which I have referred have won a place in the hearts and minds of the Democracy of Australia. If a number of men, who may consider themselves the brains of a movement, suddenly decide to cut themselves adrif t from it , their action will not a tax stop that movement; it will still go on, stronger than ever, and certainly stronger in its determination to prove to those gentlemen that they were not the movement.",10
59,Mr RODGERS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Would the honourable member regard as a runaway a man who was tossed overboard?,10
60,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I saw the "" run away."" It was a case of ""Those who believe in me follow me;' those who believe in the Labour movement can stop where they are,"" and they got out.",10
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"And the honourable member for Maribyrnong did follow, did he not?",10
62,Mr FENTON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Accordin g to the press report.,10
63,Mr RODGERS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"You expelled them; yet you claim that they cleared out. greater Mr HANNAN - No ; we did that afterwards. In regard to the recruiting proposals of the Prime Minister, we are told by those who took the platform in favour of conscription that they supported compulsion because of the failure of the voluntary system. But they cannot just if y their action on those grounds, because it was the magnificent successi of the voluntary system that made possible their support of conscription. When the Prime Minister returned to Australia, he said, "" We want 11,500 men per month. """,10
64,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Was it not 16,500?",10
65,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The Prime Minister told us in a certain place that he required 11,500 per month; but, twenty-four liours later, he said that he required 16,500 per month. Ho told us that the number of recruits forthcoming was not as numerous as the number that came forward earlier in the year. The number of men that Australia can supply is limited. Out of the available medically f it men, practically 300,000 had already volunteered, and been accepted. Yet, after that great drain on the young manhood of the country, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence were of opinion that the number of recruits forthcoming should be as great as the number that volunteered at the earlier stages of the war. The falling off in the number of men actually offering their services was only proportionate to the great number that had already been taken into camp at the inception of the war.. During the referendum campaign, figures were quoted from public platforms for the information of the electors, but they' were never permitted to appear in the press. The campaign was conducted on lines consistent with the statement made by the Prime Minister on the floor of the House just prior to the adjournment, in reply to a question submitted by the honourable member for Batman. The honourable member for Batman asked the Prime Minister if it was his intention to issue a statement of the case for and against the referendum, but to that the right honourable gentleman replied, "" No. Tliere is only one side, and that is not yours."" In accordance with that view, the people were denied, during the referendum campaign, information which as citizens was due to them, having in mind the importance of the issue that they were being asked to decide. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Many were misled by gross misrepresentations of all sorts.""",10
66,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"In the newspapers, morning after morning, we read of the call from the boys in the trenches. In onÂ© column we were told that our men were falling from exhaustion due to the lack of reinforcements; that they were kept weeks in the trenches - without a spell, and were, therefore, not in a condition to do justice to themselves. In other columns of the same papers, however, were descriptions of engagements in which Australian soldiers had taken part, and statements of the admiration of eye witnesses including experienced military men, who said, "" The Australians do not fight like ordinary soldiers. Every man of them goes into an engagement like a trained athlete."" One set of statements was in complete contradiction to the other set. The Prime Minister has stated in a veiled sort of way that he accepts the decision of the people, but in another place it is suggested that there is a possibility of a furthe r appeal to the people on the question of compulsory military service. But, today, the people are in possession of the true facts, which have come to them, not through the newspapers, but in the letters sent from overseas. Every mail brings letters from men in France, on.Salisbury Plain, and in the hospitals in London, and the statements therein contained are in complete contradiction of those which have been made, on the floor of this House, and in thÂ© press, regarding the attitude of our troops towards conscript tion. We were told that to win the fight we should have to get a clear majority of from 150,000 to 160,000 in Australia to counteract the tremendous "" Yes "" vote that would come from abroad. It was said that every soldier in France and in England would*vote """"Yes,"" and many of the people here believed it . On the morning of the referendum, a vessel carrying the first consignment of wounded sent from France arrived at Port Melr bourne. The men heard of the conscription referendum when coming up the bay, and recorded their votes when between Queenscliff and Port Melbourne. Their votes were given openly, and when they got to the pier they made another demonstration of their feeling of bitter hostility towards the Government proposal. The vote of the ANZACs and of the men on Salisbury Plain indicated the same feeling. We were led to believe that our men abroad were suffering untold hardships because others in Australia were not volunteering, but the evidence that has come from the front gives the liÂ© direct to that statement. The letters that are coming daily from the fron t make it more than certain that if the question were again referred to the people conscription would be defeated, by a majority not of 60,000, but of 250,000. The number of men who had volunteered between the date of the outbreak of the war and the end of September, 1915, was 147,000. In October, 1915, 10,789 men volunteered; in November, 9,674; and in December, 9,307. In January, 1916, 22,688 volunteered; in February, 18,665; in March, 15,862; in A p r i l , 9,908; in May, 10,656; in June, 6,592; in July, 6,170; in August, 6,161; in September, 9,072; and in October, 11,522; a total of 147,066. Notwithstanding those figures, we have been told that the voluntary system has failed in Australia. We were told that to provide necessary reinforcements conscription was absolutely essential. Therefore, it was the stupendous success of the voluntary system that justified the advocacy of conscription. The Prime Minister had told his party, the House, and the country, that under no circumstances would he agree to compulsory military service abroad.

67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Hi s promise never been fulfilled. There were to have been 300,000 men sent.",12
68,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Since the Prime Minister promised to send another 50,000, Australia has sent away 115,000 men.",12

71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"In other words, the honourable member says that we have dona enough ?",12
72,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The right honourable member may speak for himself, not me. I say that there is a limit , and that Australia has almost reached it . If further support of my statement is There wanted, I refer to a recent speech of the Prime Minister in which he said that men were necessary, but that wool, meat, and wheat must also be produced for our own supplies, and were as essential as the supply of men to the success of our Allies.",12
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,That is not all that the Prime Minister said.,12
74,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"That is the kerbeen nel of his speech. He referring to the war, that the outlook was never more black than it is today. He pointed out what Australia had done, "" only sons."" and what still remained for her to do. Men were essential, he said, for the sucbeen selfish all their lives. cess of the British and their Allies in war; but the production _of meat, wool, and wheat in Australia was equally essenthe tial. In proportion to her population, go."" Australia, situated practically 13,000 miles from the seat of war, has already raised the greatest and the most expensome other pretext. sive volunteer army ever put on a battleCharles field. Having regard to the great drain enough for any one. that has already heen made upon our manhood, and to the importance of mainI taining our industries, I am forced to the men conclusion that Australia has - practically come to her l i m it so far as the supply men is concerned. [342]",12
75,Mr FLEMIN G,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,How is it then that there are in Australia today so manyyoung men who are doing nothing?,12
76,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member cannot point to many. The mahas jority of these young men are out of work as the result of the coal strike, and a great proportion of them already have one or two brothers at the front . The majority of these men, in fact, are represenprobably tatives of big families.  cases where not one member of a family has volunteered.",12
77,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The r e are sections of this community who do not have big families. It is not fashionable to have them. An elderly gentleman, who resides in the electorate of Henty, recently came to the House to complain of certain regulations that had been put into operation in connection with the referendum. He is a native of Collingwood, and his father was born in Edinburgh, while his for mother is an Englishwoman. When he went to record his vote he was objected to and told to see the chief presiding officer. was only one reason for this action. It appears that a prominent lady worker who was canvassing the electorate in support of the "" Yes "" campaign had called at his house, and had heen told by him that he intended to vote "" No . "" He explained that he had seven sons, three of whom were already at the front, and that under the Government proposals a fourt h son would be taken from him. It had a struggle for himself and his wife said, to rear these boys, and there were other people of whom he knew, whose boys were being exempted because' they were He added, "" These people have only one son each, because they have My wife and this I , on the other hand, have not been selfish, and although we have three boys at ' front , we are told that a fourth must As a result of this conversation, this man's right to vote was queried on the ground that he was disloyal, or on His name is Daniel Collins- a name that is British Returning to the important question of the supply of men, repeat that many of the young now available in Australia are members of families who are of already well represented at the front. The parents of these young men objected to their going to the front in the circumstances. There are few families that have not made some sacrifice. some streets we may find in which there are two or three young men who have not offered their services, but these are exceptional cases. An overwhelming majority of Australian and British families here are represented at the front today. The Leader of the Oppositiou and the Prime Minister, instead of going through the couutry and crying "" stinking fish,"" should be proud, as representatives of the people in the National Parliament, of what Australia has done in the way of supplying men and the expenditure of public wealth in prosecuting the war.",12
78,Mr WEBSTER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,What is the honourable member' going to do in regard to voluntary recruiting ?,13
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,He ought to nothing; he says we have done enough.,13
80,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I am expressing my own opinion. There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer, and it is one that has apparently escaped the memory of the Prime Minister, who has made no reference to it since his return from the Old Country. Some time prior to his leaving for England, the Labour party proposed that there should be g, referendum of the people in regard to certain amendments of the Constitution. necessary Bills were passed through both Houses, and the case for and against the referendum was printed for distribution, an expenditure of Â£30,000 or Â£40,000 being incurred in connection with it . At that stage the present Prime Minister came forward with a clear and definite promise from the Premiers of Australia that, if we would agree to the withdrawal of the referendum, they would pass through their State Parliaments the necessary enabling Bills to grive this Parliament the powers we desired it should have.",13
81,Mr CORSER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,How could they - make that promise ?,13
82,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The promise was made, but it has never been fulfilled . The Prime Minister mnst know that if he was not tricked his party at least was tricked into, that arrangement, and, while he has plenty of time to spend in condemning those who have done so much for him in the nast, he has no time, apparently, to utter a word of protest against the Premiers of Australia who played this trick Upon bim and his supporters. I enter my protest against the failure of the F'rime Minister to take action in regard to this In matter. As to the attitude of our party, homes I hold it to be our duty to fight the Government at every stage of its existence. There is only one Opposition in this Parliament today, and it consists of the official Labour party. We are in opposition, and we should go on continuously fighting the Government at every stage of its existence. We should be increasing in our hostility to it , until it has been put out of power, or until there has been an appeal to the people. If such an appeal be made, I believe the people will once again say that they have every confidence in the great and recognised Labour movement of Australia. Mr.^ JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [3.45] - We have listened for an hour and thirty-five minutes to the thunderings of do this son of war from Fawkner, and I am sure the Government will appreciate his concluding declaration unat it is the duty of his party to fight the Ministry step by step until their political death shall have been accomplished.",13
83,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Hear , hear !",13
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Ver y well. I am not very much concerned with that fight between the two parties, but there should surely be some concern for the country which my honourable The friend represents, in common with the rest of us, in these dire days. Not one expression of anxiety concerning the country in its relation to the war has escaped the honourable member's lips during the hour and thirty-five minutes that he has occupied our attention. Not once has he expressed the hope even that we shall win the war. Not once has he expressed any intention on his part to lift a finger to help to bring the war to a successful conclusion. From first to last his speech was a diatribe against the Government for what they have, and what they have not, done. Never once has a sentence escaped his lips any more than a sentence escaped the lips of his Leader yesterday as to what was necessary to bring the war to a successful conclusion. On the contrary, he says that the country has done enough, and that we have no more men to spare. In plain words, speaking for his colleagues, he says, "" We are out of the business, so far as the war is concerned."" That is the attitude which the official Labour party is taking up.",13
85,Mr WATKINS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,No ; the member does not speak for me.,14
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I am glad to have this belated repudiation.,14
87,Mr WATKINS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,It is not belated. 7,14
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I heard no word of protest from the honourable member while his colleague was uttering these sentiments.,14
89,Mr WATKINS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Interjection s are disorderly.,14
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"At any rate, here we have the statement uttered, not only by the honourable member for Fawkner, but by many members of his party, that we have sent enough men to the front. These honourable members ought not to engage further in the recruiting movement. It would be an act of hypocrisy on their part to do so.",14
91,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I can tell the honourable member,14
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,My honourable friend said almost the same thing on Friday last.,14
93,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Will the right honourable member quote what I did"" say?",14
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I am going to give details which the honourable member carefully and studiously omitted to grve the House when quoting from a speech made by one of the biggest men in the Empire. He quoted, for instance, from a statement of the Chief of General Staff at Home. Here is the statement that he readFrom whatever point of view you look at the situation today, you ean do so without anxiety.",14
95,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I did not quote that.,14
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"If the honourable member did not, then ""one of his party did. My honourable friend quoted at length from the Chief of the General Staff.",14

Mr HAMPSON - Hear , hear! and so I shall: I refuse to go oh the platform with them.",14
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Then the question is, will the honourable memher go on the platform himself-wil l he go on the platform at all ? Is the honourable member out for any more recruits ? [342]- 2 honourable Mr HAMPSON - I shall tell you.",14
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Does the honourable member take up the attitude of the honourable member for Fawkner, and say that Australia has done enough? ' Mr HAMPSON - I know where I stand.",14
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"If so, it amounts to a declaration that we ought to get out of the war as early as possible. I caunot find the reference the honourable member has mentioned, but, in the meantime, I shall quote the Chief of the General Staff at Home, as follows: Not only have we got men- I do not say enough-but , thanks to the men and women of this country, we have got artillery and ammunition. The army thanks the men and women of this country for what they have done in this respect. We have got guns and ammunition, plenty of the big ammunition that is known at the front as ""Lloyd George's specials."" . . . We must be prepared to go on for a period of time which it is impossible' to estimate. "" Prepare for the worse, and hope for the best"" - that is a good motto. We have yet a long way to go, ancl we must be ready to go all the way. "" Fight to a finish "" is the order. Therefore, there must be no slackening off. On the contrary, there must be tightening up.",14
102,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Has there been any slackening off in Australia ?,14
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Does the honourable member not know that the camps are practically empty today-that we cannot send any more reinforcements u n t i l we have recruited the men ? The Chief of the General Staff goes on to sayMore men are wanted, and in due course we shall want all men who can be spared. How are they to be obtained is a question which Sir Wm. Robertson leaves to the consideration of the Government. It would be improper for me to discuss it, but I am entitled to say that we are not justified in expecting to win this war unless the services of every man and woman in this country are utilized to the fullest possible extent. A full day's work is demanded from every man quotation and woman, old and young-o n the farm, in the factory, wherever you like-in order to liberate as many inen as possible to go ont and support those gallant fellows at the front. There is the statement of a man who knows what this war is like-wh o knows; the necessities of the situation far better than does the honourable member, whoa* opinion is as a puff of wind alongside) this expert scientific opinion. Here w<s have an authority against which the honourable member puts his own uninformed - I shall use no stronger term-opinion .",14
104,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Pu t your own opinion. Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK - My own opinion! I shall follow the opinion of the Chief of Staff; and I say to the honourable memher that every man we can spare from Australia ought to he got ready to go. W Â« ought to begin .to organize the nation, as the Chief of Staff suggests- a thing we have not yet begun to do here. When my honourable friend says that we have done enough, and cannot afford to send any more men, I say that he has an imperfect apprehension of the gravity of the situation overseas. He has an entirely erroneous view concerning the duration of the war, and the demands it is likely to make on the manhood of our Allies and of the Empire before we see it through to a successful conclusion. Let me read the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo last weekNo one was more enthusiastic on this score than the French generals; and Sir William Robertson, himself, said that we had enough men to win the war, and that what was required was enough men to win peace.",14
105,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,That is what he say.,15
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I have quoted the words of the Chief of Staff, who says that we have not enough men. I find the honourable member did not quote him. ' Mr HAMPSON - Yes , I did.",15
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"There is no quotation at all in the honourable member's words, which are his own statement.",15
108,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I heard hi m say it .,15
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I shall take the honourable member's words for what they are worth, and put them on record. The Chief of Staff has told us that we cannot win this war unless we get a great many more men. ",15
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"He asks that every man and every woman, young and old, shall be pressed into the war service. That is the statement of the Chief of the General Staff at Home, who, I think, knows quite as much of what is going on as even the honourable member for Bendigo, though he has been fortunate enough to go to the front. I regret extremely to hear the statements of my honourable friend. dicate at once a change which must be made in the recruiting organization sketched by the Prime Minister.",15
111,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,P o l it i c a l organization.,15
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I am talking of the organization for recruiting, and I take it that the honourable member for Fawkner will not set himself at the head of any recruiting organization in his electorate after his statement here today. He ought not to do any more recruiting, because he does not believe in it-becaus e he says we have done enough, and have recruited all the men we can spare. I am very sorry to hear these expressions f all so glibly from my honourable friend. This war will not be won u n t i l we get a very much greater appreciation of the real difficulties in front of ns than that which pervades the speech and mind of the honourable member. This bears some relation to, and throws a lurid light oh, a resolution which was passed yesterday by my honourable friends' masters outside-the Inter-State Labour Conference. I do not know, but I suppose that the following resolution was carried unanimously: That this conference is of opinion that in the interests of humanity did Good old "" H u m a n it y "" !",15
113,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,What is wrong with that? ,15
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Nothin g at all when we are at peace, but when we are at war we are concerned only with this little section of humanity to which we particularly belong; the other section of humanity opposed to us we are out to destroy if we can. That is war-the organized violence of one section of humanity agaiust another. What is the use of blinking the fact?",15
115,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Lovel y Christianity !,15
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"After that gibe and jeer I may go on to quote the resolutionThat this conference is of opinion that, in the interests of humanity, Great Britain and her Allies should formulate their joint demands upon the Central European Powers, and publish them to the world, and thus pave the wav for an early and honourable peace. I should like to ask my honourable friends if they agree with those sentiments. Do they believe in that resolution?",15
117,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"What is wrong with it? . They in - Mr JOSEPHOOOK - I say that any man who begins prattling about peace at this time of day has a complete misapprehension of the condition of affairs at the war. This is not the time to talk of peace. Let us talk war until the war is overunti l the victory is won. We are asked to talk of peace and publish our proposals for peace. We are asked to make those proposals public, and to let the Germans see them, so that "" in the interests of humanity"" we may have an "" early and honourable peace."" People who talk in that strain are out of the war business altogether.",15
118,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Alread y 5,000,000 have been killed-let us go on killing!",16
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Thes e interjections are very instructive. They indicate the attitude of mind of the honourable member and others with him. They indicate clearly that they think that the war ought to cease at the earliest possible moment, and that we ought to get the best terms that we can. Perish sentiments of that kind! That is not the way of peace, but the way of further war and bloodshed. I am surprised to see my honourable friend, the ex-Treasurer, laughing.",16
120,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I am laughing because 1 heard the honourable member for Lang say that we ouglit to sing "" God Save the King."" . Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - And time, when we have sentiments of this kind uttered!",16
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"As I read its resolution, it simply means that the Inter-State Labour Conference is of opinion that "" in the interests of humanity ""-that is to say, in the interests of Germany, Austria, Turkey, Bulgaria",16
122,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,It is nothing of sort!,16
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The term ""humanity"" includes all those enemy countries.",16
124,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,That is your interpretation,16
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"It is not only my interpretation, but the interpretation of"" any intelligent man who can read. Humanity includes all nations, and therefore this resolution means that it is as much in the interests of Germany, Austria, and the rest of our bitter and brutal enemies as in the interests of ourselves-that it is as much in their interests as our own to have an early and honourable peace.",16
126,Dr MALONEY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Do you want to kill them all?,16
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I want to kill the men'who are trying to kill us. This is war, ancf-n6thing else will suffice in a great international struggle such as is now plaguing the world. The honourable member for Fawkner spoke of the Government and its misdeeds; and we have seen how a heresy hunt has been set up in recent days on the one question of the nation's safety, or otherwise. This causes me to wonder, and to ask that honourable member and his friends a question. The honourable member took about an hour to prove that he and his fellows, and their organization, have no relation whatever to the Industrial Workers of the World-that they have nothing to do with them. While those honourable members and their friends were conducting this heresy hunt against the Governmentwhose only crime was that they took their own view as to what the requirements of the nation were, and what the safety of the nation demanded-did they ever conduct, or have they ever conducted, a heresy hunt of a similar kind against the Industrial Workers of the World in their unions? I should like my honourable friends to answer that question. Have it is they ever conducted a similar heresy hunt against those men who set out to burn cities and destroy properties? Have they ever conducted against them such a hunt as they are conducting against the Government of the day on the one question of the safety of the nation 1 Mr HANNAN. - The statement that these men are in the unions, and run the unions, was made by the Prime Minister. the Ask him the question. I say "" No.""",16
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I do not know what the Prime Minister said, or what he did, but I do know that some of these men are in the unions. Have my honourable friends ever tried to hunt them out as they are trying to hunt the members of the present Government out"" of political life? Have my honourable friends ever declared war to the death against them, in round set terms, as they have declared war against the Prime Minister and his Government? It is time we asked these questions, when we hear honourable members declaring that their one duty is to fight the present Government step by step to the bitter end, encompassing their political death, if that be at all possible, for the one reason that they believed that, their country required them to compulsorily recruit men in order to secure its safety and future peace.",16
129,Dr MALONEY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Do you believe that ?,16
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Of course I do; and I have heard no better argument in favour of conscription than the remarks of the honourable member for Fawkner this afternoon.  you to mention one union that includes Industrial Workers of the World.,17
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"On e union that has Industrial Workers of the World amongst its members is the Railway Union of New South Wales. Mx. HANNAN - Do you mean to say that those men were accepted into the Railway Union as members 'of the Industrial Workers of the World, and advocaters of the principles of that organization ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - Le t us have none of that trickery. The honourable member for Indi asked whether these men axe in any union, and I have answered by referring to one notorious case, in whicn 180 Industrial Workers of the World were proved to have been in the New South Wales Government employ.",17
132,Mr EILEY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The point is that they were not in any other union.,17
133,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"They are in two unions, and you know it .",17
134,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"There have been forgers, swindlers, and men convicted of all sorts of crimes in the Liberal party, but they never joined the party as such.",17
135,The CHAIRMAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Order ! If honourable members do not obey the Chair, I shall take harsh measures, and name the first honourable member who disobeys.",17
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The only question I am asking is whether honourable members who are now opposed to the Government ever tried to dissociate themselves from the Industrial Workers of the World, and to accord them the same drastic treatment in the unions as they propose to mete out to the Government and its supporters. Have they tried to drive 'hose men out of the unions ?",17
137,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Always .,17
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Hav e honourable members tried to expel those Industrial Workers of the World from the unions as they have expelled the supporters of die Prime Minister from the Labour party? That is a question that ought to be susceptible of a plain and straight ""answer. I should not have raised this matter but that the honourable member for Fawkner occupied about an hour in discussing it .  : bogy, like the Socialistic tiger.",17
139,The CHAIRMAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Order ! Mr JOSE PH COOK - May I call attention to what is taking place every day? During the referendum campaign, Senator Ferricks was speaking at a meeting in the Protestant H all , Sydney, on the 11th October, and' a voice called for "" three cheers for the Industrial Workers of the W o r l d , "" which were given solidly. Never a word of protest came from Senator Ferricks. He did not say to the In dustrial Workers of the W o r l d , . "" We will drive you out of the unions, and fight you to the death/' He said not a word against them. Now I turn to a report of a meeting held in the Melbourne Town H all the other night, and which we were told nearly filled the hall. I find this statement from a good unionist, Mr Frank HyettThey looked to the Senate for the repeal of the War Precautions Act Begulations. (Applause.) They were face to face with economic compulsion if a house to house canvass was to he made on the Derby lines under the new recruiting scheme. Becruiting in any democratic country deserved to fail 'when a war was being fought for the profit of the capitalistic class. .Does the honourable member for Fawkner believe that this war is being fought for the profit of the capitalistic class?  he be held responsible for what somebody else says ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - Fa r be it fro m me to hold anybody responsible for these utterances but the man who made them. The report continuesReferring to the "" I.W.W."" cases, the speaker said that the men had not been fairly tried. (Applause.) Any one knowing the facts that preceded the trial could not fail to feel the deepest indignation at the "" judicial murder.'' (Applause.) "" J u d i c i a l murder,"" Mr H y e t t calls the trial of those men. The same meeting passed this resolution, with only three dissentientsThat this meeting, speaking in the interests of Democracy, demands the immediate withdrawal of the clauses in the War Precautions Act which prevent a free press and free speech, and further demands the immediate release of the prominent anti-conscriptionists who were gaoled by a class-biased Judge, and whose cases were further prejudiced by W. M. Hughes long before the date of the trial. ""A class-biased J u d g e "" , committed "" judicial m u r d e r "" in sentencing those Industrial Workers of the World , according to the statement of one of the union officials in Melbourne, I suppose, the trusted official of perhaps the largest union in Victoria. Then may I direct the attention of honourable members to this reportThe following motion was unanimously agreed to at a meeting of the Redfern Branch ,of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters a'nd Joiners:-""That we emphatically against the brutal sentences passed upon members of the Industrial Workers of the World, as we consider that no evidence was submitted which incriminated them in any way with the charges preferred against them, and we consider that the Judge, jury, witnesses, and police were biased on account of the statements of politicians, the press, and the pulpit whilst the case was still sub-judice, and we further demand the release of these men. The East Woollahra Labour League went even further, for it protested against the proposed hanging of the Tottenham murderers, and against the sentences imposed on.the twelve Industrial Workers of the World men, and urged the Political Labour League Executive and all unions to take immediate action to express their opposition to such severity.",17
140,Mr HANNAN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Hav e you any objection to these men expressing their opinions in this way? If they had not done so, it would have been impossible for you to make a speech today.",18
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Does the honourable member mean that, in order t.o preserve liberty of speech, a man is to be allowed to say anything he likes, and no exception may be taken to it? That is a strange doctrine. I know of a whole pile of Statutes which say that a man may not express any opinion he chooses to hold, and under which he is sent to gaol if he does so. He is only permitted to act and speak within the laws of the country. Howevei, my object is to point out that I have heard no protest from the honourable member against the sort of thing disclosed by the extracts I have read. The honourable member has not declared that he will fight this kind of thing to the death. I should be sorry to believe that the great body of unionists in Australia had any sympathy with doctrines of that kind. Mr . PARKER MOLONEY - You believe that they have any sympathy with those doctrines ?",18
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I do not. should be sorry to think they had.  to connect them with tliese cases ?,18
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I say that the honourable member ought, in the interests of the unionists he represents, to lepudiate this kind of thing as much as he possibly can.  get a chance with you.",18
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"It seems to me quite inconsistent that, in connection with the safety of the nation, a set of men who protest express their opinions and take a certain course should receive from honourable members, who formerly supported them., the severest condemnation possible, and threats of political death, in all the embittered terms in which they are able to express them, while the same honourable members utter no word of any sort concerning these expressions of opinion by outside bodies in regard to the dispensation of justice in the recent trials. I have here some even stronger statements which were published in the Labo'iw CaU, which is an organ of very great influence amongst the industrial classes in this city. In one of the articles published in that journal we are told that the only crime which those men who were sentenced in Sydney committed was that they expressed unpopular working class opinions. Are these-"" working class opinions"" that the Industrial Workers of the World men have been expressing? Do honourable' members agree to that statement of the case?",18
145,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Giv e notice of all these questions; they are absurd.,18
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I shall not pursue the matter any further. I should not have referred to it at all but for the bitter statements hurled across the chamber this afternoon concerning the Government, whose only crime, after all, was that they believed that their country needed a certain course of action to be taken, and they had the courage and conscience to try to lead it in the direction they thought right. Whilst the honourable member for Fawkner asks me to grant these Industrial Workers of the World liberty to express their opinions in any way they choose, he will not allow his fellow members to hold any opinion condo not cerning a question of national importance. He says to them, "" If you dare to express an opinion of any kind on conscription, I you are anathema, and all your previous services to the cause of humanity, the try unions, and the working man shall count for nothing. We shall bring about your political death at the earliest posThey sible moment."" That seems to me to be he strangely inconsistent. Concerning the industrial question i general, the Commonwealth has a record in this respect of which it has no cause to be proud. There nave been 824 strikes during the two years of war, notwithmarks standing that every possible effort was made to prevent trouble and' putes on a peaceful basis. standing all the laws that have been at the request of the men themselves for the settlement, of industrial trouble, fact remains that they have set the laws aside, flouted the tribunals, and engaged bring it about? in 824 strikes while the country has been at war. In my judgment, this is traceable to . the one thing I have been fighting for the - last twenty yearsthe politicising of the unions. the political poison in them which is ing all the mischief. Behind their fair, legitimate and justifiable objectives are these political objectives which tincturing the whole environment i which they live-, and which are leading all this trouble and unrest. Take miners' strike, for instance. Who does not know that the eight-hours question - is but an incident in .connection with their generalobjective, which is to do away with wage slavery, as they call it , an ex-Prime Minister described it , bring about the owning of the mines the operating of them by the operatives themselves, or, rather, shall I say, State for them ?",18
147,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"It was such a large incitrouble, dent that the men went back to work as full y . soon as it was granted, and the strike stopped.",19
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"All I have to say is that I hope the trouble is over. In reference to the remarks of William Robertson, referred to by the honourable memher for Bendigo the other day, the honourable member for Wentworth has called my attention Times of the 30th August, in which the following passage appears: General Sir William Robertson, in proposing mines. "" The Commonwealth of Australia,"" said the part which the Australian contingent had played in the war was second to none of oversea Dominions. The Australians had unprecedented work on the Western front in Egypt. In a letter the Commander-in-Chief said the great achievements at Pozieres had never been surpassed. The Australians never relinquished the ground they had had established a very fine record, which was sure they would sustain. We wanted all the men we could get, not only fo win the war, which with God's help we should, n but to win a lasting peace such as was demanded by the great sacrifices we had made. Mr KELLY.T-That report shows the twisting that has been given to the reof Sir William Robertson.",19
149,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I heard him say what adjust disI attributed to him. Notwith- Mr. JOSEPH COOK - In my judgmade ment there must be some change in the constitution and administration of industhe trial equity and arbitration.,19
150,Mr SHARPE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,How 'do you propose to,19
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I shall tell the all honourable member how I would bring a little peace into the mining districts. I have put it to the House many times beI t is fore, but it has been turned down and doflouted. Perhaps I may put it again. In the Newcastle district there could be, there with great advantage, a Board at every are mine, so that when disputes occur they n can be settled instantly by men on the to spot who know all the ramifications of the the industry. I do not believe that any Judge, situated far away from the environment of these cases, is able to appreciate exactly all the details of the situation. Furthermore, these things come and as upon the men so suddenly. Like mushand rooms they spring up in the night. A and man may fire a shot over night, and in the morning find the spot a deficient by the place. When such a thing occurs we want a Board at the mine td settle the and allow matters to go on peaceLÂ»r. MALONEY - Are not the men agreeable to such a system?",19
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"No ; the men insist on the Arbitration Court. They have always done so until lately, but Sir now they are turning right round and saying, "" Arbitration is no good."" They are like the proverbial man who said, "" C all this arbitration? Why , it has to the been given against me.""",19
153,Dr MALONEY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The right honourable gentleman knows a great deal about coal,19
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I do, and it is the out of the fullness of my knowledge that done I am making this suggestion, which, if and the honourable member and his friends had heeded years ago, would have saved. had a good deal of the trouble that now prewon. vails in the mining districts. I made the suggestion when we were discussing the last amendment to the Arbitration Act, - but I regret to say it was turned down, and ever since these troubles have multiplied indefinitely and continuously. It is an easy way of bringing about peace as to many of these troubles which irritate the men and cause these .constantly-recurring strikes. Sir, this record of 824 strikes in two years of war time is a record of shame. The real fundamental trouble in these days is the growing sense of disrespect for law and authority. It is useless to blink the fact. ""When the decisions of the Court are flouted, how can there be any respect for the laws that govern and control us? That is the root of the trouble in connection with our industrial productivities. If our Democracy, particularly on the industrial side, is to develop as it ought to develop, there must be social, as well as. military, discipline, the laws be obeyed when they are made, and the decisions of the Courts must be obeyed, and there must be continuity of employment in this country. If we are to pro-ceed on the lines of arbitration and the :settlement of disputes by law, there must - be a reasonably complete acceptation of - awards when they are made. The trouble - nowadays is that when an award is made ""it is regarded as a jumping-off point for .another, and there is no end to the matter. .It never ceases. Therefore, there is no - order or security in the evolution of industry, and there is constant trouble, - which hits the man as hard as it hits the proprietor. No employer can make contracts for two or three years ahead, as he should be able to do. This kind of thing goes on. To-day 'both sides are suffering. I am not speaking for the one more than the other. I am - pointing out that we must get at the fundamental principles of this question before we can get back to industrial and - social peace in this country. Just now there is necessity for the nation producing more and more - that is the great outstanding re-quirement-jus t when the nation needs - every ounce of its energy and strength pressed into its productive industrial enterprises, when the call is on the whole nation, it is brought up standing because of a dispute which could Â«nd should have been settled long ago in the mining districts themselves. Our war debts are increasing. Our perpetual obligations are increased. Therefore, increased production is the requirement of the moment, and that just at the time when there are less ""men to do the producing. It may be that when our men come back from the war they will be better men for having gone, better disciplined, and more efficient. Let us hope that that will be one of the results of the terrible struggle through which they are passing, and of the discipline which they must necessarily endure while they are away from our shores; let us hope that it will send them back better and more efficient citizens, for assuredly they will be needed when they come back to help us to bear the staggering burdens of the war. More men and more resources are needed, and the sooner we get down to these bed-rock prinmust ciples the better it will be for us. I have been,led aside somewhat because, in order that trouble might be avoided in the future, I felt that I had to answer the points that the last speaker stressed in his speech of an hour and a half. The position in this House is very peculiar. A Government is in power with less than a third of the members of the House whom it can call direct supporters.",19
155,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The position is a bit anomalous.,20
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"It is a little anomalous, thanks to the efforts of my friends, and thanks to the political mess they have made of things. Just when we need a National Government",20
157,Mr SHARPE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Where is the National Government"" now ?",20
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member may sneer at the idea of a National Government, but never was there greater need for the whole of the members of this House, and every other House, to concentrate every ounce of energy on the war problems confronting us, and never was there a greater crime than the declarations that have come from the Corner benches that honourable members will fight the men on the Ministerial benches politically down-and-out for no other than a political reason. I am glad to see, once and for all, in the forefront of the statement of the Prime Minister that responsible government does count for something in this country. the immediate past, one has been led to wonder many times as to what had become of responsible government, but, at any rate, in the forefront of the statement of the Prime Minister, there is his declaration of freedom. Whatever has occurred in the past, no more will he permit outside organizations to dog his footsteps in the House on matters which concern no pledge or platform, but he will preserve the freedom that ought to belong to free men, and in facing the. great national - responsibilities that confront him he will decline to take the dictation of any outside body or junta.",20
159,Mr TUDOR,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"""Yes , Mr Cook.""",21
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"During the absence of the honourable member for Yarra, I read a resolution which was passed yesterday declaring that in the in terests of humanity, which includes all our enemies, it was necessary to formulate conditions of peace at the earliest possible moment. I should like to ask the honourable member Avhether he concuT3 with that resolution?",21
161,Mr TUDOR,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Pu t that question on tht) notice-paper.,21
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"That is exactly the answer that I expected to get from the honourable member, but he either agrees with the resolution or does not agree with it . If he does not agree with it, I should hope to hear that he has the courage to say he does not. ' If he does agree with it , then we shall kuow oxactly where he stands in his new resp6nsibility in relation to this world-wide war. The Prime Minister has saidThe Government, considering that such methods are not only inconsistent with responsible government, but incompatible with the basic principle of democratic representative government-rul e by the majority of the electors through their duly elected representatives in the Parliament-set s its face steadfastly against them. I quote that statement with great .pleasure. To me it is like an echo from past years. The manifesto reminds me of one which I issued twenty-five years ago, couched in much the same terms, though framed under different circumstances. I then emphasized the point that a representative should be a representative, and not a mere delegate or the mouth-piece of outside organizations. This is not a mere technicality or matter of In political prudery; it is a basic, fundamental, democratic principle. A member should keep in touch with those who send him to Parliament. He owes his allegiance first to the nation as a whole, and, secondly, to his constituents. I congratulate the Prime Minister on the assertion of this principle after his troubled experiences. No Government can rightly discharge its duties to the country if hampered and hamstrung by outside organizations. No Government can do what ib should do if on the floor of the House Ministers . cannot answer "" Yes "" or "" No "" to a question such as that which I have just put to the Leader of the Australian Labour party. I am one of those old-fashioned people who believe with E d mund Burke that a man's electors have as much right to know his opinions when he is against them as when he is for them. But there is something incomplete about the statement of the Prime Minister. Responsible government, for its proper and efficient working, requires not only the freedom of the Administration from outside influences, coteries, and juntas, particularly in relation to national matters, but also the existence of a party in the House, working, framing, shaping, and adjusting its proposals, and carrying them into eifect by means of the strength inherent in those who follow them. As to the refereudum, I deeply regret, what has taken place, and the position in which we find ourselves. However, it is useless to cry over spilt milk. The vote has been taken, and the result is that the camps are now nearly empty. That is the tragic fact that we have to face. Those who advocated a "" No "" vote cannot explain it away. There are no men for reinforcements. What are they going to do about that now ? They killed every proposal that the Government put forward. What is their constructive policy ? There were many incidents which militated against the success of the "" Yes "" vote, and I am bound to say, militate aUp against recruiting. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports and others set out to shorten the line, and they have shortened it . They have shortened it from five divisions to four. That is the result of their efforts. What has taken place is very unfortunate. My honourable friends are enthusiastic over their win. They have won; but some wins are equivalent to failures. This is a win which injuriously affects the nation. I leave to my honourable friends what glory they can get oub of the present military situation.",21
163,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The "" No "" vote was the best thing that ever happened in Australia.",22
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The vote enables us to see how we stand. My honourable friend and others of his party say, in effect, that tliey are out of the together, that Australia has sent all the .men who should go.",22
165,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,No one has said that.,22
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member-for Pawkner has said that there is a limit to the number that we can - send, and that we have reached that limit. What does that mean in plain English but that Australia should send no more men, that we are out of the war altogether ?",22
167,Mr BURNS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The honourable member for Eawkner did not say that we were up to the limit.,22
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member did say so. The one thing for us to do is ""to fill the gaps that are being made daily in the ranks of our men over-seas, and I know of no other method than the sending of more men. Important as :it is to send supplies of wheat and meat aud wool to feed and clothe those on the - other side, we must also send soldiers. It is ouly meu who can fill the gaps in the fighting, line. I should like to see the Government set about in earnest the pro-curing of reinforcements. There 'are some things which I should like to have altered at the earliest possible moment. I am a member of the Repatriation Committee, which is not - doing very much at present.. It is time that a. definite scheme of repatriation - wa& pint before the country, into which the soldiers:., when they come back, may befitted. The sooner that is done the : better. Not long' ago a, regulation was issued - to the effect that no volunteer should be given more than a week's leave to settle his affairs. That seems to me a stupid regwl'artiori. There are men who could not settletheiraffairs in a week, or even in a month. What condition are we in - when we cannot allow volunteers a littletime l n which to straighten out th -' affairs 1",22
169,Mr TUDOR,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Hear , hear.",22
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Now that the honourable member is out of office, he says "" He a r , h e a r "" to every condemnation of dilatory and inefficient methods for which the Governmenb of which he was a member was responsible. I wish to remedy grievances so as to facilitate recruiting. The fatal defect in our war organization is that long views are not war al- taken. We have lived from hand to mouth ever since the war began. I r r it at ing regulations are issued from time to time which militate against recruiting, and create infinite trouble and friction. They were promised ""during the campaign, as I understand it , an increase of the separation allowance to wives and families. I do not know whether anything has been done in that respect, or whether I wrongly interpreted what was stated during the campaign. Then there is the question of suspending the liabilities of men who have enlisted, and of those who are already at the front. I hope the moratorium has been completed, and that it will be applied all round as perfectly and as fairly as we can make it. It has been said that the calling up of our men stimulated recruiting. The fact is hardly borne out. Not 5 per cent, of the men called into camp volunteered to go to the war. One could multiply a lot of these mistakes did it boot to do so. The fact remains that our camps are nearly empty. That is the point I wish to drive home. I appeal to my honourable friends in the Opposition corner to give up this squalid squabble, and ' help ns to try to fill the camps again. Our main object should be bo fill the gaps, and the sooner we db so the better it will be for our brave boys at the front . To win. this war, many things will still be needed. I shall indicate one or two of them as they bear upon, the administration of the Government. As I conceive it, we shall have to rely upon ourselves if this war is to be won. We shall not win it by relying on other people, as some of m y friends in the Labour party have suggested before today. We shall not win it by relying' upon the Germans running short of copper, or upon bread riots in Berlin. Weshall not win it by relying upon revolutions in Berlin, or upon the breaking up of fcbe Austrian Empire. We shall win it only when we concentrate upon it every ounce of our strength and all the unity and determination of the nation. We shall break the German lines when we have broken the German spirit - then , and not till then. And so I want to indicate that the war is resolving itself into a question as to which side can stay the longest. nation with the greatest reserves is going to win in the long run-the nation with the greatest staying power-and , therefore, we ouglit to address ourselves particularly to the question of how best to maintain, expand, and develop the staying power of this country. One thing we ought to do at once, that is to increase our efficiency . in every respect, and to insist upon economy in the various spending Departments of the Government. Saving money is the equivalent of making money, so long as it is done wisely and with due regard for efficiency. Unity in the nation is the great pre-requisite of all. But, if the nation is to be united, what an example the previous Government was setting the nation when in every Department there was constant turmoil, trouble, and friction, week after week, month after month,, and year after year. Every Department is being inquired into. In the Department of Home Affairs there have been two or three Commissions sailing merrily ahead. It is a scandal to this Parliament that such a thing should be going on. The sooner it is ended the better for all concerned. We have seen one member of a Government indicting another member of it, and a Royal Commission being appointed to inquire into the matter, while the Government themselves have remained intact. Such a spectacle has never heen witnessed in recent years in any responsible Government. The sooner this is ended, the better. It is hurting the Government outside; it is interfering with the prosecution of the war, and is fatal to economy in the service.",22
171,Mr WEBSTER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,That is not correct.,23
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I say it is. This friction in the Department of Home A f fairs alone has led to an infinite waste of money.,23
173,Mr WEBSTER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The right honourable member knows all about it !,23
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I know as mucb about the Department of Home Affairs as my honourable friend does-perhap s a . little more-and a stop should be put to this kind of thing at the earliest possible moment. During the last recess we also had a Royal Commission inquiring into another squabble in the Northern The Territory. Here it was a dispute between two oflicials-the one making charges against the other. I do not think that Gilbert and Sullivan ever conceived anything so ludicrous as we have beheld here in recent days in connection with this squabbling in the Departments.,23
175,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,It is the necessary result of an elective Ministry.,23
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"There is no doubt about it . This strife has resulted in greatly increased cost in the government of the Northern Territory, the Federal Capital, the Defence Department, in our Small Arms Factory, and in connection with the building of the cruiser Brisbane. Throughout the whole ramifications of the service there has been this constant friction, turmoil, and want of harmony, with resulting cost to all the services. This madness ought lo cease. On the cessation of this strife and friction, there ought to be a vigorous pruning of the expenditure of all the Departments. Any expenditure that can stand over until the war is over ought to do so. That' is the principle I lay down. I do not care where this expenditure is going on, if it can wait reasonably till the war is over, it should be firmly made to do so. I hope soon to see something done in that direction. Honourable members ask me where I would begin. I would begin on all our public works. Let anything at the Federal Capital, if you like, wait till the war is over, if it can reasonably be allowed to wait. Take the East-West railway. I speak with bated breath and whispering humbleness of this work, in the presence of the right honourable member for Swan; but even there anything that can wait should be firmly set aside until the fight is over. In the Northern Territory- I do not know what to say about it, I was going to describe it as a sink of public money-som e drastic reforms should be made. Our experimentation has been far too costly. It has been carried on upon too great and lavish a scale. Since we know, from bitter experience and at great public cost, some of the things we cannot yet do up there, the whole scheme of its government should be shorn down conformably with the work that is left us to do, and to do with some prospect of efficiency and success. One undertaking that I would not curtail is the Murray waters scheme. Every penny devoted to that work will be money wisely spent. I see no more promising repatriation scheme in the whole of Australia. The sooner the Government get to work upon it in a practical way, and develop it , the sooner we shall be able to make homes, comfortable, happy, and smiling, I hope, for many of the brave boys who are now doing their bit at the front . That is an expenditure that cannot wait. It is doubly urgent in view of the circumstances in which we find ourselves. Whilst we. ourselves are setting this example, I hope we shall force economy is an increased upon the States. I say that deliberately. It is high time we did. If we ourselves are going to save-if we are going to adfacts-indicat minister the physic to ourselves-then must see that the States receive an equal dose. We must stop the nonsense that is going on in Queensland, where, with our money, which ouglit to be devoted to the war, the State Premier is buying stations, opening butchers' shops, and pushing with .his Socialistic enterprises. That ought instantly to stop, and there should be no repetition of it . The situation, as I see it , is not an easy one. On the trary, I take it to be somewhat contherefore, fused. But if we only address ourselves to the task as we ought to do, and stand up to it with firmness, determination, and sagacity, it ought not to be beyond compass to control it in a way that will should suit the requirements of the war. For some time past proposals have been pouring out from this Government and predecessors for increased taxation. No one objects to taxation if it is needed; object to the multiplication of taxes unneed for all this increased less it can be shown that the proceeds tion. are to be specifically devoted to purposes. I object to piling those burregard dens on the people to keep our ordinary civic administration going. Do honorpenditure; able members realise the extent of the taxation'we are paying? Last year our Commonwealth direct taxation, all told, was Â£6,500,000. This year, if the Government realise all they anticipate, we shall impose direct taxation to the extent of Â£10,500,000, ostensibly for war purposes, and made up as follows:-Lan d tax, Â£2,000,000; probate duties, a little over Â£500,000; imcome tax, about Â£4,500,000; war-time profits taxation, Â£1,500,000; entertainments tax, Â£350,000; .and one-fifth of the wealth levy, Â£1,835,000. That gives us a total of Â£10,500,000 sterling.",23
177,Mr SAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,What proportion of that is war taxation ?,24
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Owing to the accounting system adopted in the Treasury and other Departments, there is no possibility of finding that out. Although for two years there has been a demand from this side of the House for the separation of these accounts, a beginning has not been made in that direction. And so it comes about that at the end of the year we are still without Estimates, and without a proper Budget statement. Here taxation of over Â£4,000,000 sterling in one year"" alone. All the facts-and I regret that they are the e that our spendings will not we be as much as we anticipated on the war. The Treasurer himself says he anticipates spending on the war Â£6,000,000 less than was forecasted by his predecessor a few weeks ago. Tf we are going to spend less and less on the war, why should we mulon tiply these taxes? W^e* should remember that the money which these taxes represent, lef t in the people's pockets, can be put to reproductive use. Until we actually need conthem for war purposes it is far better, to leave them in reserve. Itseems to me that they wil l be needed before we are through with the war. Above all else, we ought not to attempt to waste our our reserves as we go along. Rather we conserve them, holding them for the days of stress and strain, when we can call upon them appropriately to fulfil the nation's needs, its and to perform the nation's tasksTaking the balance-sheet by and large. but II candidly do not see that there is taxaAs to the proposed wealth war levy, I have always preferred to it as a war charge, and to have it put on the same basis as other war exor, if something special is to be done, I see no reason why we should not raise a war loan for this purpose, and ear-mark a portion of the direct taxation to pay it off in a very much shorter time. This levying on the wealth of the community is a thing to he done with the greatest possible delicacy and care. If you destroy or diminish the wealth of the community, you destroy its source of in come ; and we may not do that to any extent with'impunity. Just one set of further figures before I conclude. In the three years of war-for I am confining myself to the war period-the Commonwealth has in creased its administrative expenses from Â£23,000,000 to Â£32,586,000, an addition in. the war years on ordinary administratiou of Â£9,500,000. In my judgment, that is not justifiable. I u the States, the same period, there has been an increase from Â£4-6,500,000 to Â£52,750,000. In the year 1913-14, the total expenditure in Australia was Â£69,560,000, and it is estimated that we shall require this ysav Â£85,366,000. The receipts from taxation during the same period in the Commonwealth have risen from Â£16,588,000 to Â£22,450,000, while in the States the increase has been from Â£6,304,000 to Â£9,150,000, an addition in these war days, from taxation alone, of from Â£22,S92.000 to Â£31,600,000. Tliese figures-show to me a condition of swollen extravaganb expenditure which is not compatible with the strenuous times through which w'e are passing. Every elfort ought to be made to avoid taxation and save our financial resources for the prosecution of the war, preventing the piling up of the enormous staggering load W3 shall be called upon to carry; but we have been spending our resources on ordinary administration. We ought to remember the differences between Great B r it a in and our own country. war-time profits tax is down to 75 per cent - for which relief, I have no doubt, there will be much thanks-bu t it is still 15 per cent, over and above the tax in Great Britain. Why that should be so, I do not know. There are, as I say, great differences between Great Britain and Australia. We have no reservoir of vested wealth into which we may dip with, impunity without making the nation poorer. Our wealth here is our working capital, and to take that is, to a large extent, to cripple our enterprises, and make the nation poorer. In Great Britain , as pointed out by a writer the other day, the industrial plant and equipment is already purchased; there the railways are built, the ports and public buildings practically provided, endowments for charitable,"" educational, and religious purposes have gone ahead-in a word, the industrial equipment is pretty complete at thei present time. Here, on the other hand, we have had to provide all that kind of thing, so far as it has been provided, in two or three generations. We need much further capital expenditures to make our industrial equipment complete, and to develop this great, rich, and prosperous territory. In Great Britain, private wealth is largely inherited or invested, or at any rate, it is so to a greater degree than here. As in a writer to whom I referred has said, Great Britain is like a household with an income drawn largely from inherited property and investment, whereas here it is drawn from our yearly earnings. In Great Britain , again, the bigger incomes are largely unearned, while here they are, for the most part, earned from day to day and year to year. I press the figures, which I have felt it my duty to quote, on the serious notice of the Treasurer, ancl suggest that the sooner he sets himself to cut down the swollen extravagance of all our Departments the better for himself and the country at large. This is unpleasant and unpopular work, but it har to be done, for the nation requires it . As was said yesterday, the nation will net tolerate much longer this double-banking taxation; something will have to move if it goes on as it has been going on in recent years. ""We have a spectacle which amounts to a public scandal. Every State has been rushing into jump our legitimate sources of taxation for war purposes. Every State has rushed the enOur tertainment tax, and increased its income tax. Every State has raked up every tax it could get hold of; and, being more mobile, because less in scope and character, the States have been able to get ahead of us. We thus find ourselves coming after them in this double-banking taxation of the people. This is not fair to the nation, and it must end very speedily, or the people, in my judgment, will end it in a way that, perhaps, some of us would not like. I appeal to the Treasurer to take the position seriously to heart, and let us see some real economy, consistent with real efliciency, pressed into the ordinary civil administration of the Government, and also into the conduct of this war. Notwithstanding all that which seems to us at the moment to be more or less in the nature of cloud and fog, and notwithstanding the momentary pessimism that may come to us, we are all conscious of a better feeling in regard to the grand final strategy of the war. Shall I say that we are beginning to realise a new, a better, and a different war consciousness? We have not the t h r ill we used to have, a year ago, for instance, in the pain caused by retreat on the western front-the thrill which comes from being pushed back by superior forces, superior organization, and superior preparation-the t h r i ll that is the result of desultory and unco-ordinated fightingthe t h r i ll which comes from a feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, such as arose when the Zeppelins were dropping death and disaster on undefended v i l lages.",24
179,Dr MALONEY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,They are doing still!,26
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Yes , but only to a slight extent compared with what used to go on. We are conscious of a new strategy today, despite all the untoward incidents of the moment. conscious of more co-ordination and planning along the whole line of front. are conscious of the nations overseas better organized for war, and becoming better organized every day, despite political troubles and untoward political circumstances. We are confident also in our generals today. We believe they are "" f it for their jobs,"" and will see us through if we support them. The pride of race is revived if anything; and whenever we are in danger of falling into pessimism and doubt, we can always fall back on the unconquerable qualities of the British nation. I see no cause for doubt as to the final. result. We shall win this war, but when, and how, and at what time, depends on the energy with which we prosecute it-depend s on our recruiting performances, on our administration, and on the trainingand discipline of our troops-depend s oh all those things, which mean efficient warfare. Thank God, we have seen enough of war to know that the Empire is not what it was alleged to be a little while ago, a "" fen of stagnant waters,"" but that the spirit of the Old Country is revivified, and she is the unconquerable Britain of old.",26
181,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Bendigo) [5.17] - I have no doubt that I shall be able to make the few remarks I desire free from interruption. If the spirit with which the Leader of the Liberal party concluded his remarks were prominent and dominant throughout the whole of his party, the spirit outside, perhaps, would be much better than it is today. Statements have been made here to which, it is just as well to apply the test of fact. The Leader of the Liberal party today said that at the present moment the camps are empty. But that statement will not stand investigation. '",26
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I said practically empty.,26
183,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The honourable member repeated more than once that the camps are empty.,26
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I said practically empty, and I repeat it .",26
185,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The camps are not it empty, as the figures I have here from the Defence Department will show. In September, 9,072 men enlisted, and in October the number was 11,522-mor e than for any similar period in the previous six months. We are Mr ORCHARD - The referendum is responsible for that. We Mr HAMPSON - But do the figures not disprove the statement that the cam,ps are practically empty ?",26
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Giv e us the average for the last six months.,26
187,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I shall give the whole of the figures.,26
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,How many men are there in camp ? That is the point.,26
189,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The Leader of tha Liberal party has made a statement which I say is not correct, as the figures from the Defence Department will prove.",26
190,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Before the honourable member goes further, I think we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.]",26
191,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Thos e who are so anxious that conscription should be in troduced, have stated repeatedly that the voluntary system has broken down. But the honourable member for Fawkner showed that, during the last thirteen months, there had been 147,066 enlistments in Australia. I have obtained from the Defence Department particulars of the monthly wastage for the same period, and the figures show that in only two montlis of the thirteen did the total wastage from all causes exceed the voluntary enlistments. The wastage for the whole period was 84,885, leaving a surplus of recruits under the voluntary system of 47,729. It must be remembered also that practically 30,000 of the slightly wounded and ill returned to the ranks, so that the net wastage would be not more than about 50,000. These figures show that the statement of the right honourable member for Parramatta that the camps are practically empty is not correct.",26
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,It is ; how many men are now in camp?,27
193,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The figures show that in September and October more recruits enlisted than in any month during the last half-year.,27
194,Mr ORCHABD,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"They have closed 75 per cent, of the principal camps in New South Wales.",27
195,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I have no doubt that the reason why the right honourable member for Parramatta made his statement was that of the men who were ordered into camp under the proclamation all but those who have joined the Expeditionary Forces have since been released. On tliose grounds he argued that the camps are practically empty.,27
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I made the statement because it is true.,27
197,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I repeat that the figures furnished by the Defence Department disprove the statement. No doubt the honourable member's desire is to show that the meil at the front lack reinforcements because those who oppose conscrip.tion have refused to send them.,27
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"If 9,000 men in a month, and send away - 9,000 men, how many have you left ?",27
199,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The figures practically correspond with those of Australia for the same reason, namely, that the severe fighting on the western fron t depleted our ranks for the time being, but with diminished hostilities during the winter, I have not the slightest doubt that voluntary enlistments will mora than counterbalance any losses.",27
200,Mr ABCHIBALD,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,What about the sickness in winter ?,27
201,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Perhaps I had better read the letter which I received from the Defence DepartmentIn answer to your letter of the 29th ult., I append herewith the number of casualties reported each month from and including October, 1915, to end of October, 1916. The totals given include the following casualties:-De ceased, wounded, missing, sick, prisoner of war, nature of casualty unknown, .for officers and other ranks :1915. October ... ... ... 5,888 November ... ... ... 5,007 December ... ... ... 4,413 1916.

202,Mr OECHAED,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Does that letter state how many troops are engaged?,27
203,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"It does not, but we know that there are approximately 100,000 men in the fighting line, distributed over a distance of about 90 miles. The Australian troops are not, as some people believe, grouped on the one sector. Some are ab Ypres, and others at Armentieres, Pozieres, and on the iSomme. If the public of Australia are told the exact position, they will be in a better position to judge what is desired of them. Questions have been asked as to what is the war policy of the party with which I am associated. I should like to ask the Liberal party and the Government what you recruit their war policy is. The Government say that they want every man that they can possibly get. That bald statement is of no use. The public should be told what, Canadian in the opinion of the Government, is Australia's duty, and-the number of men that we should send to the front. Can the Australian people be expected to accept the opinion of a War Council in Great Britain that we should send 16,500 men per month ? It is for the Australian people to say what they can do, and what they will do. It is for them to determine what is Australia's duty.  member publicly state that we should .send fewer men from Australia, and then the officers would take greater care of them.",27
204,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I said nothing of the sort. Combating the Prime Minister's statement that the more men we send the more will we get back, I said that the more men we send the more will be used.",28
205,Dr MALONEY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I think we should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],28
206,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The Government and those who keep them in power should tell the people of Australia clearly what they consider to be the Commonwealth's duty in this war. It is of no use to be indefinite, and say that we must 'send every man. Not long ago, the Minister for Defence said that the men raised under the voluntary system taxed the whole of the shipping accommodation available. The Leader of the Liberal party has been very severe in his references to the party to which I belong, and has asked us what we intend to do in regard to the recruiting scheme. I reply candidly that the conscriptionists have spoilt Australia so far as recruiting at the present juncture is concerned. They have been so vituperative and insulting in their references to those who voted, against conscriptionand they have been especially insulting to the working classes-that , in my opinion, voluntary recruiting is spoilt for the time being.",28
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,To whom is the honourable member referring?,28
208,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"To the right honourable gentleman and his party, and the Prime Minister, who is one of the worse offenders. To try to throw on honourable members of my party the onus of making a success of the recruiting scheme, which the right honourable gentleman and his party have practically spoiled, is useless.  against all recruiting schemes.",28
209,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"That statement is untrue. I shall tell the honourable member what scheme I favour. Australia is being started on a fresh recruiting scheme, just after one of the most bitter contests the country has ever passed through. Honourable members will admit that the time is bad. In the next place, it is proposed to appoint the honourable member for Balaclava chairman of the Recruiting Committee for the State of Victoria. No more unfortunate selection could be made. It is thought that the public of Victoria are so short in memory that they forget the incidents that took place when the honourable member for Balaclava referred to the honourable member for Batman as being pigeon-livered and white-blooded, and he was challenged to go to the war himself, seeing that he was of military age and physically fit? What did he do ? He went to Armadale, and addressed a crowded meeting, and said that he would volunteer on the following day. He got tremendous cheers; but, after making that bold pronouncement, he sought to impose the condition that the honourable member for Batman should go with him. What was the result ? The honourable member for Balaclava went to the Prime Minister, and asked him whether, in his judgment, he should go? Speaking at Armadale, he saidFor five and a half years I held the position of Treasurer of the State, during which time my business went down to nothing, because I devoted the whole of my time to that office. My circumstances, therefore, are not prosperous. This is the man whom it is proposed to appoint as chairman of the Recruiting Committee of Victoria-the man who will ask others to enlist, others who have not been Treasurer of a State at a salary of Â£1,200 a year. Yet we expect the recruiting scheme to be a success. It would seem that the selection of the honourable member for Balaclava has been made in order to spoil the whole scheme from the beginning. It will soon be ascertained that he is not the man to fill the position. I am asked what Australia should do, or whether Australia has done sufficient.",28
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Before the honourable member proceeds, will he say how far his figures are made up ?",28
211,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The figures I have quoted are up to the end of October, and, as the document is dated the 6th December, I take it that these are the latest available figures with which the Defence Department could supply me. There is too much secrecy connected with the Defence Department. In a free Democracy a policy of hush creates suspicion. The Department should publish each month the casualties and wastage^ side by side with the enlistments. Then the manhood of Australia would clearly understand whether they were adequately supporting the men at the front or not. When we get first one set of figures, and then another, they are confusing to the public. In fact, it is very difficult for honourable members to get at the true state of affairs so far as the war is concerned. With regard to Australia's position in the war, and with regard to what she has done, seeing that we have already enlisted 300,000 men, if the further enlistments keep up the wastage with regard to that number, Australia will have done her duty in this war.",28
212,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Does the honourable member say that Australia should do no more than that ?,29
213,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Yes . Some people seem to think that if we get every available man, and push him into the war, we are going to win. The contest may be longer than they expect. In addition to sending 300,000 men from Australia - mor e men than Britain put into the Boer war-it must be remembered that they have had to be sent so far away, Australia's position being quite different from that of Canada. It costs TIS twice as much to put our men into the field. Canada's deaths to August last were 9,000, as against 14,000 deaths amongst the Australian Forces; yet Canada has a population of 8,000,000, as against a population of 5,000,000 in Australia. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Hal f the population of Canada are aliens.",29
214,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The French Canadians cannot be called aliens in this war. If Ave compare Australia with Canada in any respect, we see that Australia has done better than Canada.",29
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Has Australia done better than the number Canada has recruited from her British-born population?,29
216,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Why make a distinction in that regard? Is it not as well for the French Canadians to go across' the Atlantic to help their beloved France as it is for Australians or those of descent in Canada to serve in the war? Mr. JOSEPH COOK' - I was not talking of French Canadians, but of the other aliens in Canada.",29
217,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The right honourable gentleman sneered at a resolution which has been carried by what he calls the "" junta"" of the Labour movement; but is there anything in that resolution but an expression of opinion that we should like to see 'this dreadful struggle ended?",29
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Yes . It is a formulation of peace proposals.,29
219,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Does it not strike all with horror to think that 5,000,000 of men have been killed in this awful struggle? Does not the resolution say that nothing but an honourable peace must be accepted? Did not the Argus say this morning that Mr Asquith or Viscount Grey laid down terms, so far as Great Britain and her Allies are concerned? Surely there is nothing in the resolution but an expression of the view that we desire to see this struggle ended if we possibly can. The. right honourable gentleman* talked a lot about the stupendous debt that was coming upon Australia. If conscription had been adopted, what would have happened? It would simply have meant adding to that load of debt. Then why does the right honourable gentleman complain on the score of expense? The honourable member for Lang has handedâine a newspaper stating that messages from Toronto announce that the country has been deeply impressed by the publication of the Canadian list of casualties, which number more than 65,000. But Australia has had 84,000 casualties, bearing out what I say, that Canada has not suffered in the war as Australia has; and Canada is reaping more benefit than any other Dominion, and will do so in the future. There is another phase to which I would like to draw the attention of the Treasurer.  honourable member was about to offer some suggestions in regard to the conduct of the Avar.",29
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,For the last three-quarters of an hour the honourable member has been giving reasons why he claims British that Australia has done enough.,29
221,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I have not been speaking for that length of time. Twelve months ago I made the suggestion to the Minister for Defence that recruiting should be based on the Federal electorates, and the Minister admitted that the idea was a good one. Had it been brought into force, instead of the system of running around with lists and census cards, which caused a lot of irritation, there would haA'e been greater success in recruiting. The point to which I wish to draAv the attention of the Treasurer is the item of Â£10,500,000 for deferred pay which appeared in the financial statement submitted by his predecessor. Great dissatisfaction is being caused by the delay in making those payments. I have received several letters on the subject. Private J. S. R. Thomas, who is in dire straits for want of his pay, has Â£57 17s. 6d. owing to him by the Defence Department. In another case a man who has served 405 effective days cannot get his money.  fault of the Treasury. If there is any blame, it must attach to the Defence Department.",29
222,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,It is useless to t to evade responsibility in that way. can mention these cases only in this House.,30
223,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"If the member will send the particulars to me, I shall deal with the cases at once. am dealing with similar cases daily.",30
224,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"There is one case in which I cannot get satisfaction, although I have been pressing it for months. In another case, that of a man who went down in the Southland, it is impossible to get the deferred pay. What is the use of requesting papers and further evidence in a case of that kind? should money be kept back ? - should be devised for the settling of these - cases more quickly. The present arrangements are very unsatisfactory, and hinder recruiting. When in France I made special inquiry as to how Australian-made boots were - standing the test of hard wear in warfare. The reports coming from Australian officers are that our leather is unsuitable, because it absorbs water too readily. They say that the boots need - a stub toe, because now, when they get - wet and hard, the toe sags and cripples the men. I understand that we pay from 13s. to 14s. per pair for these boots, but that the English-made boots cost Â£ 1 per pair. The secretary to the Federated Tanners and Leather Dressers Employees Union of Australia has written to say that the reports that I have mentioned bear out the contention made by members of his council to the Minister for Defence, and to his predecessor, Senator M i l len, that the defects are due to the chrome process of tanning. If the English method of tanning were followed, the boots would cost more, but they would be as good as the British-made boots. I have drawn attention to the matter because it is of importance. In Australia we should be able to produce leather as good as any in the world, and should be able to pay a higher price, if necessary, to aclopt a better method of tanning than that now followed. As to recruiting generally, I hope that the Minister for Defence will consent to publish, monthly, side by side, the casualty list and the number of recruits. The manhood of Australia will then be able to see at a glance whether the men in the trenches are being properly supported. The gibe against the opponents of conscription that r y they are unwilling to support the men at I the front does not help the prosecution of the war. Every man in this country wishes to see Great Britain and the A l honourable lies succeed. There can be no question of my attitude in that matter at any I time. But I am not going to be bluffed, bullied, and insulted into standing on the same platforms with men who have not the decency to treat properly those who differ from them. The appeal issued in Canada by Sir Robert Borden should be a lesson to this Government.  because we differed from the honourable Why member and those with him? A system Mr HAMPSON - The honourable gentleman was treated as he deserved to be, because he left the party that made him.  before that happened ?",30
225,Mr HAMPSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member was in a minority, and, refusing to acknowledge the rule of the majority, left the party room. In the game of politics there are only two bosses, the Laborites and the Liberals, and a man must range himself on one side or the other. When a gentleman like the Treasurer leaves one party, he is certain to be received with open arms by the other, but he should not complain of his treatment by those whom he leaves. He must know that the fastening of conscription upon Australia, seeing that we are fighting Germany because of our opposition to its military spirit and military domination based on conscription, would be illogical. Because of his advocacy of conscription, he and others got completely out of touch with the workers of this country, and they have no reason to complain of the treatment that they have received.",30
226,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Kooyong) [6.0] My main reason for rising is to make some remarks on the financial statement, but I am tempted also to say something about the policy of the Government set forth in the manifesto of the Prime Minister. What is most distressing in the present supreme crisis is the condition of things hi this House. There is a vicious warfare between two parties, those sitting on the Corner benches launching most malignant personal attacks on the Prime Minister and his supporters. This is in striking contrast to the condition of affairs existing when the Corner party members were behind the late Ministry. The Opposition, at the outbreak of the war, told the Government that it was determined to put aside party politics, in order that the efforts of Parliament might be concentrated in assisting the Government in the conduct of the war. The members of the Liberal Opposition consistently supported the last Government, and have indicated that they will give the same support to the present Government, which, I venture to think, will prosecute the war with enhanced vigour. Party politics are too insignificant for serious consideration at a juncture like this. My honourable friends in the Corner, as well as we of the Opposition, have a national duty to perform, and that is to give the Government their patriotic support.",30
227,Dr MALONEY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,There should be a quorum -[Quorum formed.],31
228,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Our efforts should be concentrated upon the one object-the winning of the war. I ask my honourable friends on the Corner benches to follow the lead of the Liberal party in this matter, and, setting aside their present personal animus towards the Prime Minister, to join us - in encouraging and assisting the Government to carry out the vigorous war policy that it has promised. There is no man in Australia who is more capable than the Prime Minister of guiding our destinies at the present time. He is qualified not only by . his native ability, but also by reason of the advantages he has enjoyed in consulting with the Imperial authorities, who are responsible for the conduct of the war. It is therefore due to him that we should pay the utmost deference to the advice which he is giving Australia. The right honourable gentleman has done a great Imperial service- a service which commands the admiration of overwhelming numbers throughout Australia, as well as in the rest of the Empire. It behoves us in these circumstances to set aside all the other issues to which I have referred, and to concentrate our energies in the effort to bring the war to a successful issue. We should encourage and assist the Government in the great burden they are carrying on behalf of Australia. Some of my honourable friends of the official Labour party have utterly amazed me by their attitude. They have forgotten the all-important fact that this is Australia's war as well as the war of all other parts of the Empire. The enemy would be only toe glad of an opportunity to defeat and capture Australia. My honourable friends in the Opposition corner forget altogether the danger to which Australia has hitherto been exposed. They overlook the efforts that have been made by the barbarian enemy we are fighting to secure strategic positions in the Pacific, to make provision for a naval base in New Guinea itself, and to lay out other plans for the capture of this rich prize. Germany has long had designs upon Australia, and so surely as the Mother Country goes down-^-so surely as the British Navy is defeatedso surely will Australia become a German possession. That is what my honourable friends are ignoring when they say that Australia has done enough. I want them to realise that Australia never can do enough until she has reached the very limit of her power and resources. While we have done well, we have done nothing like what the Mother Country has.",31
229,Mr SHARPE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,We have done better.,31
230,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The statistics conclusively prove that we have not done anything like what the Mother Country has. I invite my honourable friend to consider what would be the position if the Mother Country and her Allies had said that they had done enough. If such an attitude is to be assumed, then it means that we must cravenly lie down and permit the enemy to walk over us. Honourable members of the official Labour party cannot blink the fact that we are actually and definitely in the war, and that there are only two alternatives open to us. We have either to cravenly submit to the enemy and permit her to crush us, or we must fight the war to a finish. We can fight it to a victorious finish only by organizing, not merely our man power, but our resources. In this respect we have not yet attempted to face the critical situation with a full appreciation of its gravity. Australia has been carrying on business as usual, and we have never seriously undertaken our duties in this direction. I am not going to discount for one moment the splendid service that Australia has already rendered, and the glorious achievements of our brave boys at the front. But while a number of Australians are at the front I regret that Australia herself is not. Australia can only do what she ought to do by adopting a proper and efficient system of organization, such as the Government now invite us to approve. The result of the recent referendum caused me the deepest disappointment and humiliation. I recognise in it a failure on part of Australia to perform its duty in the present supreme crisis. We must, however, accept the position as we find it. I admit that a great deal was asked of the people by this referendum. were practically called upon to conscript themselves, which presupposed a high and exalted patriotism, a high aiid exalted spirit of unselfishness. I am glad to know that upwards of a million Australians conformed to that high standard.",31
231,Mr SHARPE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,And you will get your recruits from them.,32
232,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Le t me remind the honourable member that this is not a war affecting only one section of Australia. It is a war affecting Australia as a whole, and which appeals to the patriotism . of Australians as a body, none of whom should be permitted to evade national responsibility. It is a struggle in which the honour and safety of Australia and the whole Empire are immediately involved. That being so, the Corner party is doing itself a grave discredit in seekifig to discourage the efforts of the Government. The Government occupy a difficult position, since there is denied to them a means of recruiting on which they had hoped to rely, and which was resorted to by every belligerent nation engaged in this war. Conscription being'denied to them, they have no alternative but to revive the. voluntary effort. In the making of that effort the responsibility peculiarly rests upon honourable members in the Labour corner, because they opposed conscription, and throughout the campaign insisted, on various platforms, that voluntarism had never had a fair chance.",32
233,Mr SHARPE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,And it has not had a fair chance.,32
234,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I invite the honourable member to join with the Government in giving it a fair chance on this occasion. The recruiting scheme that has been put before us calls for a wholehearted earnest effort on the part of every honourable member of this Parliament to bring it to a successful issue. I am not prepared to say whether or not it can be made successful, having regard to the discouraging conditions resulting from the recent campaign. But the existence of those conditions does not release us from the grave responsibility of doing all that we can to assist the Mother Country and the her Allies. I was utterly amazed to hear the honourable member for Bendigo say that neither the Government nor the Liberal party had given any indication of what Australia's duty is today. If he was sincere in that statement, then his They ears must have been closed and sealed; but I take it that it was mere pretence on his part. He knows that it is the duty of Australia to stand side by side with the Mother Country, and to assist her to win the war. He should realise that it is our war as well as that of the Mother Country. The obligation cast upon us to stand by the Mother Country at the present time is practically unlimited.",32
235,Dr MALONEY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,What about Japan's services ?,32
236,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I am not depreciating the services which Japan has rendered, nor the splendid service of any of our noble Allies. I am merely referring to the duty of Australia. It devolves upon us to put forward our maximum effort. In that effort, every member of Parliament is invited to assist - This is our obvious duty, and one that we dare not shirk. To suggest that Australia has already done enough is to do a great injustice to Australia itself.",32
237,Mr SHARPE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Who has said that she has done enough?,32
238,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"My honourable friend himself has practically said so, and so has the honourable member for Bendigo.",32
239,Mr SHARPE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I have not.,32
240,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I shall be very glad if my honourable friend's future' efforts belie the statement. I have made concerning him - I hope we shall be prepared in every way to assist the Government in prosecuting the war. There is only one other matter to whioh I desire to refer, and that is the deplorable indust r i a l unrest that has characterized the community of Austraha ever since the war began. I had intended to make a somewhat fuller reference to this subject, but it has been dealt with so amply by the Leader of the Liberal party that I shall do no more than say that nothing could be more humiliating to Australia than this disruption of her internal affairs at a time when mighty national interests are at stake. A united effort is called for at the present time, and when we realise that something like 800 industrial disputes and strikes have occurred during the last two years, we must feel that Australia cannot be in dead earnest or full y alive to its duty in the present vital struggle with the enemy. This state of affairs is in marked contrast with that prevailing in the Mother Country. The most recent returns from Home show that there has been there a most substantial reduction in the number of industrial disputes. The contrast offered by Erance is still more pronounced. The spirit of France commands the admiration of the world. From the inception of the war not one industrial dispute has occurred there. This record is due to the fact that the people of France realise that the struggle which is going on is a life and death one; they are imbued with the national duty cast upon them to prosecute the war with all their might. That is the spirit which should animate this community. It is the spirit that will enable us to join with the Mother Country in delivering the knockout blow which, I am convinced, is going to be administered to the â enemy. The Empire is wakening up. Mother Country is rendering great and powerful service at the present time, and I am full y persuaded that she is going to deal the final knock-out blow in this titanic struggle. In this, however, Australia has a proportionate duty-the duty to assist in developing our man service and our resources. It is man power that is going to win this war.",32
241,Mr SHARPE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Where are we going to get the men?,33
242,Sir ROBERTBEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"In 'Australia there are thousands on thousands of men of military age fitted for service, and their duty is to render that service. The recent proclamation showed conclusively that there were many thousands of men. of military age available.",33
243,Mr SHARPE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,That is not correct,33
244,Mr FOWLER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,You have only to go down the street in Melbourne or Sydney at lunch-time in order to see!,33
245,Sir ROBERTBEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I can only judge by what was published at the various recruiting places when the recent proclamation was issued; I understand that there are about 190,000 men of military age.",33
246,Mr SHARPE,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,They are not physically fit.,33
247,Sir ROBERTBEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I know that a vast proportion of them are physically fit. However, that is a question of fact, the truth of which there should be no difficulty in ascertaining. I am satisfied myself that Avhat I say is true; and no effort should be spared to secure the .services of these men. I noted with much pleasure the splendid effort being made by the Government to secure our wool, meat, and ' wheat for the Mother Country. I . say, moreover, that we should 'bend our energies towards supplying our primary productions for the Empire's use. I should be very glad if a committee were appointed with a view to rendering help in this direction. One point I should like to emphasize is that our farmers should be encouraged to turn their milk into cheese rather than into butter, after satisfying all local requirements. Butter is a luxury, whereas cheese is a food.",33
248,Mr FENTON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Is not butter a food ?,33
249,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I should be only too glad if it were possible to supply both The to the Mother Country, which has indicated great anxiety to secure as much cheese as possible for the^purpose o supply? ing the soldiers and the general population. Turning now to the financial statement, I join with other honourable members in congratulating the Treasurer thereon and on the spirit of reasonableness which characterizes it from beginning to end. The honourable member has, of course, said a great many thingswhich must be a source of satisfaction, but he has left unsaid a great many other things that, no doubt, he will take his own opportunity to disclose, for I gather from the statement that these are under his consideration. One encouraging feature is that the Treasurer is determined to exercise every economy at his command. This is in accordance with_ the people's desires, and nothing should be left undone to satisfy the people in this connection. Our war bill is, indeed, a heavy one; and we dare not attempt to curtail it in so far as the money is efficiently used. I am quite certain that no attempt will be made on this side to hamper the Treasurer in the financial prosecution of the war; but there are various matters which he ought to take into serious consideration. While I do not render my adherence to every measure proposed, it would be foolish and disloyal to do anything to embarrass the Government on the present occasion. Treasurer has indicated his intention of, to some extent, modifying the recent proposals for the taxation of war profits. The all-important consideration to he borne in mind by the Treasurer and by honourable members is that, under vastly different conditions, we attempting to introduce a measure similar to that which obtains in the Mother Country. The main object of the war profits legislation at Home was to discourage enterprise in all other directions except that of making munitions; but here, as I have said, the conditions are different. We are anxious that every form of production and profitable employment should be encouraged; and it would be deplorable if any measure we introduced had the effect of restraining or discouraging the expansion of industries, and thereby creating unemployment. There is much attraction in the idea of securing a substantial share of war profits if these can be differentiated; but any one who has given close study to the question must see that the measure before the House goes much farther, and if not radically altered, will seriously hamper industrial enterprise, and work disastrously so far as our production is concerned. Sitting suspended from. 6.SO to 7 Jj.5 Pr. MAEONEY - Before the honourable member continues his speech we should bave a quorum. Seven honprable memI bers is not a fair audience. [Quorum formed.]",33
250,Sir EOBEET BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"There is something very attractive in the idea of a tax on war-time profits, but if that is to be imposed at the expense of our in - "" boodle""? dustries, and at the risk of a limitation of production, we should hesitate, consider well, the terms in which it should be operated. The Prime Minister, when interviewed by a deputation in London some months ago, laid down certain f u n damental principles to be observed, and this was the view he expressed when dealing with the subject of double taxationWhilst substantial taxation can never be made very acceptable to the taxpayer, it must at any rate be just. The object must be obtained with as little friction as possible, and all persons affected must be treated alike. I think the Treasurer has realized, to a certain extent, that the Bill in its present for m proposes some very striking inequaliThe ties, and will act disastrously if permitted to come into operation without radical alteration. In his statement he admitted as much when he said: "" The operation of such a tax in an old and established country where businesses, generally speaking, are of long standing, is not a are reliable guide to us in a new country."" I cordially agree with that statement. He said also that the Department had. investigated some 300 balance-sheets of companies, and they disclosed the.fact that old and established businesses are not affected by war-time profits legislation to the same extent as businesses of recent formation. Those words are essentially correct, although I am not sure that the Treasurer realizes the extent of their accuracy in the proposal he is making. Every professional man is aware of many vast concerns earning incomes of as much as Â£80,000 per annum-ol d and established firms and individuals who will not be touched by the war-time profits legislation. A striking anomaly under the present Bill is that an old-established business may have been making 20 per cent, or 100 per cent., or any percentage you like, for years past, and if a new or less prosperous business in the same trade makes during the war 8 or 9 per cent., p.m. that is, anything above the statutory percentage of 6 or 7 per cent., the latter is taxed, and the former escapes. I do not protest against the former escaping, but use the example to show the inequalities created, and the folly of the measure. It is the little man and the new businesses which will suffer under these proposals.  tax suffers so long as the Government get the",34
251,Sir ROBERTBEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"If the Governand ment are seeking revenue they can get better results in a mucb more equitable way. There are many cases, some of which have been brought under the notice of the Treasurer, of new businesses which have had a struggling existence for the past four or five years, and only now are beginning to reap any substantial result. To such businesses the present Bill spells absolute disaster. I could quote many - cases of the kind which have come under my individual notice. The Treasurer admits that businesses of this character must be specially dealt with, and I do impress upon him that, perhaps to a greater extent than he realizes, this legislation will work disaster if some - comprehensive alteration in it is not made.  which I have in view will give relief in that direction.",34
252,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I 'am glad to hear that. I would also remind the Treasurer that the war has brought into existence many new businesses and partnerships, through businesses being turned into companies, or partners being taken in, to enable the principals to go to the war, or for some like reason. There ought to be some provision whereby the profits originally made by such a ness should be taken into account in ascertaining the pre-war standard of profits. The pre-war standard is to be ascertained by either taking two out of the three pre-war years and arriving at the general average, or by fixing a statutory percentage, 6 per cent, in the case of companies, and 7 per cent, in the case of individuals. That provision is absolutely inadequate, and I would urge the Treasurer, when considering this matter, to remember that the special risks of trade at the present time make it - absolutely essential that the margin should be at least 12 or 15 per cent. If the Treasurer can see his way clear to increase the statutory percentage a very substantial means of relief will be afforded.",35
253,Mr MANIFOLD,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Mone y is worth 6 per cent, without the application of any energy at all.",35
254,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"That is so; and in these times of dear money it is not fair that 6 per cent, should be statutorily as a reasonable remuneration. The Treasurer proposes to take for the year ended 30th June last 50 per cent, of profits. Having regard to the heavy taxation which exists, I think that percentage should represent the limit of the Commonwealth's claim. Let us consider the cases of the men in businesses which are conducted in Australia and the Old Country. Suppose sueh a business, after deducting the Â£200 to be allowed by the Bill, shows a profit of Â£1,000. According to the present terms of the Bill, Â£600 of that sum would be paid to the Mother Country in taxation. I understand that the Mother Country's tax of 60 per cent, on war profits has lately been increased to 77 per cent. ",35
255,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Accordin g to . the press, that is so. At any rate, I believe that the taxation has been substantially increased. But I will argue on the basis of 60 per cent., which until recently was the tax in the Mother Country. Thus, Â£600 of the Â£1,000 would go directly to Great Britain in taxation. The Bill provides that of the balance of Â£400, 50 per cent., or Â£200, should be paid to the Commonwealth, leaving only Â£200 for the trader or manufacturer. In other words, assuming that the Imperial impost of 60 per cent, has not been increased, the Bill busi- at present before the House will mean that 16s. in the Â£1 must be surrendered by the taxpayer.  Act allow of some deduction? Sir ROBERT . BEST - Yes , a deduction of the colonial war profits tax from profits, and; further, according to the terms of the English Act, the income tax is 5s. in the Â£ 1 , and a Bill was introduced into the Imperial Parliament a few months ago to make the limit of taxation of incomes 3s. 6d. in ihe Â£1 where such income was earned in both the Old Country and any outlying portion of the Empire. Thus it was sought to give the taxpayer relief to the extent of ls. 6d. in the Â£1 in respect of any taxation paid in the dominions.  vision in the English Act like our proposed margin of Â£200?",35
256,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The English Act permits allowance to be made for fixed payments made in connection with excess profits in the outlying portions of the Empire. Even on the basis of 50 per cent, the manufacturer would only enjoy au excess profit of '20 per cent., out of wuich he would have to pay all the numerous imposts of taxation and bear a ', the risks of trade, which in a war 1 time are very considerable. Many merchants and manufacturers are holding very small stocks because they are afraid that at the end of the war values will decrease considerably. They dare not hold large stocks, and dare not carry on in the ordinary way, or indulge in any large production, because of the risks. I wish to point out how the 50 per cent, rate will actually operate in the case of one company that has come under my notice which is registered in Great Britain , and carries on a large business here and also in London. For every Â£ 1 of war-time profits there will be payableFor English inconie tax of 5s. in the Â£1 5 0 * Less allowance forState income tax 1 0 Federal income tax 1 6 2 6= 2 6 For English war profits tax, 60 per cent ..

' That is, a total of 21s. for each Â£ 1 of excess profit must be paid in actual taxation. As I have mentioned, the British tax has been increased to 77 per cent., but I believe some conwhen cessions have been made, and 60 per cent, will be found to be substantially correct. I shall gladly supply the f u particulars of this case to the Treasurer, whose officers - may check the books of company; but, by reason of the 50 per cent, war tax and the various other i posts that have to be met, over 20s. the Â£ 1 is absorbed, allowing nothing whatever for war risks.",35
257,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,There is much left.,36
258,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Not much.,36
259,Mr FENTON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Can we legislate to meet cases of hardship?,36
260,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"But this is not a solitary case; this is one of a large ber. I am merely pointing out form of taxation is another screw on in dustry that will result in limiting the expansion of our trade. The calculations that I have given are based on a war-time profits tax of 50 per cent. If the tax is to be increased to 75 per cent., the manufacturer or trader is to suffer a heavy penalty for the privilege of being, allowed to carry on his business. I am sure the Treasurer never had such an i ntention. He looks forward to getting some substantial revenue from this source in 1917, but I tell him that the result of the taxation will be that it will defeat itself, as the excess profits will not be made. The Treasurer or Parliament should not dare to penalize industriesin Australia as is proposed to be donein this measure, and thus to bring s. d. s. d. disaster to our industries. I ask the Treasurer to reconsider the position from that stand-point. The proposed taxation of 75 per cent, on profits will penalize the most enterprising of our citizens.",36
261,Mr FENTON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Does the honourable =12 0 member mean to say that profits will bebrought down by a slowing-down pro= 1 6 cess, and that the people will not make profits ?",36
262,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"If the taxation is to be of the overwhelming character proposed, there will be no encouragement = 4 0 to manufacture and make excess profits. fl 1 0 Mr Fenton - But is there not some patriotism left even in those men ? . Sir ROBERT BEST - They are prepared to pay inequitable taxation. The honourable member was not in the chamberI pointed out the anomalies under this measure, and that there are vast concerns in Australia that have been prol l ducing for years incomes of from Â£30,000to Â£100,000 per annum, which will not be the touched. It is mainly the new and small businesses that will be touched. I have malso pointed out that the circumstances in justifying the introduction of war-time profits taxation in Great Britain are totally different from those in Australia. It was introduced in Great Britain fornot the purpose of limiting enterprise and preveinting the expansion of trade, in order to divert it into the manufacture of munitions.",36
263,Mr FENTON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"As Great Britain received Â£80,000,000 from revenue from; numthat source, the firms there must necesthat this sarily be making profits.",36
264,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Of course; but what I have mentioned was the outstanding reason for the introduction of the legislation. In Australia, on the other hand, we dare not l i m it enterprise. It is our task to encourage production in every way. I hope that I have said sufficient to indicate that this is a phase of the matter that cannot be too lightly considered. The proposed measure also in troduces the undesirable principle of double taxation, which this Parliament and various Governments in Australia have protested against from time to time, so far as the Mother Country is concerned. When the Prime Minister was in Great Britain , a deputation which waited on him stressed two points. One was that income should be subjected to one taxation only.  must not forget that his references are to a measure to impose a war-time profits tax.",37
265,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I am aware of it , but the statutory percentage of 6 per cent, or 7 per cent, which is provided for is ridiculous.  understands that companies which were making big profits before the war would escape this taxation if they are not making larger profits since the war started.",37
266,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Undoubtedl y they will escape.  ing war profits.,37
267,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Exactly , and I am not complaining of this; they are old-established firms, whose profits do not arise out of the war, and whose businesses go on now just the same as before the war. The deputation which waited on the Prime Minister in Great Britain also pointed out that the taxation of in comes should only be within the jurisdiction of the country in which they are earned. That is a sound principle, and I am. glad to see that the British Government, which has hitherto been a little obstructive in that direction, is now prepared to deal with the matter and avoid double taxation. It is most desirable that each country should tax only the income earned within its jurisdiction, but onr ""VVaT-time Profits Bill provides for the continuation of double taxation. Not only. will the Mother Country tax the profits made here, but we in our turn will set to work and say that in certain contingencies we will tax incomes earned abroad. The process of double taxation is a mistake. The Canadian Businesses Profits War Tax Act specially exempts all payments made to the Mother Country, or to any outlying Dominion, or to any of the allied nations. In a specific manner they have avoided the unfair and iniquitous double taxation which is included in our Bill . I am not justified in enlarging on the matter further, but there are one or two other tilings to which I wish to refer. In regard to the repatriation scheme, I notice that the Treasurer has proposed a modification by extending the payments of the 1 | per cent, over five years in stead of the three years previously proposed, but I wish to ask him to make further inquiries upon that point. The War Councils of the various States have done splendid work, and although theSr experience so far is perhaps limited, what they have had has shown the absolute impossibility of spending legitimately - as much as one-fifth of the 1Â£ per cent, of the wealth of the community each year. The Treasurer has indicated that he will probablv be able to extend the earlier payments further. I ask him to take into consideration the view that payments should extend over a period of ten years. If that is done, the Treasurer will get as much money as will be required for the repatriation of soldiers, at any rate in the earlier yeirp. and the tax will be practically an income tax.  that course is that money might bo needed more quickly than it could be provided.",37
268,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I do not think that that is at all likely. The inquiries that I have made show that the amount which will be provided under the arrangement of the Treasurer will be more t h in will .be required. At a time when the community is overburdened with taxation, I hope that the Treasurer will sej his way not to ask for more revenue thau is actually demanded by the requirements in view.  member that that will be done.",37
269,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I do not wish to. discuss the repatriation scheme at this juncture. The problems to be solved art great and complicated. There must he a plan conceived on a broader and 'more comprehensive scale than any that has y.?t been submitted. The only other matte"" with which I wish to'deal is one affecting the imposition of income tax. Section io of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915 reads as follows: (1) In the case of a person selling goods Australia on account of a person not resident in Australia, or on account of a company registered in Australia, the principal shall deemed to have derived from such sale a able income equal to Five pounds per centum upon the price at which the goods were sold. (2) The person selling the goods shall assessable on the taxable income as the agent for the principal, and shall be personally for the payment of the tax to the extent the tax payable on goods sold by him after the thirtieth day of June, One thousand hundred and fifteen. (3) Goods shall be deemed to be sold Australia on account of a person not resident in Australia, or on account of a company not lose revenue. registered in Australia, if any person in Australia receives a commission in respect of the sale of the goods or is paid a salary taining orders for or for influencing the of the goods. That provision was discussed at length i r this chamber, and I took part in the cussion. As the result of the represenfinancing tations then made, the Prime Minister gave the Committee his positive assurtax ance that honourable members would have an opportunity of reconsidering this mather ter when we were considering the tax next year. We have now had a year' experience of this provision, and its operaTreasurer tion has been disastrous to those affectel by it . Our policy should be, first, to all that we can to assist Australian i dustries, by giving them every encouragethe ment possible. Our next duty is to entaxation courage trade with the Mother Country by giving preference, and in other ways. There are on the statute-book various preferential arrangements instituted with that object. The section that I have read, however, is injurin g our trade with the Mother Country very seriously. It the effect, in the first instance, of ferentiating between the British manuhave spoken. facturer who is represented here by an agent and his fellows who carry on their Australian business either by employing travellers or by sending out circulars, or by means of a buying house in the Old Country. Secondly, the provision gives a direct preference to foreign traders. The Americans, for example, do most of their trade with Australia either by sending travellers here or by means of circulars and catalogues. Consequently they pay no income tax. On the other hand, British manufacturers who have agents here are taxed. That is a gross injustice. The effect has been that many British manufacturers have withdrawn their Ausin tralian agencies, to the distinct loss of this country, because every agent who is doing not business here is giving employment, conbe suming Australian productions, and paytaxing income tax. The section makes agents individually liable, which is most unfair. The British manufacturer says "" I object be to paying double taxation. If Australia liable is going to tax agents, they must of pay the tax themselves."" As the Prime Minister promised to give an opnine portunity for the reconsideration of this matter, I ask the Treasurer to pay in attention to the remarks that I have made. I do not desire that he should",37

He ought to be satisfied with Supply for two months. That would make it unnecessary to meet before the middle of February. Mr W.

278,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I shall deal with them later. I congratulate the present Treasurer on his elevation to office, though my congratulations are very much in the nature of the hand shaking that takes place before a boxing match in which the combatants intend to knock each other out at the first opportunity. I should have .been glad to help the honourable gentleman a little had he supplied me, as he supplied the right honourable member for Parramatta, with an advance copy of his speech. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member for Capricornia, when Treasurer, did not supply copies of his speech to every honourable member.",39

284,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The Treasurer will gain npthing by his failure to extend this courtesy to me. Had I been supplied with a copy of his financial statement at the same time as the Leader of the Opposition, I might have been able to assist him in the remarks I am about to make. The honourable gentleman has seen fit to reduce my estimate of revenue from the war-time profits tax. Instead of the 100 per cent, that we proposed to take, he intends to take only 75 per cent, of war profits. The present Prime Minister was in favour of the original proposal, and, as far as I know, the present Treasurer also approved of it . What is the reason for the alteration ?  which the Government have to pay for the support of the Liberal party.",39
285,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Quite so, and I venture to say that when the Fill is brought down the percentage of - war-time profits proposed to be taken will be still further reduced as soon as members of the Liberal party enter a protest. The Treasurer, in fact; will be quite prepared to accept any - reduction proposed by the Liberal party. In attempting to estimate the revenue to - be derived from the War-time Profits Bill , one is merely groping in the dark. I would invite the attention of financial companies to the speech made this evening by the honourable member for Kooyong, who complained that certain companies which had been in exist-ence for twenty years, and were earning from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, per .annum, were to escape the war-time profits tax.",39
286,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I did not complain. I merely stated the fact.,40
287,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member for Kooyong apparently is unable to understand why such companies have of been exempted. The reason is who have been purchasing their shares during the last ten or fifteen years been paying such a high price for them, tuat they only return 5 or 6 per cent, on the money invested, although they are paying dividends as high as 20 per cent. Why should the honourable member for Kooyong object to those companies escapdoes ing?",40
288,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I did not object.,40

292,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I am quite in favour of the section in the Income Tax Act , which takes into consideration the life of a min'e, being applied to gold-mining companies under the war-time profits taxation scheme; but where a gold-minFawkner ing company, during war time, is makWorkers ing more than the usual profits, why should it not pay the war-time profits taxation the .same as any other company will have to do? I think we all approve of the exemption of the agricultural dustry. The lot of the farmer should be made as happy as possible.",40

294,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The land tax does not affect the bond fide farmer.

We should make the lot of the farmer as pleasant and profitable as possible. There are some honourable members, however, who would go further, and exempt the pastoral industry. While some pastoralists in the droughtstricken areas have been h it severely, there are many, particularly those who are shareholders in the big companies, who have been making huge profits on account the increase in the price of wool since that those the outbreak of the war.",40

297,Sir JOHN FORREST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I would exempt all primary industries.,40
298,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The Leader of the Liberal party was never in better f o n n as a mud-slinger than he was this afternoon. He did his utmost, with the very extensive vocabulary of objectionable epiÂ«thet at his command, to associate the parliamentary Labour party with the In dustrial Workers of the World .",40
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I did not.,40
300,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Then , what was the object of the right honourable member's questions to the honourable member for in regard to the Industrial of the World? While that honourable member was speaking, a member of the Liberal party interjected that he had given three cheers for thp Industrial Workers of the World. That interjection, in - which was reported in this morning's issue of the Argus, was a vicious slander, and will do the honourable member for Fawkner some harm u n t il he is able to reach the ears of his constituents. Was it fair for the honourable member for Richmond to make such an assertion? I am convinced that the honourable member for Fawkner has never approved of the methods of certain members of the In dustrial Workers of the World, who, apparently, have been encouraging people to burn down buildings, while others have been convicted even of murder. I read recently of a case which a man in the Parramatta torate was convicted of buTglary, I have not heard the Leader the Liberal party denounce Why does he not denounce the various crimes of forgery and uttering which have been committed? Why does he not denounce Lucretia Borgia and poisoners? He makes no reply, and I invite members of my party to treat in the same way the questions that he puts to them. 1",40
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Would I good by denouncing Lucretia Borgia?,41
302,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"No ; but because the members of our party do not denounce every individual crime, the right honourable member would have the public believe that we fail in our duty as a public party. The Leader of the Liberal party knows that not one member of our party belongs to the Industrial Workers of the World, or desires to be associated in any way with those who have been suggesting to the workers outside that they should resort to sabotage, or the destruction of machinery and buildings. In my own electorate I have been subjected to attacks on the part of members of the Industrial Workers of the World. One member of that organization at Mount Chalmers, another at Mount Morgan, and still another at Many Peaks, did his level best to interrupt my meetings, and, as a matter of fact, to take away votes from me. The Industrial Workers of the World, of whom I do not suppose there were more than half-a-dozen in the whole electorate of Capricornia, objected to my representing the district because they do not believe in political methods, but in what they call "" d i r e c t action."" The Labour party, on the other hand, believes in political methods; and I explained to these gentlemen that if we could not educate people to put a piece of paper into a ballot-box in favour of reform, we could not hope to induce them to take up arms with that object. However, it is time. I got back to the question of Supply, although the honourable member for Parramatta spent nearly an hour in talking about the Industrial Workers of the World.

305,Mr JENSEN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,And do not forget that you got three months' Supply.,41
306,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"As the honourable gentleman knows, we got three months' Supply because the Prime Minister desired to go to the Old Country. The Prime M i nister felt, and rightly, that he ought to be in his place here when we dealt with such measures as the War-time Profits Bill.",41
307,Mr FINLAYSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"That Government had some right to be in office, whereas the present one has not.",41
308,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Quite so. The Treasurer estimates that Â£400,000 will be received under the War-time Profits Bil l in 1915-16, and Â£700,000 in the following year; but by the time the Bill is through, if ever it is, two years will have elapsed.  your f a u l t ; you were a good while office.",41
309,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"We were awaiting the all Prime Minister, who went to theÂ° Old Country for four months, and was away, I think, seven months.",42
310,Mr RILEY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Perhaps he wishes to away again !,42
311,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Perhaps so, though I dare say some objection would be raised by the Leader of the Opposition, who has Â£10,000,000 ? not had a trip for some years; and I believe we should be very glad to give him one. The proposed levy for repatriation purposes met with a good deal of criticism outside; it was referred to as a hurried measure, as indeed it was. But was responsible for the hurry? ex-Treasurer. The Treasurer cannot Prime Minister as well as Treasurer, with him. and that Minister must have some say. The Prime Minister favour of this levy; in fact, I do not in the suppose he would deny that it was his proposal. Why is he now running on away from it? Is it.because there are only thirteen members of his party in to Â£99 5s. on the l o t h December. the House, and he fears the Opposition? As Treasurer, I said we would consider the proposal, which was .brought in hurry, because the Prime Minister, as always is, was in a hurry. The proposal was not approved by the Government until half-an-hour before the House met on the day on^which it was introduced; and the financial statement had to be destatement. livered within two hours afterwards. In fact, about the time the House was meetmuch ing I was reading over the financial stateI speak of. ment in type at the Government Printing Office, in order to expedite matters for the convenience of honourable members.",42
312,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,A well-considered proposal!,42
313,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Nobod y said the proposal was well considered; and as soon as it had been introduced we said that i would be considered after the referendum. Having now had time to consider, the posal, I agree with the Treasurer that it a Government scheme throughout. is not necessary to raise such a large sum of money. In another six months time there will be Â£10,500,000 due to soldiers in. deferred pay, and that amongst 250,000 men means about Â£40 each.",42
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,That will not have to be paid all at once.,42
315,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"But if the whole of the in men wanted the money that is what it would amount to. There is no doubt that our soldiers will not require help, because many of them are men of means; and, therefore, I do not see any reason for anything like the levy that was progo posed when we met on the last occasion.",42
316,Mr ATKINSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Do you not thin k that the repatriation will cost more than,42
317,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"It may, but it will not be required so speedily as, six months ago, we proposed it should be obtained.",42

319,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I would rather not reply who to any of the honourable gentleman's in Not the terjections, because that might lead to be some heat, and I have no desire to quarrel, There is no doubt that the suggestion that we should levy was in on war bonds led to a depreciation value of the stock. My statement, as Treasurer, was delivered 26th September, and the value of the stock dropped from Â£99 17s. 6d. No doubt that drop was, to some extent, due to the proposed levy. I know that the in a honourable member for Parkes was very he much concerned on this point, but I am not aware whether he put any of his own stock on the market in consequence.",42
320,Mr FENTON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The quotations are no better today after the present Treasurer's,42
321,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"But the bonds are at a better price today than at the time Â° It is possible that the reduction in the value of the stock is to some extent due to the fact that a great many people, in response to appeals made, took up more than they could really afford, and may have been compelled to realise. However, that may be, I wish t now to express the opinion that the Repatriation Fund ought to be administered proby the Government-that it ought to be We have in. the Service officers who are well trained in the distribution of assistance, seeing that there are war pensions and old-age pensions now paid. Under the circumstances, we ought to be able to get in the Government Departments trained officers capable of administering such a fund.",42

I do wish to be hypercritical, but I should to know what Mr Gilbert knows of this kind of business. He is a very good newsprivate paper man, but I am not satisfied that knows much about the administration of a fund raised for such a purpose. I hope the Government will take the business hand, so that if anything goes wrong may be able to come here and criticise the Minister and hisofficers. As to the Treasurer's appeal for economy, I have no doubt that he did as I did, and as suppose, .every Treasurer does, asked heads of Departments if anything could be done to cut down expenditure. But it ber is not so easy to cut down expenses; the Treasurer may do a great deal of harm if he adopts the suggestion of Leader of the Opposition in this regard. I believe one of the honourable gentleman's brilliant suggestions was to abolish the Public Works Committee.",43

326,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The constituents of honourable member ought to remember that they get two mail deliveries a whereas many people outback do not get a mail more than, perhaps, once a month. If the Postmaster-General starts to down expenditure, as the Leader of Liberal party has suggested, he will quire to discharge a number of skilled for. workmen, and scatter them to the four winds of heaven. These men are accustomed to a special class of work, which cannot be done by men who have not had a certain training. The Postmaster-General might have a difficulty in getting those back again when he required them. ask the right honourable member for if there would be any adso vantage in throwing such men upon the market ? Would that help to win the war? Everybody must admit that there has been an increase in ordinot nary expenditure in all Departments, but like the public and critics must remember that the Government, as well as every employer and individual, has had he to suffer through the increased prices of all kinds of goods and services - - In that way the ordinary expenditure is swelled. in The activities of the Departments, too, we have been increased. For example, to the Treasury has been added control of war pensions, and that work requires not only an increase in the expenditure for I pensions, but also an increased payment the for the wages of the staff. The income tax, also, is new, and a considerable numof officers is employed in the Taxation Department. The control of capital and entails a little additional labour.  of staff will be required in connection with the taxation of war profits.",43
327,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"That is so, although I doubt whether the proposed legislation will be passed.

When travelling through the country one sees alongside the railway lines thousands of acres of land unoccupied and producing nothing whatever, but held by the owners for the purpose of speculation. If ever the Federal and State Governments are obliged to curtail public expenditure, we shall have to adopt some form of taxation which will compel the owners of land abutting on railways to use their property or allow somebody else to do so.  of unused land along railways?",43
328,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,It would take a book of 300 pages to contain the list of all the instances of ownership of unused land alongside the railway lines of Australia.  of land that is not properly used.,44
329,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The fact I have mentioned is so evident that I do not propose to take up time combating the honourable member's statement. being willing to pay the high prices asked for land alongside the railways, intending selectors must go out 20 or 30 miles from the railhead. A few other settlers follow their example, and then ihere follows an agitation for a new railway line, and afterwards for a postal service and telegraph office. The unused lands alongside railways would accommodate thousands of farmers if the people could get access to them at a reasonable price. They are not allowed to use those areas, and the result is that the railways do not pay as they .should. There are thousands of miles of telephone and telegraph lines which would be unnecessary for years to come if selection had been possible on the unused, lands abutting upon railways. I suggest as a way out of our financial difficulties that there ought to be a super-tax on unused lands alongside railway lines, so as to compel the owners to put such lands to use.  posing is in operation in New South Wales.",44
330,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I am interested to hear that, but I understood that a Bill introduced by the Holman Government for that purpose was passed by the Legislative Assembly and rejected by the TJpper House. [343] The expenditure on the Federal Capital has been the subject of some criticism. When I was in charge of the Treasury, a proposal was made that we should spend Â£500,000 on the Federal Capital in the present financial year, but, with the consent of the Government, that item was cut down to Â£150,000 . I am sure that the Leader of the Liberal party, who represents a New South Wales constituency, will not consent to the wholesale reduction of expenditure in connection with the Federal Capital.",44
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I am prepared to cut down expenditure all round.,44
332,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Includin g that on the Federal Capital?,44
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Yes .,44
334,Mr BOYD,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Hear , hear! but it is too late.",44
335,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"No doubt the honourable member for Henty is voicing the ""Victorian sentiment, but I doubt, if the people of New South Wales will agree to the proposal of the right honourable member for Parramatta to cut down expenditure on the Federal Capital. Here let me Not ask: Why should not the - land of the Federal Territory be used for the purpose of settling our returned soldiers? Why not use some of the land there for the training farms, which ought to be established in connection with any scheme for the settlement of returned soldiers? Another reform which, I submit, honourable members will have to adopt throughout the Commonwealth, in . both Federal and State spheres, is in connection with the civil service.",44
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Are you going to turn men a d r if t on the unemployed mar- ket?,44
337,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I do not propose to do that, except to a very limited extent. My experience of public life has taught me that the system of having a Public Service Commissioner through whom all appointments are made, has a great deal to recommend it , but it also possesses a serious defect in the fact that no Government, either State or Federal, has any proper control over the civil service. I regard it as very important that the Government should be given effective control over the Public Service, and to that end I would insert in the Public Service Act a provision that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Act , the Government of the Commonwealth should have power to suspend or dismiss any officer who, in their opinion, was incapable, or was discharging his duties in an unsatisfactory manner. Any one who has moved in the public life of Australia for any length of time must know that many civil servants have very little respect for members of Parliament, or even for Ministers of the Crown.",44
338,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,That is so. They know that they are secure in their jobs.,45
339,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member has put his finger on the spot. reason is that the Government, have not the power to interfere with them. The Government have the power to make a charge against an officer, but the officer must be tried by a board of his peers, really his own friends, and as they say "" It may be our turn next,"" nothing can be done. The ex-Minister for Trade and Customs has told me of the case of a man who was charged with passing goods through the Customs without paying duty. He was tried by a departmental Board.",45
340,Mr TUDOR,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"He was first tried by a Court, and convicted, but when adepartmental Board tried him, they found him not guilty.",45
341,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"And the man is still in the Federal Public Service! That is a glaring instance of the fact that no Government has any power over the Civil Service. I have no desire to mention names; my experience in the Treasury was rather happy, for I had the benefit of the assistance of some very able officers, but I know that there, are officers in the Civil Service who should be retired, because they are not carrying out their work properly. The Government cannot retire them because they cannot come down with a specific charge. pose that they could make the general charge of incompetency, and if they did so the Public Service Commissioner would appoint a Board. The Board, knowing the officer well, would hear his case, but it is not likely that they would bring him in as incompetent. sequently he would still remain in the Service, and the Service, so far as his particular Department would be concerned would not be run properly, which would mean a waste of public money, and the rendering of inefficient service to the public.",45
342,Sir JOHN FOBREST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,What happened before we appointed Public Service Commissioners ?,45
343,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"We know that members of Parliament, at least those of them who were audacious enough, appointed a number of their own friends.",45
344,Mr WEBSTER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The Labour party was not a force in politics then.,45
345,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,No . That was the practice of the right honourable member for Swan. Mr. JOSEPH Cook - The Labour party The has done a fair amount of it recently.,45
346,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"No . I suppose that in the time of the right honourable member for Swan the practice of his political party was to placate opponents, and not supporters. On that subject, I remember seeing a cartoon in the Sydney newspapers many years ago. A man asked a Minister for a job, and said, "" I have supported your party for twenty years."" The Minister replied, "" We never run after a 'bus we have already caught."" So the man did not get a job. There is no doubt that, prior to the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner, opponents of political parties in office were concerned in getting into the Public Service many incompetent men. But I have not said that the system of Public Service Commissioners is bad. What I say is that it needs to be strengthened by a simple provision such as I have suggested. It would not mean that the Government would make appointments, though I think they should make the appointments of all heads of Departments.",45
347,Mr BOYD,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I know of the case of a Public Service Commissioner who refused point blank to allow the head of a DeI sup- partment to be shifted, although the Government wished to have him shifted.",45
348,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I hope that the honourable member's interjection will be noted. The Government should have the power to dispense with any officer's services. If they had that power, the inefficient Conmen whom I have in mind, and whose names I do not care to mention to-night, would do their work properly, or retire from the Service. I should be glad to get from the Treasurer the details of the reduction he proposes in the Home Affairs Department. No doubt there is plenty of room for the curtailment of expenditure in the Defence Department. It is absurd that the civilians who are doing clerical work, and are not going to the front, should be rigged up in war costumes. Why do they need to wear such costumes? Why do Canon Garland and other clergymen need to wear war costumes ? Some of them look absolutely ridiculous in them. It was nearly as amusing as Charlie Chaplin to see Canon Garland at Enoggera Camp walking ahout in his uniform. This is one direction in which there could be curtailment of expenditure. In the navy also there is plenty of room for curtailment of expenditure, but when I say that I am also confronted with the prospect that the Minister would have to throw a number of men out of work, and I hesitate to suggest any particular place where expenditure might be curtailed, because I know that on one occasion the Minister had certain work carried out at Port' Stephens in order to give employment to some unemployed. I am very much interested in the statement that the Treasurer proposes to establish a sinking f u n d of 1 per cent, to extinguish the war debt in thirty nine years. When I was in office I was in favour of a sinking f u n d of 10s. per cent., but the Prime Minister-that young man in a hurry-stipulate d for 2 | per cent. Why has he backed down ?",45
349,Mr JENSEN,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Why did the honourable member give into him ?,46
350,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Because I was not the Prime Minister. Is that not a fair answer ? To my mind a sinking f u n d of 10s. per cent, is quite enough. The nation is very much in the same position aa parents who have children to bring up. Parents who work themselves to death in order to amass money to leave it to their children make a very great mistake, and posterity, who are going to have this huge country, as large as Europe, handed over to them should be-willing to bear a share of the heavy war expenditure that this country is now undertaking.",46
351,Mr BOYD,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Com e over to our party.,46
352,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I am trying to assist the Treasurer.,46
353,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,You are now stealing our policy.,46
354,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,It is not the policy of the' honourable member's party. At one time the policy of the Liberal party was to have no sinking fund.,46
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Not in our time. It is the law now ,46
356,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I believe that honourable members supported the Bill after consideration. A sinking fund of 10s. per cent, will extinguish the debt in about fifty-two years.",46
357,Mr BAMFORD,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Of what use is a sinking f u n d any how ?,46
358,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"If the honourable member had his way he would play ducks and drakes with a sinking fund . That is the trouble. We may have a big sinking f u n d but it all depends upon the Government of the day what is done with it . I wish to say a word or two about the Treasurer's Advance, which has caused the Treasurer some trouble. He has discovered that the sum of Â£1,700,000 has been voted by the House as Treasurer's Advance; and he thinks this* is too large a sum. If a Government is not going to meet Parliament it must have a Treasurer's A d Vance of large dimensions. We cannot allow every Minister to please himself as to what he spends - Some one must keep an eye on the expenditure and that in dividual should be the Treasurer. Among the items which I agreed should be paid out of the Treasurer's Advance during the month of September were Â£38,500 for the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway and Â£41,300 for the purchase of foodstuffs for the Government of India. There was nothing wrong in connection with the expenditure of the Treasurer's Advance.",46
359,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Was there anything paid on account of the ships that were purchased by the Prime Minister?,46
360,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"We arranged to give the Prime Minister Â£2,068,000 for the purchase of those ships. It was my desire, and I hope it is the desire of the present Treasurer, that the Prime Minister or some other Minister should introduce a Bill to legalize that expenditure. It was a very large sum to entrust to one man, but it had to be done. If everybody in the community had been informed that the Prime Minister was about to purchase ships he would never have got them at the price at which he got them, if he got them at all. That was the reason for the Prime Minister keeping that matter more or less secret. But it is now due to the House and the country that the Prime Minister or some other Minister should introduce a Bill at an early date to have the transaction legalized. Another reason why we should cut down Supply from tliree months to two months is in - order that we may get the Government .'here and, if they do not pass this Bill, put them out and get another Government in - office that will do so. It is not necessary to go through the long list of items paid out of the Treasurer's Advance. If the Government is not going to meet Parliament it must have a large Treasurer's Advance. The Treasurer is asking for three months' supply. When he gets that Bill through he will reimburse his Treasurer's Advance Account and have' a million pounds to spare, which will enable him and his Government to stay in recess for four months instead of three months. I would not trust the Prime Minister to meet Parliament in March if he had sufficient money to enable him to wait until April.  said that the Prime Minister is always in a hurry.",46
361,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"He is in a hurry to get into recess, but I do not think that, with his small following, he will be in a hurry to meet Parliament again. The Treasurer has drawn attention to the largeness of the Treasury balances, and has stated that they have averaged Â£20,000,000. I should like to mention that the Government balance at the Commonwealth Bank has been swollen mostly by war-loan money. ",47
362,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"On the 1st July, 1915, the cash balance at the Commonwealth Bank was Â£459,457. A month later it was only Â£391,161. On the 1st September it had grown to Â£1,816,719; on the 1st December, it was Â£6,979,201; on the 4th January, 1916, it was Â£5,935,573; at the beginning of February it was Â£6,907,006; on the 1st March, Â£9,391.089; at the beginning of April, Â£8,700,882; - and at the beginning of May, Â£12,337,060. In addition, there were Â£2,000,000 held on fixed deposit. At the beginning of June, the balance was Â£15,922,866. It is admitted that these are large balances, and honourable members have said that we ought not to have such large sums earning little or no interest. T ask them how much they think the money can earn in Australia? If we can do without it in Australia, it may be well to send some of it to London.  made the other day, I find that it would cost about 10s. per centum to do that.",47
363,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"We cannot get more than 1 per' cent, for the money in Australia, but we might get 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, for it in London if at short call. It is impossible for the Commonwealth Bank to pay interest on Â£20,000,000. c  heeded here ultimately.",47
364,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Yes . That is the answer to those* who complain of the largeness of the balances held in the Commonwealth Bank. We should always be in a position to place our hands on Â£10,000,000 or Â£12,000,000.",47
365,Mr FENTON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I understand that if you have over Â£50 on deposit in the Commonwealth Bank you receive interest on your money. Why cannot the Bank treat the Government as it treats private depositors?,47
366,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank thinks that he cannot afford to pay interest on these large sums.  interest on some of the money.,47
367,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"He may take some of it. I have been pondering over the matter, and eonsidering whether we should leave all the money in the Comonwealth Bank, or distribute it among the private banks, which might be prepared to pay interest for it. We have to raise money in Australia for the war. Bank managers are very conservative. As the war has progressed, they have been careful to keep their reserves as strong as possible. They wish to take the least risk. Their training makes them more nervous than other persons. They see the collapse of the dreams of those who think that they can make a fortune if they can only borrow. Knowing the uncertainties of business, they are conservative. Naturally, when we deposit in the Commonwealth Bank a sum - like Â£20,000,000, most of which, but for the existence of the Commonwealth Bank, would be in the coffers of the private banks, the latter are not prepared to contribute to Commonwealth loans as freely as they would do if part of the money were allowed to remain with them until needed by the Government.  member speaks of is the solution of the difficulty, I think.",47
368,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"That may be one way out of the difficulty. Another way may be, in arranging for the flotation of the next loan, to provide for ten or twelve instalments.",48
369,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Sprea d the instalments over twelve months.  vide a remedy, if interest had to be paid as has been arranged in the past.",48
370,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"We have given very lioeral terms, * for which the public did not ask, but which they have readily accepted. I have no doubt that the public and the banks will advance money more freely if deposits could be made in twelve instalments. That arrangement would suit the Government, because money would be coming in regularly every montb with which it could meet its bills. This would leave less money lying idle in the Commonwealth Bank.",48
371,Mr WAITT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,To spread the instalments over twelve months would increase the popularity of the loans.,48
372,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Unde r ordinary circumstances, I should be very much obliged to the honourable member for his assistance; but, after his malicious attack on me the otlier evening",48
373,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I am assisting the Treasurer.,48
374,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member made a malicious attack on me, and I wish to say uothing to him, privately or publicly, except so far as I may be obliged to deal with him on public matters, in which case I shall address him only as the honourable member for Balaclava, trying to forget as far as I can that he is the creature that he is.",48
375,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member's Temark is surely unparliamentary. The TEMPORARY (Mr ATKINSON ) - I ask the honourable member for Capricornia to withdraw that remark. Mr HIGGS , - I suppose that, as you ask me to withdraw it , sir, I must do so. I remember that the other evening the honourable member accused meof theft. This person, who accuses me of purloining - documents, objects to be called a creature. I say that he is a bully and a coward.",48

377,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"If you insist on it , 1 withdraw tnem. I wish, in the few minutes remaining to me, to deal with the subject of recruiting. If there has been a falling-off in the number of volunteers, it is due to the fact that the Prime Minister and the honourable members for Flinders and Balaclava have discouraged recruiting by their speeches and conduct. To deal first with the honourable member for Flinders: This gallant K n i g h t Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George has appeared on several public platforms urging men to go to the front. He has told the public that there are thousands of persons who are hungering to do something in connection with the war. Why has he not done more than make speeches? Is there no work-non combatant work-that he could do at the front ?",48
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,They would not allow him to go.,48
379,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Yes , they would. Other gentlemen with large incomes have gone. The honourable member for Flinders, who would compel the sons of the poor to go, makes no attempt to perform these services which he says others are hungering to perform. He prefers to stay here and rake in the guineas that he can make by his practice in the courts of law, returning to his well-feathered nest at nighttime. His conduct has discouraged recruiting. But that of the honourable member for Balaclava has been very much worse. On the 2nd February, last year, speaking at an Australian Natives' Association banquet, he said I hope I may be pardoned for giving expression to an opinion on a recent event, the telegram of President Wilson to the Kaiser wishing him luck on his birthday. CHAIRMAN A Voice - The mongrel. Mr Watt - I think no more wanton, profligate outrage was ever perpetrated. Mark the extravagance of the language. The mere sending of a birthday telegram is a "" wanton profligate outrage."" This gentleman is accustomed to use that sort of language. Apparently, he cannot find any other. Surely publio men, in referring to the leading citizens of other nations, should at all times use the language of moderation. The honourable member was known abroad as the exPremier of Victoria, and naturally peofjle there might attach more importance to his words than would those in this State who know h im so well. He does not use the language of moderation; he prefers the language of vituperation, hoping, I suppose, that it will give to h im pearance of bravery which he does not in reality possess. He went on to say on this occasionI t is not a birthday, but a death day, of William of Hohenzollern that we want, and I trust the day is not far distant when the Allies will say to him, in the scarlet words of Shakespeare, ""Down, down to deepest hell, and say I sent the."" Mark the newspaper comment: "" L o u d and tumultuous applause which continued for some minutes."" Is it any wonder that his audience applauded ? The people were profoundly moved by these words. They said, no doubt, Â°"" At last we have a man who is prepared, if need be, to do and die."" The honourable member for Balaclava at any time during the last two and a half years might have gone to Europe and have been within a few miles of the Kaiser. But no, he has preferred to stay in Australia and fight the Kaiser with his mouth.  able member for Capricornia?",48
380,Mr SINCLAIR,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,He would not take h im on.,49
381,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I do not mind taking you on if you like. Let me deal one at a time with these brave gentlemen. Do not let us pay too much attention to the bovine representative of a bovine constituency such as the honourable member for Moreton. In an article headed, "" The Unchained Tiger,"" "" Mr Watt may fight,"" the Argus of 8th July, 1915, stated that at a recruiting meeting held at Moonee Ponds, the honourable member for Balaclava saidThe position is about as desperate as it can be I am sometimes asked at meetings why I do not go myself. It is not intended as a question to embarrass meImagine any question - that could embarrass a gentleman with the colossal impudence of our honourable f r i e n d but is a natural inquiry to understand how it is that men who pretend to be leaders of public thought are not offering to do their PJEPEESENTATIVES.] Supply. share, but are advising other people to go. I fully expect, at the right time, and before this war is over, to go with the men of my age and circumstances. A Voice - We will all go with you. Mr Watt-Do not think I say that boastfully. I say that in order that you may see how grave the situation is to many of us. That was on the 7th July, 1915. A year the ap- and five months have since elapsed and the honourable member is still here.",49
382,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Hear , hear! That is what annoys .the honourable member.",49
383,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Not at all. The honourable member does not annoy me. In a speech which the honourable member for Batman delivered at the Bijou Theatre, on 4th July, 1915, he explained, as reported in the Argus on the following day, thatHe was not a fighting man, nor had he ever pretended to be one, "" I have been the man who looks to reason and conciliation to fix these great disputes,"" he added with warmth. "" The men who should go to fill the gaps, and go hurriedly to the gaps, are those who are urging young men from the platforms. If these warlike people can do the business of war, we peaceful people can attend to other questions. Every man for his own job. If I were suddenly transported to Gallipoli, and if a loaded rifle were placed in my hands, and I saw a Turk in front of me, I would not pull the trigger."" Because of this expression of opinion on the part of the honourable member for . Batman, the honourable member for Balaclava said next day that he should be deprived of his seat. Speaking of him in what I regard as most objectionable terms, he saidHo wondered if Mr Brennan could really be the man who had taken the oath of true allegiance to King George. . . . "" This man,"" said Mr Watt, "" comes from a family with every member of which I am acquainted,.and he is the only pigeon-livered member of it."" Naturally, that criticism stung the honourable member for Batman. Speaking in this House on 8th July, 1915, he said I tell him (Mr Watt) now is the time, and tomorrow morning at the recruiting office I challenge him to meet me, and I will go with him. . . . This is the time. I am not a fighting man, but I can bear stretchers, build barbed-wire entanglements, and carry my dead comrades off the field. . . . I never ""said I feared death, and am prepared to prove it. I said what I feared, and could not do, was to take life. But if Mr Watt wants a man to go into the danger zone with him I will go. He invited the honourable member for Balaclava to go with him to the recruiting office at the Town H all next morning at 10 o'clock. The honourable member for Balaclava did not go, but the honourable member for Batman was at the Town H all ready to go.",49
384,Mr SINCLAIR,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"He did not go past the Town H all , did he?",50
385,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"That is the kind of in terjection I should expect from a Jersey cow if it could speak. The honourable member for Balaclava, on 9th July, 1915, said I am sixteen months within the age limit of forty-five. I am a married man. . . . The circumstances of my business and finances are these: that if I went to the war tomorrow those children would be indifferently provided for. The honourable member would have had his parliamentary salary as well as what he could earn at the frout. This statement on the part of the honourable member, which was made in the course of a public meeting, greatly stirred his audience. The people thought he was replying to the honourable member for Batman's challenge, and were expecting a certain word to come from him, just as great audiences in Melbourne were expecting the Prime Minister to use the word ""conscription."" He worked them up to a great pitch of excitement by means of his eloquent periods, and went on to sayI will go tomorrow morning (loud cheers) at any time-(renewe d cheers) The audience expected him to say that he would go to the recruiting office. Where was he to go? To the front? No ; to Mr Fisher! Greatly modified cheers! He went on to sayI will tell him (Mr Fisher) the facts of my life as I have roughly told you, and if he says it is up to me to go, I will volunteer within half-an-hour. In company with his friend, Jim Boyd, who would pull him out of a hole if he could, he went to Mr Fisher",50
386,Mr BOYD,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,That is totally wrong. I was not interested in or connected with the matter in any way.,50
387,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,A newspaper gave the honourable member the credit of going with him.,50
388,Mr BOYD,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I said the other night that the newspaper was a liar, and I stick to that statement.",50
389,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member for Balaclava has not exhibited much pluck in this affair. He said last week, "" God forbid that Mr Higgs should ever hold office again."" He said that because I had exposed the Prime Minister's tactics. Was he annoyed because I had brought to the fron t some regulations which he himself had discussed with the Prime Minister?",50
390,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,That I discussed with him ?,50
391,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I have it on the best authority that the Prime Minister consulted the honourable member about those very regulations, by which it was proposed to manipulate votes.",50
392,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,That is entirely incorrect.,50
393,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I have it on good authority that the honourable member was consulted, and that he was in constant consultation with the Prime Minister. He was the only member of the Liberal party who did consult with him. I wonder whether he was trying to intrigue the Leader of the Liberal party out of his position. On the return of the Prime M i nister from Sydney after the referendum campaign, he went to Seymour to meet him.",50
394,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I did nothing of the kind.,50
395,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Was he disappointed that the F'rime Minister did not make some proposal for a coalition ?,50
396,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I did nothing of the kind.,50
397,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Anothe r reason why the honourable member for Balaclava said "" God forbid that Mr Higgs should ever hold office again "".was that he was attempting to exploit public sentiment in connection with the returned soldiers. You will have read, sir, that some persons were proposing to buy land, with Government money, on which to settle the people. There was another proposal to avoid land taxation, and, while I was Treasurer, the honourable member called to see me several times on the subject. I well recollect when he first put his head inside my door. He used such objectionable terms in respect of others that he will not mind my saying that when he thrust his head through my doorway, I said to myself, "" By all the gods! Charles Dickens' Bill Sykes!"" When he walked towards me with that lurch of his, that might be expected of a leader of the "" B o u v e r o o "" push, I wondered what was the object of his visit. He asked that I would amend the Land Tax Act to provide that the Australian Farms Limited might be able to avoid taxation.",50
398,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"A good and sound public proposition, which I still maintain.",51
399,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,We shall see.,51
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The gentleman seems to have got this up very well.,51
401,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,No doubt he has spent a week on its preparation.,51
402,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I have spent a little time on it . Since I was made the victim of a malicious and unprovoked attack on the part of the honourable member, I thought it was about up to me to make some reply to him. The honourable member for Balaclava, like all bullies, is a coward when he comes under the lash.",51
403,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,Is that parliamentary? The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. ATKINSON ) - Will the honourable member withdraw that remark?,51
404,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Yes . The honourable member for Balaclava came forward with a proposal that the Australiau Farms Limited should not be asked to pay land tax when it has in process the dispersing of large estates for the special purpose of putting New South Wales and Victorian returned soldiers on the land, and that no present land taxpayer should be called upon to pay a higher rate of tax because of any fresh investment in the company. I got the Commissioner of Taxation to investigate the bona fides of the Australian Farms Limited, to see how far they had been successful in settling farmers on the land-to ascertain their history and practice, and what was the Commissioner's view of the proposal. His reply was as follows: The Commissioner of Taxation considers it impossible to furnish an accurate estimate of the prospective loss of land tax, because it cannot at this stage be known to what extent this company's operations would spread, or whether other companies will be formed to carry on the same business. I then wrote to my colleagues in the GovernmentI do not approve of the first amendment suggested by the company, viz., that the company should not be asked to pay land tax when it has in process the dispersing of large estates. Land owners would probably arrange with the company to take over properties, with a view to evading taxation. I am afraid that the time at my disposal will not permit me to go further into this question, but I turned the proposition down, in spite of the solicitation of the honourable member for Balaclava, and I submit that that is the reason he made such a vicious and unprovoked attack on honourable me the other evening.",51
405,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I had forgotten all about it!,51
406,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,I have done with the honourable member for the present.,51
407,Mr WATT,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,What about the honourable meinber for Moreton?,51
408,Mr HIGGS,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"If it is necessary, I should be just as willing to "" take on "" the honourable member for Moreton as I have been to "" take on "" the honourable member for Balaclava. I warn the latter honourable member that he must not think that he can bring into the Federal House the tactics he adopted in the State House of Victoria, because they will be combated every time he uses them. This House has wrecked the reputation of many a public man, and no man's reputation has received a bigger dint than that of the honourable member for Balaclava. I commend to the electors of Balaclava the remarks I have made concerning that gentleman this evening.",51
409,Mr MAHONY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Dalley) [10.5] Mud slinging has been carried on, not only in this chamber, but fro m one end of Australia to the other during the last six or seven weeks. It is most astonishing to find men, who pose as leaders of thought and as empire builders, indulging in tactics that would disgrace people of the lowest order in the world. Criminal charges have been preferred against - certain people in the community, and those charges are made a stalking-horse for political purposes. The object is to associate members of this House with people who are alleged to be guilty of criminal actions. It is most cowardly and contemptible to attempt, for political reasons, to damn the character of men against whom nothing can be said, either publicly or privately. During the referendum campaign I myself was charged with being connected with the Industrial Workers of the World. I know nothing of that association- I do not know a single member of it , and was never connected with it in any way; yet this charge was made against me. I repudiate any charges of this kind, and to say that I ""was astonished at""sueh being levied against me is to - express my feelings in very mild language. We hear of what is called the ""higher criticism,"" and it would seem, that the rarefied atmosphere in which some people live induces them to indulge in sueh criticism as I have described. When, during the campaign, we told the - people what Australia was doing, and was prepared in a. legitimate and honourable way to do, we were told that we were in the pay of Germany and the agents of the Kaiser, and then, as a piece of ""'higher criticism "" in excelsâ¢ , we were said to be members of the - Industrial Workers of the World. Such tactics reflect no credit on .the people who adopt .them,-and the vote of the people of Australia on the .2.8""th October is the best, reply that can be made to them. ' When we have a campaign, let it be conducted on the merits or demerits of the question before us, but do not let us lookjn mud puddles for filth to throw at one another. Those who make .'charges of the kind in connection with myself I challenge to place their character against.my own. It is damnable to, first .of all, say that there is .a.criminal .association in existence, and then to connect the names of honourable men with it. ",51
410,Mr MAHONY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member may. not have done so personally, but rthose who hold , the whip over his party outside-hi s press "" barrackers ""-hav e done so. One of the reasons 'for - the falling off in recruiting is to be found in such tacties, although there are other reasons, as I pro-pose to show. 'One of those other-reasons is the idiotic,ahd, in. some cases, the callous, administration of the Defence Department, in face of which we cannot possibly hope to have a proper response to our appeal for recruits. What is wanted, first of all, is the abolition of the present policy, and the adoption of a policy of justice and common sense. One case, which is typical of many, is that of a man who enlisted as a private, and, .after being at the front for a short time, ""was given the temporary rank of corporal, which carried with it an increase in pay of 4s. a day. His wife, had been left with - an allotment of 3s. a day and a separation allowance of ls. 5d., or a total of 4s. 5d. [344] a day. This she was getting on the pay of her husband as a private. But it suddenly dawned on the Department that it .had been paying the woman .a separation allowance which the regulations did not.allow, the temporary rank of corporal, at 9s. a day, bringing the payments over theproper amount. In a letter which the woman wrote to me she. sairl that on a certain day, when she went to draw her allowance, she was informed that she had overdrawn by Â£20, and that her payments in the future would be reduced to ls. a day until that:amount had been refunded. - She-said she had been told'that there were hundreds of others in a similar position, some of the husbands being in Egypt and some in Erance. She pointed, out in her letter that it was impossible for a woman to'live in Sydney on 7s. a week, and that she was an old woman whose working days were passed. It will be seen that this was the Department's own mistake and incompetence, but, all the same, the woman's allowance was cut down to ls. a day. I know that the Assistant Minister is very sympathetic, and, if he had the power, would quickly remedy this .sort of .thing. ' Mr LAIED - SMITH - If the honourable member will let me have the woman's letter, T shall'look into the case.",52

420,Mr MAHONY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"I will tell the Committee the sort of things done by the Deuniversal partment presided over by Senator of Pearce, a man who does not receive with ordinary civility a member who interviews him. I say candidly that I will not go to the Minister for Defence with any discipline more cases. I wish to draw the attention of the Committee to the case of young Australians who nobly responded to the call for recruits. We sent them off to the fron t as heroes, and, to our dismay, we found that Senator Pearce and his Department brought them back as criminals. This matter first came under my notice in the following letterW. H. Mahony, Esq., M.P.', Balmain. Dear Mr Mahony, I am deeply interested in the case of Boy Fountain, recently court martialled and sen-' King tenced to three years' imprisonment with hard that labour. The young man is only about twenty-one years of age, and was about one of the first to go to the front, and served for seventeen weeks on the Peninsula. I am sending you a statement of his and I understand his relatives have already Been you, and that you are also interesting yourself in regard to Mr Quill. The punishcomplement. ment appears to me to be outrageous. young man has been sent back to serve three yeais' hard labour in our ordinary prisons, and his career practically is blasted by a form of officiousness which one can quite understand would influence alarge majority of people against anything like militarism.' The Herald and Daily Telegraph newspapers have also been impressed by the severe tences. The Herald, in reporting, heads their report, "" Severe Sentences,"" and the Daily Telegraph heads its report, "" Heavy Sentences."" I am attaching herewith the Daily Telegraph report. Will you do your best to get at the matter at once, even if a temporary expedient can found in releasing Fountain, with Quill Dalton on parole until further inquiry been made. Will you also endeavour to get fused. at once a copy of the records of the case. understand Senator Millen, Senator Gardiner,  Even if the case were much worse than what by is painted, one's blood boils at the method martial of the punishment and the confinement these young men in the State's prisons for years in respect to,a breach of discipline. .. In the case of Mr Quill, I understand that he is a married man with wife and young chilnot dren, and that the authorities have refused to give her any allowance. I have to confess, as one who believes in service, and has acted as chairman a War Recruiting Committee, and visited at the homes of many young men, that this list of punishments which has been published has almost frozen my zeal. One, of course, subscribes at once to punishment for lack of in matters of great moment, but one cannot subscribe to forms of punishment which appear to have the viciousness that is akin three almost to a barbarous vengeance. Yours truly, (Sgd.) RICHARD CROFT. This is the statement of Private Roy FountainStatement of Roy Fountain. On the 10th March three of us, Privates Darley Chambers, Quill, H. J. Dalton, and self, three of us on the 156 King-street, same charge, were sentenced for three years' Sydney, 21st June, 1916. penal servitude. No, it was not for manslaughter or blackmail, but for disobeying in such a manner as to show wilful disregard of military discipline and authority, as the crimesheet shows it. And^ they still say, ""Your and country need you."" And to think a man enlisted to fight for men like that. After seventeen weeks on the Peninsula, we, 20th Battalion, were sent back to Egypt, and then across the Suez Canal on the Arabian Desert. One of the jobs allotted to our battalion was that of building a light railway. There was a party of us told off for outpost case, duty. Next morning the party for railway was found to be short, and our party was taken at a minute's notice to make up the Before leaving for work, we The asked Sergeant Turner about water, as we would be away from camp from 8 a.m. t ill 4.30 p.m. We could get no satisfaction-the rest of the party had filled their bottles previous to this. On arriving at the job about 8.30 a.m., after a march of 1 mile, the three of us (Quill, Dalton, and self) were told off with a party' under Corporal Cunningham. senWe sat down, and did not start work. The corporal came along and asked us why we were not working, and we said we wanted some water first. He, the corporal, said that water would be sent for at 10 o'clock, that would mean 11.30 before it came back-w e would have to work in the broiling sun with a shovel be for three hours without a drink. We asked and the corporal for a drink out of his bottle, has which was then full of water, and were reSergeant Turner was then brought I along, and he also refused us a drink. Lieutenant Blanchard also refused us. We were then placed under arrest, and we were tried court martial on the 10th March. At court it was pointed out this was my first of offence, and my character was very good. That is the case for those boys who today are in a criminal prison in New South Wales. On receiving that letter, I brought the matter under the notice of the Minister for Defence, by letter, and received the following reply from the Acting Secretary of the Department for Defence, under date of 23rd June, 1916With reference to representations made by you concerning Privates Quill, H . J. Dalton, and Roy Fountain, who have been returned from the front under sentence for disobedience, I am directed to inform you that the court martial proceedings in these cases have not yet come to hand; but, on their receipt, the matter referred to in your letter will receive prompt consideration. I waited in the ordinary way for the promised communication; but having received no further word, on the 4th tober I sent the following "" chaser "" after our friend Senator PearcejRe case of Privates Quill, Dalton, and tain, who were seventeen weeks in trenches, Gallipoli, now doing three years in criminal gaol.

To that telegram I received the following . reply, despatched from Melbourne on 16th October, twelve days laterWith reference to your telegram of the instant, respecting the case of Privates Dalton, and Fountain, of the Australian perial Force, who are at present under sentence of three years' imprisonment, I directed to inform you that, pending ceipt of the proceedings of the Courts which tried these men, it is regretted that i possible to take any action. The proceedings have been cabled for from England, and should be shortly available, and on their receipt it is proposed to submit these cases for the conweeks sideration of the Committee appointed to view court-martial sentences. The boys had been sentenced by court martial in"" March, l n June, the Department said that the papers had not arrived, and in October the papers were still unavailable. Now the Department proposes to ' cable to somebody-God knows who and where-to send the papers in connection with the case. All this time these boys are incarcerated in a criminal gaol in New South Wales. It ' is - sort of thing which is damaging recruitfesto,"" ing in Australia.",53

Why should not the Department liberate these prisoners, holding the sureties until the papers arrive, and then if it is proved 4th that they have been guilty of something Quill, which deserves punishment to the extent Imof three years' imprisonment in a comam mon gaol, perhaps we will allow them to the rego there. One of these boys held a responsible position in . a public Departt is not ment, but he felt it to be his duty to give up that position and go to the front. The three of them served for seventeen in that hole of hell, Gallipoli, and reeven if they did commit an indiscretion, even if they had the awful temerity to ask for a drink of water in the Egyptian desert, that does not justify them being sent to a criminal gaol for three years.",54

The state of affairs shown in the letter from the Comforts Committee, if true, is a scandal, and the reply from the Department shows that there is laxity some7th November, 1916. where when such a-thing can take place, and they admit that there is no information available up to the present time on Moore-street, City. the subject. If the Department-is being ru n as it should be run, and the interests of the men are considered, it'ought to know immediately whether any comforts were placed on a transport for the use of menThere is too much of this sort, of thing, going on. It creates an uneasy feeling, in the minds of people that the goods, they donate for the use of the troops are not being given to them, but are being sold to them, and that some one is making money out of the deal. The great thing that is helping to kill recruiting is the laxitv in the administration of the Defence Department. Unsympathetic administration tends to k ill that healthy feeling which enables a good response to be made to the call for volunteers. I . opposed compulsion, and I am still opposed to it , but I am not opposed to voluntarism. I havei always been in favour of it . and have always endeavoured to do my b it for my country. I am still prepared to do what I think is the right, thing.",54
428,Mr WEBSTER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Is the honourable member prepared to go out recruiting ? B. PILLINGER, Hon. See. . Mr MAHONY - I believe that com^ mon-sense administration of the Defence Department would help to get recruits more than the sending of flamboyant telegrams all over the country. We would' get far more recruits and more confidence in the Department. What kills recruiting is the fact that the people outside have no confidence in the administration of the military authorities today-.",55
429,Mr WEBSTER,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,The honourable member the. does not propose to go out and help.,55
430,Mr MAHONY,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"Statement s "" Routing-the shirkers,"" "" In s p i r in g the' workers,"" and "" Australia will be there "" cut. no ice. What will help fa r better to. winr the war will be common-sense administration by the Department. I hope that the Department willgive serious consideration to cases such as those I have mentioned, and when an honourable member approaches the Minister for Defence the Minister might have the ordinarydecency to treat him with courtesy, and, at least, listen to what he has to say in reference to the matter he wishes to put forward.",56
431,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,TRIALS OF INDUSTRIAL,"T s there any objection to adjourning the debate!  orable member to understand that I want the Supply Bill put through tomorrow, in order to get it to the Senate. Mr TUDOR ' - It all depends upon how many speakers there arefrom the Liberal party, becauso the members of my party are prepared to-sit on to-night if they are not to have an opportunity of speaking tomorrow.",56
