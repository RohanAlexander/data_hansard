From there, I was and considered the issues involved through that some members of the committee about where to lowlighted, in my view-by extreme claims statements made by some scientists who are in being one whom I will have a couple of things to to the other side where various experts from more flat-earth approach and are concerned more are also being blown out of proportion. say a few things, and one is that, as someone I am not sure what will end up being the case both in terms of adult stem cells and in terms of is limited and that of a layman, with reNA 6042 MAIN COMMITTEE spect to research in these areas, the one thing evidence with respect to adult stem cells that on behalf of humankind in the years to come. may well happen with embryonic stem cells. entist, I am not an expert in this field, and evidence that suggests things both ways. We of both sides of the cause are endeavouring to own particular views with respect to this issue. When this matter was being considered overwhelmingly, but not entirely, medical experts in embryonic stem cells agreed on one thing: as is the case with medical research and as is a range of areas, often where you go and how opments in one can and will often assist developments move forward in a way that ensures that society debilitating conditions that face people as an early age. So I do not think there is a convincing of which research is best; I think both research on that basis. It comes down to your ethical I think that is the key. Before I go to that question, though, I turn why this sort of research should not be allowed. and that this is a step down a track which inexorably examples have been given as to where this might That is plainly ridiculous, in my view. It is this track, things may not end up where people that, if you do not regulate these areas, you influence what occurs. That issue underpins we are here, on occasions, to intervene and chances of particular things occurring within slippery slope that the point of this legislation place to avoid such a problem. Will that system be perfect? No, I do not believe system? Yes, it is. Are we in a situation where issues around this question?

I will be quite viewpoint on the Legislation and Constitutional cess IVF embryos in the circumstances outlined. evidence is produced to show that this research conditions that have been mentioned-and that sider other aspects of therapeutic cloning that in this area, but not now.

But, if we have consider those questions down the track. That circumstances: you put in place safeguards that them in the circumstances. I think one of the best arguments about the the ethics of some of the people involved has about Professor Alan Trounson, the germ cell appears to have come out in that. I stress that we have heard the end of it quite yet. Trounson is a better researcher than he has been port. I have to say that I think he has been one something new for me to say, although At one stage Professor Trounson said to report-that there were enough stem cells available do what is required. That was plainly out of sync, we spoke to. I must admit that I formed a view time in front of the test tube and less time ing to explain stuff which he clearly has some gets across the views of his particular part of terms of the public debate, has been unhelpful. he gets out of it, the better. When we look at where we go from here, it of an embryo. What are we talking about here? to that human life? I am sorry, the arguments believe that an embryo at the age that we are tential development of a human life because it where development is going to occur, and we cumstances we face with, in this case, excess IVF embryos.

There is the question of where we go from one in this debate. I am hopeful that the decision I do not know if it is the correct one.

On a scheme to regulate research on embryos, rather NA 6056 MAIN COMMITTEE than banning research on embryos completely, situation of competing ethical beliefs, it is universally acceptable resolution. This bill It does, however, seek to strike a balance. After knowledge about both adult and embryonic stem are routinely discarded, I have come to the view priate and necessary at this time. The bill prohibits the removal of an embryo collecting a viable human embryo. It also prohibits body of a woman for any purpose other than bill does basically prohibit the creation of there are already thousands of embryos in existence used for the purpose for which they were created. part of an assisted reproductive technology thought of as IVF embryos which are not used These embryos may not be kept indefinitely.

However, even after that time, because method of creation of embryos and the purposes liberate creation of excess embryos is prohibited. Mr Deputy Speaker, several arguments have embryos even within the extremely constrained dress four of them. The first argument put forward and unjustified because adult stem cells offer ethical challenges as the use of embryonic stem benefits of adult stem cells are well established, treatment of blood disorders and diseases. number of reasons why adult stem cells are that the two areas of research are in fact complementary exclusion of the other. I understand that adult stem cells do not have have to differentiate into any tissue in the large numbers, they do not replicate indefinitely, advancement of knowledge in areas that adult cell research may increase understanding about development, and this may assist scientists studying ageing process. It does seem likely that research word, symbiotic. If research involving embryos such cells will never be realised. Further, it development of knowledge that would have application use of stem cells. For these reasons, I do not stem cells as sufficient justification to A second argument against permitting embryonic would be better allocated to research on adult cells. For myself, I genuinely do not think that particular path of research on the basis of an than an alternative path. Despite the fact that range of areas, I simply do not believe that of judgment. Mr Deputy Speaker, a third argument against volving embryos is that this is in some way for access to embryos. The bill does facilitate, Australia to expand the existing knowledge about parent that this bill does not give scientists method, any and all human embryos. I emphasise available for research are a limited number of fertility treatment program and ultimately lowed to be kept frozen in suspended existence posed of.

This restriction is for up to three the legislation imposes restrictions on the for which embryos may be created, the debeen advanced against allowing research on parameters provided for in this bill. I will adis that research on embryos is unnecessary great therapeutic potential without the same cells. Indeed, at least some of the therapeutic for example, the use of bone marrow in However, it is my understanding that there are a not the equivalent of embryonic stem cells and and neither should be pursued to the the same ability that all embryonic stem cells body.
