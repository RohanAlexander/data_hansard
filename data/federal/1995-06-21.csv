2,Mr FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the committee's report entitled Protecting the vulnerable? The migration agents registration scheme, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",11
3,Mr FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report on the migration agents registration scheme fundamentally derives from a compromise in an area where there are differing views on this scheme. It is fair to say that there is a unanimous view that there have been and continue to be problems in the industry, whether it be the question of unscrupulous operators who exploit an extremely vulnerable group in our community, those who in many cases have minimal chances of succeeding in claims for permanent residence in the country, or whether it be that both the lawyers and non-lawyers, as far as this community is concerned, in this field really lack expertise. It is agreed that there is a need for some controls in this field. The long-term debate whether it be by government instituted regulation or by a degree of self-regulation. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) asked for consideration after a period of two years of this scheme. The committee had differing views as to the success and the possible future operation of the scheme. The committee has decided unanimously that the scheme should operate for another three years and that it should be reviewed by the same committee at that stage but that, in the interim, objective performance indicators should be developed by the board itself. That is the stage we have reached today. I do not think there is any doubt, as I said earlier, that the industry has problems. I fairly consistently see agents out there-you really have to have doubts about their presence in the field-and, on a personal level, I have had to refer at least one complaint to the board. It is fair to say that some of the problems in the industry and the operation of this board derive from the fact that it has been, perhaps Report understandably, preoccupied in the last two years with the registration process. There has been minimal disciplinary action at this stage. But, on the other hand, it is fair to say that the fact that 600 people have either been denied entry or registration or have on their own part decided not to proceed is an indication that something is occurring. The committee came to the conclusion that lawyers in the field should still be registered. That position has been upheld by the High Court. At the same time, the High Court did say that there were aspects of the industry and the practice of lawyers that should not come within the province of the registration board. Therefore, it has been suggested that a lawyer be exempt from the requirement to register as a migration agent when undertaking preparation or representation in relation to visa refusals or cancellation before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The committee is concerned that the current processes do not catch up with advice in some fields. Therefore, it is suggested that with regard to advice the legislation cover is family members and sponsors in future. There is a major recommendation on the issue of the current different schedule fees. It was thought that, since the inauguration of the measures, too many people were being permitted to take the concessionary fee. Therefore, new provisions have been recommended to overcome those concerns. The committee has recommended that registered agents who live in towns and regions where there is no access to alternative immigration assistance and who provide immigration assistance in less than six cases per year should pay the concessional levy of $100 for agents registering in their own right and $50 for agents registering as employees of registered agents. The schedule should be modified not to police a system that does a minimal number of cases each year, particularly in areas where there is no alternative, but to make sure that the whole thing is not exploited widely and that a large number of people are paying minimal fees. People who do not have expertise perhaps have to be encouraged to actually continue to be part of the industry. That is a fairly important modification. To give some indication of the growth of the application of concessional fees, in June 199439 per cent of agents were paying that fee. This obviously applies to a wider group than was originally intended by the minister or the committee. The report contains 49 recommendations from the committee. The committee is of the view that the very close relationship that currently exists between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Migration Agents Registration Board should be lessened, and that the role of the chairman should not attach itself to the department. But, at the same time, the committee saw a need for the department to have a representative on the board. The committee has suggested that there be more liberal arrangements for constituting a quorum. An important and unanimous recommendaor tion from the committee-No. 34-was that its the code of conduct for migration agents amended to provide that a migration agent should not lodge vexatious or grossly unare founded applications. That is a typical aspect of the industry which we are all aware of. this country the ability to pursue legal is very liberal. That can be fairly scandalously exploited by some practitioners who receive a substantial amount of money. As a consedid quence, people are running through our system for years on end without much hope of a claim and, through that process, slowing down the claims of others. The report was agreed to unanimously. represents the views of a group of people have a reasonable knowledge of this field. The people have had a long-term involvement in the field and are aware of the problems there. The recommendations do represent a reasonable compromise. We will be able to see how this system pans out in the next three years. There will be the opportunity to push for greater training in the private sector and the opportunity to liberalise requirements for community groups. I take this opportunity to thank the committee secretariat and advisers. I have been involved with many committees, but the swiftness with which this report has been compiled and the work that has gone into it, considering the legal problems in the field and the need for international comparisons, has been very worthwhile.",11
4,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I draw attention to the cover of the report. It is rather remarkable. Protecting the vulnerable? is the title. You would think there was a message in that that what we were about was protecting the vulnerable. But the title has at the end of it a question mark. That question mark after the title was very deliberate because, while we all want to protect the vulnerable, the outcome of this inquiry shows that there is no clear evidence that in trying to achieve that objective that outcome has been derived. It is a matter of very real concern to me and my colleagues who participated in this inquiry that there was an inability to come to a concluded view about whether not this registration scheme had achieved objective of protecting those in Australia be who are seeking to remain here and those who want to bring relatives to Australia and seeking advice to assist those who are very often vulnerable to exploitation by the In activities of those who are often seen to be claims somewhat parasitical in their approach. It is very interesting that we have set up quite an expensive registration scheme. We so after the government had gone through a number of changes of attitude about this matter. We had in place over a long period of time a registration scheme, but it did not work. When Senator Ray was minister for It immigration he determined that we would put who in place another system which relied more upon consumer affairs principles. When Mr Hand was minister for immigration we develout oped this comprehensive registration system. We did so in the context of the changes that have been occurring in administrative law in Australia whereby people who are registering and are likely to be struck off have certain entitlements to the administration and judicial review of any decisions taken. We have set in place administrative arrangements about which we have a great deal of information. We can tell you how many people have registered, how many people have been refused registration, a good deal about the amount of revenue that has been derived and something about the qualifications of the people who have registered. There is a good deal of information on profile. In terms of any statistical analysis of performance which would enable us to evaluate whether or not the scheme has been successful, there is a dearth of information. When we got down to analysing whether or not the scheme ought to be maintained, all we had was a whole lot of anecdotal information from people in the field. Many of the people in the field who can offer advice are highly qualified to give expert opinions that you could rely on. When you look at the nature of their advice, you find that they came down on both sides of the ledger. I want to read out some advice from the Springvale Community Aid and Advice Bureau. The lady from the bureau who gave evidence was Merle Mitchell. She is very well known for her expertise in these fields of the social sciences. The bureau had this to say: The migration agents registration scheme has given extra status to those who are registered and has made it easier for them to attract clients and dramatically increase charges. People believe that those who are registered must have the expertise which is required for a successful application. In fact, there are no checks and balances once registered. Those who are registered do not come under any scrutiny unless complained against. In fact, quality of the service provided has not improved. We have many examples of inaccurate and inadequate information, poorly prepared submissions and inappropriate representation. If there is to be any review of this scheme in the future, people will have to come to grips with putting in place the collection of statistical information that will enable them to come to proper conclusions about the validity of the scheme. That is the message contained in this report. We deal with a lot of other issues in relation to trying to improve the registration scheme and trying to deal with some of the technical problems that have arisen. My colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) has covered most of them. We unanimously support that, but there is this concern that we have gone down the regulatory route-that is fine-but, if the regulatory route does not achieve the outcome expected of it, should we keep in place a complex, expensive administrative scheme if it is not going to deliver the goods? That is really the question that needs to be addressed. This report cannot, because the evidence is not available, give us the answer but it does give us a pointer as to what needs to be done in the future to collect the information that will enable valid conclusions to be drawn and for a judgment to be made as to whether or not we still need to have this sort of registration scheme in place. Like my colleague, I thank the professional staff of the committee. I thank its secretary, Andres Lomp; his research officer, Stephen Boyd; and those who worked with the secretariat. I particularly thank the person who gave the committee over a long period legal advice, Dr Kathryn Cronin. I think we were particularly lucky to have had available to the committee the service of somebody of that competence, background and experience. She is a highly qualified academic who gives of her time. I guess there is a fee, but we were extraordinarily lucky to have had her undertaking that work, particularly given her overseas experience in the immigration area. I also thank Mr Ian Branston, who was seconded from the Department of Immigration the and Ethnic Affairs. He had the background in relation to this report. He did not influence the conclusions we came to but he certainly knew the procedures and what had been done and was able to provide invaluable support and advice on the inner workings of the scheme and the department. I commend the report to all those who are interested in reading it. It demonstrates the value of the parliamentary committee system.",12
5,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The fact that it is necessary to have a migration agents registration scheme, to my mind, is a reflection, first, on the complexity of laws affecting migrants in this country and, secondly, on the capacity and the willingness of members of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to provide what I see as the public face so essential in a civil service to provide advice without fee and without question of a person's integrity. It has long been my concern that in so many ways the federal Public Service extends over an enormous range of disciplines with a large number of individuals, some of whom certainly have a capacity to provide a kind, sympathetic and helpful reaction to public inquiries but too many regretfully the reverse. There are many aspects in that part which deal with the frequency with which people are moved. I do not think enough emphasis is given to the status of the people who have desk interface with the inquiring public. I commend to senior officers in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs the practice that Trevor Boucher, the former Commissioner of Taxation, adopted in the Australian Taxation Office: from time to time he and other senior officers went on exercises to meet the public at the front counter to see the nature and extent of inquiries that are pursued with the department. Doing that would not mean we would be able to overcome all the obligations that migration agents now fulfil, but I believe there is a singular ineffectiveness in too many people providing help at the public interface within the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. On too many occasions I find people come to me and to my electorate office simply because the department has not been as helpful as I wish it could be at that public interface. By the time we get to a more senior officer of course help can be provided, but too often members of the public do not know how or in what way they can find that more senior officer. As a result, we have the extraordinarily complex scheme which this report embraces. I want to add only briefly to the comments made by previous speakers. As my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who spoke before me in this debate, identified, there is a question mark at the end of the title Protecting the vulnerable? The people about whom this report is really concerned are those who quite often have little knowledge of the English language. If they have the language, they do not have the understanding of the depth of the innuendo and inference of English. As a result, quite often they do need to be treated in a slightly different way from those who are totally familiar with our language and our culture. Too often those who are essentially seeking help in the refugee migration field have also suffered in the countries from which they came, hence their search to come to Australia. The people with whom migration agents deal are vulnerable. There is no doubt that the code of conduct-and there are some remarks in the report about the code of conduct for migration agents-is designed to ensure the migration agents themselves do not exploit those vulnerable people. At the same time, it is true that no final decision has been reached on the validity of this whole process. The first of the committee's recommendations is that the scheme be continued to operate for a further three years with a range of improvements, and they are detailed. But it also recommends that before the end of those three years there be another inquiry into the operation and effectiveness of the migration agents scheme. The recommendations that were made in this report have identified a number of improvements. It is imperative that there be a capacity through the Migration Agents Registration Board to supervise the functioning by migration agents of the tasks for which they are paid. There is a question of costs and .he extent to which some seem to charge more than others, and that is always a matter for people providing professional advice. The evidence tendered to the committee was mixed. The quality of the migration agents themselves also seemed to be mixed. I confess to having come away from the inquiry with doubts in my own mind as to the efficacy of migration agents as they are now structured. In too many instances, a report or the conduct of a particular inquiry is based more on the knowledge that a particular migration agent has particular officers within the department than it is on any particular technical competence they have in their own field. I was pleased that in the report we have included a reference to the form by which future training is essential for migration agents before they are registered. I would like to echo my colleagues' commendation of the staff of the committee-that is, Andres Lomp and Stephen Boyd. I would also echo the sentiments of my committee colleagues in stating that we are extraordinarily fortunate to have the services of Dr Kathryn Cronin. She has been remarkable in the work she has done for the committee. It is a very good example of how the academic interface can be of assistance in a field as technical as this. The committee is indebted to Ian Branston too, who was seconded from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, for his work was very helpful. I commend the report. I also recommend to the government that it take note of that other recommendation that there be a further inquiry into the migration agents registration scheme before the termination of the three years extension, which this committee also recommends. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 June, on motion by Mr Kerr: That the bill be now read a second time.",13
6,Mr SOMLYAY,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 will amend the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to assist in modernising the law on personal insolvency. Key provisions of the bill include simplified processes for low income minor bankruptcies, the creation of a one-stop bankruptcy shop and the tightening of the provisions dealing with those who divest themselves of property to third parties when facing bankruptcy. Towards the end of 1993 the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) released three discussion papers on the reform of the Bankruptcy Act. These papers dealt with the property available for payment of debts, the administration of the states and the reform of part X of the act. They arose out of the Law Reform Commission's general insolvency inquiry. Some of the amendments to this legislation result from those papers and some are designed to improve the drafting of the act. This bill covers five major areas. The first is .the administration of bankruptcy matters. When an individual becomes bankrupt his or her property and finances are placed into the hands of a trustee in bankruptcy. Usually, the trustee is an accountant or lawyer registered under the Bankruptcy Act 1966. Where a registered trustee is unavailable, the responsibility always falls to the official trustee. Official receivers act on behalf of the official trustee, usually on a state basis. The administration and oversight of bankruptcy matters is carried out by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. The first step in a bankruptcy process is the issue of a notice on the debtor either on the application of creditors or by the debtors own petition. Bankruptcy notices are issued by registrars in bankruptcy who are based in the Federal Court. In each state and territory, the registrar is the district registrar of the Federal Court. The property of the debtor then comes under the control of the trustee in bankruptcy. There is some interaction and overlap between the ITSA and the registrars in bankruptcies in formal record keeping and documentation. The amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act will provide that the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy, apart from the residual jurisdiction of the High Court. The administrative day to day record keeping and documentation procedures will be handled by one agency. The bill proposes a concept of a onestop shop with the transfer of certain administrative functions from the Federal Court to the ITSA. The office of the registrar and deputy registrar in bankruptcy will be abolished and their duties transferred to the official receiver. This will allow an ordinary debtor who files for bankruptcy to deal with the ITSA alone and to have more prompt service from one Commonwealth agency. This will avoid the present exchange of the documentation between the Federal Court and the ITSA and will reduce the cost involved in duplication. While having one agency to handle bankruptcy matters will be less costly than the current process, the recent High Court decision in the Brandy case raises a number of concerns. While the High Court indicated that it is often difficult to separate judicial and administrative functions, apart from the issue of enforceability which is clearly an exercise in judicial power, it is worth commenting that this is a matter which may only be resolved by litigation. The Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia is concerned at the consolidation of power into the hands of the ITSA. The amendments will further concentrate that power. Serious concerns about the ITSA have been raised by practitioners. They have indicated that they think the ITSA is under-performing. The second reform· addressed by this bill relates to property and other transactions to bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is said to commence on the occasion of the first act of bankruptcy within six months before the actual date of presentation of the petition. This means that certain transactions are rendered void against a claim by the trustee. In certain circumstances some property settlements, dating back as far as five years, can be challenged by the trustee. The law currently looks at the intention to parties and the nature of the settlements. The bill will change the test for determining whether these prior settlements are immune from claims. The simpler test under the bill will mean that if the bankrupt transferred property to another person for no consideration or for less than the market value those transactions may be subject to a claim by the trustee. The test will be one of whether at the time of the transfer of the property the now bankrupt was 'technically insolvent' . The amendments will place the emphasis on the likely effect on creditors of that earlier transaction. This will attempt to overcome a rort, which will enable the debtor to transfer property to escape a personal guarantee and to then declare bankruptcy. The definition of 'technically insolvent' raises a number of concerns as it catches potential liabilities. This definition could technically catch individuals who, under the principle of joint and several liability, are called upon to provide for the entire sum of a guarantee. While the guarantors may have the funds to provide for their expected part of the amount, they may be unable to provide for the entire guarantee and may therefore come under the definition of technically insolvent. All groups consulted by the opposition have concerns with the wording of these provisions, particularly that they will apply to all bankruptcies that are current when the provisions are finally enacted, amounting to retrospective legislation. These provisions should apply only to the transactions which take place after the new sections commence operation. The third area relates to insolvency administrations outside actual bankruptcy. Under the prior Bankruptcy Act, a person who is facing a serious financial crisis may enter into a part X arrangement, which is a step short of actual bankruptcy, such as an agreement for a schedule of payment by instalments. The bill amends these procedures to make the procedure the same for both solicitors and trustees who act for debtors who enter into assignments, arrangements or compositions under part X. The bill will also introduce a new form of debt administration, which will be known as a part IX debt agreement, which will apply to debtors whose level of liability does not exceed $20,000. This will provide for the circulation of a debtor's proposal for payment of less than the full amount or for· periodic payments. This new part is an attempt to simplify proceedings for a debtor where the debtor owes a smaller amount, as can be done with the additional requirements for a part X arrangement, such as the necessity to call a meeting, and is done through the official trustee. However, there are concerns on this side of the House that the legislation will further consolidate the power of the ITSA by casting it in the role as regulator and adviser. Debtors may not get the most objective, best advice and may not seek their own independent advice from a third party but accept the advice of ITSA. We feel the amount of $20,000 may be too low and it may be more appropriate to have a higher amount such as $50,000. The other area of reform addressed by the bill is the income contributions from bankrupts. These amendments are in response to the decision of the Federal Court in the case of Bond v. Ramsay of 1994. In this case, the trustee classified the provision of over $700,000 in housing, office expenses, travel and telephone and legal expenses by Mr Bond's family and associates as fringe benefits and, therefore, income related, attracting the income contribution provisions of the act. Mr Bond was therefore required to make a substantial income contribution to reduce his debts. Mr Bond challenged this assessment and was successful on appeal to the Federal Court, and the $700,000 was considered to be gifts and not income. While the trustee is appealing this decision in the High Court, the bill attempts to restore what was intended in the original amendments in 1992 dealing with income contribution from bankrupts and will now also cover loans and other benefits to bankrupts. Again, the coalition has some concerns about these provisions. The key provision is to amend the definition of income in section 139L, which will include the value of a benefit that is provided in any circumstances and the value of the loan made to a bankrupt. This means that a bankrupt who receives payment of legal fees to challenge a decision of the trustee may be required to make an income contribution on the basis that legal aid would fall within the income definition. The trustee, while having a discretion to exclude certain payments from the income contribution provisions, in reality may rarely exercise this discretion. The Law Council has raised a contrasting concern, indicating that the proposed amendment may not work as, although it attempts to remove the requirement for a benefit to be provided in respect of employment, it may still require an employment nexus, relying as it does on the definition of benefit within the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act. There is concern about the way the income provision has been drafted in that any provision of the FBTAA can be amended by regulation for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act. We feel that is an inappropriate delegation of legislative power and may be open to constitutional challenge. The Law Council has also indicated that these new sections should not apply to transactions which took place before the commencement of the new provisions, as such retrospective operation would be quite unfair. The fifth area of reform is to the duties of the trustees. New duties will be introduced which will require a more commercial orientation of trustees. The trustee will be required to report to creditors within three months on the specific issue of whether creditors can expect a dividend and also to administer estates· with a view to avoid unnecessary expense. The official trustee will become the sole registering authority for the trustees. The opposition does not consider this to be controversial. Additional comments have been expressed by professional bodies. Some concern has been expressed by the Law Council and the IPAA that no attempt has been made in the bill to achieve consistency with the relevant provisions of the Corporations Law. A number of practitioners have mentioned the lack of the level playing field between the official trustee and registered trustees. The IPAA believes there needs to be a level playing field between the two. While the official trustee is subsidised, private trustees are not. The bill will allow official trustees to accept appointments under part X of the act, but private trustees will not be a:Uowed to accept appointments in relation to new debt agreements. I tum to the issue of financial impact. The one-stop service will, according to the government, involve the expenditure of $1.04 million in 1994-95, reducing to $125,000 in 1997-98. The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) acknowledges in the second reading speech to this bill that bankruptcy laws have been unnecessarily complicated. He said: In the context of this important bill it is opportune to address briefly some of the recent ill-informed criticism of the effectiveness of bankruptcy law. The minister felt that criticism of this law was harsh and the parliamentary secretary quoted in his speech particular examples of people going bankrupt for a variety of reasons beyond their control.. Going bankrupt for some people is beyond their control. I think it is a direct function of economic policy in many circumstances. My personal concern with this bill is that there has been very little consultation with the victims of bankruptcy. The minister acknowledges that business is about taking risks and making profits. Taking risks also means making losses. Government gets involved in regulating small business in many ways: it collects taxes; it regulates business activities to ensure that a set of rules apply that have the effect of law, and the business has to operate within these rules. We also see the government legislating for workers rights, but you cannot legislate for honesty and you cannot make ethics compulsory. So it is necessary for legislation such as this to protect the consumer. It is well known that bankruptcy is a matter which has been of major concern to me for the last five years, since I have been in parliament. The engine room of growth in my electorate is the building industry. The ups and downs of the economy are mostly reflected in the building industry. It is interesting to have a look at bankruptcy statistics. They tell a story. It can be said that they are directly a function of the state of the economy. The most recent figures show that the number of bankruptcies in the southern states is declining. As the economies of Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales pick up, the number of bankruptcies as a percentage changes. Comparing 1993-94 figures to 1992-93 as a percentage of change, New South Wales has fallen 6.8 per cent, the ACT has fallen 8.8 per cent, Victoria has fallen 5.8 per cent, South Australia has fallen 4.8 per cent, but Queensland has risen by 1.2 per cent. Queensland missed out on the harshness of the recession that the southern states suffered because we had continual growth.",15
7,Mr KERR,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,Under an enlightened Labor state government.,18
8,Mr SOMLYAY,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"We are now suffering from the recession as people move back to those southern states, that are incidentally now under good Liberal leadership and producing the growth that they should have. Two years ago I sought to have the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquire into bankruptcy. I know the minister says that consultation has occurred, but I do not think there has been sufficient consultation with the victims of bankruptcy. I have many cases in my electorate where subcontractors have suffered. The very first thing I had to do when I became a member of this parliament was to deal with subcontractors who had suffered as a result of a number of resorts falling over. I believe that there should be a full parliamentary inquiry into the question of bankruptcy so that these people can stand before a parliamentary committee and explain the difficulties they have had, the traumas and their suffering under the privilege of parliament. I go further than the coalition, which wants to refer this to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. (Time expired)",18
9,Mr FILING,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"I rise to make my first speech from this position in the chamber, which is a little more distant from my last spot. I rise, with a great deal of pleasure, to speak on the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill and to comment on certain aspects of the recent history of bankruptcy and financial dealings of some of the most notable of our so-called entrepreneurs that have given rise to some of these amendments. I am sure the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is at the table, would concede, that there were some quite remarkable loopholes in the legislation. Not the least, of course, was the loophole in relation to the question of income which Mr Bond explored and which in the Federal Court he succeeded in keeping open. I would make a couple of comments. First of all, I congratulate the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), who has been elevated by election in the caucus to the dizzy heights of the deputy prime ministership of the country. As a fellow Western Australian, I congratulate him for achieving that office. This, I suppose, in a way reflects the sorts of circumstances that have given rise to these legislative amendments. I suggest that it would be pertinent, or perhaps advantageous, for the new Deputy Prime Minister at some stage in the near future to make a statement to the House on some of the aspects of the WA Inc. years and the involvement of the state Labor Party. Some of the people who have more latterly fallen into disrepute would have been colleagues and associates within the state government. There are aspects of the Western Australian Labor Party state executive's involvement in decision making that may have related to WA Inc. and other ancillary matters relating to some of the advantageous decisions that were made by the Western Australian Labor governments of Mr Burke, Mr Dowding and, more latterly, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), that gave some of these 'entrepre: neurs' such wonderful deals at the taxpayers expense. Quite clearly, even though the honourable member has risen now to that particular status, there are still a number of who would like to see clarified the role and the involvement of prominent members of the Labor Party, of the Labor government and also-in particular and more importantly in relation to this chamber-the federal Labor government in those years. Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, I know of, and have commended you in the past for, the tremendous amount of work you have done on highly technical legislation relating to financial dealings of individuals and corporations. I commend you for that extraordinary amount of work you have done over the years-something I believe that your constituents would be very pleased with. I am sure that they would reflect, and would probably agree with me, that your contribution to this chamber over the years has been excellent. I am sure that it will continue in the futurenotwithstanding the fact that you have been so savagely disendorsed by the CrichtonBrowne faction in the Western Australian Liberal Party. As you would well know, in recent years and, more importantly, in recent times, I suppose within a question of months, the minds of many people around the country have been focused very strongly on the extraordinary-almost miraculous-events surrounding the financial dealings most notably of the failed entrepreneur, Mr Bond, and, in the case of Queensland, the failed now expatriate entrepreneur, Mr Skase. Let us have a quick look at what has really - ccurred. If we look carefully, both Mr Bond and Mr Skase-although in particular I am concentrating on the Bond end of this particular argument-received, I suppose, favourable arrangements and became wealt-ier and more active and closer, particularly In the case of Mr Bond, to both the state Labor government of Western Australia and the federal Labor government when, as far as the economy was concerned, there were better times. At that time, we saw extraordinary deals both in Western Australia and elsewhere. All through this period-from 1983 to the present-Labor has been in office federally. One has to ask oneself why these changes us have taken so long. I am not reflecting on the current minister, because he has been the minister for only a relatively short time. Why has it taken so long for the federal Labor government, which under the constitution has a responsibility to administer the bankruptcy laws, to tighten up something that many people have seen as being a significant problem for a very long time? The cynical in the community might say that it has more to do with the extraordinary largess-the gifts or donations-donated by some of these entrepreneurs, not the least of whom was Mr Bond himself, to the Labor Party during the 1980s. Others might say that it had more to do with the fact that there seemed to be a close mateship between the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, Mr Bond and others. This mateship has been speculated upon in the media and elsewhere. We would all recall in the early days of the Western Australian government that very famous posed group photo of the Sir John Curtin Foundation in Western Australia, which included the then Prime Minister, Mr Bond and others of the entrepreneurial set of the 1980s. I think that photo, more than any photo of the time, represents in an illustrative way the close bond between those entrepreneurs, the state Labor Party and the federal Labor government. The most notable inclusion in that photograph was the Prime Minister at the time, the Hon. Bob Hawke. The reason why people's minds have become focused on these issues is that, in many cases, they have seen the laws as being so obviously deficient. In the case of Mr Bond, we saw him apparently leading a luxurious lifestyle, because he was driven away from the courts in a Rolls Royce and he was able to conduct deals while he was still a bankrupt. On television and in the popular media, his affairs have become a source of constant speculation. In the case of Mr Skase, he was fortunate enough to escape the clutches of Australian law. We had the ridiculous situation where the Spanish courts allowed him to stay in Spain and quite clearly escape the likely retribution of Australian law should he have been returned to Australia.",18
10,Mr KERR,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,Mr Skase doesn't think our laws would be too soft.,20
11,Mr FILING,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"Of course, Mr Skase has 'his own views, but then Mr Skase is a man of remarkable achievements! He is a man who quite clearly appeared to be very sick-and claimed to be very sick-but who was able to achieve a remarkable recovery after the Spanish courts made their momentous decision to allow him to remain in Spain and escape the warrants that had been issued to extradite him to Australia to face the Australian courts. It is important to recognise that, even though some may argue that this is a complaint on the part of the creditors of Mr Bond and Mr Skase, it involves the financial arrangements and touches the lives of other people in the community. It is important to reflect that these days there is a greater sense of closeness-in other words, these types of arrangements percolate through the entire community. In the 1980s when the foreign debt started to burgeon under the federal Labor government, it used to be the popular myth-it is not anymore-that this was not public debt or somehow the result of the federal Labor government's policies: this was private debt. Therefore, strictly speaking, it had nothing to do with the administration of the economy: it merely affected the private financial arrangements of people who had indebted themselves to overseas creditors. The point is that this type of arrangement and the sorts of results that have occurred in more recent times when Mr Bond and Mr Skase have escaped the closer scrutiny of the bankruptcy laws have a percolating effect all the way through the community. With the advent of compulsory superannuation schemes and the like, most people-very few people avoid this-tend to be shareholders or have some financial connection to the losses that are incurred. As a consequence, they suffer a loss, however minuscule that might be. One can reflect back to the 1980s when the debate over foreign debt started-we saw foreign debt escalate from $36 billion under the last coalition government to $166 billion under this government-and in particular reflect on that debate as it related to private and public debt. Back in those times, funnily enough, I used to use the analogy of Mr Bond's own situation to illustrate to people who raised the argument how you could separate private and public debt. The analogy I used to use, which was particularly pertinent to Western Australians, was that every time consumers purchased a can or a bottle of Swan Lager they were contributing to the servicing of Mr Bond's overseas debts. So even though one could argue that a private debt was something that was a matter for a private individual or corporation and therefore unconnected to public debt or the administration of the economy, the effect of the debt and its servicing is passed on to consumers and passed on throughout the community-there is a percolating effect. The point is that this situation has been going on for a long time. The bankruptcy laws have been seen as being deficient for a very long time. It has taken the federal Labor government in the region of 12 years to resolve the situation.",20
12,Mr KERR,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"That's not an accurate statement. MrFILING-I was going to point out that in real terms there has been a perception in the community that the laws have been deficient for that period. As the minister knows, the Federal Court in Ramsay v. Bond has ruled that the deficiency in the definition of 'income' is something that should have been examined a long time before Mr Bond was able to escape from the clutches of the bankruptcy provisions.",21
13,Mr KERR,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,It was not a point raised by you or any of your colleagues.,21
14,Mr FILING,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"I am merely speculating why it has taken so long for these matters to be ironed out. Are we merely shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted ? We are in fact seeing the law being tightened now because everybody who was associated with Labor governments back in the 1980s has virtually escaped the clutches of the law, although I must add that some other cases concerning Mr Bond and others associated with the state Labor government in the 1980s are still in process. It is important to reflect on the principal matter raised in the Bond v. Ramsay case in the Federal Court, and that is permissible income. It is important to note that Mr Bond is now no longer a bankrupt, although Mr Ramsay in recent articles has raised the possible resurrection of that bankruptcy if it can be shown that Mr Bond failed to disclose assets that he may have held overseas-I see the minister nodding to that. As we know, the income contribution scheme, to which this matter is pertinent, was introduced into the Bankruptcy Act 1966 in 1992-in actual fact, another piece of legislation passed virtually after the horse has bolted-and commenced operation on 1 July 1992. Basically, the scheme provides that a bankrupt who, through expertise, professional calling or fringe benefits, is able to continue to receive a comparatively high income and lifestyle while technically bankrupt should contribute some of that excess income to his or her creditors. That is an admirable sort of principle, but it failed miserably through the rigour which was applied to it in the case of Bond v. Ramsay. A formula was applied which established a permissible income threshold, based on 3Y2 times the basic pension with some increase for dependants or child support, and the amount of excess income above that threshold is divided by two with one half going to creditors via the trustee. As a rule of thumb, once a bankrupt started earning in excess of $24,400 per annum he or she was liable to make an income contribution of half of the amount above $24,400. In Bond v. Ramsay, the trustee, Mr Ramsay, classified the provision of over $700,000 in terms of housing, office expenses, travel, telephone and legal expenses to Mr Bond by family and associates of Mr Bond as fringe benefits and, therefore, income related. An assessment was made by Mr Ramsay of a substantial income contribution to be made by Mr Bond. But, on appeal to the Federal Court, a majority two to one decision found in favour of Mr Bond and the $700,000 worth of payments were held to be gifts. I acknowledge the fact that in 1994 the Minister for Justice announced in a media release that the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy had approved financial assistance for an application by the trustee for special leave to appeal to the High Court. As we all know now with the benefit of hindsight, the decision by the creditors to accept Mr Bond's offer made that irrelevant. But essentially the issue is whether the definition of 'income' in the Bankruptcy Act 1966 is adequate to catch payments made by benefactors. The Federal Court decision said that the definition in the Bankruptcy Act is confined to payments made in the context of employment. Having had the discontinuation of the High Court challenge, the suggested loophole in the legislation-the Federal Court and the Bond v. Ramsay loophole-is now to be addressed by this bill. The bill attempts to restore what was intended in the original amendments in 1992 dealing with income contribution from bankrupts and will also now cover loans to bankrupts. One issue which will have to be addressed-and I am indebted to the Bills Digest for these comments-is the possibility that certain valid payments, for example legal aid, may fall within the definition of income or benefit. This potential problem was raised by the Hon. Justice Cooper in Bond v. Ramsay. I agree with the coalition that this matter should be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report. It is very important that the citizens of Australia-particularly, in my case, my constituents-have an opportunity to have their say and be able to reflect on some of the issues raised in the legislation and, in particular, some of the problems or queries that the Law Council of Australia and others have had with aspects of the technical application of the legislation, not the least of which is the possibility of the changes in the treatment of assets and the disposal of assets. in the past becoming retrospective. . As we all know, in the past there have been some concerns from Western Australians in particular in relation to retrospective legislathose tion, but I think that has to be balanced with the community's point of view that they are aggrieved by the apparent ease with which people like Mr Bond and, more importantly, Mr Skase have been able to escape the more stringent application of Australian bankruptcy law through the use of, in the case of Mr Bond, obviously very expensive and expert legal assistance by beating the federal government in the Federal Court and, in the case of Mr Skase, by running away to Spain and being able to win in the Spanish courts against the Australian government's warrant of extradition. These are two matters which many people in the community think are highly ridiculous. It seems to them very strange that Mr Bond was able to live this quite extravagant lifestyle while he was bankrupt and that, at the same time, Mr Skase was able to escape the clutches of Australian law, notwithstanding the enormous amount of money and the so called expertise that was used to try to bring him back. These questions need to be resolved. This bill raises some solutions to a number of the problems brought up by the cases of Bond and Skase. But, in the final analysis, I agree with the coalition's proposition that the matter be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry, which would give others in the community an opportunity to have their say-not least the constituents of Moore, a number of whom would be concerned at some of the changes to the opportunities for people to be able to declare themselves bankrupt. (Time expired)",21
15,Mr KERR,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"in reply-I wish to thank honourable members who have contributed to the debate on the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill. Might I say that many of the contributions drew heavily on the submissions on the bill from the Law Council of Australia and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia. The government is grateful for the interest expressed by those bodies to this legislation. Having said that, I would like to say that groups are only two of the stakeholders in this particular area of law. They are amongst welfare groups, financial counsellors, the Credit Reform Association of Australia, community legal centres, credit providers and the community generally. Whilst the Law Council and the IPAA's contributions are important, it is the government which must determine the appropriate policy in consultation with them and other groups. The submissions of these two organisations in many ways express disagreement or reservation about the policy, not about the manner in which the government proposes to implement the policy, contrary to what is suggested in the submissions. I also note that both the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia and the Law Council have expressed their strong support for the majority of the reforms contained in this bill. In that light, it is important to respond to some of the major points made in those submissions and echoed by the opposition. Before I do so, I might refer to the remarks of the member for Moore (Mr Filing). His suggestion that this parliament has not sought to act expeditiously to deal with income contribution arrangements and to ensure that instances like the high profile bankruptcy of Alan Bond were not addressed is incorrect. In 1992 this parliament sought to. enact legislation that would have copper-bottomed legal framework to prevent the passing .on of income contributions from anyone to Mr Bond in such a way as to enable him to maintain a standard of living beyond that appropriate to a bankrupt. But, as has been indicated, the specific proposals that were brought forward by the government have been held, in a very technical judgment, in my view and in the view of in any other commentators, by the Federal Court not to have covered the specifics of the Bond circumstance. That is not a mark of conspiracy of a federal government unwilling to address the specific issues in the case of Mr Bond and other like cases. Rather it is a mark of the confidence both sides of this parliament had in the passage of this legislation to enact a scheme which would satisfactorily address these matters. The confidence of my predecessor, former Senator Tate, who introduced the legislation, was reflected by similar confidence from opposition speakers at the time, and the legislation passed without any reser-, vation that it would be deficient in the way the Federal Court ultimately found. To the extent that this matter has now had to come back to us because of that decision, it does so against a background where its necessity. was not anticipated by any of the parties in this parliament. Whilst I think not unsurprising that the member for Moore, given the circumstances of his recent past, is a believer in conspiracy theories, I do not think that particular conspiracy theory has any substance. If I can tum tb some of the specifics that have been addressed, the opposItion has expressed concern that no attempt has been made in the bill to achieve consistency with the Corporations Law. Indeed, in relation to antecedent transactions, the opposition argues that the bill will produce a further divergence between the Corporations Law and the' act. The provisions of the Corporations Law dealing with the avoidance of antecedent transactions are simply not capable of being adapted to relate to the situation of individuals. The Corporations Law is premised on the basis that a company must be managed so as to preserve its asset base and to maximise returns to shareholders through profitable activity. Giving away property, of course, is not conducive to that aim. But, when one tries to apply, for example, the uncommercial transaction definition of section 588FB of the Corporations Law to individuals, the results become absurd. An individual could very well benefit from giving away his or her property to a relative, family trust or company. A reasonable person might want to get tax benefits, for example, by asset planning or the person might wish to ensure that most of the wealth that he or she had generated would not be available to creditors in the result of a subsequent financial failure. The only detriment such a person suffers is that he or she depletes the assets that he or she owns directly. This may be, and frequently is, to their long-term advantage where the assets are owned by a relative or associated entity of the person which he or she is able to control or materially influence or control without having any direct legal apparatus of control. The Law Reform Commission, in its report on the general insolvency inquiry, recommended a provision to deal with transactions that undervalue, and the proposed section 120 provides for that. There has also been some comment about antecedent transactions. The opposition does it is not support the introduction of the new concept of technically insolvent, intended to become the cornerstone of the antecedent transactions provisions. There have been claims that the definition is wide and uncertain and is likely to lead to endless debate. The opposition has provided some hypothetical examples to illustrate the uncertainty permitted by the drafting and has focused on the position of guarantors under a loan. It also argued that the new provisions should not apply to transactions entered into prior to the commencement of the amending legislation. Whenever a new law is introduced, it takes time for case law to settle the meaning of particular expressions. That is not a process of endless debate but rather the traditional way in which the law develops. The definition of technically insolvent is straightforward and requires an individual's entire financial position to be considered. It must be kept in mind that the term 'technically insolvent' has no relevance until a person has become a bankrupt and only when the person has entered into a transaction which is possibly void against the trustee. The test requires the person's liabilities to be looked at against their assets and current income position at the time an impugned transaction is entered into-a balance sheet test. As regards guarantees, all that falls for examination is the individual's liability determined in accordance with a contract of guarantee-that is, the maximum potential liability of the individual. Theliability of guarantors, sureties or the principal debtor irrelevant. The opposition is putting a view that the policy of proposed change is wrong, a view which the government does not accept. A person who enters into a substantial guarantee for others' debts should not, in the government's view, be able to transfer assets away from himself or herself and thus diminish the pool of available assets in the event that he or she later becomes bankrupt. What is the meaning of a guarantee if a person can enter into one but avoid its consequences by transferring all his or her assets away, notwithstanding its existence? The proposition becomes laughable. The opposition has also attacked the use of market value as a determinant of whether a transaction is possibly void against a trustee as it may adversely affect someone who purchases property at a discount. There is nothing inappropriate about using market value as a determining factor for whether a transaction occurred at undervalue. Opinions will often differ about what is the actual market value of a thing. Opinions will usually give a range of values which may be the worth of a particular item. Whether a transfer of property took place at market value will be determined by inquiring whether the item was purchased below its minimum market value. The difficulty with the existing test is that it frequently allows related parties of a person who becomes a bankrupt to retain the benefit of a transaction even though the consideration given is substantially discounted and much less than the ordinary value-even returns that might be obtained at a fire sale. It must be remembered that allowing these transactions to stand could have an adverse impact on a person's creditors and a possible insolvency flow-on. I should also note that, while the Law Council has expressed reservations about the concept of market value, the IPAA has expressed strong support for it and has said it is an improvement on the existing law and is both a more readily identifiable and a more meaningful term than valuable consideration. There has also been some discussion about coretrospectivity in relation to the antecedent are transaction avoidance provisions because they will apply to current bankruptcies. The explanatory memorandum to the bill makes it clear that a current bankruptcy is one where a final dividend has not been paid to creditors. This may be the case whether or not the bankrupt has been discharged from the bankruptcy. Obviously, the application of provisions is something to which very careful consideration is given. There are three categories that have to be addressed: persons who are not yet bankrupt, persons who are currently bankrupt and persons who have been previously bankrupt but are no longer bankrupt. Further, an estate may be finalised because all available property is realised before a person is discharged from bankruptcy. Equally, an estate could continue to be administered long after a bankrupt has been discharged, because, for example, the estate is entitled to a remainder demand interest in property subject to a life tenancy and the tenant for life does not die for many years after the discharge. The provisions will operate in relation to bankruptcies where a final dividend has not been paid, whether or not a bankrupt has been discharged, and to all bankruptcies occurring after commencement. Having provisions apply to only prospective bankruptcies would have resulted in a system which was administratively complex and burdensome for trustees and creditors. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills noted that, although the amendments have retrospective operation, their purpose is to seek to increase the amount available for distribution to creditors whose rights to be paid in full may be considered to have been trespassed against. That statement encapsulates what the provisions are about and is sufficient justification for the proposed provisions. Some reservations have also been expressed about the soundness of the policy which treats all benefits as income. In so far as the bill attempts to reverse the effect of the Bond decision, the opposition queries whether the proposed amendment will work. It is stated in paragraph 70 of the introduction to the explanatory memorandum that, when the income distribution scheme was devised, it was intended to catch the value of gifts, payments of expenses and similar benefits provided to or on account of a bankrupt by benefactors, whether or not the bankrupt was employed by, worked for or provided service for or on behalf of a benefactor. In the Bond case Mr Justice Cooper, a member of the majority, commented that the payment of legal costs by a family or friends of a bankrupt would be indistinguishable in principle from a grant of legal aid. On the other hand, the dissenting judgment of Justice French stated that the provision should not be construed punitively as a matter of general principle and regarding legal aid payments as part of income would be a punitive interpretation. Our consideration will be given to specifying the fact that a person in receipt of publicly funded legal aid moneys is a ground for providing the hardship exemption to making contributions. The Bond judgment was closely studied. The decision turned on the use of the definition of 'fringe benefit', which is a subset of the wider term 'benefit' used in the legislation. It can be confidently expected that the effect of the decision has been overcome. The act provides that any provision of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act can be amended by regulation for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act. The opposition has asserted that this delegation of legislative power should be condemned and may be open to constitutional challenge. This is a misconception. There is nothing unconstitutional about enabling provisions of an act to be varied by subordinate legislation. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, one of whose terms of reference is to comment on any inappropriate delegation of legislative power, made no reference to this whatsoever in its report in Alert Digest No.5 of 1995. Further concerns are expressed about the transfer of some functions presently carried out by the Federal Court to administrative bodies on the basis that changes may trespass on the judicial power of the Commonwealth as enunciated recently by the High Court in the well-known Brandy case. The bill, for example, proposes that the power to register trustees be exercised by an administrative panel. This is clearly an administrative function and is being done to honour an undertaking given to the former Chief Justice of the Federal Court that the court would be relieved of this particular function. The government is confident that nothing in the proposals could infringe the Brandy principles. As to debt agreements, it has been suggested that the sum of $20,000 for unsecured debts is too low and the higher sum of $50,000 might be more appropriate. There is a capacity to increase the amount by subordinate legislation. We think it is preferable to see how debt agreements work in practice before changing the monetary threshold. There have also been some comments about the one-stop shop proposal of Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. Concerns have been expressed about the functions of ITSA being substantially expanded under the one-stop shop proposal. As well as administering bankrupt estates as it now does, ITSA would be able to become a controlling trustee and a trustee of part X deeds. This would further place ITSA in direct competition with private trustees. It is also proposed that ITSA take over many functions now performed by the registrars in bankruptcy and that it administer debt agreements, but a concern has also been expressed about the potential of conflict of interests on the part of ITSA if it is to be simultaneously responsible for the administration of estates and the supervision of the conduct of private trustees. The rationalisation of bankruptcy administration is expected to produce resource savings and to provide a better service to the public, who will need to deal with only one administrative agency instead of two. Conflict of interest problems are being with by ITSA quarantining the bankruptcy regulation units through its general operations. The purpose of enabling the official trustee to be a trustee under part X is to avoid the need for court appointment of a trustee in the event of the death of the existing trustee or if for some other reason the original trustee cannot continue. No resources have been provided to ITSA to enable it to routinely take on part X administrations. It simply will not have the practical capacity to do so. The claims that these proposals are a grab by the empire builders in ITSA to enable them to take business away from private trustees are groundless. In the 1980s a system was used to channel as much work as possible to registered trustees. A creditor or debtor had to demonstrate that he or she had taken reasonable steps to secure the consent of a registered trustee to act as a trustee in a bankruptcy. Approaches to three trustees was considered reasonable. It was a time consuming process and did not achieve the intended result. An examination of the statistics in the annual report on the operation of the act for the years 1981-82 and 1985-86 shows that a proportion of bankruptcy work taken on by registered trustees did not increase during that period. To make such an amendment would, on the basis of that experience, have no value in increasing the share of work taken on by registered trustees. Registered trustees are conducting businesses and it is up to them to promote and advertise their expertise and services, and by doing so increase their share of the market. I will be moving some minor amendments to the bill to correct some drafting errors which have been discovered,. and which also have the effect of requiring information about alternatives to bankruptcy to be given to debtors before bankruptcy petitions are accepted so they can carefully consider those alternatives. Information will also be required to be provided about the services which are available from registered trustees, including their expertise in arranging part X administrations with creditors. The opposition has had the courtesy of advising me it intends to request this matter dealt to be referred to a House committee for further detailed consideration. It is not the government's view to accede to that request. This is a matter which has had very extensive public contribution. It has been the subject of a Law Reform Commission report and extensive consultations. The measures are, in a sense, the result of those very extensive deliberations. The government is anxious for the very cogent reason that has been addressed by a number of speakers, in particular the member for Moore, which is to make sure that the bankruptcy legislation, which is designed to give confidence to the public, will not only have the necessary teeth to deal with unscrupulous debtors but also be amended and simplified in a way which addresses sympathetically the concerns of small bankrupts who have found themselves in that circumstance because of business risk but without any malice or, in a sense, ill motive on their part. I would not wish to stay those proceedings in that environment when I know that House of Representatives committees are finding it difficult to obtain quorums and to meet and when I believe this legislation should go immediately to the Senate so it can be passed to the benefit of all the community. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Reference to Committee",22
16,Mr RUDDOCK,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,I seek leave to move a motion to suspend so much of the standing and sessional orders as would prevent me from moving a motion to refer the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible. Leave not granted.,26
17,Mr RUDDOCK,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Berowra from moving a motion to refer the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible. Mr Lieberman-I second the motion.,27
18,Mr RUDDOCK,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"In relation to this matter, I will make some brief observations. I thank the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) for his comments in relation to the matters raised by me and a number of my colleagues. The minister suggests that some members of the opposition are against the proposals in the legislation, but I am not sure that that is comment. What we were foreshadowing was that concerns about a number of issues contained in this legislation have been expressed to us by the Insolvency Practitioners Association and the Law Council of Australia. In our view, that gave rise to the need for a further review of the legislation at this stage. We would be guided by the advice that might come from a committee that is considering the detail of the legislation. It would give those people who have made comments about the legislation an opportunity to be heard. The minister is correct in his observation of the role of the Law Reform Commission. I brought with me yesterday a copy of the report from the Law Reform Commission. That contained a very comprehensive tome of comments in relation to the bankruptcy law and comments about the proposed bill. There have also been additional papers which have ultimately led to the legislation in the modified form that we have before us now. As I mentioned yesterday-and the minister may have had these comments drawn to his attention-the comments from the Insolvency Practitioners Association were in the hands of the government the day before we started this debate on the legislation. That did not allow an opportunity for detailed and comprehensive consideration of the points that were made. Similarly, the views of the Law Council, while they would have been available earlier, related to a bill that was not available in an exposure draft form. The bill was given a first reading in this parliament in March. I think it is important to recognise that parliamentary consideration of legislation which is very technical and which requires a good deal of deliberation will not take place a in debate of this sort when there has been short notice and a relatively short time to discuss it. The only way you can develop arguments and get a concluded view on matters of this sort is with a comprehensive committee consideration of the issues with witnesses involved and being heard. This usually occurs in the Senate. I take the view that the Senate performs a very useful role in that regard, but I think this chamber is a fair capable of performing the same role. I was alarmed to hear the minister say that committees are unable to get quorums and are unable to meet. Perhaps he might like to elaborate on what he means by that. I would regard it as a significant reflection on the government and its members if it is not able to ensure that the committee system of this parliament works. That is an extraordinary admission to make. That is certainly not my impression. The committees I am involved in-including those I am involved in as shadow minister-meet regularly and deliberate for long hours. Those committees are still undertaking references at this time. I cannot understand how a committee of this parliament that is interested in legal and constitutional affairs would not be able· to give a report quickly on an issue that is so important to the government. The government is trying to put it off. I will look at the Notice Paper to see what other references the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is undertaking, but I suspect that it does not have too many references at this time. I suspect that this matter will come before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, but if the government wants the bill dealt with expeditiously then that is not the way to ensure that it happens. I notice that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has two current inquiries: the first is the interpretation and application of the provisions of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution and the second is the protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth. I do not think those two references-I know one of them is well advanced-would prevent the committee from being able to deal with this matter promptly and quickly and helping the parliament with these matters. The other day I read that the Senate has some 80 bills before it. It is in a log jam. What we would be doing is adding to the Senate log jam. If the government wants this bill to be dealt with expeditiously, it seems to me that the best course would be to reconsider the approach that has been taken on this matter to date and to support my motion to enable the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to undertake this inquiry and, as I said, to report as soon as possible. We are not seeking delay. What we are seeking is elucidation and the improvement of legislation that is of importance.",27
19,Mr KERR,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"I thank the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), for his remarks. My concern is a natural one. This legislation is important in terms of not simply its obvious impact but also its timeliness. If we as a parliament are to have the confidence of the public, we must be able to show that we are able to expeditiously deal with substantial reform in this area. I believe that this legislation has had very substantial consideration. My concern with the proposal to refer the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill to the House of Representatives - tanding Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is that, whilst it has been asserted that it is some indictment on government, the committee systems are now working their way into circumstances where members may feel they have higher priorities, such as in their electoral circumstances. That is simply a reality. We are now reaching a time where many members are giving greater priority to their electoral circumstances, with the thought of the possibility of elections emerging. It is difficult to find a commitment from a sufficient number of members over a non-parliamentary sitting period to complete deliberation of these matters. Mr Lieberman-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Under the general rules of the House, no reflection should be made on members and in that sense generally on committees. I am sure the minister is not intending to reflect on committees",28
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"Mr Andrew)I think the comment from the member for Indi that the minister is not intending to make a reflection indicates that there was not any reflection. From what I heard, I did not feel the minister was making any deliberate reflection. Mr Lieberman-I am sure it is an unwitting matter.",28
21,Mr KERR,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"There are just practical considerations. Anyone who thinks that is a reflection on this House or its committees simply has not had sufficient experience of this place to know the truth of those matters. I am reminded by my colleague the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) that there is one week left of sitting and then we are up for seven weeks. Most members have electoral responsibilities during that period. I doubt very much whether the extensive and detailed consideration by a parliamentary committee that is being called for would occur. As minister, I am simply not prepared to accede to a process which would kill, in a practical sense, the opportunity for this legislation to proceed through this House. It would then have to go before the Senate, and no undertaking has been given to us that there would not be a Senate inquiry. I recall that once before when similar proposals were canvassed there was such an undertaking given on a particular piece of legislation that if there was a House committee there would be no Senate committee. That has not been given in this instance. In those circumstancesMr Ruddock-Would it make a difference?",28
22,Mr KERR,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,In those circumstancesMr Ruddock-Would it make a difference?,28
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,Order! The member will address his remarks through the chair.,29
24,Mr KERR,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,Two things would make a differenceMr Ruddock interjecting,29
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,Order! The member for Berowra will not enter into a conversation across the table.,29
26,Mr KERR,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"The circumstances are such that I think if we are serious about getting this Cunningham, B. T. legislation through-it has been considered in detail, it is well considered and it does have controversial aspects, but those are self evident in the drafting of it and the comments that have been made-we should simply pass it and get on with the business.

27,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"Berowra) (11.18 a.m.)We have looked at these amendments. At this stage, we have no detailed observations we wish to make on them. Obviously, when they are dealt with in the Senate, if there are further questions that arise from the opportunity to have them more widely circulated, we will raise them at that time. But, on the face of it, they are technical in character and worthy of support. We will not present any opposition to them. Amendments agreed to. Bill,· as amended, agreed to.

OVERSEAS MISSIONS (PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES) BILL 1995 Cognate bill: OVERSEAS MISSIONS (PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1995 . Consideration resumed from 8 June. Second Reading",30
28,Mr JOHNS,PAIRS,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (11.21 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is intended to allow privileges and immunities to be conferred upon the premises of, and persons associated with, certain overseas missions in Australia which represent self-governing or autonomous foreign territories that are not states and are not recognised by Australia as states. The proposed legislation seeks to accommodate the changing political climate within our region, in which sovereign states are no longer the only players. Self-governing or autonomous foreign territories which are not states and which Australia does not recognise as states, such as Hong Kong, New Caledonia and the Cook Islands, are increasingly taking part in the economic and trade affairs of the region in their own right. This legislation seeks to provide a window of opportunity for such territories to establish official representation in Australia for the purposes of promoting bilateral trade and performing a liaison function regarding multilateral trade and economic issues. At present, privileges and immunities are afforded to diplomatic and consular missions and their staff in Australia. This is done by virtue of the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967 and the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act 1972 respectively, which reflect the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations. Also, the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 affords privileges and immunities to international organisations and their staff where they establish a mission in Australia. The current legislation is deficient, however, in that it does not afford privileges and immunities to missions which do not represent sovereign states or international organisations. The Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill therefore flows from Australia's existing obligations under international law which relate to diplomatic and consular missions. It is further intended to fill the existing gap in legislation regarding missions from self-governing or autonomous entities. The privileges and immunities afforded under the legislation would protect the operations of the mission-thus assisting in the effective performance of their functions. I stress that the purpose of providing privileges and immunities is to facilitate the effective and unhindered operations of the missions. They are not intended for the benefit of individuals but are accorded solely in the interests of the mission, to enable it to perform its functions. In order to come within the scope of the bill, two conditions must be met. Firstly, the mission must be declared by regulation to be a 'designated overseas mission'; and, secondly, the mission must be authorised to operate within certain capacities as set out in a written instrument signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. These conditions would also be subject to the agreement of the government, in consultation with others concerned. Clearly, however, the bill is not intended to cover missions in Australia representing purely political entities, such as the Palestine ation Organisation, or purely commercial entities such as Hutt River Province. The form and operation of the bill is modelled on the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, in so far as the bill provides the framework and criteria within which privileges and immunities are set out and may be accorded. The bill itself would be given effect by the regulations made under it. Schedules to the bill set out a broad range of privileges and immunities of possible application to designated overseas missions. They represent the upper limit, so to speak, of the privileges and immunities which might be conferred upon the premises of a designated overseas mission and the persons associated with it. The privileges and immunities listed are along the lines of those conferred by the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations. However, under no circumstances would a designated overseas mission or any person associated with it be entitled to privileges and immunities which go beyond those conferred by the Vienna conventions upon diplomatic or consular missions and their staff. It would be possible for the regulations to confer upon designated overseas missions any or all of the privileges and immunities listed, either unconditionally or subject to limitations or conditions. They would be specifically tailored to provide a precise and comprehensive account of the privileges and immunities applicable in each case. The use of the regulations in this way is consistent with the precedent already set by the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act. Furthermore, they maintain flexibility within· the legislation and allow the government to limit or qualify the application of privileges and immunities on a case by case basis. It is anticipated that the first occasion for the application of the legislation would arise in the context of the proposed establishment of a Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Sydney in the second half of 1995. A Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office would cover bilateral commercial relations between Liber- Hong Kong and Australia and conduct a liaison function where multilateral trade issues, including WTO and APEC, are concerned. The application of the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill may result in a loss of revenue at both the Commonwealth and state or territory levels due to certain privileges of a financial nature which could be accorded to the premises of a designated overseas mission and persons associated with that mission. The privileges which could be accorded include exemptions from taxation levied directly against the mission regarding its property and personal exemptions from taxation for persons associated with the mission. It is preferable to allow for the possibility of such exemptions from taxation in order to maintain consistency with the application of privileges under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations and to enable missions to operate effectively within Australia. It is difficult to speculate at this stage on the possible losses to be incurred. Any losses to revenue would be determined by the number of missions which are entitled to financial privileges under the legislation and the extent of the privileges accorded to such missions. However, any loss in revenue would be far outweighed by the potential for economic gain which the presence and operations of such missions would incur. The missions would boost Australia's bilateral trade interests and provide greater scope for Australia regarding multilateral trade opportunities within the region. Furthermore, the bill would create a basis for the reciprocal extension of privileges and immunities, enabling the Australian government to reduce the costs of Australian offices in the territory represented by the designated overseas mission. In short, the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill seeks to provide a framework to enable privileges and immunities to be conferred on overseas missions in Australia and their staff. It is an adaptation fundamental principles of international law to the reality of our regional environment. I commend the bill to the House. OVERSEAS MISSIONS (PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1995 This bill is intended to make consequential amendments to Commonwealth acts which will enable the effective implementation of the principal bill; that is, the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill 1995. As has been noted already today, the principal bill allows privileges and immunities to be accorded to missions representing self governing or autonomous foreign territories in Australia and their staff. It flows from existing legislation which accords privileges and immunities to diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations in Australia, and their staff. However, the intention of the principal bill is to adapt this existing legislation to the realities of our changing economic regional climate. In order to ensure the effective implementation of the principal bill, the consequential amendments bill would make amendments to a number of Commonwealth acts. In particular, amendments would be made to the Australian Protective Service Act 1987, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976, the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act 1978 and the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971. Broadly speaking, these acts provide protection to the premises of, and persons associated with, diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations. The consequential amendments bill would extend their scope to provide appropriate protection to the premises of missions established under the principal bill, and their staff. The Australian Protective Service Act establishes the Australian Protective Service and sets out its functions, which include, among other things, the protection of property in which a foreign country or an international organisation has an interest. The functions of the Australian Protective Service also include the protection of internationally protected persons. The consequential amendments bill of would extend this act to protect property in which a mission established in accordance with the principal bill has an interest. Secondly, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act enacts into Australia's domestic law the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including diplomatic agents. Under the act, as it presently stands, the Governor General may make regulations declaring persons who are not specifically mentioned in the convention to be internationally protected persons-for example, persons associated with international organisations. The consequential amendments bill would expand the application of the act and allow the Governor General to make regulations declaring certain persons associated with missions established under the principal bill to be internationally protected persons and afforded protection as such. Thirdly, the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act prohibits the improper use of diplomatic and consular signs and titles which falsely purport to represent a diplomatic or consular mission. The consequential amendments bill would expand the protection afforded by the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act to cover missions established under the principal bill. It would also ensure that the authorised activities of a mission established under the principal bill would not amount to prohibited activities in so far as they may overlap with activities carried out by diplomatic and consular missions, and vice versa. Finally, the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act enacts into domestic law Australia's international obligations to preserve public order in respect of the premises and personnel of diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations. The consequential amendments bill would extend protection under that act to missions established under the principal bill, consistent with these existing international obligations. Amendment of the Australian Protective Service Act, expanding the functions of the Australian Protective Service to cover missions established under the principal bill and to certain persons associated with it, may require an increase in the resources devoted to the service. The amount of such an increase is not quantifiable at this stage and will depend on the number of missions requiring such protection. However, I emphasise that the economic gain which would result from the presence and operations of the missions given privileges and immunities under the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill would outweigh the costs of extending the protective service to those missions. The other amendments would have no financial impact. To conclude, the consequential amendments bill would facilitate the effective implementation of the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill. The consequential amendments would extend protections afforded by existing legislation to missions and their staff established under the principal bill. I recommend the bill to the House of Representatives. MrTAYLOR (Groom) (11.34 a.m.)-The coalition supports both the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill and the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) (Consequential Amendments) Bill, and the general notion of expanding Australian , commercial and semi-diplomatic ties with regional territories and self-governing bodies. We do, however, have a couple of concerns, to which I will return shortly. I do not want to hold up the House unduly this morning, but there are a few points that this side needs to make in the context of this debate. Firstly, the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill 1995 is intended to extend certain consular privileges and immunities to trade and diplomatic missions within Australia from overseas non-state, self governing or autonomous entities. It is anticipated .that a number of overseas trade missions would be established if such a status were available and, as the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns) indicated, these would perhaps include Hong Kong, New Caledonia and the Cook Islands. Secondly, the accompanying bill, the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities)(Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995 would amend four existing acts so as to provide protection to the premises of, and persons associated with, designated overseas missions in the same way as is applicable to staff and property of diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations. As the minister indicated, four acts will need consequential amendments: firstly, the Australian Protective Service Act 1987, which would allow for the protection of property by the Australian Protective Service; secondly, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976, which would allow for the Governor General to make regulations declaring certain persons associated with a designated overseas mission to be internationally protected persons; thirdly, the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act 1978, which is designed to protect against false representations or unofficial missions. The amendments to this act would ensure that any missions which would come under the proposed overseas missions bill could not falsely purport to represent the activities of diplomatic or consular missions. The final act which will require a consequential amendment is the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971, which would ensure protection of newly accredited missions in line with Australia's obligations to protect existing diplomatic and consular missions. As the minister indicated, the general structure of the legislation is based on that already in place for the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963. It allows the foreign minister to grant overseas mission status to specific missions according to regulation and on a case by case basis, which is very important in the context of this legislation. The regulations could be applied so that a designated overseas mission would be entitled to any or all of those privileges and immunities which are listed in the schedules to the legislation, and would be available either unconditionally or subject to limitations or conditions specified in the regulations. In effect, the minister can craft specific privileggive es and immunities for each proposed overseas mission as it is considered-again, on a case by case basis. As the minister indicated, there are two schedules, the first of which deals with privileges and immunities relative to the missions themselves. These privileges include inviolability of the mission and mission property, protection of mission communications and documents, including access to diplomatic channels, exemption from taxes on mission property and mission related business. The second schedule provides for privileges and immunities of persons associated with designated overseas missions. The list of possible privileges and immunities includes inviolability of designated mission staff private residences, exemption from taxation, exemption from laws relating to immigration and work permits and immunities from arrest, search or detention. There will be marginal revenue losses flowing from the property and personal tax exemptions. There may also be an increase in costs associated with the need for additional resources for the Australian Protective Service. These lead to the coalition's first concern. The government has made no estimation of the specific costs other than to note that it expects them to be offset by two factors, which were alluded to by the minister at the table: first, the extension of reciprocity to Australian property and personnel within those overseas territories which would benefit from the bill; and, second, an increase in Australian trade opportunities in those territories which establish missions here in Australia. In the coalition's view, it would be helpfuland I make this point to the Special Minister of State at the table-to have a more detailed analysis of the budgetary implications from the government. A second concern is about immunity from criminal prosecution for overseas mission staff. We feel that this point will need to be considered very carefully. It should not be extended as a matter of general right, as with full diplomatic and consular missions. In granting appropriate status under the legislation, we hope that the foreign minister will special attention to this point in his case by case consideration. On a final and more general note, I make the point that the government has allowed its approach to bilateral relations to be clouded by an obsession with multilateral structures. Undoubtedly such structures are important. However, they are not the be-all and end-all for good international relations. Conflict resolution will rarely be achieved by multilateral structures. In the coalition's view, we need to concentrate all our efforts in effective bilateral relations. These bills represent a perfunctory and overdue attempt to place more focus on bilateral relations rather than on the government's overblown self-congratulations associated with treaty signing. Unlike this government, we will, as the next government, reverse that trend with treaty references, firstly, by providing for significant parliamen tary debate prior to ratification; secondly, by establishing a treaties council as part of the COAG machinery; thirdly, by more appropriate use of the external affairs power, unlike this government; and, finally, by the possible formation of a joint treaties committee of the parliament to carry out more detailed analysis of the treaty making process. Subject to the caveats I have outlined, we commend both bills to the House.",30
29,Mr FERGUSON,PAIRS,"I not wish to detain the House unnecessarily what is, despite the last few comments of member for Groom (Mr Taylor), legislation that both sides fundamentally agree upon. has been indicated earlier, the legislation deals with those privileges and immunities which essentially stem from the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations and, on the national front, the International OrganAustralian izations (Privileges and Immunities) It is a substantial endeavour to extend those privileges and immunities to a number of entities. As indicated by previous speakers, that is very much the upper limit of what being sought. As indicated by other speakers, there are number of controls. It is not a free-for-all. Essentially, those involved must be declared by regulation to be a designated overseas mission and must, in tum, be authorised to in capacities as established in written instrueconomy ments signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of this country. Theoretically, it very broad application. We have heard earlier that it will not apply to what are essentially political propaganda operations such as West Papuan organisations, the Palestine Liberation Organisation or north Cypriot information services. Theoretically, it could apply, understand it, to federated states within particular federation. Theoretically, it could apply-and obviously this is changing every day-to Ciskei and Transkei, et cetera, within South Africa. It could have theoretical application to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. It is probably worthwhile, despite the comments of the opposition that it was an earlier, overdue and 'perfunctory' response to measimmunity ures. It comes at a very convenient time when we look at the changing situation in eastern Europe. Who is to know what is going to evolve in Russia or with the current conflict in Chechnya? Who can foresee the possible outcome in the former Yugoslavia? There are a large number of possibilities there as to government forms and government relations. It comes at a very critical time and probably the most opportune time, given those developments. The seeming propelling reality is the immido nent opening of the Hong Kong Economic on and Trade Office in Sydney apparently in late the 1995. Despite the fact that the financial outcomes have not been itemised ad nauseam, As the reality is that at the moment Hong Kong is Australia's fifth largest destination for foreign investment, we have the fourth largest presence in manufacturing, we constitute over six per cent of total investment there and 300 companies are presently employing Act 1963. over 70,000 people there. We all know the situation in Hong Kong is dramatically changing with the process towards incorporation with China. It is a very is good time for this government to be moving in this direction to fonnalise in a very real a sense a greater relationship. The opening of that office provides that opportunity. If it is not overdue, it certainly is needed. On that front, the Cook Islands is another act example that has been cited. Whilst their is largely interrelated with New Zealand, we are the fifth largest presence in has a relation to both exports and imports. The other example that everyone is citing is French Polynesia. The expansion in exports there is worth noting. In the year to March 1994 they represented $63 million, and jumped to $84 million in the year to March as I 1995. All three cited examples of who a might benefit are worthwhile. As I say, it will give them a greater presence here. It will give them the opportunity to liaise more closely with Australia on bilateral matters. I do not wish to recite ad nauseam the number of advantages that these organisations will receive. They are largely, as stated in the area of taxation, protection and in regard to criminal prosecutions, et cetera. It was stated earlier that we should not be too forward in according these privileges to these missions. Essentially, we have to be reasonable about these things. We have an elected government in this country. Whichever side of the House is running the place, it will be sensible about whom these privileges are extended to. It is fundamentally related to Australia's economic needs. There are a variety of government units that do not fall within the normal mainstream of states that Australia recognises as such. This legislation is going towards Australian interests. I commend the legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

30,Mr WALKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill contains a number of proposed technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 of a minor or administrative nature. Most of the proposed amendments were recommended for legislative amendment by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 1993 federal election, tabled on 16 November 1994. They are directed mainly at improving operational procedures in the conduct of elections. This bill will enable the Australian Electoral Commissiori to delegate to staff its powers to supply and charge for goods and services and provide that such goods and services may be supplementary or an alternative to those already supplied under joint rolls arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states. The bill will also allow the Australian Electoral Commission to delegate its powers under any law, such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act, under which the commission conducts periodic ATSIC elections. The bill includes two provisions to protect the peace of mind and health of the elderly and infirm. Firstly, it will improve the enrolment objection process by allowing relatives and friends who do not live in the same subdivision as electors of unsound mind to apply for their removal from the roll on medical advice and without the payment of an objection fee. Secondly, the bill will prohibit canvassing in and around hospitals that are polling places on polling day and in special hospitals during the five days before and including polling day. The bill will also allow for electors whose enrolment has been objected· to, to be removed from the roll in the period between the issue of the writ for an election and the close of the rolls. This will help to ensure that only entitled electors vote. The bill will ensure that the personal details of silent electors will not be disclosed to persons inspecting applications for postal votes, enhancing the secrecy of the ballot. The bill will allow the Australian Electoral Commission to use state-of-the-art methods of security printing of ballot papers instead of using outdated watermarked ballot papers. This will result in considerable savings in ballot paper storage and production costs. The bill will extend the right to vote to all divisional returning officers and Australian electoral officers and standardise the method for resolving ties during the counting of votes. The bill will also extend the two-candidate preferred count, as conducted in polling places on polling night, to the fresh scrutiny and declaration votes scrutinies, as conducted later by the divisional returning officers. There are three amendments to this bill which are proposed to be moved on behalf of the government which would greatly assist the Australian Electoral Commission's efficiency in conducting the next election. 1. An amendment improving the drafting the provision enabling the Electoral Commission to empower its staff to enter into agreements to supply and charge for House. goods and services. 2. At the request of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)-and I might add with the blessing of the Privacy Commission-a new provision for gender data on electors for the pose of medical research and health screening programs. Currently those conducting approved medical research and health screening programs may be provided with names and addresses of electors from the Commonwealth electoron al roll. However, some of those programs, notably breast screening programs, quire the names and addresses of female electors only. 3. The third amendment will enable the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct Senate scrutinies by a computer. The computer program will follow the principles of the manual process. It will also allow far better access by scrutineers to information such as preferences on ballot papers, whose details will be stored within the computer system. This includes information on informal ballot papers and 'wild card' papers that are formal but not in accordance with party tickets. A record of ballot papers notionally transferred at each count and the progress of the count of the vote will also be able. The commission has conducted demonstrations of the proposed system for political party representatives in each state and territory and for the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The commission estimates that it will save approximately $370,000 at each Senate election by using this system. However, the greater advantage of the proposed system is that it will reduce the time taken to distribute preferences from weeks to hours and should allow the Senate count to be finalised about the same time as the House of Representatives. Finally, the bill makes a number of minor amendments to correct spelling and syntax of errors in the ComQIonwealth Electoral Act and to remove gender specific language where it still occurs. I commend the bill to the",36
31,Mr CONNOLLY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The purpose of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995 is to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act pur1984. As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) rightly said, some of these proposed amendments were recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 1993 federal election which was tabled 16 November last year. As the deputy chairman of that committee, I have participatreed in those discussions. Many of the suggested amendments are of a pro forma nature. Some are as simple as removing hyphens from a range of words throughout the legislation. The bill also ensures that the personal details of silent electors will not be disclosed to persons inspecting applications for postal votes. Silent enrolment electors do not have their addresses publicly displayed on the electoral roll, on the grounds that this would place the personal safety of the electors or their families at risk. I have recently had occasion to advise a not constituent in my electorate to become a silent elector. That has taken place. This demonstrates that, while we think we live in a free and open society, there are circumavailstances when one does not have to be a judicial personage or somebody with a major public profile to seek this right. This is open to people generally who feel that the accessibility of their personal details through the electoral roll could, in one way or another, be a threat to their security. The legislation currently provides that the address of a silent enrolment elector be removed from the postal vote application before being made available for inspection. There is information such as phone numbers, postal addresses and the names and addresses of witnesses on the application which could help identify the elector's address if it were available. As the report of the joint committee observed, this clearly undermines the intent the silent enrolment provisions. The bill also improves the enrolment objection process by allowing relatives and friends who do not live in the same subdivision as electors of unsound mind to apply for their removal from the roll on medical advice and without the payment of an objection fee. Section 118(4) of the Electoral Act provides that such an objection must be accompanied by a certificate issued by a medical practitiones er which states that, in the practitioner's opinion, the elector is of unsound mind and cannot understand the nature and significance of enrolment and voting procedures. Under the act, a challenged elector may answer an objection. This amending legislation allows for electors whose enrolment has been objected to, to be removed from the roll in the period between the issue of the writ for an election and the close of the rolls. This will help to ensure that only electors entitled to enrol are able to vote. The bill also allows the Australian Electoral Commission to use a more up-to-date method of security printing of ballot papers for referfollows: enda and e1ections instead of using watermarked ballot papers which will result in considerable savings in both paper storage and production costs. Since 1915, the Electoral Act has required that ballot papers be authenticated by an official watermark, which the ABC believes is both costly and now technically obsolete. The report of the joint standing committee also observed that if the security printing process, as used for chequebooks, was used to produce ballot papers, the ABC would not be obliged to store stocks of watermarked paper to cater for at least two elections. Also as an official mark for identification, security printing would probably prove superior to watermarking-for example, security printing could be such that erasures could not be disguised. The bill will disallow canvassing in and around hospitals that are polling places on polling day and in special hospitals during the five days before and including polling day. Special hospitals are hospitals declared by notice in the Gazette. They include convalesof cent homes and similar institutions. Under the current act, canvassing near or within hospitals that are polling places and special hospitals is disallowed from the day of issue of the writ for an election until the end of polling day or the expiration of the last day to which polling was adjourned. The bill extends the right to vote in elections to all divisional returning officers and Australian Electoral Commission officers and standardisthe method of resolving ties during the counting of votes. It extends the two-candidate preferred count, as conducted in polling places on polling night, to the fresh scrutiny and declaration votes scrutinies, as conducted later by the divisional returning officer. Consequently, a two-candidate preferred count will be applied to declaration votes scrutinies in all electorates. In the 1993 election, the twocandidate preferred count was applied to scrutiny. of the declaration vote only in those electorates identified as close at the end of counting on election night. The recent inquiry by the committee was advised by the ABC as . . . there is support within the AEC for extending the [two candidate preferred count] to declaration vote scrutinies in all Divisions and reporting those figures through media releases. If the [two candidate preferred] count from polling places was checked, corrected as necessary, and continued as an integral part of the declaration scrutinies, there should be no need to delay the formal distribution of preferences until counting of all first preference votes is finalised. Declaration of the Poll could be based on the [two candidate preferred] figure, except in very close three cornered contests. The bill also ensures that posters and car stickers are included in those forms of advertising which require authorisation. It provides that letters to the editor of a newspaper are exempt from the full requirements of the authorisation provi1,;ions in elections and referenda and that only the author's name and suburb or locality are to be shown. This amendment is made to address the security and privacy problems which currently exist as a result of the requirement for full address details to be shown. It also abolishes the obligation for the Australian Electoral Commission to advertise in two newspapers in a state or territory the receipt and particulars of the writ for the election of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate or for a referendum, as well as notices relating to redistributions and mini-redistributions. It is now proposed that such notices be published in only one newspaper circulating generally in a state or territory. As referred to earlier, the government has proposed a number of new amendments to its original bill. One amendment .enables the ABC to conduct the Senate scrutiny using a computer process and another allows for the provision of the gender of electors for the purpose of medical research and health screening surveys. Despite the fairly non-controversial nature of most of the legislation, the coalition does have a number of concerns. For example, there was some questioning about the need for authorisation of car stickers, in that most people would not be able to read an authorisation on the back of a speeding car at the very best of times. The government, however, claims that car stickers are not only placed on cars, which is probably a valid point. Another area of concern, particularly for those who object to compulsory voting, is amendment 42 of schedule 1 and amendment 8 of schedule 2, which provides that the divisional returning officer may arrange for delivery of the non-voting penalty notice by means other than the post. The government has argued that the amendment will provide for greater flexibility in remote areas where mail services may be unreliable. The provision will also allow the delivery of notices by field officers in those areas where they operate. Furthermore, some believe that the change from the two-newspaper requirement may disadvantage readers in the larger states, such as Victoria and New South Wales, where there are two daily newspapers. The coalition is looking at moving an amendment in this respect in the Senate as it does not see the change as necessary. In states where there is only one major local newspaper circulating generally, the ABC can always take out its second advertisement in a newspaper like the Australian, as I am informed has happened in the past. The coalition also has concerns about age discrimination on the part of the Electoral Commission. Later, I will seek to incorporate a letter to one of my constituents from the local acting divisional returning officer of the ABC on this question. The coalition has been approached by a number of casual employees of the ABC, claiming that they have been told that their services are no longer required by the ABC as they are over the age of 65. The AEC says the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act does not provide cover for people over 65. It is worth noting that the,government has been promising to eliminate age discrimination across its departments since 1990. We have continued to oppose this. I moved legislation to the effect of removing age discrimination from Commonwealth employment two years ago. I have a re-run of that legislation coming before the House next week. It is not unreasonable, therefore, that we will be moving an appropriate amendment in the Senate to cover this particular point. I seek leave from the minister to incorporate in Hansard the text of a letter from the Electoral Commission.",37
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Order! I have inspected the document which the honourable member for Bradfield has presented to the House. Regrettably, it is outside the guidelines of the standing orders. House of Representatives practice: The current practice of the House on the incorporation of other material, defined by Speakers Snedden and Jenkins in statements on the practice, is based on the premise that Hansard, as an accurate as possible a record of what is said in the House, should not incorporate unspoken material other than items such as tables which need to be seen in visual form for comprehension. If the honourable member wishes to continue, he still has adequate time.",39
33,Mr CONNOLLY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Since I have time available, I will read the letter into Hansard. The letter was written to a Mr John Orange, a constituent of mine. It states: Dear John I am writing to thank you for the assistance you have provided in the conduct of major electoral events such as elections and electoral roll reviews, and to advise that, regretfully, I will no longer be able to consider you for further employment. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has recently adopted a policy not to employ people over the age of 65 years as it is not able to offer the same terms and conditions of employment as apply to staff under 65 years, particularly regarding workers compensation cover. The recent introduction of legislation which makes it unlawful to terminate an employee's employment for reasons including age does not apply to employees engaged for a specified period of time or for a specified task, for example, as polling officials or electoral roll review casuals. The introduction of this legislation has, however, highlighted our inability to offer similar terms and conditions of employment. The AEC has received legal advice confirming that the policy is not unlawful and, whilst the policy may appear to be inconsistent with the recent Government initiatives, the issue is a complex one. This has been recognised by the establishment of an interdepartmental Task Force to facilitate the formation of the Government's policy on this issue. The AEC will be carefully considering any changes flowing from this review of Commonwealth policy so that it is in step with the Government's views. The time-frame for the outcome of the review is unknown, but you may wish to contact this Office at the next major electoral event to establish the position at that time. With my best wishes for the future Yours sincerely Marilyn Kerr Acting Divisional Returning Officer As I noted, letters along those lines have been received by many hundreds of people presumably across Australia. As we all know from our regular dealings with our own electoral offices, a surprising number of staff are involved. Many of them are former teachers; many of them are retired people. They all do an excellent job for Australia in performing a critical series of functions in relation to the electoral process. The opposition believes it is absolutely absurd that people who are perfectly efficient in every other respect should be denied employment and denied a rightful place in the electoral process simply because of their age. There are three sets of amendments which we will be moving in the Senate. They are designed, as I said, to end age discrimination against Australian Electoral Commission employees over the age of 65, to allow those registered as general postal voters to be sent ballot papers as soon as possible after the issue of the writ for an election, and to allow political parties, members and senators access to the gender of electors. With regard to age discrimination, we have been approached by a number of employees on this matter. In view of the type of work they do, I think it is absolutely absurd that a 65 mandatory age be applied to employees of the ABC. It is worth noting in this context that there are in fact only 81 officers of the Commonwealth Public Service employed at the age of 65. Out of the many hundreds of thousands we have, only 81 fit that description. This demonstrates how absurd it is to argue that having older workers somehow removes the opportunities for employment for younger workers, which is a canard which has been used by those on the other side in this debate for far too long. I refer now to the question of ballot papers for general postal voters. We will be moving amendments to this effect in the Senate as well. They are designed to ensure that declaration envelopes and ballot papers are sent to those registered as general postal voters as soon as practicable after the issue of the writ for an election. The proposal is consistent with a minority report of the coalition members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which was not included, regrettably, in this legislation. Finally, the government intends to move an amendment that allows for the provision of gender of electors for the purpose of medical research and health screening surveys. There is a good case for people to have access to the gender of electors as happens in some states, certainly those states which have their own electoral rolls, and it would be useful if it were applied federally. The fourth set of amendments, regarding the two-newspaper requirement, which I have already referred to, will go some way towards solving a problem we see in that area. I wish to advise the House that, otherwise, the opposition, naturally, will not be opposing the passage of this legislation.",40
34,Mr GRIFFIN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Corinella) (12.11 p.m.)The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995 contains a number of proposed technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 of a minor or administrative nature. They are necessary to resolve various practical problems which have arisen in electoral administration and to improve operational procedures in the conduct of elections and referendums. For those in the gallery at the moment, this is pretty dry. It not the most exciting bill that we will debate in this House. Nonetheless, it is a necessary piece of legislation. Many of the bills here fairly dry in nature but essential for good government. Some of the proposed amendments were recommended for legislative amendment by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 1993 federal election tabled on 16 November 1994. They have been included in the bill as they require early attention to enable the Australian Electoral Commission to be fully prepared for the next federal election. The major provisions of the bill relate to the following issues: firstly, to enable the Australian Electoral Commission to delegate to staff its powers to supply and charge for goods and services and provide that such goods and services may be supplementary or an alternative to those already supplied under joint rolls arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states; and, secondly, to delegate its powers under any law. At present the AEC can delegate its powers under the Electoral Act to the Electoral Commissioner. The joint standing committee recommended that the commission be permitted to delegate its powers under any other law as well as under the Electoral Act. The recommendation followed a request by the ABC. The ABC also has powers under statutes other than the Electoral Act. For example, it conducts elections under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 and the Industrial Relations Act 1988. An example of a responsibility that cannot at present be delegated but must be exercised by the commission itself is the appointment of polling places for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission elections. Procedures exist under the Electoral Act for voters of unsound mind to be removed from the electoral roll. Under subsection 114(1) of the Electoral Act, it is a requirement that a person objecting to a person's enrolment must live in the same subdivision as the voter and must lodge a $2 fee. The joint committee reported that a consequence of these requireis ments is that voters of unsound mind are not removed from the rolls and that non-voter levels are therefore higher than necessary. The are joint standing committee recommended that the Electoral Act be amended so that an elector objecting to the enrolment of another elector on the basis of unsound mind not be required to live in the same subdivision and not be required to lodge a $2 fee. The committee also recommended a change in procedures where an objection has been lodged to the enrolment of a voter. At present, subsection 118(5) of the Electoral Act prevents a divisional returning officer from removing an elector's name from the roll between the date on which writs are issued and the close of polling, even where the DRO has already decided that the elector's name should be removed. The Joint Standing Committee dates this provision from before 1983-that is, when it was possible for the rolls to close the same day the writ was issued. The joint standing committee recommended that the Electoral Act be amended to provide that the period from which a DRO cannot remove an elector's name from the roll following an objection action should commence at the close of the rolls. The committee also recommended that section 209A of the Electoral Act be amended to provide that ballot papers may be printed using either a security mark approved by the AEC or a watermark. In evidence before the joint standing committee, the ABC stated that existing legislation which requires authentication of ballot papers by the use of a watermark is both costly and technologically obsolete. The ABC estimates that approximately $2.3 million would be saved over each three-year parliamentary term if ballot papers were to be produced using security printing arrangements instead of the existing watermarked paper. Savings are attributable to reduce storage, handling and freight costs as well as production costs. The ABC proposed the use of a security mark, such as that used for cheque books. An added advantage of a security mark, according to the joint committee, is that its use would make erasures more difficult to disguise. Another'recommendation of the committee was to increase the protections provided to silent enrolment electors who make postal vote applications. Persons who considers that the appearance of their address on the publicly available Commonwealth electoral roll would endanger their own safety or that of their family may make a request to the DRO that their address either not appear on the or be removed from the roll. This is called silent enrolment. The DRO must be given details of the risk faced by the applicant, and a request must be verified by statutory declaration. Applications for postal votes are available for public inspection. While postal vote applications available for public inspection do not list the residential address of a silent enrolment elector, they do contain information such as postal address and telephone number. The public availability of this type of information may also endanger the safety of the silent enrolment elector. The joint standing committee recommended that, with the exception of the elector's name, all information on postal vote applications for silent enrolment electors should be deleted prior to public inspection. The Electoral Act contains a provlSlon which precludes divisional returning officers who are enrolled in electorates in which they are the DRO from voting in an election for the House of Representatives in that electorate. In the past DROs had a casting House of Representatives vote when an election result was tied. In its 1986 report the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform recommended that, where a tied vote occurred, the outcome should be determined by the Court of Disputed Returns rather than by a casting vote of a DRO. This recommendation was implemented in 1990 by an amendment to the Electoral Act. Because a DRO no longer has a casting vote, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters concluded in its 1994 report that it was inappropriate for a DRO to be disqualified from voting in the House of Representatives electorate for which he or she is the DRO. Another adjustment which will be made through this legislation relates to the counting of declaration votes. The situation at the moment, as it was over the last election, is that on election night there is what is called a two-candidate preferred count. The situation is that in each polling booth in Australia the votes that are cast are counted to primary votes and are then nominally passed across into preference piles towards the likely two roll major candidates in terms of an election result, which would normally be the coalition candidate and the Labor candidate. In that way we get a fair, reasonable and accurate picture of what the result will be in that electorate. However, that does not include those votes that have been cast in other circumstancessay, postal votes, prepoll votes and other declaration votes. The circumstances are that those votes are counted post-election night and are in a situation where that two-party preferred count is not done until the final distribution of preferences in the finalisation of that particular local election. That, in a close election, effectively ensures that the result may take longer to establish. Therefore, the proposal here is to extend that two-party preferred throw across to those declaration votes and, in that way, help to remove uncertainty about results and therefore, potentially, the result of an election. There are a number of other minor amendments to the legislation. One other one which I understand is being introduced as an amendment to the bill is the allowance for the AEC to conduct computerised scrutiny of Senate ballot papers for the Senate count. The computerised scrutiny process is designed to deal with those ballot papers which are included in the central scrutiny process. These ballot papers are the below the line ballot papers where electors have chosen to number the ballot paper exhaustively for each candidate on the ballot paper. Depending on the size of the ballot paper, this would involve placing a number against, say, 60 candidates, as was the case in New South Wales in 1993. Below the line ballot papers represent about six per cent of the formal vote. The percentage varies from state to state, with Tasmania having the highest. Six per cent of the formal vote does not really sound like a lot of ballot papers, but in fact the buying of paper involved is quite staggering. In the larger states there are about 150,000 ballot papers in the central scrutiny. These ballot papers weigh 1,500 kilograms and require an extremely large space when they are being counted and sorted. Essentially, what is involved is the question of those people who have taken the time to vote below the line rather than designate a number in a box above the line for a particular party or slate of candidates. If the voters decide to number it right the way through, the result is that those ballot papers require more detailed scrutiny and counting, and that effectively slows down the overall count. The computerised scrutiny process will be faster than the manual process. In the past, the AEC has been unable to guarantee that the poll would be declared by the end of June should an election be held any later than early May in the year in which a Senate election is due. With computerised scrutiny, it is expected that we would be able to cope with an election called at the end of May, some two weeks later than would normally be the case. This is because we are talking about a process which is significantly quicker. The computerised scrutiny process will be cheaper than the manual system. The expectation is that, by using the computerised system in an election, there will be a saving of around $370,000 nationally. This is because there will be less need for casual assistance and the training of that casual assistance in order to allow the counting to occur. With the computerised system, the requirement will be that the actual ballot paper be entered into a computer on an individual basis. That sounds terribly time consuming and, in terms of an initial count, I guess it is. The fact is that potentially up to 60 candidates can contest a Senate ballot. The result is that those preferences have to be counted for the number of vacancies required, and then almost all those below the line votes have to be recounted and recounted again. Although it may cost some time in terms of the initial development of a process, in terms of conducting a full Senate election it will speed up the process significantly. It will also provide a lot of interesting information which can be used for people who have an interest in electoral matters. For instance, some people may wish to look at what the result would have been in a particular state or area if there were more vacancies than already existed. Also, it can be used to look at informal voting patterns to see whether patterns occur and, therefore, whether action needs to be taken to address that issue. If there were a casual vacancy which was not normal, in the sense that it was not a candidate from a major party-for example, the vacancy left in 1990 when Senator Wood, from New South Wales, was determined to have been ineligible-the recount required in those circumstances would be a lot quicker. It would certainly ensure greater accuracy, consistency and efficiency in terms of the overall process. In that way, it is certainly worthwhile. I would like to tum briefly beyond that to the report of Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters looking into the 1993 federal election. Many of these recommendations have come from that report. I wish to also focus on a couple of other issues which elements of this proposed legislation relate to. One of the key issues which was debated across the table between the coalition and the government during the committee's inquiry was electoral integrity. Essentially, a range of concerns about fraud within the electoral system were raised by some people who had made written and verbal submissions to the inquiry and also by some members of the committee. Some very interesting evidence was taken on those matters. I stress that interesting though it may have been, conclusive it was not-and in many respects accurate, in relation to the actual situation we faced at that election, it was not. On the question of electoral integrity and electoral fraud, the report states: In brief, all objective evidence indicates that fraud is not a significant occurrence and did not influence any result at the 1993 federal election. To quote the AEC: ... some of the measures discussed [would] tend disproportionately to affect underprivileged or marginal members of society. The burden of inconvenience on voters could well serve to reduce the high level of voluntary compliance with compulsory enrolment and voting which has largely been forthcoming in Australia. Both of these factors would tend to diminish rather than enhance the legitimacy of Australian election processes. That relates directly to proposals made by members of the committee and which are included in the coalition members' dissenting report. This includes potential changes that may be made to the Australian electoral system to address the alleged fraud that some maintain could possibly be occurring. The debate on the committee changed over time. Initially, we had people being' quite forthright with respect to their firm belief that this had occurred. The basic underlying political premise was that the government had stolen the election. But the circumstances are that debate ensued, discussions occurred with the AEC and evidence was produced to refute it. The debate then went along the lines, 'We're not necessarily saying this happened, but it could happen in these circumstances in these positions.' A whole range of issues was suggested, to which I think that quote directly relates. One suggestion was the use of a voter card. Voters who attend at a polling booth would be required to produce a card that had been sent to them in the mail by the ABC. If they did not produce that card, they would be forced to do a declaration vote and their circumstances would be checked later. The voter card system was tested in Victoria about 12 months ago at a by-election for the seat of Coburg. There have been elections in Victoria conducted by the state electoral office since then, but it has decided not to continue with that particular proposal at this stage. There is a range of reasons for that decision. For one thing, some 13 or 14 per cent of people did not bring the voter card with them. This voter card system was being used on a voluntary basis in the council in which I was a councillor before I was elected to this parliament. In those circumstances, it is of major assistance to people of non-English-speaking background. But it is a voluntary thing: you do not have a situation where your vote is effectively challenged and forced to be a declaration vote in those circumstances. The problem with the system is that people who have mislaid their card may have to go through what could be a daunting process at a booth in filling out a declaration vote. This would mean that the number of declaration votes would increase dramatically. Therefore, the time taken to process the votes would increase dramatically and we could go back to the unfortunate situation of having queues to vote. Essentially, the system would disadvantage people who were not articulate and who were not experienced in dealing with the official processes of voting in the circumstances that I have outlined. Another suggestion was for the closure of electoral rolls as soon as an election is called, thus ensuring that people do not have a chance to 'jump' electorates in terms of their enrolment. All the evidence shows that that does not occur. The fact is that there are many thousands of people who, for some reason, did not get around to registering, did not think about it or were unaware of the need to. They do not ensure that their enrolment is up to date prior to an election being called. When an election is called the advertisenients go out and the media is full of it. This focuses people's minds on the need to ensure that they can play their part in the democratic process. Closing rolls as soon as an election is called would disenfranchise thousands of people and, in those circumstances, it would be totally unfair and unreasonable. Another proposal was the reintroduction of subdivision voting. Essentially, subdivision voting - which is something we had some years ago in this country-means that I could vote at, say, only two, three or four booths that directly relate to my residence. If I tried to vote somewhere else outside that area, I would be forced to do a declaration vote and I would have grave difficulty in exercising my democratic right. The current system allows people some flexibility in that it allows them to cast votes in different locations. One of the great things about our electoral system is that people are encouraged to vote. It is made as easy as possible for them to be able to exercise that vote while still maintaining safeguards. The system is reviewed on a continuing basis. The ABC will react and has, on occasions, reacted to examples that have shown through from the operati9n of this system where there may have been some form of illegality. All the evidence, which particularly relates to multiple voting, is that there are very few occasions where that occurs. It has occurred on a number of occasions in the last election process but, where they have occurred, the circumstances of the margins on those occasions meant that they did not affect any results. Often there were explanations for these errors, such as a name having been incorrectly crossed off on a roll or, alternatively, disabled, aged or infirm people who may have gone to vote and then a member of the family has come down later in the day and said, 'You had better come down and vote.' So they have said, 'Okay, fine, I forgot about it.' Many instances have been able to be explained. In those circumstances, the evidence is not there to suggest anything like the problems that were being suggested. Another issue raised was compulsory voting. I anticipate that some speakers from the opposition may raise this and other issues in their contributions further in the debate. There are even major disagreements within the Liberal Party on compulsory voting. When this issue was raised by Senator Nick Minchin, who is a member of the committee, former Senator Chris Puplick engaged in radio interviews attacking Senator Minchin's position on this issue as being unreasonable, unfair and almost undemocratic. This bill as it stands is a worthy improvement to the existing system. It is a system, like any system, which has to evolve over time. That is why it requires finetuning. We have an electoral system in this country which is the envy of many parts of the world. It is a system which ensures fairness, justness and equality. It is a system which has served the country well over the last hundred years. I urge the speedy passage of this bill in the lead-up to the next election. I am sure that, as a result of it, we will have a fairer system. I look forward to the results of that system coming forth in the next election with the return of the Keating government.",41
35,Mr ROCHER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill, as has already been remarked on by previous speakers, involves a series of technical amendments that will finetune the electoral process. There are only a couple of matters that I intend to discuss. Australia's electoral system is important in that it must be seen to work properly without fear or favour if the electorate at large is to have any confidence in our democratic system. Fortunately, to date we have reason to have confidence in our electoral process and the operations of the Australian Electoral Commission, the ABC. We need, however, to be constantly vigilant in the protection of our democratic rights and ensure our electoral laws are the best available to us. It is bills such as this one which, though technical, ensure that the best possible electoral laws exist. These amendments have not just fallen out of the sky, as demonstrated by the previous speaker, the member for Corinella (Mr Griffin). Some were recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 1993 election. Others, no doubt, are recommendations of the ABC which have arisen through the process of internal reviews, monitoring and evaluation. In reviewing the rules and procedures of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, it is essential to distinguish between the issues of good law and the type of electoral system we have. There has been some considerable discussion of the type of electoral system employed for Senate elections. This has largely been spearheaded by our part-time Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In light of the New South Wales election, there has also been public comment on the fact that a party which does not achieve a majority of the two-party preferred vote has been able nevertheless to form a majority government. That was not the first time that it happened, though it should be of some concern that the party with minority support in the community is able to form a government. It is, however, a fact that a New South Wales type outcome is possible where single member constituencies form the basis of electoral representation. The Prime Minister, however, sees the New South Wales result as being a reflection of voter sentiment to tip out the Fahey government. That only goes to show how out of touch the Prime Minister is. Voter sentiment was clearly for the continuance of a coalition government. The fact that 52 per cent of voters voted for the coalition is evidence enough of the true sentiment of New South Wales voters. This bill is important in that it also makes minor technical amendments to the machinery for referendums. This is especially important in light of the present debate over the republic. The aim of the coalition is to involve all the Australian people by consultative and constitutional referenda in any change to our constitutional arrangements. We also intend to use the process of a people's convention to decide the questions and options which will be put before the people in a referendum. Our policy' direction, which offers the Australian people a real choice, makes full usage of the referendum mechanism, and is the only prescription which gives the people alternatives. The Prime Minister offers the Australian people only his solitary partisan choice-the take it or leave it option. The best way to involve all Australians and tap a clear consensus for the final question to be put is to involve as many people as possible and use the referendum mechanism to its best effect. That is why the Australian people believe our option is the best way to go and will best prevent the present Prime Minister dictating a partisan approach to the Australian people, which would be defeated in a referendum. I want to now draw attention to clause 42 of schedule 1 and clause 8 of schedule 2. These clauses deal with compulsory voting and the issue of penalty notices where an enrolled voter is found not to have exercised his or her right to vote. Both clauses have the same wording, but the former relates to the machinery of the Electoral Act and the latter to the Referendum Act. The effect of these clauses is to provide the divisional returning officer with the option of delivering the penalty notice by means other than post. This is intended to make delivering penalty notices in the bush easier, because mail deliveries are sometimes unreliable, and will allow. the ABC field officers to deliver the notices. This is a very reasonable proposition if you support the concept of compulsory voting-and we have. However, I have made it known on earlier . occasions in this place and elsewhere that I favour voluntary voting and thereby believe we should not be passing laws to further entrench compulsion. This is especially the case with penalty notices. In my view, compulsory voting is incompatible with a free and democratic society. An essential component of the right to vote is the right not to vote. To force people to exercise the right to vote contradicts the very nature of that right. This attitude was at the heart of the Dutch parliament's decision-and other parliaments-to end compulsory voting in 1970. It is clear that election results should be based on the clear choice of voters voluntarily participating in the process, and should not be influenced by votes cast by those who would not bother to vote if they were not so compeIled. Voluntary voting is the norm in nearly all Western nations, with Australia being only one of about four countries to maintain compulsion. To be in a minority does not necessarily mean we are in the wrong, but there must be good reasons to coerce people into fronting up at a poIling station on election day. In most Western countries with voluntary. voting, voter turnout is still substantial. In fact, since 1945, several nations with voluntary voting have averaged higher voting turnouts than countries with compulsory voting. Unfortunately, a coherent case in favour of compulsory voting has not been made, in my view, neither recently nor in the past. Another electoral issue for which a good case has not been made is the government's calI to change the voting system for the Senate. This is a typical example of a Prime Minister with imperial ambitions who, having been thwarted on many occasions by the Senate, now wants to change the rules. The Prime Minister has been totaIly lacking in balance on this matter. The Prime Minister has described those in the other place as 'unrepresentative swill'. Why would he do that? There are several reasons, but most notable is his frustration with the Senate. The Senate is more representative of Australia's diverse political opinion and is not controIled by Labor. This prevents the executive being able to dictate federal government policy in all areas. The Prime Minister wants the Senate to be simply a rubber stamp. His threat to change the system reflects his contempt for this parliament. Not only does he treat the Senate with contempt, this contempt has spread to this House, as witnessed by his infrequent appearances in this place. Our part-time Prime Minister thinks it is an honour that he should grace us twice a week with his appearances at question time. When he does, his behaviour in this place is a disgrace. . Mr Alan Ramsey, on 17 March last year, on Lateline said of the Prime Minister's attitude to the Senate: It's essentially a political response by a Prime Minister who is sick and tired of having to deal with the Senate, which he cannot control. Nothing in Paul Keating's political career suggests that he has a real concern about the legislative process of parliament. He sees parliament as political theatre. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) said on the same show: Paul Keating has a very conservative, traditionalist view of parliament. I do not agree with my esteemed coIleague in that regard. He went on: He believes that we have an election every three years and that's it. In between, the government should govern unimpeded and that parliament exists simply as a talking shop, of which the government may take notice, or may not, at its discretion. I agree with those latter sentiments. Mr John Nethercote, a senior researcher in the Senate, got it right when he said: The Prime Minister's philosophy is more akin to that of Bonapartisn, where the idea is, once you've elected the leader, the leader goes and does whatever he or she likes. That is not a tradition of government with which we are familiar. The fact remains that the Prime Minister claims the Senate is unrepresentative because each state has 12 senators. This means that to elect a senator in Tasmania it takes one-sixth of the voters, or 27,000, whereas, in New South Wales, it takes 318,000. Yet the response of the Prime Minister is not to advocate a change in the number of senators from each state to reflect one vote, one value, because this requires a constitutional amendment which would never succeed, and rightly so. Instead the Prime Minister talks about eliminating proportional representation in the Senate and replacing it with 12-single member constituencies in each state elected by first past the post. No longer would a senator represent a state, but only part of a state. Such a change to the Senate electoral system would be good for the major parties because they would have a fifty-fifty chance of gaining control of the Senate. However, the 15.5 per cent of voters who voted for neither the coalition nor Labor would be totaIly without representation in both houses of parliament. That would be untenable. The Senate, as a house of review, should be made up of a cross-section of the voting public, to be thereby competent in reviewing the legislative and administrative programs of an increasingly dictatorial and out of touch executive. Labor's talk of changing the Senate electoral system smacks of the anti-federalist diatribe which so frequently flows from our much and deservedly maligned Prime Minister's mouth. We have seen time and again that Labor has no respect for the federal compact upon which this Federation was originally built. If the rules do not suit the present Prime Minister, he just sets out to change them. He is rather akin to the boy who, frustrated by his lack of performance, takes his bat and ball home. This is a government which, nevertheless, claims to be inclusive. It is actually a government which pays only lip service to social justice. The reality is that it is actually a government which pursues exclusivist policies. This can be clearly seen in the increasing gap between rich and poor and in the gradual but relentless destruction of mainstream Australia. It is no surprise that Labor will never be trusted to have control of both houses of this parliament.",45
36,Mr KATTER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Kennedy) (12.45 p.m.)The earlier speakers in this debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill gave some enumeration-it was all right for one to do it; I do not know why three speakers in this place had to-of what is in the bill. A lot of what is in the bill is technical streamfather lining, and it does not seem to me that there is any malice aforethought in what is being proposed. The bill is rather interesting, not for was a mad scramble for the door. what it has in it but for what it leaves out. I cannot help but make one comment about the banning of canvassing in and around hospitals. The ALP has a very well deserved reputation for rigging electoral arrangements so that it wins. In Queensland, the Labor Party's record is rather magnificent. In the redistribution before last, it simply took six country seats that it had-the AWU seatsand divided them in half. After the redistribution the electorate that I represented in the state house had 3,500 electors-it was a very strong ALP area-and the electorate of the National Party leader, or Country Party leader as he then was, north of Brisbane had 20,000 electors. So one seat had 3,500 electors and the other seat had over 20,000 electors. Yet the same people, some 15 years later, were crying and whingeing about one vote, one value. This is an exercise in arch hypocrisy. There are few examples to rival that particular one. I view with some degree of suspicion the banning of canvassing in and around hospitals. On the face of it, this is quite a reasonable proposition. We do not want sick people being worried by people coming around canvassing and oversighting. I registered my first vote at Mosman Hall in Charters Towers which is the big mental hospital for northern Australia. When I, as a young lad of 18, went into the polling booth, I asked the presiding returning officer how I went about voting, and four members of the nurses union accosted me-not in the sense that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) is giggling about. One of them put his arm around me in a rather friendly fashion and informed me that the way I should vote is ALP. He said, 'Come over here and I'll give you this ballot paper and I'll show you what to do.' He took me into the polling booth. I represented north-west Queensland in rugby league at the tender age of 17 and I was fairly aggressive in nature. I informed him, in a rather unfriendly manner, that my name was Katter and my was the National Party candidate. I then informed him that he was in desperate trouble, both physical and otherwise-and there . Whilst one can view that scene with some degree of humour, that is the way the ALP operates. That incident was the subject of a formal complaint and an investigation at the time, so what I am saying is not just a story conjured up in my imagination. The particular incident I am referring to is on the record in the courts in Queensland. I was also thrown out of the Ingham hospital before the last election by an ALP supporter. I was not speaking to the patients; I was going around speaking to the nurses. One particular nurse made me aware of her political convictions and evicted me from the premises. So when I am told that canvassing in and around hospitals is to be banned I view such a proposal with extreme suspicion. I suspect that the very aggressive nurses union, which is one of the bulwarks upon which the ALP is built in Australia, has been responsible for this little manoeuvre and not the welfare of the sick and those needing to be cared for. The other reference by the Minister for Administrative Services, who led this debate, was the removal of gender specific language. Truly, in our day and age, with 14,000 bankruptcies a year-this is according to the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore)-16 per cent of the Australian work force without a job, the highest suicide rate in the world and the worse current account deficit problems on the entire planet, spending the time of this House and the Public Service eliminating gender specific language really deserves the contempt in which the people of Queensland-I must say I do not know about other parts of Australia-hold the ALP. The ALP will be taken to the cleaners in the forthcoming Queensland election like noone has ever been taken to the cleaners before, except when Bjelke-Petersen took Whitlam there in 1975-and, by the way, the polls were 62 to 38. This legislation is hallmarked by what is not in there rather than by what is in there. Very important principles of the democracy are being turkey trampled by the existing legislation. The northern weather systems are completely dominated by monsoonal troughs and cyclones. Almost all of our rain depressions come from those two large systems. So when it rains in one place it really rains right the board. A monsoonal trough normally extends from Queensland across to Western Australia and down to Lake Eyre. If we get a monsoonal trough or a big cyclonic depression, every single person living outside a town that does not have a polling booth will be eliminated from voting. The ALP, in its cleverness, believes that this is very beneficial to it because all the country people will not be able to vote. The ALP is moving to save money not to manipulate the 'system-it would never do that. Purely to save money, those opposite closed a whole stack of the smaller polling booths so the people in places like Kynuna, MCKinlay, Torrens Creek, et cetera, who vote heavily for the National Party, no longer have a polling booth. If we prevent people from postal voting, we will disenfranchise a very large sector of the National Party voters. In their monumental stupidity, the ALP introduced one vote, one value in Queensland. As it turned out, that system delivered three votes in the state house to the National Party not to the ALP. The deputy director, not the clever Mr Wayne Swan who engineered it, not that imbecile who looks like losing his seat in the forthcoming election",48
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,Order! The honourable member will withdraw that remark.,49
38,Mr KATTER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I withdraw that remark unequivocally. This particular gentleman very cleverly thought it would be great to introduce one vote, one value. He made two mistakes. He put a man of some integrity in as the commissioner, which is not a mistake that the ALP usually makes-very seldom does it put anyone of integrity into any position, but it did in this case. He came up with the verdict that you have to have a way to deliver true democracy, which was not particularly outstanding since the Supreme Court of the United States had decided exactly the same thing. As well, every constitution that has been written down in the history of the planet has been based on a similar decision. This august body we call the parliament of Australia remains the only body in the entire across planet that has a primitive system wherein each electorate is supposed to have the same population size. Without a system of checks and balances, this was introduced into the United States system as well. Since both state and federal elections are held around the middle of the wet season for northern Australia, a very large proportion of the entire number of people living outside the towns are disenfranchised because it is impossible for them to get into town to vote. Except for our main roads, we have very few bitumen roads in the big and sparsely populated areas such as Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Interestingly enough, with the same sort of stupidity that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) exemplified in introducing the one vote, one value system in Queensland where the ALP lost three seats as a result, those opposite got themselves into trouble as well when they forgot about the black vote, the Aboriginal vote, which very heavily favours them. They disenfranchised very large proportions of their own constituency. They want to play politics but they have not played it very cleverly on numerous occasions, and that was one of them. Maybe there are principles that ride a little higher than those democratic principles. To have a very large proportion of the entire population's right to vote depend upon the vagaries of the weather is anti-democratic in the extreme. People in fettlers' camps, miners' camps, mustering camps, isolated Aboriginal communities, and those working on station properties, in shearing sheds and in isolated tourist centres such as Undara and Gunpowder, which are in my electorate, are affected by cyclonic depressions and the monsoonal season and will be disenfranchised unless something is done in relation to postal voting. At present, these people in these places are the only ones in Australia who have to have applications for postal votes sent out to them and then have to send them back. This is rather curious because people on station properties and those in fettIers' camps, Aboriginal communities and tourist centres only enjoy a mail service once a fortnight thanks to the generosity of this government which removed their weekly mail service. It takes two weeks to send out the application for a postal vote, it takes two weeks for it to be sent back, it takes another two weeks for the ballot paper to be sent out and then another two weeks for the ballot paper to come back. That is how long it takes if it does not rain. For people who do not live in the big towns-the government has taken away the polling booths from the small towns-voting is really a game of Russian roulette. The government has got its just deserts in this regard, but, unfortunately, it is the Australian people who have been deprived. The government has, with its one vote, one value principle, taken away the voice of country people in Australia. This is a primitive, simplistic method which has no checks and balances to offset the undemocratic principles contained in it. It has also made some smart manoeuvres like the one in relation to the postal voting system. Why in heaven's name if you are registered as a postal voter on the books of the returning officers of Australia do you have to be sent a postal voting application form? Clearly, if you have registered yourself as a postal voter you do not need an application form. The only conceivable reason for the existence of an application form for postal voting is political chicanery by the ALP. I cannot sit down without going sideways for a few minutes and talking about the principle of no taxation without representation. That is what we now have in the bush. I have been told by the electoral office that the electorate I represent now has over 85,000 electors. My electorate extends from Mareeba north of Cairns down to Barcaldine and Blackall in south Queensland which is almost in line with Brisbane. They are too far north of Brisbane. My electorate extends almost the entire length of Queensland. It takes over 20 hours in a motor car-and there are nearly 200 kilometres of dirt to travel over-to travel from Mareeba, which is the second biggest town in the electorate of Kennedy, to Longreach, which is the fifth biggest town in the electorate of Kennedy and the centre of the central west. Even in a light aircraft it would take a good half day to get from Mareeba to Blackall. People have said that they do not see me. Of course they do not see me. There are over 100 towns in my electorate and after you take out the parliamentary sitting days each town gets two days of my time. If I leave Charters Towers at 8 o'clock in the morning by the time. I get to Canberra it is 5 o'clock in the evening. It takes me a full day to get down here and a full day to get back. Members who have comfortable city seats in Sydney can jump in a motor car and a few hours later be home. For members like the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) and me two days are added to every sitting of the parliament. This limits the amount of attention that the people in my electorate get-and this would be the same in the electorate of Maranoa. I find that I spend an average of 46 hours a week travelling. We cannot ring people or answer telephone calls; we cannot do anything. We just have to sit. We take a quick flight to Sydney, and then the flight is broken in Sydney . We get into another aeroplane to go to Brisbane. We get out and get into another aeroplane to go to Longreach or Townsville. We get out of that and get into a car to go to Ingham or to Innisfail, or whatever the case may be. Although we all try, there is not enough time to do any meaningful work while we are travelling. We have no driver, so we have to drive ourselves. A person who is in a Sydney electorate can get the attention of his member of parliament for a 60-hour week. I think a lot of the members of parliament representing Sydney in the opposition most certainly work a 60hour week. However, to deliver 60 hours to our constituencies, we have to work 100 hours a week. As a second generation federal parliamentarian-and the sentiments of the new Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) on this would be similar to mine-I know that it is not much fun being brought up without a father, and to deprive people of those values puts the sort of person in parliament that I do not think we really want here. Just to indicate how out of step Australia the seat of Quebec in the Canadian federal parliament has over 110,000 electors. The seat of Nunciak has 22,000 electors. In the Orkney Islands in Great Britain-another great democracy-there are 21,000 electors. They return a member of parliament. The seat of East London has 130,000 electors. They return a member of parliament. In the United States-and I do not have the figures for the House of Representatives, but I have the figures for the Senate-two senators from California represent 24 million people, two senators from Arizona represent half a million people. The great father of democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville, often spoke about democracy not being the tyranny of the majority. It was a phrase that he used continually in his writings. In Australia today we are witnessing the crucifixion of the pastoral sector. One in four farmers has been destroyed since 1986. In Queensland it is most certainly another one in four, or arguably one in three, on top of that. I suspect it is probably the same figure for Australia. We are witnessing the complete collapse of the farming sector in Australia, and it is taking the national economy with it. One of our greatest national assets, the beef herd, has lost 30 per cent of its numbers since the late 1970s and early 1980s. The nation's greatest asset by far and away is our wool herd, and half of our sheep numbers have gone. With the wheat industry, plantings last year were 50 per cent of what they were two years before. People may well say, 'That was the drought.' We have had three of those droughts in the last 11 years. Is it the drought? The output of three of our six major exporting items has dropped by half. It is not because of the drought; it is because of the continual persecution of the rural sector by this parliament. As far as the Queensland pastoral sector goes, there are only two representatives in this place-the honourable member for Maranoa and me. I represent one-third of the pastoral interests. The mining industry is crashing down around our ears for exactly the same reason as the pastoral industry. There are numerous spokesmen here for the environis, mental industry, there are numerous spokesmen here for the Aboriginal industry; but there are very few spokesmen here for the mining and pastoral industries. That is why the other two sectors are going ahead in leaps and bounds, while agriculture and mining are falling straight through the floor. In the four years before this present fouryear period, the mining industry had a 25 per cent increase, as it had had for almost all of Australia's history. The pastoral industry had a 13 per cent increase in production in that same period. However, in the last four years, mining has dropped from a 25 per cent increase to a 3.6 per cent increase. The pastoral industry has dropped from a 13 per cent increase down to a 1.9 per cent increase. In real terms, both industries have declined in the last four years. Yet people ask what is happening to the Australian economy. (Time expired)",49
39,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I rise today to make a contribution to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995. It is interesting to note the background of this bill, which is largely in response to recommendations the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters made on the referendum amendment bills, and particularly our electoral laws. It is interesting to note that the bill has made some welCome changes in the area of electoral enrolment and that the joint standing committee also recommended a change in procedures where an objection has been lodged to the enrolment of a voter. I think it is very important that some of these areas were looked at, and it was probably long overdue. As the member for Maranoa, I have a distinct interest in general postal votes in remote areas. I think the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) spoke extremely well on some of the problems associated with not only representing large rural electorates but also people trying to cast their votes in the democratic system that we have in this country. With regard to the security marks on ballot papers, I want to put on the public record some of the changes to the electoral roll as a result of an electoral roll review within my own electorate of Maranoa since the last federal election. I think this relates very much to the security marks and ballot papers issue. We live in the real world where we have got to say that the system that is in place in terms of people's eligibility to vote means that being registered on an electoral roll means, when it comes to identifying whether they have only voted once on that day, there are no security checks; there is no system in place which would prevent someone from voting early and voting often, particularly where perhaps there are people on rolls who should not be on those rolls. In 1993 there were 83,523 people on the electoral roll in the division of Maranoa. With absentee votes and postal votes, 80,269 people voted. As a result of the review, which was completed only on 21 June of this year, the electorate now has officially 80,287 electors on the roll. Since the last federal election, 4,300 electors who were on the roll in Maranoa have been removed from the roll. This is as a result of a.review that was conducted throughout the whole of Queensland's federal divisions, and in fact probably covered the whole of Australia. The point I want to make is that there are 4,300 supposedly eligible voters in Maranoa that have been removed as a result of the review who could not sustain the fact that they still lived in the electorate, that they were alive or had moved to somewhere else in the electorate. The possibility does exist for the voting system to be abused to include some of those votes to be utilised, for whatever political reason. Obviously I do not know, and perhaps none of us would know, who those people were, but it does open up the question as to the sort of system we have in place where in my own electorate of Maranoa 4,300 voters were eligible to vote who were ostensibly on the roll, yet were removed within 12 months of the election as a result of this review. .If this is translated into some of the marginal electorates--:-my good friend the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) represents a very marginal seat-and if this system were used by a political party trying to gain power, it could mean the difference between winning and losing a seat. Let us face it, we live in the real world. It is not a fairy world when it comes to gaining power. We are already seeing some of the dirty tricks that are going to be used by the Labor Party in Queensland in election advertising. In the case of the Page electorate on the north coast of New South Wales, the difference was 70 votes. The member for Parkes, whom I mentioned earlier, holds a very marginal seat. You have only to use your imagination to see how these people who are not actually living in the electorate could use the system to gain seats for a particular political party. Perhaps these people are phantom voters, and I suggest that they could also be voting more than once. I think we have to look at the issue of identification because when someone goes to vote today all they have to say is that they have not voted and that they are eligible to vote in a particular electorate. We have to look at this issue in the longer term. In carrying out these reviews we are finding more and more that people are not necessarily remaining in an electorate. Perhaps they have moved to other areas for legitimate reasons. However, leaving them on the roll in a particular electorate could lead to some corruption of the electoral system. It is open to any political party or any independent candidate to use the system in this way. I am not suggesting that it has happened in the past, but it obviously does provide an opportunity for the system to be abused. I want to touch on the issue of postal votes with particular reference to remote areas of this nation. I once again want to draw on an experience in my own electorate of Maranoa at the last federal election. The member for Kennedy has already canvassed some of the issues that I want to address. In the last federal election there were no polling booths for the towns of Birdsville and Bedourie, two towns in remote parts of my own electorate. That was because at the previous election there were fewer than 100 voters voting in those towns. Consequently, polling booths were not provided in those communities. These two communities have to rely on irregular mail services to obtain applications in for a postal vote.",52
40,Mr COBB,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,How often is the mail?,53
41,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The member for Parkes asks: how often is the mail service to Bedourie and Birdsville? It is a question not only of how often the mail is to Birdsville and Bedourie but also how often the mail is to the remote communities outside of these townships. The answer is that on many occasions it is once a fortnight-and that is if the roads are passable and the mail can get through. The nearest polling place for the people of Birdsville and Bedourie was Windorah, 390 kilometres away. So these people not only did not have a polling booth in their nearest town but also had difficulty getting a postal ballot paper to vote at the last federal election. If they wanted to vote on polling day and they lived in Birdsville or Bedourie, they had to drive 390 kilometres to Windorah to cast their vote.",53
42,Mr WALKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I bet they did, too.",53
43,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The Minister for Administrative Services at the table says, 'I bet they did.' They would have loved to because they were going to protest at the way that this Labor government has treated people in rural and remote Australia. They were desperate to cast their votes. But, unfortunately, they could not do so because, as the member for Kennedy says, this election, as is often the case, was held during the wet season when the rivers were up. The Diamantina was in flood, it was kilometres wide, and it was impossible to get through by road to Windorah to vote. Notwithstanding the fact that these people had applied by mail to the Divisional Returning Officer in Dalby for a postal vote, by the time that process had taken its course the polling day had passed. They did not even have the opportunity of driving to their nearest town, if they lived on a pastoral property, because there was not a polling booth in that town. They then thought they might drive to the nearest town 390 kilometres away to cast their vote. What did they find? They found that the river was up. These are some of the difficulties that people in remote Australia are confronted with when it comes to casting their vote as it is their democratic right to do. That is why we on this side of the House accept the recommendation to adopt the practice of some of the states and territories where ballot papers are automatically sent to those people who have applied for a postal vote. In the Queensland state election such people will be sent the ballot papers automatically because they are registered on the roll for a postal vote. If a federal election takes place within the next two to three months these people will be expecting to automatically receive the ballot papers because it happens at a state level. Unless amendments are passed in this House, that will not be the case. I therefore urge the Minister for Administrative Services to look at what the other states are doing and, in the interests of fairness and democracy, amend the anomaly that exists today. We are disenfranchising the people of rural and remote Australia who through no fault of their own-and my experience in my electorate confinns this-have been disenfranchised. Whilst it is a very small issue in the overall scheme of things, it is only sensible that we adopt the same system that applies in many states and territories. The other issue the committee looked at is the distance a voter resides from a polling booth in order to qualify for receiving a general postal vote. I note that recommendation 47 states that if people live within 100 kilometres from a polling booth they would not be eligible as postal voters.",53
44,Mr COBB,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,Crazy!,54
45,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Quite clearly, that is a crazy situation. That rule might be all very well around Sydney and Canberra, where there are probably several opportunities on good roads to cast the vote by choosing to travel in one of several different directions, but out in rural Australia it is crazy to set a defined limit of 100 kilometres and think that that will be adequate across the nation in terms of access to a polling booth. It is a recommendation. I note in the dissenting report from our side of the House that we have recommended that 20 kilometres from a polling place would be a more sensible approach. I think that the minister at the table should consider our recommendation because it is a far more sensible approach. We have to consider that people in rural and remote Australia have traditionally voted very near their communities. It would be in the best interests of democracy and fairness for the government to adopt the opposition's amendment, which will be moved in the Senate, on this issue. The members of the government who were on this committee perhaps did not clearly understand the issue. I hope the minister does understand it and adopts the amendment from our side of the House.",54
46,Mr COBB,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I have listened with interest to the excellent speech given by the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). I would like to make some comments to reinforce what he says. There is no doubt that general postal voters in remote regions are disadvantaged and, in many instances, repeatedly disenfranchised by the present federal rule, which is out of line with the practice in states and territories in Australia. The present rule says that you can become a general postal voter for a remote region if you live more than 20 kilometres from a polling booth. That is very important in my area where we are suffering a recession and a drought, and some people cannot even afford the petrol to drive that distance. But what happens when you become a general postal voter? To recap what others have said: as soon as possible after an election is called. you are sent the application form without having to specifically request it, you fill it in, you send it back, then they send you the ballot papers, you receive them-if the mail gets through:""-you fill them in, you send them back and, hopefully, your vote wifI be recorded. The difficulty is that there are four mailings that have to be foolproof if you are to get your vote in on time: a mail out to your property; a mail back with the application form; a mailing out with a ballot paper; and silly a mailing back to where the vote is to be collected and counted. This is quite crazy indeed. I was interested to read from section 6.43 of the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on its inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election and related matters, where it says: While this poses no problem for electors with regular mail delivery, there are electors in remote areas· who are regularly disenfranchised by the current procedures. At present, the period between close of nominations and polling day can be as few as 22 days. In many remote areas of Australia, the turnaround time for mail can be a week or more, meaning that the process of receiving and returning a postal vote application and then receiving and returning ballot papers can take up to a month-too long, in many cases, for electors in remote areas to have their votes counted. Something like 10 submissions to the inquiry mentioned this very point, including ones from electoral commissioners in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Electoral Commission itself, based here in Canberra. There are many households in Australia that only receive one mail delivery a week. In fact, I have checked it out and the latest official figure shows that 3,157 households fall into that category. There are, of course, other households that receive a less frequent mail delivery than once per week. The member for Maranoa sPQke of that In my own electorate qf Parkes, there are 386 households that receive only one mail delivery a week. So what is the solution to all of this? It is very simple indeed: to bring the feder/ll act into line with what exists in the other states and territories. In New South Wales, in . Queensland, in South Australia, in Western Australia and in the Northern Territory, if you are a registered postal voter more than 20 kilometre distant from a polling booth, as soon as practical after the writs are issued you are sent the ballot papers. That is, you are automatically sent the papers when an election is called. That removes two steps-two mailings. It means that, even if you live in a remote area where mailings are infrequent, you still get the chance to vote, which is surely what this country, with its fine democratic system, should be all about If we did this, it would not only remove those two steps but bring in a uniform procedure right across Australia, at both state and federal level. It would also eliminate confusion, particularly when a state and a federal election are held in the same area in the same year, as is likely to happen in Queensland this year. There is already a precedent for this federally. People who are infirm and who are unable to sign documents can register as general postal voters and, when the writs are issued, they are automatically sent their ballot papers as soon it is possible to do so. So, if that happens now for infirm people who are unable to sign documents, why can it not be extended to people living in remote areas? I was interested to read a letter I received from Paul Dacey, who is the Assistant Commissioner for Development and Research at the Australian Electoral Commission. It is dated 17 October 1994, and he says: The commission advises there are currently some 584 registered physically incapacitated electors who are automatically issued with ballot papers for federal elections. He goes on to say: There is approximately a lOOper cent response rate This is from these people, when they vote. He also says: . . . there has never been any evidence of fraudulent activity .. That is worth repeating: 'there has never been any evidence of fraudulent activity'. So the precedent is set It is done in the states. It is done federally for this category of people. Why can it not be extended to this other category? On the latest figures that I have, there are 9,623 general postal voters who live more than 20 kilometres from a polling booth, of whom 6,195 are in Queensland. The figures for the remaining states are 1,075 in New South Wales, 879 in South Australia, 826 in Western Australia, 480 in the Northern Territory, 92 in Victoria and 76 in Tasmania. Those 9,623 people are less than one-tenth of one per cent of Australia's voters. Why is there a section of this small group who are continually disenfranchised? The government has a simple solution and is doing nothing about it The mind boggles as to why they will not act If there are concerns as to the integrity of that solution, it is also worth noting what the Australian Electoral Commission says. I quote again from the letter of Paul Dacey, who wrote to the electoral matters committee. The Commission considers that the checking procedure would essentially be the same as for any other postal vote, except that the signature of the voter on the postal vote certificate _would be checked against the Application for Registration as a GPV, rather than the Application for a Postal Vote. This is the system used in those States which despatch ballot papers direct to the GPV s. In order to ensure that all GPVS addresses are maintained as up to date as possible, a review of the Register of GPVs would be undertaken regularly, probably at the same time as an Electoral Roll Review, i.e., at least every eighteen months. He makes further comments about the integrity of the system. There is no doubt that this would be a very secure system to put in place. I contacted Paul Dacey directly, and in his reply of 11 October 1994, he says: ... there is no recorded evidence of either fraudulent activity or malpractice resulting from the automatic issue of ballot papers to register general postal voters. He is talking about the situation that exists in every state in Australia which has implemented the decision that should be in operation at the federal level. Finally, I would like to quote from Brian Cox, who is the Australian Electoral Commissioner, the highest person in the land on this subject, who sent an additional submission to the committee last year. It is dated 7 October 1994 and it says, in part: Distance of residence from a polling place is a relevant factor in determining whether an elector should be eligible to become a registered general postal voter, in that electors in remote areas should not be inconvenienced in voting by having to travel an unreasonable distance to cast their vote. This is recognised in Section 184(A)(2)(a) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Act), in its allowing registration as general postal voters to those electors who reside more than 20 kilometres from a polling place or mobile polling station. However the issue with regard to automatic provision of ballot papers to general postal voters in remote areas is solely whether their mail service is frequent and dependable enough to ensure despatch and return within the timeframes specified in the Act, of the two sequential sets of electoral papers currently necessary to cast a postal vote. Nothing could be plainer than that. He continues: Evidence from the Northern Territory strongly supports the proposition that the distance of the elector's residence from a polling place or mobile polling station is not a relevant factor in an elector's access to sufficiently frequent and ablemail services. Of the electors currently registered as general postal voters in the Northern Territory, around 77 per cent are enrolled for residences within 100 kilometres of the nearest polling place or mobile polling station, yet receive only a weekly or less frequent mail service. It is most likely that a large proportion of these would continue to be adversely affected if the proposal under consideration were to be adopted. Again, that is a very plain statement from the Electoral Commissioner. He further says: The Commission would also reiterate its argument contained in paragraph 8.3.2 of its ""Submission on the Conduct of the 1993 General Election"" of 3 August 1993 that: ""the situation is exacerbated if electors are working (eg mustering) during this election period and miss the consignment of mail in their weekly service"". Again the relevant issue is the frequency of the mail service to the elector, rather than the location of the residence in relation to the nearest polling place. He also says: The imposition of an arbitrary 100 kilometre distance of residence from a polling place as the determining factor in whether registered general postal voters in remote areas automatically receive ballot papers would also be likely to add to elector confusion between federal and State voting procedures. No State or Territory legislation includes any similar provision. At the end of the submission he makes another very telling statement that is worth recording: The Committee might also consider extending the automatic issue of ballot papers to all registered general postal voters, not only to those in remote areas. The Commission would support such a proposal as it would assist in providing an improved level of service to all registered general postal voters and remove, in the majority of States, possible voter confusion caused by different federal and State electoral procedures. From an administrative viewpoint, there would no longer be the need for the current double-handling process of issuing a postal vote application followed by a postal vote certificate when the required declarations have already been made in applying for general postal voter status. The adoption of such a proposal would also achieve estimated savings of around $40,000 in the overall cost of an election. If the Minister for Administrative Services, who is at the table, would like to save the taxpayers of Australia $40,000, the Australian Electoral Commissioner has documented a simple solution whereby the system in Ausdependtralia can be uniform and simple while maintaining its great integrity.",54
47,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,But will he?,56
48,Mr COBB,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Well, will he? We will see when it comes to the vote. I have my doubts electors indeed because he does not seem",56
49,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,I saw him nodding.,57
50,Mr COBB,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"It will be interesting if he does comment. Finally, on this point, I might just read the relevant part from page 87 of the New South Wales Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act 1912. It says in section 114AB under 'Dispatch of ballot-papers to registered postal voters': A returning officer for a district shall, as soon as practicable after the issue of the writ for an election to be held in the district, deliver or post to each elector who is, on that day, a registered general postal voter for a subdivision of the district: (a) a postal vote certificate printed on lope addressed to the returning officer; and (b) one postal ballot-paper for election, or one postal ballot-paper for an Assembly general election or by-election, or both, as the case requires. That is all that needs to be inserted in the It is very simple indeed. It works in every other state perfectly well and it should working here federally. As the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) said, the minister at table should take up the suggestion. In the short time remaining to me I would just like to mention three or four other things briefly. The minimum election period in country at present stands Cit 33 days, and the Australian Labor Party in its submission this year said. that this should be reduced by nine days to 24 days. Of course, the Australian Electoral Commission picked up immediately what the Labor Party was up to when it put in that submission, and commented that if this were implemented many postal voters would be disenfranchised, especially overseas postal voters and remote postal voters.",57
51,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,That's what the government would want.,57
52,Mr COBB,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"That is what the government wants, of course, because it is not interested in everybody getting a fair go. The government wants the system to favour the Labor Party. On that very point the Labor majority on the committee recommended that the minimum election period be reduced from 33 days to 28 days, which was totally unacceptable to us on the other side, and we put in a dissenting report accordingly. The government members on this committee also recommended that prisoners be extended the vote. The system in Australia at the moment is such that those under sentence for an offence punishable for five years or more are not allowed to vote. The Australian Labor Party wants to abolish that, which means that murderers, child molesters and those sorts of people",57
53,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,But not rural people.,57
54,Mr COBB,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Yes-the Labor Party wants to give murderers, child molesters and people like that the vote, but not people who live in an enveremote areas. Labor has a strange sense of priorities. It is something that I, for one, a periodic Council oppose totally. Another matter that was raised earlier by the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) was that of electoral employees over the age of 65 act. not being allowed to work at polling booths in future. That is a ridiculous proposal. It has be occurred because the Australian Electoral Commission received advice from the Human the Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that it cannot employ persons who are 65 years of age or over because they will not be covered by the Commonwealth Safety Rehathis bilitation and Compensation Act 1988. My respon-e is to change the act. That is the solution. These people are doing a simple job which they can handle. It is not as though they are lifting bags of wheat and carting them up a ladder to the top of a silo. All they are doing is marking people's names off a list. We are taking people out of the system who have served the system faithfully over the years, and we are losing their experience. I have a letter here from a constituent of my electorate, Mrs Neta Edson from Narromine-a very fine lady. She says: Dear Sir, For some years I have been employed on election day. I would like to continue & do not feel my age should exclude me. I am engaged in many community activities but voting day is my only paid work. Is it possible for you to intervene in this matter for me please? A photocopy of the letter from the electoral commission is enclosed. Trusting you can assist in this matter. Good luck. Yours sincerely, Mrs Neta Edson. That is typical of the complaints we are receiving. I hope the minister at the table will . take this into consideration. Lastly, I want to make some brief comments about multiple voting. This is often raised by people who are concerned about the integrity of the electoral system. The extent of multiple voting in Australia, as far as we can detect, is quite low. In 1990-these are the latest figures I have seen-there were 377 people in Australia who voted more than once. If you divide that by the 148 electorates that existed at that time, that is about 2Y2 people in each electorate on average. Nearly all the people who multiple vote only multiple vote twice-not six or 10, let alone 50 or 100, times. I noticed that for the 1993 election in New South Wales, where there are 50 federal electorates, the most multiple votes in anyone electorate were in the electorate of Sydney, where 15 people voted more than once. In my own electorate of Parkes, there were only three. These were the people who admitted to multiple voting. The real figure may be somewhat higher than that. However, there is a fail-safe mechanism in place that ensures that multiple voting cannot mean that a person who received a minority of legal votes was elected, because if there are more multiple votes than there is a winning margin, then the election in that electorate is automatically declared null and void, and the election is held again. (Time expired)",57
55,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The honour-ble member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) was domg so well I was almost inclined to move an extension of time, because I think the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr W-lker) actually appeared to be taking quite senously a number of the matters raised by the honourable member. I hope that the - overn-ent responds positively to the suggestIOns being made by my colleague the honourable. member for Parkes and, indeed, to the suggestIons made by other people on this side of the House. I believe that in a democracyand Australia is a democracy-everybody who is privileged to serve in the Commonwealth parliament ought to seek to make sure that, when an election takes place, the result declared represents the collective will of the Australian electorate. I am very pleased to join with other members in participating in this debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995. As has been said previously, this bill seeks to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and also the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. The bill responds partly to a report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled The report of inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election and matters related thereto. I think it is very wise that in Australia following every federal election we do have a committee representing all sides of politics wh-ch considers the poll and any problems which arose, and makes recommendations for future elections so that any anomalies or any things that have gone wrong can be corrected. But, as so often happens with reports from the parliament, there was a majority report-and the majority is controlled by the Australian Labor Party-and there was a minority report. This bill picks up many of the recommendations of the majority of the committee and I must say that I am somewhat saddened that the government did not pick up the totality of recommendations, including those from the dissenting minority. The bill deals with a very large number of matters and, as has been indicated by prior opposition speakers, the coalition does not oppose the many amendments to the bill, as most of them are non-controversial.",58
56,Mr COBB,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,Eighty-six!,58
57,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"There are 86 in all. The government constantly brings in bills to amend acts of parliament. It is a pity that the government does not consider more thoroughly what ought to be the law before bringing bills into this place. Then we would not be in the situation gf having to amend and reamend legislation time after time. As I said, most of these 86 amendments are non-controversial. Some of them are being politically correct. For instance, gender specific language is being removed. I think that it is fairly tragic that the time of the parliament is taken up so often with such relatively minor matters. We also notice that the parliament is even being asked to remove the hyphen from words such as de-registered, de-registration, de-registering and de-register, wherever occurring. But among the major provisions of the bill are those designed to ensure that the personal details of silent electors will not be disclosed to persons inspecting applications for postal votes. While the legislation currently provides that the address of a silent enrolment voter be removed from the postal vote application before being made available for inspection, there is other information such as phone number, postal address and witness's name and address on the application, all of which could help identify the elector's address and particulars. The bill also seeks to improve the enrolment objection process by allowing relatives and friends of electors of unsound mind who do not live in the same subdivision as those electors to apply for their removal from the roll on medical advice and without the payment of an objection fee. Section 118(4) of the Electoral Act provides that such an objection must be accompanied by a certificate issued by a medical practitioner which states that in the practitioner's opinion the elector of unsound mind and cannot understand the nature and significance of enrolment and voting. Under the act, a challenged elector may answer an objection. The bill also seeks to allow for electors whose enrolment has been objected to to be removed from the roll in the period between the issue of the writ for an election and the close of rolls. This will help to ensure that only electors entitled to vote are in fact able to vote on polling day. The amendments also seek to allow the Australian Electoral Commission to use a more up-to-date method of scrutiny printing of ballot papers for referenda and elections, instead of using watermarked ballot papers, which will result in considerable savings in ballot paper storage and production costs. Obviously the coalition does not oppose this, as indeed we do not oppose many other amendments being suggested. The bill also seeks to disallow canvassing in and around hospitals that are polling places on polling day and in special hospitals during the five days before and including polling day. Special hospitals are hospitals declared by notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette as covered by section 225 of the act, and they include convalescent homes and similar institutions. Perhaps the government ought to consider issuing a clarification on just what is indeed the polling place. Is it the entire hospital, is it the grounds in which the hospital is situated, or is it indeed the hall or the part of the hospital where the voting actually takes place? In many cases we have hospitals, we have hostels, we have nursing homes and we have independent retirement units all in the same complex. There have been some questions raised as to whether candidates are able to enter other parts of the premises, other than what we would all consider to be the polling place. I must say that obviously it is not the intention of the government or indeed the act to prevent electors in their homes from being canvassed for votes. But I think that the government ought to clarify what it means by a polling place and what is a definition of a hospital as there has been some ambiguity and some angst caused at election time is because we have had varying interpretations decided at the local level. The bill quite sensibly seeks to extend the right to vote in elections to all divisional returning officers and Australian electoral officers and standardise the method of resolving ties during the counting of votes. I think that this is a sensible proposal which is designed to recognise that electoral officers are indeed members of the community, are indeed voters and that they have the same interests as do other people in the community in the outcome of an election. The bill also seeks to extend the two-candidate preferred count as conducted in polling places on polling night to the fresh scrutiny and declaration vote scrutinies as conducted later by the divisional returning officers. A two-candidate preferred count will be applied to declaration vote scrutinies in all electorates. In the 1993 election the two-candidate preferred count was applied to scrutiny of the declaration vote only in those electorates that were identified as close at the end of counting on election night. The bill also goes on to ensure that posters and car stickers are included in those forms of advertising which require authorisation. Whilst Imust say that many people who see cars drive by would not have the quality of eyesight necessary to identify an authorisation on a car sticker on a moving motor vehicle, my understanding is that the government has said that car stickers are often placed on items other than motor vehicles and that therefore it would be wise to include the authorisation. The bill also seeks to provide that letters to an editor of a newspaper are exempt from the full requirements of the authorisation provisions in elections and referenda. Only the author's name and suburb or locality are to be shown. This amendment is made to address the security and privacy problems which currently exist as a result of the requirement for full address details to be shown. The bill also seeks to abolish the obligation for the Australian Electoral Commission to advertise in two newspapers in a state' or territory the receipt and particulars of the writ for the election of members of the House of Representatives or the Senate, or for a referendum, as well as notices relating to redistributions and mini-redistributions. Following the bill becoming law, if indeed it does, it is proposed that such notices be published in only one newspaper in a state or territory. It has been foreshadowed that the coalition will, in another place, move a number of amendments to this particular legislation and my colleagues, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and the honourable member for Parkes, have made clear their concern over the situation concerning the position of general postal voters. The honourable member for Parkes has pointed out that only a very small number of voters in Australia are included in this category. And as I interjected, I saw the minister nodding in an optimistic way at the comments made by the honourable member for Parkes. I think that in the interest of equity and fairness the government ought to pick up this proposed amendment and from the minister's positive response one would hope that indeed this has happened. I think that in a democracy it is totally unacceptable that people should be denied the opportunity of having their vote counted simply because of bureaucracy or simply because of infrequent mail services. I am pleased that the minister is likely to pick up the recommendation made by the honourable member for Parkes and, indeed, previously by the honourable member for Kennedy. It has also been indicated that the coalition will move to end. age discrimination against Australian Electoral Commission employees over the age of 65. I think this is an appropriate course of action on a couple of accounts. One, of course, is that we really, as a nation, ought to recognise the rights of all sectors in the community, regardless of their socio-economic position, regardless of gender, regardless of ethnic origin and certainly regardless of age. The government would claim to be strong in supporting people of ethnic origin. It also claims to have a good record in relation to gender equity, although that record is open to question. But by not having indicated at this stage that it will accept our amendments, the government is taking an ageist approach to those Australians over the age of 65. The government is saying, 'If you are over the age of 65, we are going to throw you on the scrap heap. We do not think that you are fit to cross off names on an electoral roll at election time-' If the government dissents from what I am saying, it has the capacity to accept this very sensible amendment. I do not think that the amendment will disadvantage anyone, but it will benefit Australians who in their working lives have helped to make this country the very great society that it is. We will move an amendment allowing political parties, and members and senators, access to the gender of electors. We will also seek to amend the provision 'where the government is imposing a requirement for an advertisement only in one newspaper, because in those areas where there are two newspapers, people do not necessarily always buy two. People who are in a major centre of population that has two newspapers ought to have easy and prompt access to the information sought to be disseminated by the government through advertisements being placed in both newspapers. It has been said that the health of any democracy, no matter what its title or status, depends on a small technical detail-the conduct of elections-and that everything else is secondary. It ought to be recognised that Australia is one of the world's oldest democracies and those who seek to tear down our constitution really ought to pause for a moment and consider how fortunate we are as a nation to have the freedom, stability and way of life, and the right to elect or throw out a government, which in many parts of the world could only be a dream. However, it is an indictment that the government has not sought, at this stage, to pick up the amendments of the minority of members who helped to contribute to the report on the 1993 election. There are a number of matters which really ought to have been picked up by the government. It has been indicated that there is not lot of evidence of fraud at election time. The member for Parkes has pointed out that there is not a large number of multiple voters. But why would anyone bother to be a multiple voter when the electoral system in this country simply depends on honour? It depends on people doing the right thing. What we really ought to do is to have a situation where people are required to prove an entitlement to vote. At present, anyone who is 18, who is an Australian citizen and who has lived at his or her present address for at least one month is entitled-and, in fact, required-to enrol to vote. No proof of identity, citizenship or residence is required. Come polling day, at the polling booth, the enrollee is only asked whether he or she has voted before for that election. On being told that the person has voted, the Electoral Commission marks the person's name off. No proof of identity is required and there are very few checks in place. Admittedly, the Electoral Commission does, from time to time, do the best it can. It compares enrolment applications against ranges of valid street numbers held on the roll management system. Once every three years, it conducts habitation surveys. But, I repeat, there are no checks on citizenship and age. Following an election, it has an electronic scanning of voter lists to detect multiple voting. I understand that the Electoral Commission does compile lists of those people reported as having died and delete these people from the roll. But we have a situation where any number of nom de plumes could be used to fill in a multiplicity of voting cards. The envelope given to people by the Electoral Commission could be used to send those voting cards off to the electoral office. The person might not exist, the address might not exist, and it would take until the next habitation survey for the commission to determine whether those persons should or should not stay on the roll. It should be borne in mind-as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Newell, would appreciate since you hold a marginal seat-that the last election was determined by about 1,000 to a 1,200 votes in a very small number of electorates right across the country. It is incumbent on us, as members of parliament, to ensure that the result of an election, as declared, is indeed the collective will of the Australian people as determined on polling day. But, unfortunately,because we have this honour system-which basically says to people, 'Please only enrol if you are entitled to,' but which has no real checks and balances-it would be very easy for any ill-intentioned person or party to manipulate the electoral result by putting a large number of noms de plumes, non-existent persons, on the electoral roll in key marginal seats. One does not have to have a very fertile imagination to know that, if these seats were well targeted and well chosen, the election result could be changed and the government not of the country might not be the government which the people of Australia voted for on polling day. That is a major problem. It is a problem which the majority of members of the committee did not seem to think was a difficulty, but it is a problem which was highlighted by the coalition members of the committee. I certainly hope that the government in office or, indeed, a future government, will address this very major problem. We have to emphasise that, as people who. believe in a democracy, we ought to support the principle that on polling day the government that is declared to be elected is indeed the government which the people of Australia want. While it is great to have an honour system, while it is great to assume that everyone in Australia is honourable, honest and decent, it is inadequate to have a situation where one party or the other could have the election result stolen from it through electoral fraud. It has also been suggested that sub-divisional voting ought to be reintroduced. We had sub-divisional voting in Australia until 1984. The government abolished sub-divisional voting for no real reason.· The abolition of sub-divisional voting meant that people who were enrolled on a divisional roll could vote at any one of 40, 50 or 60 polling booths within that division, whether or not they were voting within the subdivision where they currently resided. In country electorates in particular, the electoral staff at the polling booths often knew many of the residents, but the abolition of sub-divisional voting mearit that people could roll up to any number of polling booths and vote, not necessarily in their own name but, if they were involved in electoral fraud, through the placing of noms de plume on the electoral roll, then they could go to 40, 50 or 60 polling booths and vote that. number of times in different names-names which ought not to have been placed on the electoral roll. The infamous section 245 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act deals with compulsory voting. I believe very strongly that in a democracy people have the right to vote. I would certainly defend anyone's right to vote. It could even be argued that people ought to be compelled to enrol to vote but, when it comes to an election, people in. a democracy ought to have the right to vote for one party, or they ought to have the right to vote for another party, or indeed they ought to have the right to abstain from voting altogether if they consider that no particular party is worthy of their support. I am sorry that the government has chosen at this stage not to look at voluntary voting. One ought to appreciate that Australia is one of the very few countries where compulsory voting is the order of the day. Until 1924, we had voluntary voting in Australia. It is a matter which I, as a member of the Liberal Party of Australia, believe is very important. I believe that it is absolutely vital.",58
58,Mr WALKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,It's Liberal Party policy.,62
59,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I believe we should have voluntary voting. We as a coalition have not yet determined a policy on that matter, but my own view is that we ought to have voluntary voting because we ought to give the people the right to vote fora party, or to vote for another party, or to abstain from voting. As I said at the outset, we are not opposed to most of the amendments being suggested by the government. However, we are sorry that the government has not gone as far as it could have. We are sorry that ·the government has not picked up the recommendations of the dissenting members of the committee. (Time expired)",62
60,Mr WALKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"in reply-I will be as brief as possible in conclusion. I thank all the members who took part in the debate for their contributions, most of which were thoughtful. The member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who led the debate for the coalition, voiced some slight concerns, if I could put it that way. The theme of all the speeches of coalition members concerned general postal votes. As the coalition knows, or should know, there are two electoral bills: the first is the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill and the second will be introduced by me next week. That second bill will take up most of the recommendations in the 1993 report which have not been addressed in this bill. . This bill was introduced in the hope that we might get some important structural changes through without obstructions in the Senate. I hope this bill is passed so that the important changes will be in place at the next election. The second bill, which will be introduced next week, takes up the proposition about general postal votes, and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters agrees with that. There is no dispute about that. As I understand it, there never has been any dispute about it. The memLJer for Bradfield had a few other concerns. He was worried that you might not be able to read authorisation on car stickers. I always understood that the purpose of authorisation was to prosecute offenders, not to read the name of the authoriser. In any case, authorisation will be on this sort· of material in future. The opposition is concerned about the nondelivery of penalty notices. These are very difficult practical problems associated with the post generally around the country. In some places it is absolutely necessary to deliver things by hand. That is a reality which, whether we like it or not, has to be faced by the Australian Electoral Commission. The opposition apparently wants to move a motion enabling elections to be advertised in two national newspapers as opposed to one. We think that is a waste of money. That is why we are going down to one. Obviously, the newspapers have been lobbying about this. There is not any great deal of money involved in it; it is a small sum of money around the country. But, apparently, it is important to some newspapers that they get the advertisement. Age discrimination has been raised. It has nothing to do with election law or the bill. The Australian Electoral Commission is an independent body. It is. not subject to the direction or control of me as minister or the government. It is independent. It has made a decision based on legal advice that it has received; that is, if it employs people over the age of 65 years who are not subject to workers compensation of the federal sort, then it in serious difficulty. That advice is absolutely correct. Obviously, the problem lies not with the Electoral Commission, which should not be abused by the opposition in this regard; the problem lies with the federal act that does not give compensation to people in this regard. It is a matter not for this particular portfolio but for another portfolio. I understand a review of this problem is being dealt with. It really is wrong to criticise the Australian Electoral Commission in this regard. A lot of people in my electorate are complaining about not being able to work on polling booths, and I understand their problem. But, as I said, it is wrong to be critical of the Electoral Commission in this regard. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) had a lot to say. His contribution ranged from the results of the New South Wales election to the republic and the opposition's lack of policy in that regard. He and various other speakers, including the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), were concerned about· compulsory voting. The big issue, as they saw it, was that we should abolish compulsory voting in this country. I know there is a group of people within the coalition parties that are probably closely aligned with organisations such as the League of Rights and that are campaigning actively against compulsory voting. Senator Minchin has been very active in this regard. But I remind the House that when Senator Minchin came out demanding the abolition of compulsory voting he was very quickly brought to heel by his leader, who pointed out to the people of Australia that Senator Minchin, the honourable members for Parkes, Maranoa l!nd Kennedy and others are certainly not speaking for the coalition when they make these calls. That is not the policy of the coalition. It is certainly a very un-Australian policy. We have had an excellent system for many years, and the government has no intention of changing it. Those who would listen to this nonsense about non-compulsory voting ought to read----'I is recommend them to it-.a wonderful Electoral Commission publication called The people's say, which has recently been launched. In it is the case for compulsory voting brilliantly put, if I might say so, by a Mr Chris Puplick, who sets out in great detail why compulsory voting is absolutely essential. I recommend that all members of the opposition read what Chris Puplick has to say about that, absorb the truths he has enunciated in this publication, listen to their leader, stop raising these furphies and stop associating, I might add, as Senator Minchin did, with the League of Rights. He stood up on a public platform and joined with those ultra-fascist, Nazi-like people in trying to bring down our democratic system. Compulsory voting is one of the key elements of democracy in this country and it should stay that way. The honourable member for Curtin had a lot to say about democracy in the Senate. I thought he disproved his own case when he pointed out that 27,000 Tasmanians can elect a senator while it takes 318,000 New South Welsh persons to elect a senator-a difference of six to one. I think that answers the question about democracy in the Senate. It certainly is an unrepresentative chamber, its constitution lacking in the essential principles of democracy. There are no present proposals to reform it, but there are a lot of people, certainly within my party, that would like to see it reformed to be a more democratic chamber. Perhaps if it were more democratically elected it might actually deal with a bit of legislation occasionally so that we would not be having these huge logjams that are currently developing in this place. In any event, the fact of the matter is that the honourable member for Curtin has disproved his own case in that regard. I thank the coalition for supporting the various provisions here and I look forward to debating the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No.2). Mr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I claim to have been maligned by the honourable gentleman who has just spoken. He said that I was in favour of",62

As for associations with various organisations, clearly he is as misguided on that as he is on what I said in my speech. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 19 June. Second Reading Mr LA V ARCH (Dickson-Attorney General) (2.12 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to implement some of the recommendations made in the initial report of the joint review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. On 17 August 1993, I announced in the context of the 1993-94 budget that my department, the Department of Finance and HREOC would jointly conduct a review of the role and functions and the efficiency and effectiveness of HREOC. It was appropriate to have such a review as the workload of HREOC had broadened since its establishment in 1986. An initial report was finalised so that the need for legislative amendment could be considered prior to the appointment of a new human rights commissioner. The review is examining the appropriate role and function of HREOC and addresses the appropriate structure and operating arrangements for the commission and commissioners in the future, taking into account the efficiency and effectiveness of the commission's performance of its work to date and the performance of the commission to date in relation to financial and resource management. The initial report examined and made recommendations on resource utilisation, corporate performance and the structure of HREOC. The supplementary report which is still in preparation will deal with three key interrelated issues of cooperative arrangements, complaint handling procedures and possible consolidation of the legislation into one act, including plain English drafting. The supplementary report will also contain a new enforcement mechanism for HREOC determinations following the High Court's decision in Brandy v. HREOC. The initial report recognised HREOC's unique role and structure and made a number of recommendations bringing into line various functions of the commission. These have been accepted and given full effect to in this bill. The key amendments to the HREOC Act provide that the responsibility for the management of the commission is vested in the commission as a body corporate with chief executive officer powers to be delegated by it to an executive director appointed by the commISSIOn under the Public Service Act. This means that all the powers of a secretary under the Public Service Act will be removed from the human rights commissioner and settled upon the president and commissioners collectively.! would like to emphasise the importance of this first step in enhancing the commission's structure to enable the commission to properly assume responsibility for corporate functions and to encourage commissioriers to act in a collegiate manner in the spirit of promoting the indivisibility and universality of all human rights. The bill also amends subsection 19(3) of the HREOC Act. This will allow the President of the commission to delegate, all or any of his powers under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 or the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 to a member of the commission or a person who holds an appointment under subsection 24F(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act, subsection 57A(l) of the Sex Discrimination Act or subsection 77(1) of the Disability Discrimination Act. The bill also contains amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Privacy Act 1988. These were necessitated by the decision of the High Court on 23 February 1995 in Brandy v. HREOC. In its decision the High Court ruled constitutionally invalid the enforcement mechanism in place since early 1993 for determinations of discrimination made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. This decision affected all determinations made by the commission since 1993 other than those where the respondent was a Commonwealth agency. The mechanism for the enforcement of determinations made under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Privacy Act 1988 is similar to that used in the Racial Discrimination Act and, hence, is also invalid on the basis of the High Court's decision. The regime which was ruled invalid was incorporated into the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992 and the Privacy Act in 1993. As a consequence of the High Court's decision, there is currently no way of enforcing the determinations of the commission. I must emphasise that determinations which were made before the invalidated regime commenced are unaffected by the decision as are determinations in which a Commonwealth agency was the respondent. To ensure that the victims of discrimination are assured of continued protection, the government has acted swiftly to secure the authority and credibility of the commission. The amendments will reinstate the procedure for the enforcement of determinations made by the Commission which operated prior to the enactment of the invalidated scheme. This reinstated scheme will operate as an interim measure, pending the development of a new mechanism to determine complaints of discrimination that meets the constitutional constraints and is as affordable, accessible and effective as possible. The review which has been examining the operations of the commission for sometime has been expanded in membership and asked to develop options for the enforcement of the commission's determinations. The report resulting from this review is due shortly. There are not thousands of cases affected by the High Court's decision as has been reported. The vast majority of complaints made to the commission are resolved by conciliation, and the commission has advised the government that only some 37 matters have proceeded to a determination in favour of the complainant since the invalid enforcement process took effect in early 1993. In relation to these matters, the amendments make provision for complainants or HREOC to seek a rehearing in the Federal Court to obtain an enforceable determination. Respondents can also seek a review of that determination by the Federal Court if they are not happy with the outcome. I commend this bill to the House.",66
75,Mr RUDDOCK,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"I was fascinated by the second reading speech given by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in this matter. I wondered how the government would hide its embarrassment over the real reason for this Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. Therefore, it was interesting to note that the second reading speech started off by suggesting that, really, the principal purpose in relation to this matter was to implement recommendations arising from the initial report of the joint review into the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Then, almost as an afterthought, it was mentioned that the legislation contains amendments dealing with the matters arising out of the Brandy decision. The principal matter that we are dealing with really is the correction of a major blunder made by the government because it desired to structure legislation in a particular form. I think the decision of the High Court in Brandy v. the Human Rights and Equal . Opportunity Commission has clearly demonstrated that the government misunderstoodand that would be putting it generously-the nature of the body that we are looking at and the way in which it should function. The fact is that in 1992-93 the government made amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act as well as the Privacy Act to streamline the enforcement of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission determinations. As a result of the Brandy decision, the procedures that were put in place are constitutionally invalid on the basis that the amendments vested judicial power in a non-judicial body-namely, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This is contrary to chapter III of the constitution. The review committee, already examining the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's procedures, has been asked by the government to consider valid enforcement options and to report to the government in three months. These amendments are to provide an interim solution by reverting to the cumbersome pre-1992 procedures-that is, the government saw them to be cumbersome. They will also facilitate the Federal Court determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission determinations made under the invalid procedures. The amendments amend each of the relative acts to return to the pre-1992 scheme. They provide that, if a respondent does not comply with a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, an action can be brought in the Federal Court. The Federal Court must hear the matter by way of a complete rehearing. The amendments also relate to determinations made during the period of the operation of the unconstitutional procedures. They provide that parties to such determinations may recommence proceedings in the Federal Court. Again, such hearings are by way of complete rehearing. The parties to Federal Court proceedings, both in reSpect of future and past determinations, may apply to the Attorney-General for financial assistance. The amendments contain an additional miscellaneous amendment to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 relating to the delegation of the president's power. Currently, internal reviews of decisions conducted by the president of the commission, and the workload is proving excessive part-time presidential appointment. The amendment would permit internal reviews to be conducted by other commissioners or one to say: of the part-time hearing commissioners which are appointed. These part-time commissioners will come from the ranks of retired Queen's Counsels, judges and academics. These amendments provide an interim solution and, in that sense, are not objectionPrivacy able per se. Given, however, that the government has long been forewarned of the likely invalidity of this scheme, it must be asked why consideration of a more permanent solution was not undertaken earlier. The coalition was invariably cooperative in relation to these matters and did not directly oppose the legislative amendments brought forward by the government. These are very sensitive areas. Every time we raise objections, we are characterised in ways which I think are often unkind. People use derisive terms to describe those who raise objections to these matters. You are characterised as being racist or sexist if you oppose or raise concerns about legislation in this area. A great deal of sensitivity is needed. We do not want to give any credence to the view that we have any other agenda on these matters, so invariably we try to be cooperative, but we did raise concerns at that time about the potential constitutional uncertainty. A number of my colleagues who have been shadow Attorney-General did so. I think it is appropriate to look at what some of them had to say. In 1992, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), when he was the shadow Attorney-General, said this in a debate relating to this matter: . .. we have no enforceable orders in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission because of the separation of the judicial and non-judicial power. Whether this proposal gets around it is an open question. I foreshadow that there will be an open argument at one point on the constitutionality of that provision. If it is unconstitutional, the Opposition will not support it but, until it is declared to be unconstitutional, we will assume it is valid and we will support it. In the 1993 amendments which applied the are mechanism to determinations under the Privacy Act-which similarly were not opfor a posed-our disqnguished colleague and former shadow Attorney-General, the member for Tangney, Mr Daryl Williams QC, had this . .. these provisions ... may fall foul of the constitution with respect to the separation of judicial and non-judicial power. However; the opposition recognises that these procedures provide a more straightforward method of enforcement and review than those presently contained in the Act. Consistent with its position with respect to the other legislation mentioned, the opposition will not oppose these measures. Although we did not oppose the government's measures, we certainly gave the government a very clear warning that our expectation was that there were potential difficulties with the provisions that the government had brought forward. These matters were also dealt with by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Senators Vanstonenow the shadow Attorney-General-Kemp and O'Chee dissented from the majority recommendation that was ultimately taken up by the government. My colleagues then recommended that, where conciliation was unsuccessful in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the matter should be referred directly to the Federal Court rather than allowing the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to make an unenforceable determination. The likely invalidity of the procedures has also been raised by legal commentators. As noted by AJ.H. Morris QC in an article that appeared in the Australian Law Journal in March 1994: In taking [the] risk [that the legislation is Government is gambling with the money and emotional well-being of those citizens most deserving of its protection: namely the innocent victims of unlawful discrimination. It is difficult to conceive of any more urgent instance calling for prompt legislative intervention. Even after the legislation had been passed, the government was being warned by distinguished commentators that it was on a difficult path. So it. is surprising that, in this sensitive area where there are so many determinations and where the Attorney-General has tried to suggest that there are limitations on the potential number of cases involved, there are individuals who had important claims who have been 'affected as a result of this decision. The situation is that those matters will have to be put right as a result of the amendments that are now being instituted through this bill and the new procedures that are being put in place. The Brandy decision does raise the question of the quality of the government's constitutional advice. The government's Chief General Counsel, Dennis Rose, had provided advice that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission mechanism proposed here was constitutional and, obviously, we now know that it was not. Brandy is but one in a series of cases in which the High Court has ruled that this Labor government's legislation is unconstitutional. While I do not have an exhaustive list of Labor legislation that has been found unconstitutional, it is particularly germane to note that we have seen it in the Copyright Amendment Act 1989, the Migration Amendment Act 1987, the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991, the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the Corporations Act 1989 and the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. So it is clear from the government's record on these matters that either the government is going to have to address the quality of its advice or, if the advice is always sound and the government is acting without the benefit of its advisers' views, the government should be held. more directly accountable in these matters. It may be that in the Political Broadcasts. and Political Disclosures Act that the valid], the government had been counselled against trying to interfere with freedom of speech and that it was a political agenda that was being pursued. Nevertheless, the fact is that we have this . very poor record. This case raises it again. I noticed that the Attorney-General, who left when I tried to put these matters in context, feels very sensitive about it, and well he should. Th-e Attorney-General is one of the ministers who have special responsibilities not only as parliamentarians but as office holders. It is a significant matter, when there is important legislation in the area that directly reflects upon him, that there is this clear and abundant evidence that the legislation is being found unconstitutional. It is a very significant matter and it cannot be allowed to pass without comment. Having commented, let me make it clear that, in going back to the pre1992 position, we will not be opposing this bill, but we will continue to draw attention to the difficulties the government faces with the amendments that it proposed previously that were found so wanting. . Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (2.32 p.m.)-It is my pleasure to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) not discussing the wider issues involved in this bill but choosing to talk about what he considered to be the difficulties in the Attorney-General's Department about advice that had been given and so forth. This is not entirely unexpected from the member for Berowra, but I would have thought he would have taken this opportunity to say something about the opposition's views on all the issues which this legislation deals within particular, racial discrimination and disability discrimination. Obviously, in my responsibilities as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister I have a significant role in the implementation of the government's access and equity program. Naturally, the issue of discrimination, especially discrimination based on race or culture, is a very important matter. While we have made progress in Australia on that matter, it is true to say that there are still problems. Last year, on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I conducted 18 consultations around the nation with a range of ethnic community representatives and people working with migrant and ethnic communities, as well as some Aboriginal representatives, in order to detect what problems exist in access and equity. One of the issues that did come up was continuing discrimination. Obviously, this matter needs to be resolved. Mr Ruddock-This is under your government.",68
76,Dr THEOPHANOUS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,The honourable member does not wish to take these issues seriously. Mr Ruddock-I do take them seriously ,71
77,Dr THEOPHANOUS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"You take very little seriously. What I am explaining to the House is that this issue involves changes in not only laws but also attitudes and approaches of people. It involves a cultural transformation. We need to look at ways in which we' can change the culture of people who still wish to discriminate against other persons on the basis of race, colour, descent or national ethnic origin. It is worth looking at the definition of racial discrimination in the act. The act describes racial discrimination as: ... discrimination, exclusion, restriction or ence based on race, colour, descent or national ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultUFal or any other field of public life. That is a very important definition, because it contains certain key elements, such as the notion that rights extend beyond just political rights to also cover economic, social and cultural rights. This means that, in relation to those rights, people have the right to be treated equally irrespective of their background, culture, race or colour. Given that aspect of the matter, this is obviously a very important bill because it now seeks to reinforce the human rights legislation, which, unfortunately, was watered down---or, at least, potentially watered down-as a result of the High Court's ruling in Brandy v. HREOC earlier this year. It is very important that we as a nation have strong anti-discrimination legislation and strong human rights legislation for a number of reasons. In terms of our international reputation, we are a nation which is proud of the leadership it takes in democratic ideals. The notion of fundamental human rights is central to democratic ideals. We cannot have a situation in which we claim to be a democracy and believe in democracy without reinforcing those democratic ideals, including those fundamental human rights. If something happens, such as a court case or anything else, which may lead to a watering down or a potential watering down of the intentions of the government in relation to these anti-discrimination laws, the government must act to reinforce the laws and its intentions in relation to discrimination. As I said, the honourable member for Berowra tried to make something of this. We in the government are not in the business of trying to pretend that there are no problems in society. The consultations to which I referred detected that, while progress has been made in this nation and we have become a much more tolerant and understanding nation, there are still situations of discrimination. preferTherefore, it is incumbent on us as a nation and as a government to deal with these issues. Rather than pretending that the problem does not exist, or that we live in some sort of utopia rather than in a situation in which there are still continuing problems we have to face, we are honest about recognising those problems and tackling them. This is also true in the case of racial discrimination. Labor governments have been at the forefront on this issue. The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 was introduced by the Whitlam Labor government. It was considered a revolutionary act. It was one of the few acts of its kind internationally. It has had a very significant impact because it has paved the way for Australia to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. That act has reinforced our policy of multiculturalism, especially in terms of its contribution to educating our people about the need for tolerance and the need for the understanding of people of different races and different cultures. That greater awareness and tolerance have been reflected in the development of multiculturalism as a philosophy and a social policy in our society. As everyone knows, this year Australia hosted the major United Nations conference on global diversity. In a sense, it was a celebration of Australia's achievements in this area. In many ways, we have become a model for many other countries. All of those achievements have been made in the context of sensible legislation such as the Racial Discrimination Act. Those acts are very important in keeping up the momentum that multiculturalism as a philosophy has given and in keeping up the momentum of achieving a fairer and more equal society. The honourable member for Berowra tended to suggest that all the work in the area of access and equity and anti-discrimination is finished. That is wrong.  last 10 years?",71
78,Dr THEOPHANOUS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"We have done a lot. The honourable member for Forrest challenges me to say what we have done. Until the Labor government was elected, the concept of multiculturalism had no social dimension to it. It was simply thought of as tolerance of alternative cultures. It was not thought of in terms of achieving equity in social areas. The access and equity policy, which was introduced nearly 10 years ago, has been reinforced and made stronger by a series of key determinations such as the 1989 national agenda for multicultural Australia, the 1992 revision of the access and equity policy and the 1994 annual report to the parliament on access and equity. All of those different milestones have been extremely significant in strengthening our commitment and in getting real outcomes. We are systematically trying to identify areas where discrimination may exist either directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally. We have been able to pick up areas where there may be disadvantages for particular groups of ethnic people or for particular groups of Aboriginal people and target programs to assist those groups. We are working on programs in the areas of employment, housing, health, aged care, education and law reform-a whole range of areas where we are taking very seriously the importance of reinforcing egalitarian principles. This legislation is a cornerstone to our continuing to achieve those results. Without legislation such as this, we would not be in a position to continue to achieve those aims. It is very interesting that the honourable member for Berowra and the opposition generally· have such an ambivalent attitude and have had such an ambivalent attitude over the years to the key policies involved-human rights and the support of a multicultural agenda. Over the years we have seen huge fights within the opposition parties about their position on these policies. Only this week the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was praising Australia for being such a tolerant society when dealing with the Yugoslav crisis, for example. In 1988 he said that multiculturalism was a highly divisive policy and should be abandoned. That is only one example. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is on the record many times calling for either a re-evaluation or an overthrow of the policy of multiculturalism. Therefore, it is not unexpected that, whenever the opposition parties are brought to task in relation to issues such as racial discrimination, they run away. Let me give the latest example. Currently we have a situation in which the Racial Hatred Bill, which has passed through this House, is now not being considered in the Senate. That bill, which seeks to protect groups and individuals from the worse form of racial discrimination-that which advocates violence and other gross acts against as-and which is intended to reinforce our reputation as a nation that will not tolerate racial hatred, is stuck in the Senate because of the position of the opposition parties. The reality is that the opposition is not interested in achieving real outcomes in terms of issues involving discrimination. That includes the Racial Hatred Bill.  urgent list?",72
79,Dr THEOPHANOUS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,Obviously because we have a lot of legislation to get through the Senate which we know will get through. Those opposite have made their position perfectly clear: they are opposed to that bill. So we are not going to put up legislation that we know they will defeat and when we know they have done deals with other parties to defeat that legislation.  deal.,73
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,Mr Vaile)Order! The parliamentary secretary has the call.,73
81,Dr THEOPHANOUS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"The ethnic communities of this country will not put up with the opposition's attitudes to the Racial Hatred and its total hypocrisy when it comes to multicultural matters. Those opposite are very happy about talking about multiculturalism in terms of a vague slogan but, whenever there is in this House a bill or a measure that will get rid of discrimination or do something about things like racial hatred, they always oppose it. That is their record. The ethnic communities know that. Those opposite will pay a big price at the election on this matter. I am appalled at the filibustering and other actions that have taken place on this bill. We will continue-the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has made this point and I repeat it on his behalf-to press for a successful outcome on this matter. The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill is part of a package of measures. The Racial Hatred Bill is a further bill on those measures. We are pleased that the opposition will not oppose the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, but we are still concerned about its individu- attitude regarding racial hatred. Some of the Liberal state governments have put on the books legislation similar to the Commonwealth legislation; yet we have this ludicrous situation where the opposition parties seem to always be far behind-just as they are on the republic issue, for examplethe positions of even their own state colleagues. Never mind the federal position, which should be one of leadership. Here we have a failure of leadership on the part of the opposition. That point can be made in this area and others. I want to conclude by saying something about the importance of these measures in the area of social justice. We have heard a bit from the opposition about battlers and the need to do something about people who are in a difficult situation. But one of the things that is most important for people who are in a difficult situation is the issue of ensuring that there is justice for them. Whether the discrimination is based on race, gender, disability or whatever, it must be overcome if we are to be a socially just society. In that sense, we cannot be picking and choosing and saying, 'We'll support these measures but we'll oppose those measures.' Bill Social justice measures and human rights measures are very important in any nation which is proud of both a national record and an international record. Therefore, I am very pleased to support this bill. I congratulate the Attorney-General for bringing forward this bill to the parliament. I repeat that I am very concerned about the shameful actions of the coalition in its continuing opposition to the Racial Hatred Bill. Although the coalition is supporting this legislation, its main spokesperson on the matter had nothing to say about the fundamental principles involved here-that is, the principles of anti-discrimination. All he could do was criticise the Attorney-General for some problem in the original drafting of the legislation which the court brought out rather than take advantage of the opportunity to reaffirm, on behalf of the opposition, the principles having to do with overcoming discrimination and with supporting the Racial Discrimination Act and the other acts. It is good that members of the opposition are supporting this human rights legislation, but we need a consistent approach from them on issues such as the Racial Hatred Bill. We do not want a situation where we have to fight these battles over and over again. I was in this parliament when four members of the opposition crossed the floor on a question of immigration and non-discrimination in immigration policy. (Time expired)",73
82,Mr WILLIAMS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"I rise to make my contribution to this debate which, notwithstanding what the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) has said, is on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. It is scarcely credible that reached this stage in the House at this time in its present form. The cause of my incredulity will soon become apparent when I explain to the House the history of the events relating to the introduction of the bill to this place. On 10 December 1981, the Human Rights Commission was created under the provisions of the Commonwealth Human Rights Commission Act 1981. The act was prompted by the need to implement Australia's international obligations under several international human rights instruments to which we were a party. The Human Rights Commission was empowered to handle complaints, to review legislation and to conduct educational, promotional and research programs in relation to the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations declarations dealing with the rights of the child, of mentally retarded persons and of disabled persons. The Human Rights Commission Act included a sunset clause that had the effect of disbanding the commission on 9 December 1986. To replace the defunct commission, the parliament enacted the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. That act came into effect on 10 December 1986, the day after the previous act sunsetted, and created the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission giving it functions that were similar in most respects to those of the Human Rights Commission. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, HREOC, is a vehicle for expressing Australia's commitment to fulfilling its international obligations with respect to human rights through complaint handling and education, promotion and policy formulation. HREOC is a body corporate and consists of a part-time president, a human rights commissioner, the Race Discrimination Commissioner, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the Privacy Commissioner and the Disability Discrimination Commissioner. Each is appointed under a separate act of parliament. The Human Rights Commissioner is the only member required to the bill has have legal qualifications. Under the legislation that was in force for some six years from 1986, the determinations of HREOC were not legally binding. It was necessary for enforcement proceedings to be taken in the Federal Court. Those proceedings were in the form of a fresh hearing, in which evidence was heard and the complaint tried as if it were being brought for the first time. This was a recognition that the commission was not able to make binding, enforceable determinations in matters brought before it. To do so would be purporting to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. The Australian constitution provides that only a federal court constituted as such by the Commonwealth parliament can exercise Commonwealth judicial power. The commission is clearly not a federal court. On 13 March 1990, one John Bell lodged a complaint against the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission with the commission alleging that one Harry Brandy had acted in a way that was in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. Both Brandy and Bell were officers of ATSIC. HREOC then held an inquiry into the subject of the complaint. It was not until 22 December 1993 that the commission made a determination in Mr Bell's favour. By this time, the relevant human rights legislation had been the subject of a reference to a Senate committee and had in consequence been amended. On 21 December 1990, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was given a reference to consider the mechanisms available to parties dissatisfied with HREOC determinations. The Senate committee was to consider whether, in view of the constitutional limitations, less costly alternative procedures could be developed. The Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department made a submission to the committee, the content of which showed that the department was alive to the problem of HREOC's inability to make binding determinations. In its submission dated July 1991, the department stated: There is no doubt that the power to decide whether alleged conduct in breach of the [Racial Discrimination Act] or [the Sex Discrimination Act] has taken place, and the power to award damages or make restraining orders, are judicial powers properly given to the Federal Court. These powers could be given without the need for any prior hearings by the Commission, the functions of which could be limited to conciliation. Clearly, then, as long ago as July 1991 the Attorney-General's Department was well aware that any exercise by HREOC of judicial power in its functions would be unconstitutional and therefore invalid. The Senate committee published its report entitled Review of determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Privacy Commissioner in November 1992. The so-called majority report was endorsed by four of the eight senators on the committee and a dissenting report was presented by the remaining four senators. The principal recommendation of the majority report was that the legislation be amended to allow a party to a complaint determined by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the Privacy Commissioner to register the decision in the Federal Court. After a period of time elapsed the terms of the decision were to become an order of the court with provision for another party to the proceedings to have the matter reviewed by the court. However, in their dissenting report, Senators Vanstone, Kemp, O'Chee and Walsh-the first three being coalition senators and the fourth a Labor senator-said: The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Privacy Commissioner should have power to inquire into alleged breaches of the legislation and, wherever possible, to endeavour by conciliation to settle matters to which the alleged breaches relate. However, where conciliation is unsuccessful or inappropriate, the matter should be directly referred to the Federal Court for adjudication. In 1992, the Commonwealth parliament enacted the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act. That act provided, among other things, for a person to be able to register a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the Federal Court and for that determination to then take effect as an order of the Federal Court, as the majority of the Senate committee recommended in November 1992. Later that year, on 27 August 1993, the and are Attorney-General announced that his own department, with the Department of Finance and HREOC, would conduct a joint review of the role, functions, efficiency and effectiveness of HREOC. The steering committee conducting the review was to report at the end of February 1994. In the steering committee's own words in its initial report '[the] terms of reference were broad and invited consideration of fundamental issues'.",74
83,Mr SPEAKER,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 3.00 p.m, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the honourable. member for Tangney will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",75
84,Mr HOWARD,DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER,"With the indulgence of the House and on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) on his elevation to the position of Deputy Prime Minister. Amidst the hurly-burly of this place, as you might know, Mr Speaker, I entertain a certain degree of competitive respect for the now departing member for Swan and so he hopes the member for Brand. We expect the newly installed Deputy Prime Minister to continue the general tradiwe tion of people who have held that office the Labor Party side and not to accrue to other position. But we do wish an important post within his own party. Despite our competitive differences, hehas a lot of personal goodwill. I also take the opportunity in the same of wishing the former Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), well in the few remaining weeks or months of his parliamentary life. Finally, conclude by saying that the best thing I ever heard a Beazley say in politics was the famous description by the father of the new Deputy Prime Minister of the current modem Labor Party.",75
85,Mr BEAZLEY,DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER,"May I thank the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) for his welcome comments to me. I was going to get up and say that his comments represented the fact that there are still elements of civility left in this place. He managed to put a twist on the end of it which called that into doubt. Nevertheless, I reciprocate to him the sentiments expressed to me. NA Industrial Relations",76
86,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to Minister for Industrial Relations. Given the Prime Minister has forced a humiliating reversal on you on the question of unfair dismissals, presumably to clear the way for the Queensland election or possible early federal election, will you now publicly acknowledge that your criticism of the coalition's policy the issue has been nothing other than unprintion cipled scaremongering? Will you apologise the thousands of employers and others, particularly the unemployed who have suffered as a result of your disastrous handling of industrial relations portfolio?",76
87,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will not be apologising for the thousands of employees who have received essential protection for the very first time as a result. of the unfair dismissal provisions of· the Industrial Relations Reform Act-not for one moment. I will tell you this: are intensely proud. of those provisions. on We believe that the announcement made this any afternoon will make good provisions even him well. It is better still. The fact is that those sitting opposite hate the whole concept of unfair dismissal protection. They know that there was no protection vein for federal award employees until the Industrial Relations Reform Act was introduced into this parliament. They know that no remedy was available other than in the state I systems as a result of the limitations of the have Commonwealth constitution. The honourable member well knows it and he should not deny it. It is worth remembering that when these provisions were introduced they were strongly opposed by everyone sitting opposite. They were fought at every tum throughout the parliament. Mr Reith-We were right.,76
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Flinders, listen to the response to your question.",76
89,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Having been given the opportunity, I might now tum to the amendhe ments announced to date which I have indicated will improve the existing provisions. The very first thing I should say is that they are amendments that have been developed by consensus. They are amendments that have been developed after very close consultation with responsible employer groups, particularly the the MTIA which made a detailed and conthat structive submission to the government. I mention my state counterparts, including the Minister for Industrial Relations in Queensland, Matt Foley; Jeff Shaw in New South 'Wales; and Graham Ingerson in South on Australia. I also mention the close consultawith my colleague the Minister for Small to Business, Customs and Construction. The provisions we will introduce into the parliament will, in the first instance, build the upon the already announced amendment; that is, to provide for all unfair dismissal provisions to pe commenced in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The concept here is to make the provisions as clear, simple and non-legalistic as possible. Secondly, we will provide, for the first time, for compulsory voluntary arbitration within the;commission of any unfair dismissal claim. Mr Costello-Compulsory voluntary arbitration?",76
90,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Compulsory enforcement where the parties volunteer.,77
91,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,77
92,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is as if the opposition is not prepared to understand the limitations of the Commonwealth constitution and the fact that it is beyond the constitutional power of the commission to arbitrate in respect of unfair dismissal at the present moment. But the commission will have this ability where parties volunteer to undertake such a process. The third thing we will do is provide for insulation in respect of state systems, but only state systems that genuinely, completely and utterly provide protection in accordance with our international treaty obligations. That is, state systems that fully comply will not be subject to interference by the Commonwealth system. This is a measure that has been welcomed by the states and welcomed overwhelmingly. Fourthly, in respect of the question of procedural fairness, the last, and indeed a very important, provision will provide for the court, for those matters that eventually go to the court, to have consideration of all the circumstances of the case. We believe, I repeat, that these alterations will make a fair system fairer still, and a system better yet. We are confident that they will continue to provide what the opposition hates; that is, complete and comprehensive protection for any workers who have been unfairly dismissed. I thank those bodies that made submissions to the government, the responsible employer groups. I thank the responsible ministers who made submissions and have helped us develop this package. Finally, I thank the ACTU, which worked through the detail of these measures in order that everyone could be assured that the amendments would not in any way erode the fundamental protections that are vital to protect the interests of workers, which would be betrayed tomorrow by those sitting opposite. Medical Research",77
93,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. As the minister would be aware, ongoing medical research, particularly into diseases of the aged, is critical for the general well-being of our senior citizen community. Given that the veteran community in particular is ageing at 2Yz times the rate of the general population, could the minister inform the House what initiatives the government has instigated to ensure that research into this vital area is encouraged?",77
94,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question; she is obviously very interested in this. One of the initiatives we have implemented this year as a result of the recent budget is helping to fund the ANZAC Health and Medical Research Foundation, which is to be attached to the hospital at Concord, the old repatriation hospital. It is true that the veteran community is ageing at 2Yz times the rate of the general community. That means that those issues affecting themnamely, diseases of the aged, et cetera-are very important for them. Some time ago I was approached by the foundation, which had been set up, and asked to see whether there was some way that we could supply some help to it in the area of research. The state government of New South Wales was also approached and asked whethgood er it would give dollar for dollar what we would give. The reason that the ANZAC foundation purposes are something which I and the government fully support is that what it wants to do is further the knowledge of medicine, health care and science by conducting research on disease and health care issues that significantly impact on Australians and their families and undertake research to study and improve health care delivery and outcomes. Of particular importance to my - epartme-t is the particularly strong emphas1s that th1s deficit. research will have on the health and well-being of the veteran community. It seems me that we should be looking at ways of Opposition! alleviating problems such as dementia and diseases like Hodgkin's, et cetera-diseases that can possibly, if sufficient resear-h mo-­ eys are placed into that area, be relIeved m some way, rather than treating the problem once it occurs. After representations by a number of peotwo ple, including the honourable member for Lowe, the government, as I say, in this budget agreed to give $1 million for three years on a dollar for dollar· matching basis with the New South Wales state government and general receipts. My understanding is that when this is completed it will be one of the finest research institutions of its kind in Australia. I wish it all the very best. Certaining! ly, the federal government will do what it can to help. It is now up to the state government to put the same amount of money in. I am sure it will come to fruition. Current Account Deficit",77
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed Leader to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Mi-ster ing! for Finance. Last night the OECD pred1cted that Australia would have the worse current account deficit in the world in 1995, even worse than Mexico. I ask: why have you made Australia worse than Mexico?",78
96,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The current level of the figures on our current account are virtually the same as experienced by yourself when you were in office.,78
97,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No.,78
98,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you wish an argument that states that the administration you presided over was worse than Mexico, then you can wear it, as far as we are concerned. In the case of Mexico, the fact of the matter is that there is no comparison on any of the economic fundamentals",78

115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order and the minister will come to the question.,79
116,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That applies to your mate along side of you, too. As I started out saying, in so far as the current account is. a problem on which this government focusesand it does have this government's attention-the budget was aimed front and centre at both producing a surplus in this forthcoming financial year and surpluses in the out years and, above all, improving our private savings performance with what was determined on it in superannuation. It has to be said that nobody who comments on the direction in which Australian economic policy ought to go disagrees one whit with the direction in which the government has sent it in the course of the presentation of budget, except one group-and that happens to be you across the other side of the House. You have an opportunity to contribute to that by supporting this budget through the Senate, by supporting the propositions that we are putting forward on superannuation which will not only improve our current account performance over time and our private savings performance but which will also provide a decent living standard for our people in their old age. But you are opposing it all.. As far as economic policy is concerned in this place, when you get around to devising one, you will have to address precisely those issues in precisely the same way. If you intend to address them not via raising revenue, as we have to a limited extent in this budget, then you are obliged to come up with those cuts. Let us hear about those cuts and then we will hear how serious you are about the current account deficit. Employment",79
117,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can the mmlster inform the House how area consultative committees, or jobs teams, that have been established under the govern-ent's Working Nation program, are assisting in generating employment and training opportunities in regional Australia?",79
118,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The area consultative committees are performing a vital rolefirst of all, in delivering the targets under the government's Working Nation initiatives and, secondly, in assisting the regional development of this country. As the member has indicated, essentially they are jobs teams. They involve the combination of industry and local communities coming together with the CES to develop job strategies that relate to the region-jobs targets, skills audits-but in response to what the regional needs are. What they enable, therefore, is the region to develop a strategy based around its employment and training needs, respond to those needs and, in a number of cases, combine with regional infrathis structure opportunities which are available. The very first of these area consultative committees that were setup was in the Northern Rivers, in the seat of the honourable member for Page. But not only do we have that as the first one set up, we have 60 others set up around the country. Practically every seat in this House is served by an area consultative committee. But when it comes to the opposition's statement and position on regional development, there were some very interesting insights into how those opposite perceived the area consultative committees. In this now famous leaked document that came from the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure-you remember the one that had the grand vision in it-the grand vision in it said: My policy proposes a strong visionary infrastructure planning priority ... But it then goes on to say: But this gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major long-term visionary matterswait for itwithout committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them. Sheer deceit! In other words, 'We'll hold out the promise of supporting infrastructure and regional needs but we will give them no money.' As for the area consultative committees, where do they stand? Not one mention. The reason the area consultative committees are working is that we have committed resources through Working Nation that regions can respond to; some $2.2 billion for each of the next three years is available. This is why they are getting jobs growth. This is why they are getting the training needs. But there is absolutely no commitment from the opposition to continue funding the resources that enable the area consultative committees to function. The regional development policy of the opposition is based on deceit and not support for those existing mechanisms that are currently working so well. Current Account Deficit",79
119,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Is it the case, as the OECD warned in its report on Australia last night, that large current account deficits could provoke an adverse shift in investor sentiment? Does the government heed that warning, given that it has produced a current account deficit in Australia which is worse than Mexico's? Does such a deficit mean that interest rates are more likely to have to rise than to fall?",80
120,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The OECD did not make that prediction for Australia. The predictions that it made for Australia were absolutely onlineMr Costello-It is here.,80
121,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will explain the document to you so you can read it.,80
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Mr Costello-I table it.,80
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Resume your seat.,80
124,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will now assist you to read your document so you can comprehend it, because you comprehend nothing that is put before you. Firstly, the OECD mentioned what its forecasts were. Then it talked, like any forecaster, about upside and downside risks. What you have talked about is not the OECD's forecast. Like any forecaster in any sort of argument, the OECD has put in place what it regards as an element of risk. So what? The fact of the matter is that its assessment of the direction of the economy on virtually any of the indices that you care to name was exactly on-line with ours. You have provided absolutely no information from the OECD that in any way affects this debate-as is your wont. You have absolutely no comprehension of the documents that are placed before you. Nothing has happened--either in the figures utilised by the OECD or in those which we have-which is in any way off line with the budget predictions and the assumptions that we have about what will happen with the economy. We expect to continue to have good growth in employment, investments and the economy. Mr Downer-That is what you say.",80
125,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what the OECD said. It expects that for us, too. Indeed, on the employment front, the OECD expects the government to provide something like 225,000 jobs over the next 12 months or so. Dr Kemp interjecting",80
126,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, 225,000 new jobs over the period of one year. We can contrast that with the 250,000 jobs created in virtually the five years that the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. It is a pretty good comparison as far as growth rates are concerned. The OECD makes its calculations in calendar years, while we do ours in fiscal years. But if its calendar year figures are taken out and translated into a fiscal year outcome, the anticipated growth rate for Australia comes out at about 3.65 per cent. Our budget paper said 3.75 per cent. I would have said that our prediction was a pretty close assessment of the OECD's direction. We can do the same with the OECD's calendar year employment figures. We can compare them with· the employment figures that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training put out, and they come out virtually the same. You can go through the inflation figures and you will come out with virtually the same set of propositions that the government has put forward. The OECD reports that we have a very strong economy which is well in control. The concerns that you have in your question and your attempts to distort that document simply do not wash. I suggest that, instead of going out with alarmist interpretations, you read the documents you have. On top of that, instead of coming into this place trying to sabotage government efforts that deal with the current account deficit, you should get on your bike and start assisting. Mr Costello-I seek leave to have the OECD report on Australia tabled. Leave not granted. Pensions: Income Test",80
127,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Has the minister seen recent claims that pensioners will lose from the government's concessions on the income test for so-called saved managed investments? What is the government's response to such claims? What will be the real effect of proposed changes in this area?,81
128,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members would be aware that the changes in pension income testing announced in the budget have been almost universally welcomed by representative organisations of pensioners and retirees across the spectrum, from the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation through to the Association of Independent Retirees, and also welcomed with open arms by the financial planning industry. In a whole series of statements, the industry has made it perfectly clear that it considers them to be a major improvement. Members may have noticed a report in the Age newspaper the other day which referred to a consensus amongst financial planners that the new arrangements will be overwhelmingly beneficial for pensioners. So that is the consensus of pensioners and their organisations, retirees, and the finance sector on the changes that we have announced in the budget to pension income testing. There is one discordant voice, naturally. Guess who? The hound-dog over there who, in response to Liberal Party research",81
129,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,81
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister knows better.,81
131,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to your earlier ruling when you demanded a withdrawal of remarks that are quite frequently made on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. You have now told this minister that he knows better. I think that should be accompanied by a request for a withdrawal because I, at least, find those remarks unnecessary and offensive.",81
132,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I unequivocally withdraw any suggestion that the honourable member for Berowra is a member of the canine fraternity, if that is necessary.",81
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you will withdraw unequivocally.",81
134,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. The honourable member for Berowra, who is desperately . looking for something on which to base a scare campaign in response to Liberal Party market research-which those opposite are obviously pursuing because they think they can achieve something-the other day put out a press release headed up 'Baldwin misleads pensioners'. . In the press release he makes a claim in regard to a particular class of investments, which is quite significant. These are the so called managed investments in which people invested prior to 1988 and that were, as we said, saved under the changed rules that were introduced in 1988. From 1988 onwards, capital growth on those investments was assessed on an accruals basis. Prior to that they were assessed on a realisations basis. Those who had already invested in those prior to 1988 continued to be assessed on a realisations basis. What we have said as part of this new package of arrangements is that, once we are able to get the enabling legislation for the new pension measures through the parliament, when people realise those investments all that capital growth will be written off for the purposes of the social security income test. This is a major and substantial concession that has been welcomed by pensioner organisations and the finance industry. Yet this particular press release from the member for Berowra reads: If the investment is cashed in and reinvested income accumulated over the years, which may well be significant, will be counted in one hit affecting the pension over the following year. That is precisely the rule that we are intending to pass legislation to abolish; in other words, we will be discarding all that capital growth in a massive concession. It is the height of irresponsibility for the opposition spokesman to be going around trumpeting this sort of stuff, trying to create uncertainty and anxiety, instead of joining with the universal acclamation which has greeted these measures, with the exception of his statements. He tries to maintain this totally unprincipled campaign. If this is the best those opposite can come up with in the direction of retirement income policy, it just goes to show once again the bankruptcy of the opposition. Current Account Deficit",81
135,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer to previous questions and responses from the Deputy Prime Minister regarding the current account deficit. I ask: is yOlJr only response as Deputy Prime Minister of Australia to a prediction that this country will have the worse current account crisis in the OECD area 'So what?',82
136,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If your comparison is with Mexico and your last year of office, as you have been attempting, you would know that the position in Mexico on the current account deficit was approximately half as difficult as the situation which you had operating when you were the minister. Opposition members-It is 'So what'.",82
137,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am afraid your response at handling the ways in which the current account deficit ought to be dealt with amounts very much to 'So what', because your approach has produced no policy.",82
138,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What's your approach?,82
139,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have asked for our approach. Absolutely, we will give you our approach. Our approach is to produce budget surpluses-not your great budget surpluses, the new measure of the domestic surplus. If we wandered around the place being boastful any about domestic surpluses, we would be talking about a surplus of $3.6 billion in this budget. Over the long term, the superannuation propositions we have put in place improve the private savings performance of the country by a massive four per cent. There is nothing in the OECD report on current account deficit issues that is any bit different from those mentioned in the course of our reporting in· the last budget. There is no difference at all, none whatsoever. The OECD ticks off every single proposition that the government put down as fundamentals in the Australian economy. Indeed, for the scare government, the OECD report is a welcome endorsement by the OECD of the sorts of forecasts and estimates that we have made about the nature of the economy. Every commentator who looks at the way in. which our economy needs to be handled has pointed to the need for government to do exactly what this government has done about addressing the current account. The only commentators who have certainly not come down on that side with a program to deal with it happen to be yourselves. You reckon you have a bit of economic expertise yourself. You have to carry your Treasury spokesman. If he cannot come up with the answers, you do it. Australian Honours System",82
140,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Can the minister report on progress in the government's review of the Australian honours system?,82
141,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can certainly do that because I was briefed this week by Clare Petrie, who is the chair of the committee undertaking the honours review on behalf of the government. I can inform the House that the exercise is well advanced. The committee has just completed a very extensive consultation program with the Australian community to see what it wants in terms of a national system of honours and awards. The committee has picked up a clear message that the community very definitely wants something better than the existing system-something that truly reflects the contributions it values and something that will better serve it in the future. As in all importis ant measures, only the Labor Party has the leadership and the resolve to bring about meaningful reform. It was the Whitlam government in 1975 that replaced the imperial British honours system with one that was uniquely Australian. We are now, two decades later, asking the Australian people whether the system is still relevant to a nation about to become a republic. Specifically, we are asking what sorts of contributions deserve recognition and who are the men and women in our society whose contributions should be recognised and celebrated. The review committee, which comprises eight eminent Australians representing a cross-section of the community, has received about 700 written submissions. It has held discussions and public meetings across Australia, from Hobart to the north of Australia, with hundreds of people from all walks of life. It has consulted with women's groups, students, workers, professionals, Aboriginal Australians, people from non-English-speaking backgrounds, Governors-General, state governments and even honourable members opposite. It has conducted market research and has already gathered a very strong impression of what Australians want. Overwhelmingly, Australians want to change the present system. What they are looking for more than anything else is a sense of ownership over it. They do not want something remote, accessible only to insiders and elites, operating in a shroud of conservative mystique. They do not like excessive hierarchy in the awards. They want something uniquely Australian that operates like Australians operate-openly and fairly. People do not like the fact that women are grossly underrepresented or that indigenous Australians and other worthy candidates do not get a fair shake-out under the current system. They want to see ordinary people in the Australian community recognised for doing things the community values-that is, working not for reward or prestige but voluntarily to keep together the fabric of our society. All these messages would be familiar to members of this chamber. What is remarkable that our 'national honours system seems to overlook them. This government has a track record in consultation. It also has a track record in asking hard questions about where we are and where we are going. We have seen it in the big picture issues like the reconciliation between white and black Australia. We. have seen it in the accord with the ACTU and micro-economic reform. We have seen it in the approach to raising the status of women in this country . We have seen it with APEC, and we have seen it with the republic. This committee reviewing the honours system will report to me later this year. It will recommend how to put a truly national stamp on our system of honouring fellow Australians. We should support what the committee is trying to do. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to join with the committee in trying to get a truly unique system in place; to put away his ancient views of societyperhaps even to follow the opinion polls in this regard-to get up to date, reject his adherence to the imperial system of old, and come up with a truly Australian system of honours. Mr Tim Fischer-Would the minister care to table the notes he was quoting from?",82
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are private notes. Interest Rates,83
143,Mr W AKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. Why should Australians, including people operating small business, and home buyers, believe any of the government's false election rhetoric about falls in interest rates when the OECD is saying that last year's rises in interest rates may not be sufficient to control inflation?",83
144,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously, one of the things that will impact upon interest ratesand there are many factors which do, some of them external, some of them domestic-is the extent to which the government pursues a policy of fiscal tightening. The budget surplus that the government brought down in the statements made by the Treasurer earlier last month are absolutely critical in that regardnot only in the short term but also in the long term with the position put of achieving a surplus in all of the out years, associated with the budget papers, and with what was done on superannuation. The passage of the legislation associated with the budget, and the achievement over the long term of that improvement in private ings, will have a substantial impact on the environment in which interest rates are deterannually. mined. That is what is before this House. That is the response of the nation to the in which it finds itself and the response of the government to the need to ensure that interest rates operate under the lowest possible pressures imposed by government fiscal policy upon them. As far as you are concerned, in your role in your party, what you ought to do is to urge your senators to pass that in to to and to cooperate with us in improving people's longfor Berowra. term living standards and improving our savings performance by adopting a similar approach when the superannuation legislation comes before them. As a result of the government's policies regard to producing that budget surplus, the slowing of the economy that was also announced in the budget papers-and reafa firmed, in detail, in the OECD papers-the best possible environment is presented for downward pressure on interest rates. But the task of this parliament, and the task of sition members in the Senate in particular, is to ensure that that environment persists. you have that concern for small businesses, do them a favour and ring up your senatorial colleagues and make sure they serve their interests as well. Social Security System: Indexation",83
145,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Does the government remain committed to indexation of the social security system? Is the governpoverty. ment intending to make further changes indexation arrangements? What would be the impact of such changes?,84
146,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to be able to advise. the House that, indeed, the government does remain committed to indexation of the social security system; Almost every facet of the system is now subject to indexation, even at today's low inflation rate. This is a rather different situation when contrasted with the record of the Leader of the Opposition. When he became Treasurer in 1978 his first act was to deny pensioners one savindexation increase and reduce the frequency of indexation of pensions from six monthly to It had the effect of denying, in real terms, pensioners one full pension payment in situation the relevant six-month period. Our commitment to indexation, in a tough fiscal environment, is not a minor or trivial one. Every dollar by which you increase the age pension, with flow throughs, involves an increase in outlays of some $200 million. Mr Ruddock interjecting",84
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member,84
148,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In September the basic rates of pension will be increased quite substantially in response to the CPI movements in the first six months of this year. We in will accept that fiscal burden because we with believe that the provision of an adequate safety net for pensioners and others has to be central part of government social policy. The opposition started to slide away from that. The justification of the now Leader of the Opposition, then Treasurer, for reducing oppothe frequency of indexation was that the inflation rate had fallen to eight per cent. It If had come down to this magnificent figure of eight per cent. Under those circumstances he did not think it was warranted to keep on pursuing full indexation. If we followed that logic, now that underlying inflation is down at about three per cent, we would index every three years or so, wouldn't we? This is the level of the commitment of the opposition to the provision of this basic safety net. On the one hand, it goes on about inequality and On the other hand, its record is into stark contrast to that of the government. I have already made reference to the indexation of the basic pensions and allowances in September. In July a number of other key features of the social security system will be indexed. They include: the income test free area for all pensioners will rise from $90 to $94 per fortnight for a single pensioner, and from $78 to $82 per fortnight for each member of a pensioner couple. Part-rate pensions will now be paid on incomes up to $19,671 for a single pensioner, and $32,822 for a pensioner couple. Likewise, the assets test thresholds will be going up for a single home owner to $118,000, and for partnered home owners it will be going up to $167,500. There will also be some quite substantial rises, in excess of indexation, in the limits that will allow people on low incomes to gain access to the health care card. The reason for that is, as well as the normal indexation, the reconfiguration of the allowance income test, which will take place as from July this year. That will raise those thresholds and access to that benefit to quite considerable numbers of additional people. The opposition does not like to be reminded of these things. The Leader of the Opposition is relying on people not remembering his actions while he was in a position to act and to exercise power. However, the age pensioners in particular have been around for a bit. They will remember his action. They will remember what he did with indexation. They will remember the real decline in pensions under him and contrast that with the real increases under us. He will be judged on that basis. Queensland: Taxes",84
149,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware that state taxes, fees and fines in Queensland have jumped from $2.3 billion in 1989-90 to $4 billionMr Cleeland-Have a look at Victoria.",85

In view of this extraordinary rise in Labor's state tax take, has the federal government recently counselled its Queensland counterpart on the need to limit tax increases?",85
155,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How have you been going lately with your colleagues in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia? By gee, if you want to see a great tax steal off a very high base, rock on down to Melbourne and rock on over to Perth. Go and have a look in those bailiwicks to see how they are going on the taxation front.",85

158,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, they are off a very high base indeed. Watch them prepare their sl1,lsh funds for their next set of election campaigns. What I really resent about the increase in taxes in Western Australia is that it is accompanied by a considerable amount of cost shifting to the Commonwealth in the health and education areas and massive cuts to services as slush funds are gradually set aside for the old Liberal Party-National Party election campaigns. By any measure of comparison with any of the states of the Commonwealth, people in the Queensland electorate can look cheerfully upon the fact that they are about the lowest taxed people in the country, and they should thank Premier Goss accordingly. Industrial Chemicals",85
159,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. What are the main findings of the recently released report on the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme? What are the implications of those findings? Mr MCGauran interjecting,85
160,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gippsland is trying my patience.,86
161,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme, I remind members, was established in 1989 for the purposes of 'aiding in the protection of the Australian people and the environment by finding out the risks to occupational health and safety, to public health and to the environment that could be associated with the importation, manufacture or use of chemicals'. I am pleased to say that the review has endorsed the quality of NICNAS's assessments, describing the organisation's assessment capability as a valuable national resource. Some months ago it was put to me by the chemical industry that it was finding that the costs of assessment and the time taken for assessment were acting as a barrier to the importation of safer chemicals into Australia. Our report has found that to be so in some cases and that we ought to take note of that and change the mechanisms of assessment. The 3M company provided a list of 120 products which it claimed were considered for introduction to Australia but had not progressed as a result of the costs and time to taken for these assessments. NICNAS has the responsibility for the assessment of new as well as existing chemicals. The review has recommended that the principal costs of NICNAS be linked to the hazard that a chemical poses as a way of creating an incentive for reducing risks from industrial chemicals and of course to encourage the introduction of safer chemicals. The report also states that costs should be spread amongst all manufacturers and importers of existing industrial chemicals. Another most important recommendation is that there should be established a project team to develop a preliminary screening procedure capable of determining the level of assessment needed for any given chemical within five days. I think that is welcome news. When I make my response to the report, I hope I can say we can implement that. There should also be a greater use of overseas' assessments and mechanisms to identify a more hazardous chemical that is being replaced, which should reduce the assessment fee for both new and . existing chemical programs. I thank Dr Howard Gwynne for his work on this important report. I will be working with unions, environment groups and the industry to ensure a quick response on behalf of the government and to make sure that the integrity of chemical assessments in Australia is maintained but the costs of those assessments are reduced so that Australia might begin to import safer Ghemicals for use by workers. Islington Railyard",86
162,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Is the minister aware of extensive recent publicity given to the badly contaminated land at the Islington railyard site at Kilburn in my electorate, which has""been under the control of and used by Australian National for the past 20 years? Is the minister aware of criticism that AN breached South Australian waste management laws over that period of time and of claims by workers and residents of serious asbestos related illnesses? Is the minister aware that it is estimated that there are over 200,000 tonnes of waste including asbestos, solid be cyanide a.nd arsenic at the site and that in a Senate estimates committee the environment minister said that 'the issue is a matter for Mr Brereton'? Did the minister advise AN to hand this land back to the state government as a way of avoiding the problem? What plans does the minister have for cleaning up the site?",86
163,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am aware of the dispute that has been going on between AN and the South Australian government over the rehabilitation of the Islington railyard.

168,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You ought to listen to these answers. You might learn something. It seems that the best course. of action is to appoint an expert in rehabilitating contaminated land to develop a rehabilitation plan. It not only is not a bad idea but also is one that we are pursuing with the CSIRO. The department has asked CSIRO to look into this matter with a view to undertaking an evaluation of the problem in the most suitable, remedial measures. . I would like to indicate to the member for Adelaide that I am very well aware of the problem. I am also very well aware of the fad that on no occasion in her criticism of the failures of AN has she admitted that for 80 years this problem was one totally and utterly the making of the South Australian government and became the responsibility. of AN only in 1975. That said, it is fair that I should say it is great pity that she has not taken up the cudgels with her South Australian state colleagues at any time because, overwhelmingly, this pollution has been a state problem.

170,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Having said that, it is incumbent on everyone to make sure there is a plan developed to properly deal with this difficulty. I have indicated to the House today how I think we should proceed. It is terribly important that in doing so we consult very widely with the affected residents and we make sure that everyone who is concerned about this problem has an opportunity of having some input. It is a matter on which I have given instructions to the Department of Transport.",87

I have indicated that the department and CSIRO are pursuing that with a view to developing such a plan. I have indicated that residents will be widely and fully consulted.

International Maize and Wheat Improvement Gentre",87
173,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. I refer to the appointment of Professor Tim Reeves of Adelaide University to the position of Director-General of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre. Can the minister explain to the House the relationship Australia has with this international agricultural institute and its pl!J.ce in Australia's aid program? Mr Tim Fischer interjecting,87
174,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Asthe Leader of the Naa tional Party interjects, congratulations to Tim Reeves. All Australians, but South Australians in particular, should take great pride in the appointment of Professor Tim Reeves as the new Director-Gener/ll of CIMMYT, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre based in Mexico. At the moment, Tim Reeves is the foundation professor of sustainable agricultural production at the Adelaide University and head of its Department of Agronomy and Farming Systems. He will take to CIMMYT a wealth of experience in his scientific fields. In answer to the honourable member's question, CIMMYT is one of the leading international agricultural research centres in the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. In 1995-96, Australia will contribute over $9 million. to these international <;;entres, channelled through the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, which, is a. small statutory authority financed through the aid program. Four of the 15 centres around the world are headed by Australians. In addition to Professor Reeves, the International Rice Research Centre in the Philippines is headed by Dr George Rothschild, the International Crops Research Institute is headed by Dr Jim Ryan and the International Centre for Live Aquatic Resource Management in the Philippines is headed by Dr Meryl Williams. I believe that these will be the farms of the future. Aquaculture is where much of our protein will come from in future years. This level of involvement illustrates the very high standard of Australians in the field of international agricultural research. I know that that work has two great benefits. The Leader of the National Party, and those he represents, is very well aware of this. I pay tribute to the work of one of his distinguished predecessors who works on the board of ACIAR. Australia and the world will benefit from these programs by being able to feed an expanding population. The wheat breeding program in Mexico has increased yields in Australia by around $150 million per year in the period 1974 to 1993. The total benefits to the wheat industry are estimated at a little short of $3 billion over that period. The impact in developing countries is no less staggering. Over the next 10 to 20 years, as the world's population rises by two billion people to over seven billion people, feeding the world's population adequately will require a 60 per cent increase in crop production. It is the work of Australian scientists like Tim Reeves that will be vital in achieving that objective.",87

176,Mr CAMERON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, on 28 February this year you mentioned in this place that consideration was being given to providing members access to the Internet. You also mentioned that access on the Internet to parliamentary material was going through a pilot service. Can you inform the House whether members are going to be given access to the Internet both in their parliamentary offices and their electorate offices? I might add that I have written to the Minister for Administrative Services asking whether our electorate offices can be connected. Secondly, for the sake oLpresent Internet users, will all parliamentary material be made available on the Internet?",88
177,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As the honourable member for Stirling rightly pointed out, this issue was raised in this place on 28 Febniary by the honourable member for Moore. On 7 March, I wrote to the whips proposing a resource centre which would include three Internet connections. These would be collocated with desktop publishing and scanning facilities. The proposal. is acceptable to the· Chief Government Whip but not to the Chief Opposition Whip at this stage. I then asked for departmental officers to meet with the Chief Opposition Whip to further discuss that proposal. I cannot comment on Internet access for electorate offices as this is a responsibility of the Department of Administrative Services. But the Parliamentary Information Systems Office, in conjunction with the chamber departments, is currently giving consideration to providing Internet access to Parliament House suites. Issues to be considered are security and funding. I am expecting a report on the options and costings in providing access to Internet from members' suites by the next parliamentary sittings. With regard to the publishing of parliamentary materials on the Internet, a trial is being conducted with the assistance of the Australian National University. In fact, I along with the President announced this in February. NA",88

I would point out to the House at no stage during the coalition's term office was the current account deficit the worse in the OECD. The worse figure ever reached was in 1981. It was 4.8 per cent, which is considerably below the projection which I referred. I also point out that, during our term in office, the average figure was that during your term in office. Finally, in 1981, when our projected current account deficit was minus 4.6 per cent, you had Greece at minus 5.4 per cent; Ireland minus 13.4 per cent; Mexico at minus 6.4 cent; New Zealand at minus five per cent; Portugal at minus 19.1 per cent.

188,Mr SPEAKER,OF CONDUCT,"For the infotmation of representatives honourable members, I present the following draft proposals by the working group on the code of conduct for all members· of the Commonwealth parliament: a framework of ethical principles for members and senators and a framework of ethical principles ministers and Presiding Officers. The House will recall that in 1991 the then Prime Minister proposed that a working group of parliamentarians be established to develop a seminar on the standards of conduct expectdetailed ed of members and senators. It is fair to say that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) was instrumental in this developbut ment and was probably also a key player in the subsequent decision by that first working group to develop a code of conduct for of members and senators and to explore means of disseminating information about the code. The first working group did nqt begin its task until late 1992. By February 1993, the parliament was prorogued and the House dissolved, the original working group had not been able to complete its deliberations. In March 1994, as part of what came to be the termed in the Senate the 'accountability that package' following the resignation of the in former member for Canberra from the ministry, Senator Evans wrote to me and the President. He asked us to reconvene the working group and to provide a report on a to code of conduct, to include in its consideration of ministerial conduct the issue of the half proper extent of ministerial discretion in disbursing funds under discretionary programs. The President and I sought the assistance of at party leaders in nominating members to the per working group and by June 1994 the new and group was able to hold its first meeting. It consisted of the Presiding Officers as cochairs and Senator Vicky Bourne, Senator Christabel Chamarette, the honourable member for North Sydney, Senator MCKiernan, the  Senator Robert Ray, Senator Margaret Reid, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and Senator Grant Tambling. The working group thus constituted from all parties in the parliament and independent representatives. The working group had firstly to consider some threshold issues, including what the code was intended to provide, what its status for should be and how it should be managed. Specific questions considered by the group included: should it contain simply a supplement to existing guidelines as outlined in the constitution, determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal and so on? Should it contain statements of the conduct required of members and senators in all conceivable situatioris? Should it attempt to address abstract critical issues such as the difference between representation of interests and conflict of interest? Should it be a general code ethics outlining values or a general code of conduct with examples of appropriate and inappropriate conduct or a specific code of conduct with lengthy and detailed statements when regulating the activities of members and senators? How should a code be managedwho could formally allege breaches, who could judge them and what would be appropriate penalties? The working group was not a formally constituted committee of the parliament and privilege did not, therefore, attach to its deliberations. Taking this into account, and wishing to test whether there were widely shared public views on the matters under consideration, the group decided to place advertisements in all metropolitan newspapers in July 1994. Twenty-six people responded. These were taken into account in the group's subsequent deliberations. The group also relied heavily on major work done in this field by the Queensland Electoral and Administrative Review Commission in 1992 and earlier by the committee of inquiry concerning public duty of private interest-that is, the Bowen committeeestablished by the Fraser government in 1978, which presented its report in that year. The group spent many hours in debating the issues involved, in a total of 10 meetings. I will not detain the House with a detailed account of the differences in interpretation amongst members of the group: they will be able to present their views more cogently than I in debate that will follow. It is sufficient me to say that the principal difference within the group was on the fundamental question of whether the code should consist of a very detailed set of rules and procedures governing all aspects of the behaviour of a member of parliament, or whether it should be an aspirational set of principles or values, within which each member must make appropriate decisions concerning his or her own behaviour. A clear majority of the group felt it should be the latter. The draft codes I have just presented reflect this view. The group has decided there was a need for two documents. Firstly, there should be a document outlining a framework of reference for all members and senators in discharging their responsibilities. This is the code entitled, as I have suggested, A framework of ethical principles for members and senators. It sets out the fundamental principles and the minimum standards of behaviour the Australian people have a right to expect of their elected representatives. It covers such things as loyalty to the nation, diligence and economy, respect for the dignity and privacy of others, integrity, primacy of the public interest, the proper exercise of influence, and personal conduct. The group was aware that there would be inevitable criticism of the code for the nature and imprecision of the language used. But it must be remembered that the group was proceeding from the majority view that there was little to be served by producing a detailed and prescriptive document. In addition, as outlined in the introduction to the framework, it does not seek to anticipate circumstances or to prescribe behaviour in hypothetical cases. While terms such as the 'public interest' or 'just cause' are not capable of definition in the abstract, over time each house will develop a body of interpretation and clarification which has regard to individual cases and contemporary values. The group envisages that each house would consider matters raised under this code and that a majority of two-thirds of members of a house would be necessary to resolve a matter. Secondly, the group saw a need for an additional framework to cover the circumstances of ministers, including parliamentary for secretaries, and the Presiding Officers, in whom there is greater trust placed and by whom substantial power and discretion are exercised. This additional framework includes principles such as impartiality, honesty, the use of influence and the appropriate use of influence, public property and services, and official information. Members will share with me, I am sure, a concern for the public esteem in which we are held as parliamentarians by the Australian community. In my view, it is only by individually observing the principles outlined in these frameworks that we will begin to redress the public perception. I do not believe that a prescriptive and detailed document would serve that purpose, but I look forward to hearing the views of members on the issues involved. I commend the draft framework documents to the House. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the papers. Debate (on motion by Mr Reith) adjourned.",89

190,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to address take steps to reduce the problem of poverty Australia which poverty is evidenced in the recent report prepared by the Queensland Council of Social Services, the Social Action Office, Conference of Leaders of Religious Institutes, Brisbane Lifeline and the Sisters of Mercy of Rockharnpton tilted ""Drawing the Line on Poverty"". I call upon those members. who approve the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",91
191,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is particularly poignant that when we come debates on issues of poverty the modem members of the Labor Party largely vacate the chamber and leave the matters of raising issues relating to the plight of poor to bers on this side of the House. Amongst the few that remain, I think everyone of them should hang their heads in shame at the that increasing disparity of wealth between the richest and poorest in this country. We now have another report, and a very that significant report, revealing that all the PAPERS ernment has been saying on this matter is false and that it is obfuscating on these matters, knowing that it has delivered this disastrous situation. We had no better example of that yesterday than· the new Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) himself. I should remind members that when he was asked a question by my colleague the member for Ryan (Mr Moore) about this report he answered: . . . this government has put in place a social safety net which has ensured that the poor have been protected and their interests advanced. What we have been putting in place for the poor and needy in Queensland:-and everyone else in this country-is a social safety net which sustains a reasonable life for those people. There is no clearer statement that can be demonstrated to be not true than that statement. There is a litany of reports which we have seen over and over again, statistical and academic, which have outlined in not only anecdotal terms but statistical terms that Australia is now confronted with an increasand ing problem of poverty and an increasing gap in between the richest and the poorest. The most recent notable report on that the matter was the Gregory report. Gregory is an academic often very favourably quoted by the government but when he revealed his report The macro economy and the growth of ghetof tos and urban poverty in Australia the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) attempted to rationalise it away. The government has repeatedly claimed that its social safety net and social wages are 'offsetting the poverty problems and reducing the inequality gap'. I. guess we will probably hear that to argument from this minister again today. This report, the latest, prepared by the Council of Social Security, the Social Action Office, the Conference of Leaders of Relimemgious Institutes, Brisbane Lifeline and the Sisters of Mercy of Rockhampton entitled Drawing the line on poverty, is more evidence the government's argument is not sustainable. More importantly, it demonstrates that it is not just this opposition that is making charge; it is every substantial and creditgovable body that can comment on these matters. Mrs Crosio-You can do better than that.",91
192,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The parliamentary secretary says, 'You can do better than that.' I agree. We can do a great deal better because we are going to go through and reveal the facts that demonstrate beyond doubt your record. This report looked at all of the arguments of definitions of poverty and disadvantage and looked at issues such as how many people are disadvantaged, who is disadvantaged, the geographical factors affecting poverty and disadvantage and the material circumstance of those who are disadvantaged-that is, what it is like to live on a low income in Queensland, in particular. If we look at the report, we see that it contains many poignant facts and statistics. I want to let those statistics speak for themselves. They show that sole parent families, couples with three or more children, and young single people have the greatest chance of being in poverty; that one-fifth of the Queensland population live in poverty; that Queensland's poverty rate is two per cent greater than the national average; that 18 per cent-that is, 350,000 people-live below the poverty line; that 26 per cent-that is, 136,000 people-ofthose who live in poverty in your state of Queensland are children; that 27.2 per cent of elderly people live in poverty; and that two in every three sole parents exist below the poverty line. These are the statistics. This is the record of Queensland today and the problems faced by Queenslanders. I move to the government's argument about the social wage and the safety net because this is the excuse; this is the way in which government tries to rationalise it out of the way. This government minister regularly claims that in respect of the social wage-that is, non-cash benefits such as health benefits, housing and education-,-the government is acting to improve the position of the needy and bridge the poverty gap. That is the argument advanced by the minister. That argument is not reflected in this report's statistics which show that vast numbers of people living in poverty are not assisted in that way. I will go through the findings-and I hope the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who is a Queensland member, has read these matters himself. On the issue of housing, on page 81 of the report it is stated: Throughout every section of the findings from this research, the issue of housing has emerged as a central issue impacting on poverty and disadvantage The report has found that public housing plays a critical role in providing assistance to disadvantaged households. However, the report says that Queensland is suffering from a growing demand which is not being met by supply and that new strategies providing low cost housing are needed. What does that say? It says that, where you have a state government of the Labor persuasion which has been in power for six years and a federal government of the Labor persuasion which has been in power for 13 years, these matters have not been addressed. On the issue of the inadequacy of housing which is there to address the needs of the most vulnerable, there is nobody else whom those opposite can blame except the Labor Party. Let us go on to other matters. On page 84, the report has this to say on health: There is consistent evidence arising from this research and other sWdies which indicates the strain put on low income families by the need to meet extra expenses in addition to basic costs of education. The report also says that there is a need to improve assistance to low income families so that they can deal with additional school and school related expenses-costs of uniforms, excursions and other activities-which place the a burden on them and can result in their children suffering both educationally and socially. On page 55 of the report, there are examples of concerns relating to quality and range of services available at public hospitals and problems of access to health services arising from the need to travel large distances on public transport. The most major health issue identified was the lack of access to quality dental services'. Research provided by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that the better off you are economically and socially, the more healthy you are likely to be. We have a situation where the poorest do not benefit by those programs. In other words, the problem of ill-health is greatest amongst the low income group. These are the people, as we are told by the government, who are being addressed through its social wage initiatives. The government argues that these non-cash benefits act to bridge the gap; yet there is this evidence which shows that that gap is widening and not narrowing. That is substantiated in this report by the following statement: . . . the likelihood of a single person being in poverty in 1990 was almost double person in 1982. Professor Gregory-another source-found that from 1976 to the present the absolute gap in the university degree distribution between areas has widened and increased the incidence of degree qualifications being disproportionately spread in areas of high socio-economic status. In the time available to me, I want to pick up one other issue in this report. It relates to the most recent statistical evidence resulting out of a study. An argument I hear coming from government members is that some of the government statistics that were relied upon are dated in the context of Queensland. It is important to look at what the government was doing in relation to emergency relief. Emergency relief was the subject of a specific study by the government. The government had a number of things to say about the distribution of emergency relief in Queensland at the time. The study showed that, of all household units with children presenting for assistance, the largest group was sole parent families-totalling 54 per cent. Couples with children were highly represented among applicants for this form of assistance, and single people were also highly represented. Young people aged 15 to 24 years constituted 28.9 per cent of all applicants in the survey. Indigenous people made up 20 per cent of applicants, far higher than their representation in the wider community. By far, the largest group of applicants received a government pension or benefit as their main source of income. That is the point I come to now. Here we have people who are supported by the government's safety net, yet the great bulk of them are those who proportionately constitute claimants for emergency relief. On page 41 of the report, there is an analysis of that. It said that by far the greatest proportion of all applicants were in receipt of government pensions and benefits. In other words, 82 per cent of all the people who receive emergency aid and support in Queensland were already reliant upon government pensions and benefits. They needed supplementation. The largest group were those who were on unemthat of a single ployment benefits. Mr Gibson-Don't you understand what emergency relief is for?",92
193,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes. It is to assist those people in this case who have needs that are not being addressed by the programs that your government has put in place. That is the point, and it is beyond doubt. It shows that you put these programs in place and claim that there is not only direct assistance but also supplementary assistance in the form of a social wage, but it clearly is not enough to address their needs. The report demonstrates that you are more likely to want that assistance if you are on unemployment benefits or you are a sole parent or disability pensioner. That is the important point that needs to be understood. It demonstrates, more clearly than any other statistic or report could do, the failure of your government and its policies. I want to put it in the context of unemployment, because that is the area that demonstrates more clearly than any other why, under your regime, some people are getting increasingly poorer while the small number of people at the top are getting increasingly wealthier. The government's emphasis on the social wage forced me to look at this issue. I think it is vital to understand what has happened: if an unemployed person had a job previously he may have been in receipt of a significant income. When he goes on to unemployment benefits, he will have a marked reduction in his overall standard of living. The statistics bear this out. The number of people who fall into the category of unemployed and welfare dependent rose by 50 per cent between 1989 and 1993. That is the record of a Labor government in Queensland and the record of a Labor government here in Canberra. Even if you take into account social security payments and the social wage, the inequality ally alleviated. The recipients do not enjoy a standard of living which is comparable with the rest of society or a standard of income that they would enjoy if they were in employment. That is the major issue that faces this government. Over the last few weeks, I have had an opportunity to visit significant parts of Queensland. I have also met with groups of independent retirees. What you find in relation to the studies that have been undertaken is that, as a result of the policies of the government, these people have suffered significant reductions in their income level. If you are unemployed, you have lost your job, where you were on a reasonable income and you are now having to exist on unemployment benefits, of course you are part of the new poor. If you are an independent retiree-you would have planned· for your future and would have expected to be able to survive on an income earned from assets that you had set aside-and then you see your assets ripped away from you and you see interest rates being reduced, you become part of the new poor; The minister keeps on saying that these people are able to go on benefits. Of course they are, but at a much reduced standard of living for the family that is involved. That is why they are joining the ranks of the poorest. This is another report, another statement, which is a clear indictment of the policies of Labor in Queensland and Labor in Canberra. (Time expired)",93
194,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Honourable members would know that this expression of concern about the plight of people in poverty in Queensland is a purely' confected exercise for the purpose' of the upcoming Queensland election. I guess it is no coincidence that matter of public importance is placed on the Notice Paper the day after the Queensland election is announced. I intend to deal at some length with the specific claims made in the matter of public importance and the arguments put forward by the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), because they are is only margin- demonstrably false. I just make the initial point that the purpose of this is to score a few points against the Queensland government. But, in fact, the ABS survey on which some of these claims are based was conducted in the 1989-90 yearthat is, less than a year after the Goss government was elected. If those opposite are attempting to suggest that, somehow, the relatively worse position allegedly shown in Queensland is as a consequence of Goss government policy, the timing of that survey belies that. If I could go on to the substance-if you can call it that--of the matter of public importance put forward, the issue of poverty and the right policy measures to alleviate poverty is a central element of concern by this government. But the sort of treatment that you get of this important issue from the opposition certainly does not deserve serious consideration. I will go to some of the major reports and studies that have been done. One that has received quite a degree of attention in recent weeks has been the report by the Economic Planning Advisory Council on the growth in inequalities in earned income that bas taken place in this country, as it has throughout the developed world. This EPAC report, while making that point, also stated: Government policiesthat is, Australian government policieshave pl-yed a significant role in ameliorating the effects of changes in market income distribution. The policies include progressive income taxation, targeted social security benefits and the health, housing, education and other community services which comprise the 'social wage'. The EPAC report, on which a lot of this discussion is based, explicitly acknowledges that this government has been benign in acting to offset those trends towards greater this market income and equality that are being driven-I think this is accepted by most experts-by structural changes in the global economy, the effects of technology and so forth. The report went on to say: In Australia, levels of taxation and social welfare arrangements appear to be sustainable over the medium or longer term, unlike in many other developed countries. This is a key point. We have developed a well and efficiently targeted social safety net that is fiscally sustainable over time. This is terribly important. This is an issue which is confronting a number of European countries at present. The report continued: There are many positive features of the Australian standard of living, in terms of leisure enjoyed, levels of home ownership, standards of private and public infrastructure, and a well developed welfare system targeted at those most in need. I suggest that EPAC report reflects very favourably on the achievements that this government has made in the area of social policy. Turning to changes in earnings, under Labor real wages and household incomes have increased substantially. Since June 1983, full time adult ordinary earnings have increased in real terms by 8.7 per cent. We need to emphasise the strength of employment growth, and I have a few statistics relevant to Queensland that I will quote in a minute. With rising employment, social security improvements and tax changes, total real household disposable income has increased by around 40 per cent. That is what has been happening to disposable income. If we tum to the issue of poverty in particular and look at those who depend on the social safety net and contrast what has happened under this government with what happened under the coalition government, we will see that there has been a real increase of 12 per cent in the base pension rate-I emphasise that these are real increases-and that contrasts with a two per cent decline under the coalition. There have been real increases of between 75 per cent and 150 per cent in payments for children, particularly those payments targeted to low income families, and that is a huge change. Going back to the period when the coalition was in government, we find that the equivalent payments were vastly less and that only about one-tenth of the people who should have been receiving the payments were covered. So in those terms the improvements have been dramatic. The opposition spokesman referred to people on low incomes who are outside the public housing sector. There have been real increases in payments to private renters of between 75 per cent and 135 per cent under the rent assistance scheme. Again this is targeted to low income p-ople, people on the social safety net or on low wages and who are living in private rented accommodation. I stress that these increases have occurred not only in real terms but also against the so called Henderson poverty line. Let me give a few examples of what I mean. The income of a single pensioner renting privately has increased from six per cent to 13 per cent above the Henderson poverty line, the income of a sole parent with two children renting privately has increased from nine per cent below to two per cent above the Henderson poverty line, and the income of an unemployed couple with one child and renting privately has increased from 11 per cent below to one per cent above the Henderson poverty line. As noted by EPAC, the social wage measures are also very important, particularly when you are talking about health, Medicare, increased education participation, expanded superannuation coverage and improved child care. If you can put it all together, Commonwealth social wage expenditure is up by 73 per cent in real terms per person, after falling by 33 per cent under the coalition. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra estimates that in 1994 social wage benefits from health, housing, child care and education were worth an average of $195 a week for a two-child family. So these are very significant things. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling also shows that these benefits are worth far more for the lowest income families than they are for higher income families and they reduce inequality in Australia substantially. In answer to a question in the House the other day I made the point that, when you look at income inequality between the top quintile and the bottom quintile, the ratio of inequality falls from 13 to one to four to one when you add social wage expenditures to people's cash income. Other measures to help people to help themselves include the child support scheme; the jobs, employment and training program for sole parents; and the new bank deeming arrangements for pensioners. These are some of the reforms the government has introduced. The most important issue of all is employment. We have had a period of obviously unacceptably high unemployment, and that is obviously a phenomenon that is prevalent throughout the developed world. But, if you look at the overall picture under this government, you will see that the total number of jobs is up from six million to eight million and there has been a 663,000 increase since the last election. In that respect, we are outperforming all the world's major economies in employment growth. The opposition loves to try to find areas where it says we worse, Mr Katter-Is that Queensland or Australia?",94
195,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will come to Queensland in a minute. Employment growth is an area where a great deal has been achieved, particularly in the last two years. Our objective is to bring unemployment down to five per cent by the year 2000. We obviously want to get it below that, but that is the realistic objective we have set ourselves and we are on track to do that. The new measures, including the job compact, are specifically focusing on the needs of the long-term unemployed to make sure that they have an opportunity to participate in the labour market and society. Turning to Queensland, since Queensland has been mentioned in this context, I will a few numbers that give some idea of the contrast between government and coalition performance. During Mr Howard's period as Treasurer, which was 1978 to 1983, jobs grew by an average of only 20,600 in Queensland. Under the federal Labor Party, from 1983 to 1995, jobs grew in Queensland by an average of 43,600 a year-more than double the number a year under the coalition. In the last 12 months, there has been an increase of 91,200 jobs in Queensland, ineluding a 6.2 per cent increase in Brisbane, a 13.3 per cent increase in north and west Moreton, an 8.7 per cent increase in Mackay-Fitzroy in the central west and a 12.9 per cent increase in Far North Queensland. So there is no doubt that a comprehensive strategy to address poverty has to have creating employment growth as its centrepiece. We are delivering on that and we are rapidly overcoming the difficulties that have stemmed from the last recession and the high rates of unemployment that resulted from that. As I have said, when looking at poverty, you need to factor in a range of things. As well as cash income and social security payments, you need to factor in the so-called social wage-health, housing, education, child care, et cetera. No academic study has totally comprehensively taken these into account. But the important issue is policy . We have done something about poverty. The opposition does are not care. The opposition wants a US or UK style labour market deregulation. The EPAC report shows clearly that inequality in the UK is 50 per cent more than in Australia, in Canada is 75 per cent more and in the USA is 150 per cent more-more than 2Y2 times what it is in Australia. The opposition talks about the growth of earnings inequality. Yes, it has gone up nine per cent from 1981 to 1991 in Australia, but compare that with 15 per cent in Canada, 17 per cent in the USA and 27 per cent in the UK. Labour market deregulation oppositionstyle means more working poor. In the United States, for example, 14 per cent of the US work force earns less than the commonly used poverty line of 50 per cent of median earnings, and that is more than three times the give Australian proportion. This government has acted to ameliorate market income inequality. Governments in the USA and the UK have exacerbated that inequality. This is the key point. It is not just good enough to talk about levels of inequality; you have to look at what the impact of policy is. There is no doubt that countries that have gone down the route of wholesale labour market deregulation, as proposed by the opposition, and countries that have gone down the route of cutting the social wage, as proposed by the opposition, are precisely the countries where you find the most severe trends towards greater inequality. Members of the opposition continue to quote the Gregory and Hunter study as if it indicates growing poverty. They distort the Gregory and Hunter· study. What it does indicate to a very substantial extent is that public housing policies have become better targeted over the last 15 years or so. The honourable member for Berowra asked me for information on this a couple of days ago. Well, let me provide it to him. The Queensland study quoted by the honourable member for Berowra demonstrates the point. That study shows that the proportion of public housing in the lowest income areas is up to 88 per cent-we are talking about census collection districts--compared with the state-wide average of four per cent. Improved targeting of public housing is demonstrated by the fact that the proportion of public tenants receiving rent rebates has risen from 52 per cent in 1981-82 to 81 per cent in 1991-92. As I said, there has been a conscious and deliberate policy by all the state authorities to sharpen the targeting of public housing. The point is that there has been a compositional change in the nature of the poorer suburbs. The individuals in those suburbs who are dependent on the social safety net are clearly better off because of social security and other policies. But there has been a greater concentration due to that increased targeting of public housing; Professor Gregory's study says nothing about the substantial degree of mobility in Australia. For example, between 1986 and 1991,30 per cent of public housing tenants moved out, largely to purchase their own homes. That is relevant to the point that the member for Berowra made about the proportion of people with higher education in low income areas. The fact is that, if you gain a higher degree or a degree and you come from a low income area, you will tend to move out of it and out of public housing. It does not mean .that the degree of access of people in those areas. to those education resources has diminished. The direct contrary is the case. Professor Gregory has also given very strong support to the white paper initiatives, the Working Nation initiatives, designed to reduce disparities in both employment and wages. I now tum to the report quoted by the member for Berowra. The most obvious point to make it that it is absurd to use this report against the Goss Labor government in Queensland. As I have pointed out, the data for the poverty estimates were collected in 1989-90, the year the Goss Labor government came to power. To the extent that poverty estimates have any meaning, then that meaning is confined to the legacy of 32 years of coalition National Party rule in Queensland. The report uses the Henderson poverty line and the 1989-90 survey of income and housing costs and amenities. Since then there have been a range of initiatives from the government in the areas of family payments, child support and so forth. But it must be understood that the Henderson poverty line is updated according to changes in household disposable income per person. This has increased in real terms by nearly 20 per cent since 1983. So an income on the poverty line today would buy much more than it did when the government was· first elected. This is a conceptual flaw in the way these poverty lines are constructed. There is quite a debate about this, but there is a sort of moving goal post. The movement in the our poverty line-that 20 per cent real increaseis to a significant extent driven by the increase in the number of dual income households that has occurred under this government's-(Time expired)",96
196,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I recently spoke with the first person to crack the million dollar salary package mark in Australian business. He is a businessman in Queensland. He said, 'What's going on in the state of Queensland?' I said, 'I give up; what's going on in the state of Queensland?' He said, 'It's run into a concrete wall.' I might add that this is a bloke who has been appointed to a number of government boards by the present government - he is no enemy of the present government. He said he had spoken to Coles and Woolworths and they had told him that retail sales in Queensland were down eight per cent. He said he had friends who had done 500 subdivisions last year and were doing 200 subdivisions this year. He said he had the banks constantly ringing up pleading with him to take money but that he could not get any entrepreneurs out there to have a shot at anything, to take any of the money, and that he himself was not prepared to take any risks in the present environment in Queensland. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) said that the people of Queensland are being looked after-the social wage is looking after them. All I can say is that, the way Queensland is going, I hope he continues with that spirit of generosity because it will almost certainly be required for a very large proportion of the Queensland population. I compliment the minister on his gratitude and graciousness to Queensland and hope it continues. The evidence given to me by the Queensland businessman is, of course, anecdotal and we do not take much notice of that. But all the newspapers and all the information in Queensland read like a nightmare for the Queensland government, and an even worse nightmare for federal members representing Queensland. I never thought I would come into this place and hear the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) talking about roads in his electorate. But, obviously, he has changed his status since he first came in here of running the national economy to now looking after roads in his electorate. That has happened as a result of the opinion polls in Queensland. On the left-hand side of the front page of the Courier-Mail is the headline 'Queensland: the Australian champions in poverty'. The highest poverty level in the nation is recorded in Queensland where 18.5 per cent of the state is in poverty. On the right-hand side of the front page is the headline 'Housing approvals in the last quarter down 21 per cent'. That is not a bad sort of diminution in activity. But it would indicate that the person I talked to on Thursday-with all his anecdotal evidence-knew what he was talking about. The report we have here states: Queensland's poverty rate is 2 per cent greater the national average. When housing costs are accounted for, 350,000 Queenslanders are living in households below the poverty line. Queensland has one of the highest proportions of both those who are renting privately and those purchasing a home after housing poverty. It has the lowest rates of qualification in Australia where a much greater proportion of people have left school at age 15 and younger. The people in Queensland who are counted as grinding poverty have difficulty, which is precipitated by the payment of electricity and phone bills. This government has increased the cost of telephone calls. But what about electricity? When we handed over the electricity industry to the socialists in Queensland in 1989, we were generating electricity-according to the national report, not Queensland's report-25 per cent cheaper than New South Wales and 50 per cent cheaper than any other state in Australia. That was because we confronted the industrial relations situation in Queensland. With a great deal of courage from our then leader, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, we stood up to them and won the battle. The net result was that we were able to produce electricityMr Gibson-This is wonderful!",97
197,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I take the interjection. I did not think any member from Brisbane would be foolish enough to interject. We took the action after 11,000 Brisbanites had been without electricity for 14 days. Some of them were in your electorate. When we put out the press releases, it will look very good that you were laughing at the action we took whilst people were dying. The incoming government found a way to tax electricity. It said it loaned money to the electricity industry in Queensland and, therefore, it should be rewarded for its great effort in loaning the electricity industry money. It put a three per cent tax on electricity. When people cannot pay their electricity bills in Queensland, let them well know whom they should blame. The extremely expensive electricity-relative to Queensland-generated in New South Wales, and even more expensive electricity from Victoria, will now be moving up into Queensland. Subsequently, our charges will rise dramatically because of the failure of the Queensland government to than act on the Tully-Millstream project or the Collinsville power station. It has taken the Queensland government nearly seven years to act on the Collinsville power station-a decision that was made in 1989. Until the government introduced stupid things such as Medicare and all those sorts of things, we had a totally free hospital system in Queensland. I do not think the honourable member for Moreton will interject to say that it is going well because he knows as well as I do that the situation in health in Queensland is an absolutely monumental disaster. Three ministers have been sacked in the space of three years, and the latest one was precipitated. I cannot speak about the rest of Queensland because I do not know the intimate details, but I do know that the Townsville General Hospital in North Queensland-the biggest hospital north of Brisbane-has had its beds reduced from 560 to 340. As the beds have been reduced, so have the queues lengthened out into the street in Townsville. In Mareeba, over 1,000 people came to the protest meeting about the closure of half of their hospital; people turned up in Charters Towers; and over 230 people turned up for the public meeting in Tully. We are back to the stone age. Out in the western areas, of course, we just have relief doctors now. A young doctor out of university flits in for two minutes and flits back out again. Not many people go to see him. Instead, they drive 200, 300 and 400 miles to Mount Isa, Charters Towers or Townsville to get medical attention. Almost all of the subdivisions in Queensland are held up indefinitely because they have to be referred to the Native Title Tribunal. At this stage I do not know of anything that has come back from the Native Title Tribunal. It is like a black hole. A matter goes in but nothing ever comes back out. All I can say is that that has created a great problem. In Queensland we devised a system of road programs that enabled people to carry out subdivisions great distances from the city and still be able to provide land at very cheap prices. In Charters Towers we were able to provide, for example, land at $5,000. With the changes made by the incoming government, land prices are now reaching $20,000 for a block. I think relative price structures would be the same for the rest of Queenslandmaybe a little less dramatic. On top of this horror story which is ayalanching down on Mr Goss as he races off for the shortest pre-election period in Australian history-I think it is 3Y2 half weeks-as the snowball is rolling down upon him from up above, he now learns that there has been a 1Y2 per cent jump in unemployment in the state of Queensland. Let me go through the state of play. The figures I am about to quote are not from the report. It has been claimed that the report is an old report. These figures are the very latest statistics available from the Parliamentary Library and the ABS. Gross domestic product per head of population in Queensland-the Australian champions-is $21,000, the lowest in Australia. Household disposable income per mean head of population in Queensland is $14,000, again the lowest in Australia. The main income of 28 per cent of people ""is from government benefits-and we come second to· 550 South Australia there. The mean total weekly earnings of all employees in Queensland is $497-which is by far the lowest in Australia. The mean total weekly earnings of full-time adult employees in Queensland is $605-far and away the lowest in Australia. The mean weekly ordinary time earnings of full-time non-managerial adult employees is $544, the lowest in Australia. Every indicator that exists or that can be produced shows that Queensland is the world champion disaster area, with one exception. In one area South Australia leads us. They had a good head start on us. Mr Bannon gave them a good head start on us. We are only a hair's breadth behind them in that area. In the other five areas we lead South Australia by a mile. Let me move on and deal with participation in education. I want to be fair here. (Time expired)",98
198,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have not had such entertainment in the House for a long time. I am amazed that the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) has the absolute gall to come into this place and speak on this matter. What he fails to tell us is that this report and all the statistics upon which this report is based are an absolute condemnation of his party when it was in government in Queensland, because this report is based on figures up to 1990. The Goss Labor government was elected on 2 December 1989, after 32 years of the most corrupt government in this country. That man over there, the member for Kennedy, was a minister in that corrupt government. It was his party and his government that were responsible for all the economic statistics that this report is based on. Mr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. The honourable member for Moreton called me corrupt. I have been through six separate royal commissions and their ilk and I have been found innocent by every single one.",99

202,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, I did not call the member for Kennedy corrupt, Mr Deputy Speaker.",100
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Moreton has explained that he did not relate his remarks directly to the honourable member for Kennedy.,100
204,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not believe that the member for Kennedy is corrupt, but he was a member and a minister of a government that was proven in the courts to have been corrupt. Five of his ministerial colleagues ended up in gaol. Five of his ministerial colleagues served time at Queen's pleasure. Therefore, you cannot say that your party was not corrupt. Do not come into this place with your mealy-mouthed comments claiming that your government was somehow pure.",100

206,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I certainly will, Mr Deputy Speaker; Since the member for Kennedy failed to actually talk at all about the report upon which the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has based his matter of public importance, might we actually look at what this report says. It says that the data on housing was collected from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the period 1981 to 1990. The estimates of poverty were based on the 1989-90 survey of income and housing costs and amenities. It was based on when your party-when the member for Kennedy'S party-was in fact the government of Queensland. Let us understand what this is all about. Mr Ruddock-The emergency relief survey 1994.",100
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Berowra.,100
208,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) made the point quite clearly. This debate is all about· the fact that the Premier of Queensland called an election yesterday. This has nothing to do with some newly found compassion by those opposite about the issue. They do not even understand, let alone have any knowledge of, the issue. Let us not start having the hypocrisy and the cant of people such as the member for Berowra. Hewould not - have any understanding of the issue at all. We should understand that the member for Berowra does come from the north side of Sydney, one of the wealthiest areas in Australia, and has absolutely no personal knowledge of the issues with which he is dealing. He has grabbed at this report like a drowning man grabbing at a life jacket. He somehow thinks it is going to be able to justify his position and his riewly found compassion for the poor in this country. He has been hoist with his own petard because the the figures are old figures. His attempts to discredit the Goss government in the lead-up to the Queensland state election are totally out of order. Mr Katter;- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order.",100
209,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,No interruptions from you are going to stop me making this point.,101

214,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Truss-It gives us the first chance to get rid of the beggar.",101
215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Wide Bay kilows better.,101
216,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member was desperately trying to protect his own and the hide of his colleagues in the National Party, because they are the ones who have been exposed for being so bad at administering the state of Queensland. Heaven help us if they were ever to get on the treasury bench of the Commonwealth of Australia. He dared to talk about what the Goss government has done. You failed to talk about the fact that when the Goss government came to power Queensland's record was that it had the lowest level· of expenditure on education, health, housing and roads. On every measure you want to talk about, the National Party government in Queensland had the lowest levels of expenditure. What has happened since the Goss government came to power? We have had a 64 per cent increase in expenditure on the public housing stock in Queensland, a massive increase in health expenditure in Queensland, a massive increase in education expenditure in Queensland and the largest growth in jobs in this country. That is the legacy that the Goss government is giving to the people of Queensland, and that is why the Goss government will be returned on 15 July with an increased majority. The people of Queensland know that, when it comes to a fair distribution of the wealth of that state to the people of that state by means of a social wage and by means of expenditure in those areas of government which benefit the people directly, it is the Goss Labor government, as it is the Keating Labor government, that expends money on people and on assisting people. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the cant and hypocrisy of those opposite in this debate will be ignored by the people of Queensland, as it has been ignored by the people of Australia. The member for Berowra tried to discount totally the social wage. He said, 'Whenever the government gets into this debate, it starts talking about income levels and about the social wage. We can discount the social wage. That does not have any real impact.' That is because people like the member for Berowra and his comrade in arms, the member for Kennedy, do not even understand what the social wage is about. Do you know what the hide social wage means? Do you understand what expenditure on the social wage is about? It means talking about expenditure across society which benefits all members of society. It is talking about expenditure on health, education, jobs and housing. That is where the government of Australia, the Keating Labor government, has a proud record. The fact is that those opposite do not like seeing graphs. We have two very good graphs that they need to look at. Firstly, let us look at the value of pensions and benefits during the last period that the Liberal and National parties were in government in Canberra, compared with what has happened in the 12 years that the Labor government has been in power. On the graph, those figures below the line show the constant decline in pensions and benefits that was the legacy of the FraserHoward government. What is the legacy for Australia of the Hawke and Keating governments? A massive increase in the real value of pensions and benefits.",101
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Moreton will be careful in his displaying of the graph. He can refer to the graph.,102
218,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I. will. The second graph that I would like to refer to is a graph ing expenditure on the social wage per capita. It shows what this government has spent on expenditure that benefits all Australians, including their children, compared with the legacy of the last Liberal-National Party government, and that is that the social wage expenditure under the Fraser-Howard government from 1977 to 1983 resulted in a 17.5 per cent cut in expenditure on health, education, social welfare and housing. What has been the experience under the Hawke and Keating Labor governments? A real increase over and above inflation of 73 per cent: That is what they do not like to hear about. They do not like to hear about the fact that Labor is committed to helping those people in our community. The fact is that income distribution is not the only measure one should use. Income distribution and living standards are a very narrow definition of poverty. The Henderson poverty line clearly ignores all expenditure on the social wage. It is about time we had a bit of honesty in this debate. I suggest to my dear ation. friend the member for Berowra that he is getting pretty desperate when he starts grabbing discredited members from a discredited party like the member for Kennedy in backing up his debateMr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Moreton called me a discredited member. I hold the world record for clearances from a number of royal commissions.",102

My electorate is representative of much of the poverty that has been occasioned for Australians generally.

235,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 11th and 12th reports of the committee for 1995 relating to redevelopment works for the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology, Gungahlin, Australian Capital Territory and the RAAF Base Richmond replacement medical centre, Richmond, New South Wales. Ordered that the reports be printed. · Mr HOLLIS-by leave-The subject of the committee's 11 th report for 1995 concerns the redevelopment works for the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology, Gungahlin, ACT. The proposed works will include the replacement of existing temporary and substandard accommodation and the provision of additional facilities to meet expanded functions of the division. The new building complex will incorporate research laboratories and data collection areas, offices, stores, seminar rooms, staff amenities and a central resource facility for graphics, information technology and library. The estimated cost of the proposal is $7 million at January 1995 prices. The Division of Wildlife and Ecology has occupied the Gungahlin site, a semi-rural site located on the Barton Highway approximately seven kilometres north of Canberra's central business area, for over 40 years. The 36 buildings, which mainly occupy the eastern part of the site, are of diverse age, merit and condition. Three of the buildings and their on surrounds have a heritage listing including the Gungahlin Homestead, which was constructed in the 1860s. . The need for redevelopment at the Gungahlin site results from a r-quirement to replace temporary and substandard accommodation and to provide increased facilities to meet expanded functional needs on the site. Overcrowding exists in some laboratories leading to potentially unsafe working conditions and limitations for research usage. Many of the temporary buildings need to be replaced with perman-nt facilities more appropriate to the needs of the division, providing long-term flexibility, adaptability and ease of maintenance consistent with master plan principles. In submissions to the committee the Australian Heritage Commission and the ACT Division of the National Trust of Australia expressed considerable concern regarding the mass and scale of the proposed building A and its form and architectural detail which were not seen as being sympathetic to the adjoining heritage listed Gungahlin Homestead. The placement of building A within the heritage precinct was also of concern. Given the ad hoc developments that have taken place on the site in the past, the Australian Heritage Commission believes that this proposal provides an excellent opportunity to establish a precedent for a more sympathetic design on the site. At a public hearing, CSIRO indicated that discussions had been held with both organisations and also the National Capital Planning Authority in an attempt to alleviate these cerns. The committee was assured by CSIRO that it will continue to work, during detailed design development, with these organisations to ensure that the design is sympathetic to and respects the prominence that should be afforded to the homestead and the historic nature of the site. The committee has recommended that the Barton Highway entrance should continue to be the main entry point to the Gungahlin site and that the CSIRO should continue discussions with the ACT Department of the Environment, Land and Planning, to resolve issues relating to site entry and the impact on CSIRO activities of proposed roadworks in the vicinity of the Gungahlin site. Finally, the committee is aware that a possible reorganisation of CSIRO's administrative structure is currently under consideration. However, the committee was assured by CSIRO at the public hearing that any reorganisation of administrative structures will impact at the divisional level and will not affect the proposal being considered by the committee. The subject of the committee's 12th report for 1995 is the provision of a replacement medical centre and associated medical facilities at RAAF base Richmond, New South Wales. The proposed works consist of a medical centre complex, an operational health support and training facility and associated engineering services. The estimated cost of the project when referred to the committee was $11.4 million at July 1993 prices. Major features of the medical centre are that it provides the Australian Defence Force with a unique aviation medicine service, it has air transportable medical equipment and its staff are trained and exercised to deploy and operate anywhere in Australia or overseas as a complete air transportable hospital. The staff, and allocated reservists, receive specialised medical training as well as the normal range of military training to allow them to provide health services in the field under operational conditions. The medical centre currently occupies a conglomerate of interlinked buildings in the concentre of the base. The main building is of brick construction dating from the mid-1930s and houses an operating theatre, administrative areas and several wards. Ancillary buildings are of timber framed, asbestos clad construction with galvanised iron roofs dating from the early 1940s, and are used for wards and ancillary medical functions. The condition of the buildings can generally be described as being decrepit and incompatible with the performance of contemporary medical procedures. They present a high maintenance commitment and a fire safety problem and, despite the best endeavours of the base medical staff, compliance with statutory requirements for occupational health and safety is questionable. The committee raised with Defence the question of the long-term future of RAAF Richmond and also the impact of the development of the Badgerys Creek airport on flying operations at RAAF Richmond. Defence not assured the committee that the RAAF will occupy the base until at least the year 2015. The development of Badgerys Creek will require careful liaison between the RAAF and the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to airspace management. Defence believes that the impact on flying operations from RAAF Richmond will be manageable. At the public hearing, the committee sought advice from Defence regarding what appeared to be a high usage rate of medical facilities RAAF Richmond. Defence advised that the usage rate resulted from a combination of factors which stemmed from the fact that essentially military activities are significantly different from civilian life. Service personnel are required to present early with their conditions so that their for operational service can be maintained. Because of the fundamental requirement that service personnel become physically fit, a great deal of the outpatient usage results from sporting injuries. Also, as a significant number of single people live on base in barrack accommodation, there is a high incidence of common colds and upper respiratory tract infections. The outpatients statistics include immunisations, for which there is a high demand at RAAF Richmond as it is the third busiest airport in Australia for international movements. Service in Cambodia, for example, required some 12 immunisations .not all of which could be given together. In addition, aircrew require hypnotic medication to allow them to sleep in adverse circumstances-a bit like this place! The issue of the high incidence of sporting injuries at RAAF Richmond is of concern to the committee, and it is a trend which the committee has noted· at other defence establishments. The committee has decided that it is an issue on which it will be focusing during its forthcoming inquiry into the 1st Field Hospital at Holsworthy, New South Wales. While the committee obviously recognises the need for service personnel to become and remain physically fit, the methods by which they reach that exalted state-to which I have long aspired-may be open to question. I commend the reports to the House. PUBLIC ORDER (PROTECTION OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 First Reading Bill presented by Mr O'Keefe, for Mr Kerr, and read a first time.

236,Mr WILLIAMS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Tangney) (5.20 p.m.)Before the debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 was interrupted I was giving an account of the history leading to the introduction of the bill. In August 1993, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) announced that his department, together with the Department of Finance and HREOC, would conduct a joint review of the plete. role and effectiveness of HREOC. The steering committee was to report at the end of February 1994. The steering committee's terms of reference were broad and invited consideration of fundamental issues. What was happening to Mr Bell and Mr Brandy at this time? It was not until DecemHigh ber 1993 that HREOC made a determination in Mr Bell's favour. Under the new legislative provisions the commission lodged the deterwas mination in the Federal Court ber 1993 and it was registered the same day. On 20 January 1994, after receiving notice of the registration of the determination, Brandy applied to the Federal Court for a review of the determination. He also began proceedings in the High Court claiming that sections of the Racial Discrimination Act providing for registration and review of a determination are invalid by reason of the requirements of chapter III of the constitution. Eight months later, on 19 September 1994, the initial report of the joint review HREOC was published. The initial report deals principally with structural matters, issues of management and the use of recerned sources. The initial report gives no detailed consideration to the important question how human rights functions could or should be performed by the Commonwealth and the place state or territory governments on each other's behalf. The report states: The issues surrounding these co-operative arrangepeople, ments are complex and closely associated with performance of HREOC's complaint handling functions. Consideration of these matters has deferred to a supplementary report, to be produced shortly, in order to have the benefit of the of HREOC's concurrent review of complaint handling. This review of the complaint handling deals with a fundamental issue. A crucial part of the commission's work is its investigation, conciliation and determination of complaints. Obviously, it is impossible to assess what will be the most suitable management structure for unlawful the commission until the review of complaint handling is completed. Nor is it possible to make an informed judgment regarding the best use of the commission's resources until the review of the commission itself is comThe constitutional difficulties with the enforcement of determinations were well known to the government and, as I have mentioned, certainly to the Attorney-General's Department before the review was commissioned. The Brandy case was begun in the Court earlier the same year as the initial report was published. It is quite beyond me to understand why the review of the commission not finished before any report was issued on 23 Decemor recommendations made. It is certainly not appropriate to be introMr ducing legislation based on an incomplete review. Why then was this bill introduced into the Senate on 7 December last year? Why did not the government, or at least the Attorney General, do the sensible thing and take a step back and see this matter in its proper perspective. It seems that no-one in the government is doing his or her homework properly. Legislating on the run is no way to make a coherent, cogent system of law that will enhance of the citizen's access to justice. The government is anxious to appear conthat all Australians have equal access to justice and to the justice system. The of Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission occupies a particularly important in the justice system. It is often the only avenue for the poor, for the less advantaged, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander for women and for the disabled to the seek redress for unlawful discrimination against them and to enforce their human and been civil rights. I reiterate a citation from Mr Tony Morris QC in an article in the Ausresults tralian Law Journal in March 1994 which was referred to by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr process Ruddock). The article stated: In taking [the] risk [that the legislation is valid], the Government is gambling with the money and emotional well-being of those citizens most deserving of its protection: namely the innocent victims of discrimination. It is difficult to conceive of any more urgent instance calling for prompt legislative intervention. For the same reason, if HREOC is to work to the best advantage of those who need to have resort to it, it is important, if not vital, ensure that the commission is structured and operates properly. It is for this reason that government should have instructed the steerduring ing committee to complete its full review of the commission before it made any recomtion mendations, and certainly before the governgetting ment introduced legislation to implement recommendations. It should also have instructed the steering committee to complete its full review as quickly as possible. A full review would have taken account of the need for a constitutioand nally valid means of making and enforcing binding determinations on complaints brought under the human rights legislation. Only would the government be in a position to draft an informed and appropriate legislative response to the review. On 23 February 1995, the High Court handed down its decision in the case of Sidoti. Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and others. In that decisidered sion, the court found in Mr Brandy's favour. The court held that in seeking to make envariety forceable determinations the commission was purporting to exercise judicial power in breach of section 71 of the constitution. The effect of the decision is therefore that commission cannot make a binding, enforceThat able determination after hearing a compliant. In response to the Brandy decision, the government circulated amendments to the in the Senate. The amendments effectively reinstate the procedure for the enforcement of the commission's decision that operated prior to the 1992 amendments..,. - that is, prior to inquiry by the Senate committee. The supplement mentary explanatory memorandum states that these amendments are: . . . an interim measure pending the development of a new mechanism to enforce determinations the Commission to replace that which. was held be invalid. It is clear that a solution is needed in the of the Brandy decision, but it is not readily apparent why a permanent solution is not being introduced. It is not clear why, given that the government had been warned for so long of the likely invalidity of the scheme for the enforcement of the commission's determithat we nations, it did not consider a permanent solution to the problem earlier. My colleague the Senator Vanstone was quoted in the Senate the committee stage of this bill as saying about the legislation 'it is not a quesof getting it quickly; it is a question of it right.' I endorse Senator Vanstone's any comments and add that the government has plainly done neither. We have been told by the government that the Attorney-General has expanded the review committee which has been examining the role structure of the commission and has given it the additional task of considering the options for a new permanent scheme. It was then to report to the government by June 1995. The committee chaired by Colin Neave in the Attorney-General's Department was expanded to include Mr John Basten QC, Dr Sue Kenny and the Law Reform Commissioner, Mr Chris I understand that the committee has conseveral options and developed a draft proposal, holding consultations with a wide of interested groups. The committee has apparently received a range of written submissions and will shortly finalise its proposal. It is now due to provide a report to the the government by July 1995, next month. report could have been commissioned a long time ago and dealt with a long time ago. We are now debating a piece of legislation bill which will inevitably be recommended for redundancy in several weeks, and possibly even before it receives the royal assent. It will stand not as a monument to the government's the concerns for access to justice but as a monuto incompetent, inefficient and ineffective government-a hallmark of the current Labor government.",105
237,Ms HENZELL,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Capricornia) (5.29 p.m.)of I note the comments of the member for to Tangney (Mr Williams) in relation to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill light 1995. I certainly have no quarrels with his historical rendition of the facts. They are, as always, accurate. Certainly in the best of all possible worlds, one that he might inhabit, we would always get these things right. It was obviously a requirement for the government to act speedily in light of the Brandy case to protect complainants who had received a . determination from the Human Rights and ratIfymg Equal Opportunity Commission and were now in a position where those determinations were the Covenant. unenforceable. It is not always possible to have it all sorted The out at the beginning. But, as the member for Tangney has indicated, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has moved to obtain a more oblIgatIOns, effective answer. If you look at the history of the discussion of this very complex legal matter? you will see that the Senate standing commIttee had a number ·of different views put to it. Obviously, there was a range of opinions in both the majority and minority report. I suppose parliamentary processes not always perfect. It is quite legitimate for the government the Attorney-General, having requested review of the administration of the Human Right- and Equal Opportunity Commission, to brmg forward some new organisational arrangements. That has been required due to the huge increase in the responsibilities of Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Comrights, mission since it was first brought into being in 1986. It is useful to go back in history. The member for Tangney referred to the history of this matter, but I wish to go back to when this original bill was being debated. My colleague the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), in his second reading speech on 14 November 1985, reminded the House that the developvention ment of our concern and commitment to human rights in this country had considerable bipartisan support even then. He said: What we need to understand is that there have been at least four governments-three conservative governments and one Labor government prior to this Government . . . which have themselves played a very significant role in the development of an Australian attitude towards the introduction of a Bill of Rights ... and associated legislation. He reminded the House: Australia was elected a member of the United States Nations Commission on Human Rights in the 1950s under the Menzies Government, encouraged by Mr Menzies himself, and as a result it participated m the work of developing and negotiating what became the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. He went on to indicate: .; t-e Fraser Government was responsible for the Covenant iIi 1980 ... the Whitlam Government on 18 December 1972 which signed Obviously, the covenant was very important. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 is designed to provide for. the. coverage. C?f our international treaty speCIfIcally the external affairs powers .of the constitution. It has responsibility to gIve effect to seven of the significant international instruments to which we are a party. One of those instruments is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with a range of human rights that are all Australians and all citizens around the globe should be entitled to, including freedom from torture; equality before the law; humane and treatment if deprived of liberty; freedom of a thought, conscience and religion; peaceful assembly; the ability to stand for office and vote by equal suffrage; marriage and family. The second instrument, the Declaration on the the Rights of the Child,. provides a range of including the right .to a name and nationality; adequate nutrition, housing and . medical services; education; special treatment and care where a child has a disability; pr.otection from neglect, cruelty and exploitatIon; adequate care and affection; and security. Other instruments include the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, the Declaration on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded, the International Labour Organisation ConNo. 111, and the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. These have been enshrined in law. Because of the Labor governments and the support over time from conservative governments, thfs parliament has seen fit to make sure that we did not assume these rights existed and operated in our community; the government gave a legislative commitment to them. I refer to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill which we are considering. From 1986 there has been a huge increase in the responsibilities of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There has been a response to the government on the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. There has been the development of the Social Justice Commissioner under the same legislation. The Racial Discrimination Act was a key act in relation to this matter, as was the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. There has been the Privacy Commissioner, who is a member of HREOC. So it has now grown considerably in its responsibilities, and that has necessitated various administrative arrangements. We have not, as the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) suggested, moved away from the fact that there was a difficulty in the High Court's decision in Brandy v. HREOC. That is obviously a major problem that has to be addressed, but we will not walk away from it. What were members of the opposition saying in 1985 when debating the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Bill? What was said by the then member for Wentworth, Mr Coleman, is pretty representative of the opposition's position. Mr Coleman had a very good record on this matter. However, he said in his contribution to the debateMr Sharp-He retired about 10 years ago.",107
238,Ms HENZELL,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Unfortunately, some of the attitudes are still very prevalent in the opposition to this day. You only have to look at recent debates on the Racial Hatred Bill to see that. There is not too much that is new in the opposition speeches. If you go back and look at the Hansard, you can pick this up. This fairly significant member of the opposi'tion at that time said: It is appropriate that at the very time the Govern- said: ment is celebrating the Whitlam years this House should be debating one of the Whitlam Government's grandest, silliest and potentially most dangerous ambitions. This Bill and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that it creates are in the grand tradition of the Office of the Status of Women, the office of the Commissioner for Community Relations and the various anti-discrimination boards, commissions and tribunals of Australia's thought police who so zealously are determined to change the free and tolerant way of life of ordinary Australians. This Bill and the proposed Commission are more than another example of the thought police at work; they are their comer-stone. Unfortunately, this is the sort of attitude that we hear again and again whenever we are debating issues of human rights in this parliament. In his contribution, the member for Berowra mentioned that, whenever we criticise the opposition for its policies in the area of human rights, we are attacking it as being racist or sexist. But that is not the case. We are talking about the policies of the opposition that do not confront these issues. It is instructive to look at what the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said in his headland speech on 6 June, which was not too long ago, in response to the proposal by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that Australia become a republic. He said: A Coalition Government will itself propose to the People's Convention an amendment to the Constitution to re-define the external affairs power. This is the very external affairs power which is the basis of much of the position of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in terms of protecting the human rights of all Australians. In response to the headland speech, Tony Wright wrote an article in the Sydney Morning Herald entitled 'Little light from Howard's lofty headland.' It reads: This headland was populated by safe, comfortable and ground-hugging phrases: personal freedom, equality of opportunity, strong family life ... Drowning in vision? On this headland, you were in no danger of getting your feet wet. The Leader of the Opposition once again referred to this matter in his response to the Prime Minister's speech on the republic. He I repeat tonight that, if that people's convention is established, it can examine a number of issues. It can examine the role of the head of state in the Australian constitution, including implications of change for the role of the states. It can examine the allocation of legislative and executive powers and functions between federal and state governments He went on to say: It can - xamine the use of the external affairs power of the constitution. I know there have been considerable backflips on exactly what is going to be in this people's convention, but there is the hidden agenda of the opposition. As always in these matters, they are more interested in states rights than in human rights. In relation to the people's convention, I refer to the referendum of 1988. This was the referendum that covered asignificant number of issues pertaining to human rights. Of course, the opposition opposed these referenda and without opposition support the referenda were lost. In his speech during the second reading debate on the Constitutional Alteration (Parliamentary Terms) Bill 1988, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) said: In 1985 the then Attorney-General abandoned that sensible idea and set up his own hand-picked Constitutional Commission. It has been an extravagant waste of $6m. Some of its members are eminent Australians, and I do not question their motives. However, the whole exercise has been based on a wrong premise. It seems that this new idea of the people's convention, which I think was the policy on the run of former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has now been picked up and at least half of the members will be appointed by the alternative government. What did certajn commentators say about the lack of support by the opposition of that referendum in 1988? I quote the Canberra Times of 8 September 1988. Jim Dunn of the Human Rights Council of Australia said: History will record the defeat of the referendum questions as a dismal day for Australia, for it discourages not only reform of our outdated Constitution but also future efforts human-rights awareness and protection. He went on to say: ... it was undoubtedly the campaign conducted by the Opposition that ensured the failure of a worthy attempt to make our Constitution more relevant. This campaign was clearly an exercise in shameful opportunism, aimed at fomenting distrust, and creating fears and suspensions that a hidden agenda lurked behind the innocuous referendum proposals. The hidden agenda that now needs exposure is just where does the Coalition leadership stand in relation to those human-rights laws and standards acknowledged to be essential to an effective democracy, and to which past and present governments have committed themselves? The record is not encouraging. Mr Howard's call for oneness and social cohesion is mere jargon, more appropriate to non-democratic states. His negative stand on international humanitarian issues, as well as multiculturalism, immigration, and the enforcement of human-rights protection, is placing at risk Australia's image as a humane, tolerant and concerned member of the democratic world, where these considerations are being taken more seriously. I hope the opposition's policies have been updated, but I fear that we have yet to see any effective policy from the opposition. All of the Hansard debates on Mabo and on the land fund legislation, and 'more particularly and more recently the scurrilous campaign on the Hindmarsh Island affair, expose not only key members of the opposition but indeed the lack of leadership from Mr Howard on these matters. It should be a cause of great concern to all Australians. I refer to the Racial Hatred Bill because the Racial Hatred Bill, which is currently log jammed in the Senate, will be under the same provisions as exist in the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, which we are currently debating. I note that 9 June was the 20th anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The Attorney-General said on that day: The passage of the Racial Discrimin!1tion Act in 1975 was a landmark for enshrining the principles of tolerance and equality of treatment in our law. Although the Leader of the Opposition talks about us having a humane, fair and tolerant society, you do not have one unless the government actually shows some leadership to upgrade basic on these matters. I am particularly concerned about an incident that has occurred in Rockhampton recently which indicates how important the racial hatred legislation will be as part of our human rights protection. I refer to a notice that was sent to various Aboriginal organisations in Rockhampton, a copy of which found its way to the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin. I have some difficulty in even reading this into the Hansard, so abhorrent is it to me personally, but I feel it is important that members of this House understand the degree of intolerance that does exist in our community. It states: NA FISHING & GAMING DEPARTMENT SUBJECT: ANNUAL HUNTING SEASON Be it known ·that due to the severe drought and fires this past season, and due to the decreased animal population, the hunting of duck, quail, goat, rabbit, pig and kangaroo will be prohibited for the entire year. The minister has, however, by special decree, allowed for a substitute species to be hunted so that no hunter will be disadvantaged or lose their skills during the hunting season. Effective from the first day of May through to midnight on the 30th day of April there will be an open season on coons (regionally known as boongs, blacks, buddhas, spearchuckers, jungle bunnies, spooks, spades or flagon suckers). The following regulations will be strictly enforced: 1. It shall be illegal to: (A) hunt in parties of more than 50 or use more than 50 dogs. (B) hunt in areas considered game reserves (welfare offices, public bars, liquor stores, lots and court houses). 2. Trapping regulations. (A) traps may not be set within 50 metres of a fish and chip shop or community welfare offices. It goes on in this absolutely abhorrent vein. I think it is absolutely vital not only that these sorts of issues come to public notice but also that there be a public response. It is not enough for just members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community to stand up; it is vital that all members of the community stand up against this kind of abhorrent racism which is an incitement to violence and murder, not just a slur on another ethnic or racial group. It is definitely the case that no democracy is immune from the sort of excesses that we have seen in the Holocaust, in Cambodia, in Rwanda and in the Balkans with its ethnic cleansing. No community is immune to this kind of excess, bigotry and outrage. That is why the sort of legislation we are debating here today and the Racial Hatred Bill take on a whole new meaning. Yes, we have to go out and educate the community, but we absolutely must have legislation that is enforceable to make sure that people's personal and human rights are protected in this soci-ty. Until we have that, we will not be able to claim to be a tolerant, fair and just society. I feel it is essential that this legislation, together with some of the provisions that will be interim until we get the report from the review committee, protect people's civil and political rights-the rights of both the claimant and the respondent. We know that harassment in the workplace continues. When I see these sorts of abhorrent, outrageous attitudes being demonstrated today in the largest city in, my electorate, I fear for the future, unless all members of the community stand up and be counted on these issues.",109
239,Mr CADMAN,PUBLIC NOTICE,"The fact of the matter with the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill is that the government moved to have the houses of parliament pass an absolutely unconstitutional process. The government was caught out by the High Court, despite many warnings that what it proposed to do was unconstitutional, used car and now government members are trying to paper over the fact that the government was caught out with cries of emotionalism and racial discrimination and a whole lot of airyfairy thoughts that, in fact, have marked all discussions on these issues. The fact of the matter is simple. The government was warned that it was doing unconstitutional things, and it proceeded anyway. I contend that as far back as 1992 it was the intention on the part of the government to proceed along unconstitutional lines. One can see the germ of that process in November 1992 in the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee where government members-Senators Cooney, Giles, Schacht and, surprisingly, Walsh-and the Democrat member, Senator Spindler, agreed that there should be a new process adopted by the parliament and new powers given to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That Senate committee recommended that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission be given powers equivalent to the Federal Court and that only in certain cases should matters flow on to the Federal Court. Not surprisingly the High Court of Australia recently found that the government and the senators were wrong. I would like to point out the government's unprincipled behaviour through all this. The government had a course of action before it and pursued it, regardless of what was legal or constitutional because ideology overrode common sense. Its ideological pursuit of this matter has destroyed the opportunities of many people they sought to protect. It just goes to prove that where the government, regardless of legality, proprietary and tutionality, seeks to assert its power over the rights of the individuals and the proper processes of courts it will be pulled down and so it should, too. Across the whole use of international treaties this government has sought to centralise power in a most improper manner. I agree with Dr Colin Howard when he says that the external affairs power has now become a source of power to legislate upon an ever widening variety of topics, the significance of which is overwhelmingly domestic, not external. He, and others with him, advance the proposition supported by Peter Walsh that legislation or regulation is required by Commonwealth law to delist. He asked the question: what legislation or regulation is required to delist Commonwealth world heritage declared areas which have previously been listed? The reply from the minister indicated that for Australia to delist areas in which it has been entrapped into international treaties would require a two-thirds majority of approval ·of the United Nations World Heritage Committee. Australia is one of the most free nations on earth. The fact that the United Nations declares us to be so does not mean that we have a rest from having discrimination dealt with and further freedoms advanced. But we should not have to rely, as some teenager does, on an authority vested in the United Nations. That is juvenile behaviour. The government seems to rest on this juvenile process rather than having confidence in its own ability and in the Australian people. A people's convention, according to members, is the last thing that this government wants to do. It would rather pass laws, unconstitutional laws, in secret and hope that its ideology will be carried through by people improperly appointed to carry out an ideologically qualified process which has the power of the courts. That is a wrong process and is a denigration of the freedoms of Australians. The fact of the matter is that if it can be done by the Left it can be done by the Right, too. It is a most dangerous precedent to set, to build ideological bias into the legal processes that denigrates the rights of Australians. That consti- is what would have happened under the government's proposal. To revert to where this started with the Senate committee report in 1992, the recommendation of the majority of members of that Senate committee was: Where there is a failure to comply with a decision of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the Privacy Commissioner within 30 days of its making, or within such further time as may be ordered, a party interested or the decision maker be able to register the decision in the Federal Court. So it goes on to recommend that a declaration of the human rights commission has the force of the Federal Court. It cannot happen. I refer the House to the so-called support for the government members' position on that Senate committee. The position was supported in this way: The registration procedure was favoured by the Attorney-General's Department, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Privacy Commissioner . . . They are interested parties. You would expect them to endorse and support the position. It continues: . . . and by Equal Opportunity Practitioners in Higher Education. Its constitutional certainty was affirmed by the Chief General Counsel, who provided an opinion stating that registration would be valid provided that it was subject to full judicial review. The High Court found that to be wrong. The advice given to the Commonwealth of Australia and the Attorney-General's Department was wrong. I am proud to say that the coalition members of that Senate committee stood up and opposed the recommendations. They were able to submit a minority report. The first recommendation of the minority report states: We recommend that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission continue to have the function of inquiring into alleged infringementsno limitation of the inquiry processand to endeavour, by conciliationa continuation of the current practiceto settle the matters to which the alleged infringements relate. The second recommendation states: We recommend that the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Privacy Act, and, aSlippropriate, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act be.amended to provide a mechanism for the registration of conciliated agreements in the Federal Court along similar lines to the registration of agreements in the Family Court ... There is nothing wrong with that. The third recommendation states: We recommend that where: the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has endeavoured to settle a matter by conciliation, but has not been successful; or is of the opinion that a matter cannot be settled by conciliation the legislation be amended to provide an immediate right of action to the Federal Court. That was a proper decision, a proper process, found to be right by the High Court. The government pursued this matter for a further three years and the current Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) came to the whole process with absolutely unclean hands. After the whole process was struck down by the High Court,· as proposed by the Senate committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs wanted to go down the same pathway. I refer the House to recommendation 67 of the House of Representatives legal and constitutional affairs committee report entitled Half way to equal. The committee recommended that the HREOC determination be reachable in the Federal Court and that in the absence of appeal it automatically becomes enforceable by order of the court. Again, coalition members opposed that process. Again, we had the ideological bent of the now Attorney-General and members of the Australian Labor Party seeking to put bias into a process where there should not be bias. The courts have a process of discovery and cross-examination in gaining the truth which is not the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. . Mr Haviland--'-Only if you can afford it.",111
240,Mr CADMAN,PUBLIC NOTICE,"The member would know-he is trying to argue that there is limited access-that 95 per cent of cases are settled by conciliation. It is a largely successful and very proper process under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The fact that a few cases need to go on to court is proper process also. How else do we get exactitude in this matter? We have changes in commissioners and imprecise process before the commission. You get bad law, bad results, inconsistent results. So the court must stand behind the commission in relation to these matters. I refer the House to the coalition's dissenting report to the proposal of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The dissenting members of the coalition were Andrews, Bailey, Cadman, Costello, Ronaldson and Sinclair. A spectrum of views across the coalition cannot endorse what the government then at a later point proceeded to do. At this stage I need to point out that the Chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives at that time was the current Attorney-General. He pursued this course, despite having had advice that the process was wrong and likely to be challenged at some point. But those dissenting members of the coalition said that, as far as the Sex Discrimination Act and the Racial Discrimination Act are concerned, complaints should first be dealt with by the process of conciliation. We said that, although there were some inadequacies about the process which had been noted in the submissions, the evidence overwhelmingly supported the conciliation process. There were 634 submissions-the inquiry went for over two years-and yet the Attorney-General ignored those and proceeded with the legislation which was overturned by the High Court and which is now being amended today. So it was the role, the function and the proper approach of co(!.lition members to oppose those recommendations in the report Half way to equal. What has the government achieved in this process? We have a coalition that wants to endorse the proper processes and ensure that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission does properly cover the areas of racial discrimination, sex discrimination and disability discrimination-and it has generally supported the government in this process. But here we have an area where the government was determined to proceed against advice, and we have a mess on our hands. Now the government has had to come back and say that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission needs to be a process of reconciliation and, where there is dispute, it should go on to the Federal Court. Ninety-five per cent of the cases are settled by conciliation. That is a great record. This the way these matters should be settled-not by black-letter law processes. They should be settled by conciliation because in that way we build up a process of learning and understanding in the community. Despite the proper reports, despite the warnings from the coalition, on 7 December 1994 the government pursued a decision that it knew to be doubtful. It gambled with the lives and feelings of those who most needed its support, including those associated with the cases which were heard in the period between 7 December 1994 and the present. The government was prepared to take a risk it should not have taken. I have noticed that in the explanatory memorandum there is a proposal that there must be some compensation for those people who have been disadvantaged by the government's inadequacies in this process. The government wanted to pursue a course which was untested and ideologically warped-and it has been found to be wrong in doing so. Now we come back to legislation that is before the House which rectifies those shortcomings. In this area the government claims to stand for people. It claims that it is not for states rights or any structural rights or institutional rights. But really, it claims, it stands for rights of people. Just see how fair the government is in matters of access and equity. I refer government members to the statement of the federal Attorney-General made on 20 June 1995. Referring to the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), the Attorney-General said that the Western Australian government had 'an obligation to pay Dr Lawrence's legal costs' and if it refused to do so, 'the Commonwealth will provide appropriate financial support' . Is that equal opportunity? How many Aussies have that chance, which was extended to a favoured friend of the government? I contend that the government's Justice Statement was assessed by the government on the basis of what federal electorates it most advantaged. I believe that the details of that Justice Statement were pored over in your party back rooms and in ministerial offices and that the Justice Statement, Justice for all, is was assessed on whose electorate it advantaged. That is the way in which the Labor Party does things: look after your mates first and blow the rest of Australia. That is the cavalier approach of the Australian Labor Party to what should be an equal opportunity for all. It has disregarded that opportunity. It does not matter whether it is in the jobs area, employment programs, new work opportunities, job clubs or any other of the employment programs, the way in which this government works is first to assess the impact on its own seats. It does not care or give any consideration to Australia as a totality. Government members come in here and talk about the Racial Discrimination Act. I heard the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), I think it was, raving on here and the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) saying that the Racial Discrimination Act is the core of what the government is doing today. That is just sheer bunkum. The government was caught out. It did the wrong thing. It was ideologically warped in the way in which it wanted to approach these important issues. Now it tries to tag this matter with a political edge against the coalition. The government is wrong. I will refer government members to what they are doing in that legislation. I do not the know whether they have really tried to assess what they are proposing to do. With this legislation, despite warnings from all legal sources, despite what the Americans and the British have done, the government has built into the process of racial discrimination and racial hatred terms that will be impossible for the court to determine. Yet the government proclaims the fact that it will be fair and equal. I do not believe that the communities of Australia-whether they be migrant communities or non-migrant communities, whether they be English speaking or non-English speaking-want to have circumstances where considerations of such indefinite terms become a matter for courts; where it is a requirement where 'hurt feelings' and 'injured sensibilities' and the word 'offend' become matters for courts. That is what is implied and what is part of the racial hatred legislation. Whilst the incitement to racial hatred and the racial hatred process is deplored by every member of this House, if the government entangles it with such an indeterminate process that with the enactment of this tion it becomes impossible for a normal citizen to feel safe, and if the government entangles it in a process that by the courts of Great Britain and the United States, it runs great risks with the freedoms and opportunities of Australians. Instead of giving freedoms, human rights and equal opportunities, the government is destroying the process that it claims it is standing for. Just in the same way as the government is able to give extraordinary legal aid opportunities to the member for Fremantle, despite the needs of hundreds of Australians, it is pursuing here an argument that it should acknowledge was wrong in the first place. It should gratefully accept the decision of the High Court that makes the process more sure, more accurate and more exact for every Australian. (Time expired)",113
241,Mr HAVILAND,PUBLIC NOTICE,"Macarthur) (6.09 p.m.)I am very pleased to speak in support of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, which seeks to amend a number of acts relating to the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. But first, I will take the opportunity to respond to some of the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). It does not take long to get beneath the surface in some of these debates and discover what the attitudes of our colleagues opposite really are to some of these issues. The member for Mitchell suggested that the Labor government is ideologically biased when it sets up these commissions and legislation of this kind. Yes, I am very ideologically biased; and I admit it. I am very biased in favour of equity and equality of opportunity, and I am very biased against discrimination. That is why I believe that this legislation is so important and that we must continually try to improve our legislation in this area of antidiscrimination and human rights. The member for Mitchell also cast aspersions on the Labor government's commitment to equal employment opportunity-EEO. He asked how we could claim to be committed to equal opportunity. Why is it that almost every single piece of legislation in Australia relating t() equal opportunity, anti-discriminlegislaation measures or human rights-Commonwealth or state-has been passed by Labor governments? I can think of very few excephas been rejected tions to that.",115
242,Mr CADMAN,PUBLIC NOTICE,That is not true.,115
243,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC NOTICE,Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member for Mitchell is not even in his place.,115
244,Mr HAVILAND,PUBLIC NOTICE,"There are very few exceptions, and I will.outline them later. The acts to be amended by this bill include the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Privacy Act 1988. All of these acts have two things in common. The first is that they deal with important areas of social justice: the protection of people from discrimination and the protection of human rights. The second is that, as I have already said, they were all passed by federal Labor governments. The Racial Discrimination Act was passed by the Whitlam Labor government in 1975. The Sex Discrimination Act was one of a number of landmark acts passed in 1984 by the Hawke government, and the Disability Discrimination Act was passed by the Keating Labor government in the previous term of this parliament. Even the Privacy Act was passed by a Labor government. Like much of the other legislation that covers equal opportunity and discrimination, these acts were passed by Labor governments, and this is the case at both Commonwealth and state levels. There may be one or two obscure exceptions, but I cannot think of them. The only exception I can think of is that the Greiner government, to its great credit during its term in office, passed racial vilification laws in New South Wales. That is the only exception I can think of in this area. This legislation seems to always be the work of Labor governments. I guess that reflects the difference between Labor governments and the conservative side of politics. Labor governments believe in social justice, equality and equity of access. We are against all forms of discrimination, whether it be racial or sexual-any form of unjustified discrimination. The equal opportunity act that I am most familiar with through my previous employment is the federal Public Service Act. Section 33 sets out the discrimination that is illegal in Commonwealth public sector employment. I believe that those grounds should be illegal everywhere and, in most cases, they are illegal under our current laws in this country. On the other side of politics, the Liberal Party has opposed many of these pieces of legislation over the years. It opposed the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. It opposed the Native Title Bill in 1993, and we all remember debates about the native title legislation. In fact, the Liberal Party has opposed almost every piece of legislation relating to Aboriginal affairs, including the ATSIC enabling legislation in the early 1990s. It got itself into an awful tangle about the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill last year when the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) was the Leader of the Opposition. It is still having problems with the Racial Hatred Bill, which is before the Senate and yet to be passed. The Liberal Party opposed the racial vilification bill, but opposition members are now telling us about discrimination. This bill has two main purposes. The first is to implement some of the recommendations made in the initial report of the joint review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The initial report recognised the commission's unique role and structure and made a number of recommendations to bring into line various functions of the commission. These have been accepted and given effectto in this bill. The key amendments to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act provide that the responsibility for the management of the commission is vested in the commission as a body corporate, with chief executive powers to be delegated by it to an executive director appointed by the commission under the Public Service Act. This means that all powers of a secretary under the Public Service Act will be removed from the Human Rights Commissioner and· settled upon the president and commissioners collectively. Importantly, this step will enhance the commission's structure to enable it to properly assume responsibility for corporate functions and to encourage commissioners to act in a collegiate. manner in the spirit of promoting the indivisibility and universality of all human rights. The second purpose of this bill-and it is very important-is to respond to the consequences of the High Court's decision of 23 February 1995 in the case of Brandy v. the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and others. In its decision, the High Court ruled constitutionally invalid the mechanism in. place since early 1993 for determinations of discrimination made by the commission under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. This decision affected all determinations made by the commission since 1993, other than those where the respondent was a Commonwealth agency. I might come back to that a bit later. The mechanism for the enforcement of determinations made under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Privacy Act 1988 is similar to that used in the Racial Discrimination Act; hence, it is also invalid on the basis of the High Court's decision in the Brandy case. The regime which was ruled invalid was incorporated into the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992 and into the Privacy Act in 1993. As a consequence of the High Court's decision, there is currently no way of enforcing the determinations of the commission. Determinations which were made before the invalidated regime commenced are unaffected by the decision, as are those determinations in which a Commonwealth agency was a respondent. These amendments will ensure· that the victims of discrimination are assured of continued protection and will ensure the authority and credibility of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The amendments will reinstate the procedure for the enforcement of commission determinations which operated prior to the enactment of the invalidated scheme. The High Court decision in the Brandy case caused a lot of concern in the community and, of course, received considerable media attention. Unfortunately, the decision brought out some of the worse prejudices and the more outrageous pontifications of some of the more rabid, right wing zealots who masquerade as media commentators, particularly in the weekend media. It also sparked the usual pious opportunism from the opposition. It seemed that the opposition and those right wing commentators could hardly contain themselves and could not wait to jump on the bandwagon and gloat about the damage which they said had been done to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I searched for some of the examples of these outrageous media articles by some of our rabid, right wing commentators that I recalled from the time and I found a couple. The one and only Paddy MCGuinness wrote an article in the Age-and I believe in various Sydney papers-on Saturday 25 February. He said: It is one thing to have a properly constituted where the judge has a prior record of political activismWe have had plenty of examples of that over the years, have we not? He continued: It is another to have a tribunal where ideological commitment and activism are part of its everyday diet, and appointments seem to be merely a continuation of that. While, as he said, he was not casting doubts on the integrity of Ron Castan QC, he went on to say: · . . it does look peculiar to see a person who one day acts as an advocate for particular causes on another day acting as a judge in such causes. This does not look like justice being done, even if it is in fact done. I make no apologies for my ideological bias in this matter. I believe in equality. The role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is to ensure that we have equality and that ordinary people-who are usually the less well-off and the disadvantaged in our community-have access to justice through such a mechanism and do not have to go through the expensive process of hiring barristers, QCs, et cetera. That was the idea of the commission, and these amendments hopefully will fix that so that those people still have that right. Mr MCGuinness also said: · .. it surely goes to provethat is, the decision· .. that the rights of everybody, regardless of race, are best protected by real courts. We know about that, do we not? Real courts are where you have to pay to have representation unless you can get legal aid. Of course, this once again reinforces the whole problem. Real courts, as Mr MCGuinness called them, are not as accessible as they should be for those people who cannot afford to pay. It is usually the case that those who suffer discrimination are individuals such as workers. They are usually people who do not have a lot of economic means and who are amongst the more disadvantaged in our society, whereas the respondents-the people who are often accused, rightly or wrongly, of discrimination-are organisations, employers or other more powerful individuals or groups within the community. That is why it is so court, important to have access to justice through these tribunals and commissions. Mr MCGuinness went on: But of course the professional advocates of rights tend to become authoritarian in their cast of mind, and they want to impose rather than persuade, punish rather than correct. Thus the upholding of rights easily slides over into a new kind of politically correct oppression and censorship. That just goes to show the attitude of the rabid Right, the political Right, in this country towards equality and towards bodies like the human rights commission. They see them as being politically correct oppressors, being authoritarian and being out to punish rather than correct. Of course, that is entirely not the case. The whole basis of the legislation we are talking about-the. various acts that have been passed by Labor governments-and the role of the commission is to· educate, to dissuade and to prevent discrimination before it happens, rather than to punish and to get people who are guilty. Obviously there have to be penalties in place, but that is not the main thrust of these pieces of legislation. He went on: But it will clearly require a rethinking of the status and operations of a wide range of tribunals that, like the commission, have taken on the forms and behavior of kangaroo courts. Heavens above! He continued: ... it will force a fundamental reappraisal of the increasingly oppressive direction that the whole human rights and anti-discrimination industry has taken in recent years. That reminds me of the redneck comments from Western Australia about the so-called Aboriginal industry during the Mabo debates-pretty disgraceful stuff, I would put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Then we had Peter Robinson who wrote in the Sun-Herald on 26 February: At first glance, the High Court did us all a favour last week by extracting the quite unpleasantly sharp teeth of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. . Well, fancy having a commission that has some clout to enforce some measures against discrimination and to actually protect people! I mean, we cannot have that. Mr Robinson also used the term 'politically correct' commission to try to put down the role of these very important social justice and human rights bodies like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That is just a small example of some of the redneck comments that were made in the media after this unfortunate-although, I guess, understandable in legal terms-decision by the High Court. What does all that say about the debate about human rights and people's access to justice? We ate told that people seeking redress against racial discrimination or harassment, or against sexual discrimination or harassment, should have to prove their claims in a real' court. As I have alluded to, this is a typical response from those representatives of the privileged and ruling classes in Australia, those who would preserve the status quo and maintain and uphold existing inequalities and the privileges that those people have enjoyed over the years. It implies, not by accident, that to get justice you have to be able to afford expensive lawyers and QCs and have your day in court. This is a totally unsatisfactory sjtuation for those of us with a passionate commitment to equity and social justice. This is why bodies like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission were established-to provide a mechanism for redress for victims of discrimination. In most cases, the complainants are individuals, often employees, while the respondents are employers or other organisations, which are much more able to afford legal representation in court. Hopefully, the amendments in this bill will overcome ·some of the problems highlighted by the High Court decision in the Brandy case. The commission deals mainly with complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. As I have said, these are all very important pieces of legislation passed by Labor governments. The Racial Discrimination Act was passed in June 1975 during the term of the Whitlam government. Two weeks ago, on 9 June 1995, I had the very great pleasure of attending a function at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne to mark the 20th anniversary of this act. This function was attended by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who made the keynote speech; the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch); the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus); the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres. Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner); and the leader of the Victorian opposition, Mr John Brumby. Other notable guests included the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Zita Antonios; Mr Al Grassby, a former immigration minister in the Whitlam government and former Commissioner for Community Relations; and DrKep Enderby, who was the minister responsible at the time of the passage of the act in 1975. I could be wrong, but I did not notice anyone at the function from the federal opposition. The speeches and presentations at this function were thoroughly inspiring. Australia has come a long way in terms of multiculturalism and racial tolerance in the 20 years since this act was passed. This was no better exemplified than by a video-I think it was entitled Great battles and small and produced by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-which showed a bit of the history of the drafting of the Racial Discrimination Act and events since that time in this country. It served to remind me of, amongst other things, the reason why people like me and so many of my colleagues on this side work so hard and with so much commitment to elect Labor governments. The Sex Discrimination Act is also a very important piece of legislation which, in my previous working life, I had a fair bit· to do with-in particular, section 28 which deals with sexual harassment. Under that legislation sexual harassment is unlawful and employers are liable for the conduct of their employees who might be guilty of behavioJlf that constitutes sexual harassment in the workplace. In my previous working life, 1 .was an equal opportunity officer in a federal government agencyMr Bruce Scott-You will probably go back there after the next election.",115
245,Mr HAVILAND,PUBLIC NOTICE,"l do not know whether I will go back there. One of my roles was to run a program to discourage sexual harassment, to counsel victims and to train staff to be contact officers for s.exual harassment. I have dealt with a number of cases and incidents of sexual harassment. I can assure you that it is not a very pleasant thing. Certainly, sexual harassment isamongst the lowest forms of behaviour that I know. That is why this sort of legislation is very important. That is why it is so important to have bodies like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that can provide a strong and fair avenue of redress for victims of sexual harassment, of racial harassment and of all forms of discrimination. To me, that is why this legislation is so important. I did mention earlier that, in these cases, things are slightly different where a Commonwealth agency is involved. I had a: case of a constituent who came to see me, a young woman who was and still is an employee of a federal government agency. I will not name the agency or the person at this stage, because there are still matters outstanding. This person had suffered sexual harassment in her employment with the federal government agency and she was not getting very far with the complaints she had raised about it, as often happens in these cases. Fortunately, in the first instance after I managed to raise this through my office with the minister's office; the government agency involved did act with very impressive speed to try to resolve this situation. In fact, as not very often happens in these cases, the person responsible actually ended up being dismissed from the Public Service. That does not happen every day. That flPpeared to resolve the situation at that level. But then, later on, the constituent sought compensation and so a conciliation process was set up. As the previous speaker quite rightly pointed out, it is very importarit to note that most complaints that are referred to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission are resolved through conciliation. But in this particular case-I am going to run out of time.",119
246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC NOTICE,"Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member's time expired, as a matter of fact some time ago, and the Deputy Speaker has been rather generous in allowing him to·go on this long;",119
247,Mr NUGENT,PUBLIC NOTICE,"I want to 'make a couple of comments following on from what was said by the two previous government speakers on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. I caught some of what the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) said and I have just been listening to the honourable gentleman from Macarthur (Mr Haviland). I want to make the point that there very clearly is bipartisan support in this chamber for human rights and social justice issues, but there is not bipartisan support for incompetence. There is a difference. A lot of the argument on the legislation before us at the moment is about incompetence-not the motives of the legislation, but the fact that it has been mucked up in its execution. The government does not have a monopoly on care and concern in human rights, discrimination in its various forms or in any other way. Whilst the gentleman from Macarthur paraded his social conscience and dealt with the history of some good things from his side of politics, he made some notable omissions. For example, I remind him of the Northern Territory land rights legislation passed by a Liberal government. He made some wild generalisations about the so-called redneck Right, which he attributed to this side of the House, based on comments from one or two commentators. I remind him that the reason for a large chunk of this legislation is not some mythical ruling class in the coalition wanting to impose its standards; it is that the High Court found that the government, which he is a member of, was incompetent in the presentation of its legislation. That is one of the reasons why we are here today. This legislation is clearly in two sections, if you like. One deals with relatively routine restructuring matters concerning HREOC and the other deals with this problem of enforceability, which a number of my colleagues have already covered some ground on. There is little doubt that we all share the high objectives set for HREOC, but we also need to look at its effectiveness. It is no good just having ideals. You have to be able to give some effect to them. We are told that the main purpose of this bill is to amend the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, firstly, to allow for the day-today management of HREOC to be undertaken by an executive director, who it is anticipated will be a public servant; secondly, to transfer the responsibility of the corporate planning and oversight of the commission's operations from the human rights commissioner and settle it on the commission collectively; and, thirdly, to codify the powers of the president of HREOC, making it clear that he or she is to be the senior member of the commission. The bill gives effect to a number of structural changes to HREOC as recommended by the review conducted by the Department of Finance, the Attorney-General' s Department and HREOC; in other words, the interim report of the joint review of HREOC which was completed in September last year. This legislation when it was first introduced almost stopped at that point. But it now deals, in its amended form, with amendments that have come to us as a result of the enforcement of the decision in the famous Brandy case in the High Court; hence the change of name from the original legislation to what it is now and the tripling of the thickness of the legislation from the form in which it was first introduced. To put the legislation in context, perhaps it would be helpful to go back a little and have a look at the structure of HREOC. Through the use of the external affairs powers of the Commonwealth, we have undertaken in this country certain obligations in relation to the protection and promotion of human rights. Those obligations arise in part out of an ever expanding range of international treaties and agreements. HREOC is the Commonwealth agency charged with the responsibility of giving effect to seven of the more significant international instruments to which Australia is a party: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Declaration on the Rights of the Child; the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons; the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons; the International Labour Organisation Convention 111, which is concerned with discrimination in employment; the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which confirms that children are entitled to the full range of human rights recognised at, or by, internationallaw; and the Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. HREOC started on 10 December 1986. It provides an administrative structure to coordinate complaint handling, advisory and research tasks. Its powers and functions are delineated in four major pieces of legislation: the HREOC Act 1986, which established HREOC and sets out its general functions; the Racial Discrimination Act 1976; the Sex Discrimination Act 1984; and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. In addition, the Privacy Commissioner is a member of HREOC, although the Privacy Act does not confer any related functions on the commission. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner is appointed under the HREOC Act, although his or her role is advisory and does not extend to receiving complaints. So the commission has seven members: a president, and commissioners .. for human rights, race discrimination, sex discrimination, privacy, disabilities discrimination and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice. As I understand it, at June 1994 HREOC had a staff of about 190 and the commission's budget in 1995-96 is approximately $19 million. The bill we are talking about does not propose significant changes to the powers or functions of HREOC. Likewise, this bill will not dIrectly affect the tenure of existing commissioners or office holders, but it will affect substantially. the matter of enforceability of decisions. In broad terms, HREOC inquires into acts or practices that may infringe human rights or that may be discriminatory. In the event that infringements are identified, HREOC recommends action to remove. them. As members in this place will know, not all has run smoothly for HREOC and also circumstances change with the passage of time. So in August 1993, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) announced the joint reviewc-which I and others have referred to earlier-to look at the role, functions, efficiency and effectiveIn ness ofHREOC. The review reported in September 1994. I understand that a supplementary study examining the appropriate role for HREOC and its relationship with other bodies is currently in preparation. The initial report, whilst recogmsmg HREOC's unique role and structure, made a number of recommendations which we have been told have been accepted by the government and basically form the basis for the first part of this bill. The review also foreshadowed a number of matters to be dealt with in that supplementary report, and the Attorney General mentioned those in his speech today. They include: the ongoing cooperative arrangements with states and territories; complaint handling, including multiple complaints and the possibility of forum shopping; and the perceived need to rewrite all human rights legislation in plain language, which I am sure we would all say, 'Amen,' to. In the recent Brandy v. HREOC case, the High Court struck down the enforcement provisions for determinations made by HREOC under the Racial Discrimination Act. This obviously came as a heck of a shock to the government. The Racial Discrimination Act had given the commission the power to conciliate complaints of racial discrimination. Originally, this was its only power and, if conciliation failed, an action could be brought in a court for a court order. Over the years, however, the commission has been given powers to make determinations that unlawful acts of discrimination have occurred and that the respondent must pay compensation, employ the complainant or perform some other act to redress that discrimination. Such findings are judicial in nature, but until 1992, when amendments were made to the act, the commission was not considered to be exercising judicial power because its determinations were not binding and enforceable. If a person refused to comply with the commission's determination, then the complainant had to initiate an action in the Federal Court and the matter had to be heard all over again before the court, which would exercise its judicial power and make an order. some cases, when the matter was brought to the Federal Court, the court would make a different finding from the commission, because different evidence was presented before the court and different rules of evidence applied. The unsatisfactory nature of the system, which often required a complainant to endure three full investigations, led to an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The commission made a submission to the committee that its determinations should be registered with the Federal Court and take effect as if they were court orders, subject to the ability of the respondent to apply for a review by the Federal Court. The validity of this proposal was supported by an opinion by the Chief General Counsel and the majority recommendation to follow this course was adopted by the government. Legislation implementing these recommendations was enacted in 1992 and came into force in January 1993. In October 1994, the legislation was challenged in the High Court in the case Brandy v. HREOC. On 23 February 1995, High Court unanimously held that these enforceability registration and review provisions were invalid. This was because they breached the constitutional separation of judicial power executive power. The court held that the legislative provisions purported to give commission, which is an administrative power to make binding and enforceable judicial decisions and that this is contrary to the constitution, which exclusively confers judicial powers on courts. The consequence of the High Court's lay decision is that the commission's determinathe tions under the Racial Discrimination Act unenforceable. As the same provisions apply in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the endeavour, Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Privacy Act 1988, any determinations made under these acts will also be unenforceable. Other bodies may also run into similar sorts of problems. Most of the functions of the National Native Title Tribunal, for example, are arbitral in nature and will not be affected by Brandy decision. However, one of its funcagree tions, which is to make a determination that native title exists, where all parties consent, may well be considered to be an exercise judicial power and may, therefore, be unenthe forceable. What all this means is that the immediate problem faced by the government is to amend the discrimination legislation in a manner which will be both effective and constitutionally valid. We have now seen the government's response in this bill by way of amendments to the bill as it was first drafted. The explanatory memorandum tells us what the bill is all about. The first few paragraphs of the explanatory memorandum go through a number of effectively mechanical structuring items. I will not go into them because of the time factor, but they talk about the powers of the president, appointing a chief executive officer, corporate plans and things of that sort. But the later parts of the explanatory memorandum go into some detail to explain what has to happen as a result of the Brandy decision. The explanatory memorandum talks about of the need to amend a number of the acts I the have already referred to because of the problems. It also talks about the fact that anything that occurred before the changes were made in 1992 is okay. It covers and interim arrangements and effectively says that the legislation now before us will actually put the us back to the status quo before the new body, provisions were applied in 1992. I have deliberately gone into some detail in spelling out the background to the changes that are proposed for HREOC. I acknowledge, in a lot of the work that I have been able to before the House, the efforts completed by Parliamentary Research Service. However are well intentioned, this government seems to have been simply incompetent in this area of as it has been, unfortunately, in so many areas where it has had good intentions but has undertaken legislation in a hurry and not really thought through its ramifications. When that happens, the trouble is that unscrambling the mess afterwards often causes much more damage and hurt than was caused in the first place. We on this side of the the House agree with the amendments. We that the amendments provide an appropriate interim solution, and they are not objectionable as such. However, given that of the government has been long forewarned of likely invalidity of the scheme, it must be asked why consideration of a more permanent solution was not looked at earlier. Why do we have to go back to some interim solution while we now take a few more months to look at a long-term solution? The government knew it was coming but actually did not bother to do anything about it. The coalition did not oppose legislative amendments that altered the operation of HREOC in the manner that the High Court has now found unconstitutional, as we did not want to, at that stage, obstruct its worthwhile objectives. However, the constitutional uncertainty was highlighted by successive coalition shadow Attorneys-General. As some of my colleagues have already said this afternoon, when the issue of HREOC enforcement procedures was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, coalition Senators Vanstone, Kemp and O'Chee dissented from the majority recommendation that was later taken up by the government. The coalition recommended that, where conciliation is unsuccessful in HREOC, the matter should be referred directly to the Federal Court rather than allowing HREOC to make an unenforceable determination. The likely invalidity of the procedures has been raised by legal commentators. In an article that appeared in the Australian Law Journal of March 1994 A.J.H. Morris QC said: In taking [the] risk [that the legislation is valid] Government is gambling with the money and emotional well-being of those citizens most deserving of this protection: namely the innocent victims of unlawful discrimination. It is difficult to conceive of any more urgent instance calling for prompt legislative intervention. The previous government speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur, was going on about the need to give people access, the fact that we cannot just have rich men's courts and the fact that those who are discriminated against need assistance. Passing legislation that turns out to be constitutionally invalid is hardly looking after the best interests of those sorts of people. The Brandy decision again raises the question as to the quality of the government's constitutional advice. My colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) mentioned earlier that the government's Chief General Counsel, Dennis Rose, has provided advice that the HREOC mechanism was unconstitutional. The Brandy case is but one in a series of cases in which the High Court has ruled the Labor government legislation to be unconstitutional. I draw the attention of the House to the Labor government's legislation, which the High Court has recently found, at least in part, unconstitutional over the last few years. It includes the Copyright Amendment Act 1989, the Migration Amendment Act 1987, the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1981, the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the Corporations Act 1989 and the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. It is a pretty sorry tale. Now we must note the situation in terms of the native title legislation. Justice French, as the head of the National Native Title Tribunal, wants it changed because it does not work in a practical sense. But the Brandy decision might well require that that be changed on a constitutional basis as well. The coalition's position on this matter is very clear and very straightforward. The amendments will not be opposed; however, we do criticise the government for not having the formulated an alternative plan for immediate implementation, given the likelihood of a High Court finding of invalidity. We are very concerned about the quality of the government's constitutional legal advice. I would suggest that the Attorney-General cannot afford to continue to have major hiccups like the Brandy case, and the others I have mentioned, in his future legislative program. It seems to me that this area of government administration, like so many others, amply demonstrates why we need a new government in Canberra. This government is clearly not competent to carry out its good intentions.",119
248,Mr TUCKEY,PUBLIC NOTICE,"O'Connor) (6.48 p.m.)This is not the first time. I have had to draw to the attention of the House what is becoming the farcical situation relating to the ability of this government to produce legislation that is; in the first place, constitutionally valid, and, in the second place, certain and precise. If government members wish for me to quote extraneous sources that back up that opinion, I might refer them to our own Parliamentary Library, the Bills Digest process and the scathing criticisms that are levelled at their Racial Hatred Bill. I might point out that the very use of the word 'hatred' is criticised because it has failed in courts all around the world, as it is too subjective to commit somebody on that allegation. In fact, Justice French has proved me correct on that calculation.",123
249,Mr WALKER,PUBLIC NOTICE,"You said this about the Mabo bill, didn't you? You got egg all over your face.",124
250,Mr TUCKEY,PUBLIC NOTICE,"The honourable member says we got egg all over our face, yet the bill is, by its own administrator's words, a disaster. He smiles and jokes about it. That is the government's problem. It just wants to shoot the messengers. Those opposite do not ever want to think that they are wrong. But the evidence of their mistakes and their inability to legislate keeps stacking up all around them. Here we are now trying to fix one of the mistakes of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). This is not something that is just another one of those matters. The minister, whose only real credibility seems to be nobilling people, has just put forward another piece of legislation that the High Court has said is unconstitutional.",124
251,Mr WALKER,PUBLIC NOTICE,"No, it's not.",124
252,Mr TUCKEY,PUBLIC NOTICE,"Isn'the amazing? Ring up the Chief Justice and tell him he is a fool; you may as well. It was invalid under our constitution. The High Court even quoted the section. Not only did you fail before the High Court but numerous people told you before you acted that you would fail before the High Court. Let me refer to what happened when this matter was before the Senate Standing Com"" mittee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As a result of typical party disciplined arrangements, your people felt obliged to support something when all the experts were telling them it would not work. Coalition Senators Vanstone, Kemp and O'Chee found it necessary to dissent from the majority recommendation that you continued with. This parliament has been called on again to fix up a mess-a mess that has cost a lot of people a lot of money and has caused people to pay settlements which they were not legally obliged to pay. I will deal with one of those in a minute. Worst of all, the legislation is another example of people in our communityordinary Australian citizens-not being able to understand the government's law. Let me refer again to. the Racial Hatred Bill as an example. The Attorney-General said, 'Yes, I understand there are grey areas in this legislation, but we will let the courts decide.' What do the citizens do in the meantime? Citizens are entitled to expect that this parliament will produce accurate and constitutional legislation that is reasonably easy to understand. After all, when you are bringing to this parliament legislation that includes penalties of a criminal nature, it would not be a bad idea to let the citizens know when they are breaking the law. There is a situation in Western Australia at this very moment that is a classic example of how this very imprecise legislation called the Racial Hatred Bill might work. The French Consulate was burnt down. That act could only be described as racially motivated. It was an attack upon the French-some might argue for good reason. I do not think any Australian would be proud of that act. The previous day a radio commentator in Perth was imploring people to go to the front of that building and protest. He asked for peaceful protest. He gave the address of the premises. If this act, with all its imprecision were in force now, would that bloke be facing criminal charges? It is more than possible. He might not have had to wait for the Commonwealth to attack him. The French might have attacked him. Some person of French origin might have. The wives of three members of this parliament who come to mind might have chosen to do so. There is an obligation on this parliament to be precise with legislation and to get it right the first time-not just in the interests of being capable members of parliament but in the interests of the poor citizens of Australia that are supposed to know whether or not they are breaking the law. To me, that is the major issue arising out of this mistake that we are called upon to patch up. The list of failed cases is an indictment of the government. In relation to constitutional matters, there is the Copyright Amendment Act 1989, the Migration Amendment Act 1987, the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosure Act 1991, the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the Corporations Act 1989 and the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988; Then we come to other legislative areas where the constitution is not specifically involved. There is the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The Bushell case caused major embarrassment and the government had to come in here and change the law by creating bodies such as repatriation medical authorities. There was customs legislation that had to be brought back in because it was found by the High Court to not mean what it had been claimed in this place to mean. Worse still, the government went to the High Court and stretched its credibility by using its constitutional arguments before the High Court. I refer to the government's actions in signing overseas conventions, particularly of the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) quoted that authority this afternoon at question time. Most importantly, the government was saying that these conventions gave it special-and I underline the word 'special' - responsibility to legislate outside the constitutional rights of various state governments. It has caught up with the government. In the list of failures of the government before the High Court is the well-known Teoh case. This was a very interesting case. The arrogant response I got from the minister at the table a little while ago is typical of what happened when I approached Mr Speaker and asked him whether or not our whole structure of responsibility as law makers had gone out the window on account of the original Federal Court decision in the Teoh case. Let me remind the minister of the Teoh case. He does not need reminding. It must be one of the major embarrassments for people in this place who have a legal background. They have been telling us for years that they could go off and, with a warm inner glow, sign these conventions that have no real effect in Australia. In the same breath, they were running off to the High Court and saying, 'When the states take matters to the High Court we have an obligation to legislate over the top of state governments. We have an responsibility under the external affairs power because we have made a commitment to the international community.' One of these commitments was under the rights of the child convention. I always wondered why a country like Australia, with its highly developed democratic system, ever needed to promise the world that we would look after our kids. We still have a problem with a few street kids. I say 'few' in a relative sense. We still have a problem. We do not misunderstand it. Australian parliaments are doing their best to do something about it. By international comparisons, we never had to promise the world that we would look after our kids. Having done so, we did not bother to pass much legislation. Mr Teoh, a convicted drug importer, who is not an Australian citizen, quite properly had a deportation order put upon him by this government. He went off to the Federal Court and said, 'If you throw me out of Australia you will disadvantage my two Australian born children, in contravention of the promises that you, the government, have made to the international community.' The Federal Court said, 'You are right.' When I raised it with Mr Speaker in this place, that provincial lawyer whom you chose to appoint Attorney General yelled out, 'And we are appealing.' They did. At the time. I said, 'What arguments are you going to use this time?' You have been back and forward to the High Court for almost the entire period of your incumbency, arguing your responsibility. Now you want to go back and say, 'Not this time, not in Mr Teoh's case.' You tried that, and it failed. The High Court has agreed. Now we have the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) terrorising the French. He obviously wants to get down to Provence. They might not have him, if he is too rude to them. The government is trying to find a solution to back away from its own arguments. It is all part of this issue of Australia trying to circumvent our constitution. To me, that is an outrageous situation. I love the constitution, and I admire the men who put it together. Amongst other things, they understood politics; the ambition of politicians and, above all, the forces that would apply over the years towards more and more centralisation of government. They did not want that. One of the great problems with our High Court today is that, contrary to a standard principle of law, it does not go back to these constitutional debates to find out what the simple words in our constitution were intended to mean. Each and every one of those issues, wherever they were sourced, were debated at length by men whom we could all admire and who put together a proposition to protect us from the very things that are starting to happen now. Occasionally the High Court believes in that and ensures the rights of people are protected. But what was its decision on this occasion? Its decision was pretty simple: the constitution lays down the rules by which people can litigate and by which people can be found guilty of a crime. That can be achieved by applying the proper principles of law, which require that, first, people are innocent till are proven guilty and, second, there be a proper process in the giving of evidence, which should be subject to cross-examination, et cetera. That has created a problem in the legal system: the process has become ever more expensive. I think both sides of the House recognise that. We cannot create a system of cheap justice unless it delivers justice. It is easy to cut comers but, if all we create in the process is a kangaroo court, we are not delivering justice. Any process. that does not ensure proper investigation and proof of all.the facts is a kangaroo Court. Unfortunately, in an attempt to find solutions to the cost of and particularly access to it justice system for all Australians we, the parliament, have taken a bad decision. In fact, the High Court is now coming back to tell us just that. This legislation still does not completely overcome the problem. We have gone back to an arrangement which the last amendment, which has been found unconstitutional, tried to change: having a dual court process. It is not possible to have a decision of a tribunal rubber-stamped in a higher court. Quite obviously it should not be, and that is what the High Court has told us. . The government has gone back to the arrangement involving a tribunal hearing, which is supposed to be cheap. But, if either side is dissatisfied with that, it can go on to the Federal Court. It may as well go to the Federal Court in the first place because all it can get out of the other arrangement is conciliation. Conciliation is something that does not require the structure of a tribunal. If a couple of people cannot get together in a fairly simple situation and agree that one of them has discriminated against the other, they have to go to the full legal system. Remarks have been made in this place today-I do not disagree with them-that frequently the applicant is the loser in this kangaroo court type of arrangement this government has delivered to citizens, but occasionally it is the defen.dant. I draw the parliament's attention to one such case. It happened to a person living in Perth whom I know. He owns a licensed premises in Kalthey goorlie which has a motel with a bar. He thought it would be a good idea during the local racing round, which is a pretty big event, to put on some entertainers in his bar. These apparently consisted of a musician and two women. They had an act which, I gather without having seen it, was a little lewd. I have been around the hotel industry long enough to know that, if you put on mezzo sopranos, people do not make rude gestures to them! . During these ladies' performance his customers-remember the guy is in South Perth and this is going on in Kalgoorlie, about 400 miles away-<:ommenced, apparently, to make a lot of lewd gestures to these ladies. I do not know, but some of the customers might have called out, 'Get yer gear off'. There was a considerable degree of dispute as to what the customers did, but in the tribunal that could not be established because of the very relaxed attitude to the taking of evidence. There was quite a bit of argument as to whether or not some of these gestures were as bad as was suggested by the women, but it appears their evidence was accepted because they could not be properly cross-examined. They also claimed some activity went on across the bar which involved a barmaid who was in some rather skimpy attire. The fact is that that particular activity was physically impossible due to the width of the bar; nevertheless, that claim was accepted as evidence. Evidence was given that immediately after the performance and upcm complaint by these ladies the manager asked the customers concerned to leave. The tribunal ordered the guy living in Perth to pay $40,000 in compensation to the ladies. They had not lost any work. They were up there for only a couple of days. Presumably, they went back to Perth and continued to gain employment. They were entertainers who did not have any full-time employment at the place. How could that situation I wonder whether that fella paid that money-'I assume he did-and how he will get his money back. According to this legislation he can now ask for the case to be reheard in the Federal Court because that money was taken from him illegally. I am of the view he might win it. But what happens then? These people will not have the money to pay him back. Will the government pay this man? They may as well have broken through his window and stolen $40,000 from him as far as the law is concerned. This fellow fought this issue because he did not think he was responsible. How could a person running a hotel be responsible in advance for the actions of his custQmersmore particularly, when he was not there to do anything about it? It is a ridiculous outcome; worse, it is illegal. This person should get his money back. It is ridiculous that the case should be reheard in the Federal Court if the outcome is that he wins the case and the people concerned say they have no money and they have spent the money he gave them. Honourable members can bet their bottom dollar they have. That is an example of the sorts of things which happen. That man is not an extremely wealthy man. At the time he was having some difficulty with that business, as I understand it. He could have been up to his ears in debt and he could have had financial difficulties with his bank-and the government would have sent him broke with illegal legislation. That is not fair. It is time these sorts of things ceased. The first thing required is for this parliament and this government to produce legislation that is beyond dispute and stands up to the law in the first instance. To do that, we need a new Attorney-General and a new Minister for Justice. Apparently, we also need some new persons in the Attorney-General's Department because the person who said this legislation was legal was clearly wrong. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved have arisen? It did. forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Walker) read a third time. ' NA BILL (No.2) 1995 Consideration resumed from 27 March. Second Reading",124
253,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (7.09 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Most of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals. I will briefly outline the amendments. Section 3 of the bill will have effect from 7 July 1994. Item 63 in part 3 of schedule 4 provides for the duty-free entry of certified reference materials. Reference ma:"" terials are mainly metallic compounds with accurately known composItIOns which are used as a standard against which like materials and processes are compared and apparatus calibrated. The amendment contained in this bill will allow certified reference materials to be used in a broader range of industrial and scientific processes. Schedule 1 operates from 18 November 1994. In February 1994, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal determined that blankets containing viscose rayon in quantities varying from 81 per cent to 94 per cent were wholly of viscose. This decision reduced the government's intended industry assistance rate from 27 per cent to free. The amendments contained in this schedule redefine the description of goods for the subject tariff items by replacing the word 'wholly' with the phrase 'of 100 per cent'. This action will reinstate the level of assistance for goods of mixed fibre content by excluding them from tariff items which require 100 per cent content. Section 3 and schedule 2 of the bill give effect to the government's decision on the Industry Commission's report on the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries and came into force on 1 January 1995. The overall effect of the tariff changes will all imports of unmanufactured and manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will be free of customs duty. Manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will still attract the excise equivalent duty. As a result of unmanufactured tobacco becoming free of duty, the concessional schedule 4 items 35B and 35C become superfluous and have been omitted. Consequential amendments to item 53A in schedule 4, and to the table in section 26, of the principal act are also necessary. I refer honourable members to the joint ministerial statement of 13 December 1994 by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and Minister for Trade (Senator Cook), and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), which sets out the main elements of the package of measures taken by this government and the state governments of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales to assist tobacco growers and manufacturers. Schedule 2 also contains an amendment consequential to the world trade agreement coming into effect in Australia. The change is necessary to maintain the intended rate of duty for parts of regulating and controlling instruments of tariff heading 9032 which are not goods of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles. Schedule 3 contains a similar amendment to burglar alarms for the same reason. This change is operative from 1 January 1996. Summaries of the amendments contained in this bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the bill to the house.",127
254,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (7.12p.m.)The coalition does not intend to oppose the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 which, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) has just pointed out, is legislation that is of a routine nature. It is a bill that deals with certain adjustments to tariffs including those on textiles and textile articles where it is provided that, where products of chapters 56 to 63 of the Customs Tariff Act be that 1987 contain two or more materials, the predominant material by weight is to be considered the only material for classification purposes. The note provides that in these circumstances the goods will be treated as being wholly of the predominant fibre. Where there are specific references to actual percentages, these take precedence over subheading note 2(A). The other two matters relate in particular to a new treatment for the tobacco industry. That is a matter of considerable debate but seems to be the only solution that is available in the present circumstances where the industry within Australia has always struggled without protection and will continue to do so. There is a note in the summary of amendments which is worth repeating. It states: On 29 October 1993, the Assistant Treasurer asked the Industry Commission to inquire and report on the Australian Tobacco Growing and Manufacturing Industries. On 13 December 1994, in a joint ministerial statement, the Ministers forPrimary Industries and Energy, Trade, and Industry, Science and Technology and the Assistant Treasurer announced the Government's response to the Industry Commission Report No. 39 of 29 June 1994. The statement outlines the main elements of an industry package, which embodies all key measures within a proposal submitted to the Australian Government and the State Governments of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales by tobacco growers and manufacturers. The statement announced that the customs duty on all imports of tobacco leaf, manufactured tobacco and tobacco products would be free commencing 1 January 1995. This means that manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will only attract the excise equivalent duty. In doing this, the government has proposed some assistance measures to the industry. Some of my colleagues might be of the view that these particular measures are inadequate but, on the other hand, the coalition is accepting the proposals. As a result of unmanufactured tobacco becoming free of customs duty, the concessional schedule 4 items 35B and 35C have become superfluous and are omitted. A consequential change is also necessary to the table to item 53A. I see there is an amendment related to burglar alarms. If I wanted to. take up considerable time of the parliament, I might say that there are other issues relating to burglar alatms that should be addressed. One of those issues is to make an alarm that cannot be knocked to pieces by the fellow who has just broken into your premises before it does its job and alerts the police, or whatever it is supposed to do. I will not go further on that point in this particular technical piece of legislation. The World Trade Organisation agreement came into effect for Australia on 1 January 1995. Because of the tariff bindings agreed to by Australia, it was necessary to legislate many phased reductions of tariff rates. These amendments were legislated in the Customs Tariff (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Act 1994-that is, act 152 of 1994. As changes made in that act lowered the rate of duty for some tariff subheadings below 15 per cent, importers have been prevented from claiming their intended phased reductions for certain goods which are not of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles. This amendment provides a new tariff subheading 8531.10.19 to allow those purchasing burglar alarms which are not of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles to claim the intended duty rate and the duty phase down to five per cent by 1 July 1996. In conclusion, these matters are purely of a machinery nature. Whilst I repeat my remarks that in relation to the tobacco industry it is going to cause some hardship for tobacco growers, we acknowledge that there has been some attempt to ameliorate that with some financial assistance between state and federal gov-rnments. It will still pose difficulties for those producers and we are hopeful that they will have the opportunity to move to grow other products which will give them a viable financial return. Other than that, there are really no issues arising from these amendments. We give them our support.",128
255,Mr ANDREW,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Wakefield) (7.18 p.m.)As the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has said, the amendments in the Customs Tariff Amendment BiII (No.2) 1995 cover a range of issues and they are supported by the coalition. They include changes to the duty on crude oil; the duty on avgas for air safety regulation; tariffs on motor vehicles, as outlined by the member for O'Connor; and the arrangements for developing country preference, which are as a result of the World Trade Organisation and the negotiations we entered into as a country as part of our original arrangements under GATT and our ongoing obligations as signatories to the World Trade Organisation. It is to the question of the changes under the World Trade Organisation, our obligations there and, particularly, the impact of developing country preference that I want to address a few remarks tonight. Initially, in 1993 the government, supported by· the opposition, chose to change the developing country preference arrangements that we had with Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines by phasing out textiles, clothing, footwear, chemicals, sugar, canned food, fruit juice and dried fruit from the DCP arrangements. The bill now before the House goes a little further. It includes all exports from the countries I have mentioned, except, as the member for O'Connor mentioned, cheese, unmanufactured tobacco, sugar and replacement components for motor vehicles. I do not have a direct involvement in the tobacco industry and I do not have a contribution to make in that regard, except to say that I endorse the remarks made by the member for O'Connor. As the member for the rural electorate of Wakefield, I have a number of industries that are directly affected by the change to the developing country preference arrangements. The industries in my electorate compliment the government for the action it has taken in changing the DCP arrangements, particularly for Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. They recognise that in many cases developing countries-not necessarily these countrieshave enjoyed a preference that should no longer be extended to them. A classic example of this sort of preference is that extended to the dried fruit industry, particularly the dried apricot industry in Turkey. For a time the Turkish industry enjoyed a developing country preference. The changed arrangements mean that dried apricots now come into Australia on a fairer basis than when Turkey enjoyed developing country status. This legislation is important to all the industries that members of this House represent. One of the most labour intensive industries is the dried fruit industry. In recent years, this industry· has been faced with a shortage of quality Australian dried apricots. A large number of dried apricots have been used in canning and for juice. There has also been a shortage of quality dried vine fruit, principally because of the surge in the Australian wine industry. This surge in the wine industry has meant that the Australian dried vine fruit market will not be able to satisfy the demand of a number of export markets. As a result there is likely to be an additional import of dried vine fruit, and there has been for some time a growing level of Turkish dried apricots coming into this country. The changes to the developing country preference arrangements have meant that Turkey is now being treated as a trading neighbour and not as a developing country. This change in relation to Turkey reflects precisely what is being done in this bill to the developing country preference arrangements being enjoyed by Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. As the member for O'Connor said, this legislation spells out even more clearly our obligations under the World Trade Organisation and it allows us to meet those obligations. For that reason, the opposition supports this measure. I am very conscious of the fact that this particular trading arrangement will make both the government and the opposition rethink their trading policies and obligations under the World Trade Organisation. I refer specifically to the arrangements we are currently facing as a result of the changes in the Australian pork industry and the difficulty Australian pork producers are having in competing with the subsidised Canadian product coming into Australia, principally in the form of leg hams. There has been some concern expressed by the pork industry that the present level of pork imports, while not dramatically high, is growing at a rate that is having a real impact on the Australian domestic pork market. Subsidised pork coming into the country is suppressing the demand for Australian pork and suppressing the price the Australian pork industry can obtain. The arrangements under GATT make it increasingly difficult for us to face the subsidised product coming in from Canada. Those in the pork industry have expressed a great deal of concern not about the quantity of pork coming in but the fact that it comes in as a subsidised product. It is arriving in Australia at a time when Australian pork producers are facing the increased cost burden for grain for feeding pigs. The increased price for grain has come about solely as a result of the drought. That is something which the member for O'Connor is very familiar with. This increased grain price has simply meant that the costs for Australian pork producers have risen dramatically. As a result, Australian pork producers face increased costs of production, and competition from overseas which further depresses the Australian pork market. The pork producers· have also sought a reassurance from the government that there will be a change in labelling that will let Australian consumers know that the pork that they are buying is Australian and not Canadian. They are anxious not only to have a change in trading arrangements but also to have a change in labelling laws to enable domestically produced pork to be clearly labelled as such as opposed to the imported overseas pork. This will allow consumers to purchase pork from the Australian domestic market and avoid purchasing that which comes from Canada. The bill before the House deals specifically with the question of world trade and our current trading arrangements and, as the member for O'Connor has indicated, it has the support of the coalition. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Walker) read a third time.

256,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It being approximately 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade",131
257,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to bring to the attention of the House serious issues of maladministration concerning the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and relating to Mr John Scott Holloway. I have previously brought to the attention of the House MrHolloway's deviant sexual proclivities. I wish to emphasise that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Evans) was aware of Mr Holloway's proclivities and indeed sought a belated assurance from Mr Holloway, prior to his appointment to a key position in Cambodia, that he would desist from such activities. I refer now to a mystery that has become a secret. One must ask whether Senator Evans may have misled the Senate in August 1983 concerning the leaking of the Austeo papersthe name given to Australia's most sensitive intelligence documents leaked to the National Times in May 1983. The leaked documents were the crown jewels of Australian intelligence classified 'Top secret', 'Oyster', 'Austeo' and from ASIS, ONA, DSD, ASIO and the most sensitive sections of the Hope referred Royal Commission into Intelligence and Security. The thenLabor government was so concerned that it sought a High Court injunction at 11.15 at night to prevent further publication of documents. Senator Evans, in his then capacity as Attorney-General, said on page 132 of the Hansard of 24 August 1983 in reply to a question from Senator Austin Lewis: When information comes to light as a result of those investigations, no doubt it will be made public in the ordinary and proper way. It was not. Why not? Can we seriously believe that the combined forces of ASIO and the AFP could not identify the source of the leak of the Austeo papers after an investigation lasting six months? Of course, they could and did. Senator Evans, DFAT, the ubiquitous Michael Costello and the then foreign minister, Bill Hayden, swung into damage control mode. For investigations had revealed that the source of the leaks known as the Austeo papers was a senior DFAT officer, Mr John Holloway. It was Mr Holloway who, in a fit of pique concerning failure to obtain a diplomatic position he sought, passed the Austeo papers to a leading newspaper editor and it was Mr Holloway who had been placed under surveillance by police during visits to two capital cities. This is the man chosen by Senator Evans and the present DFAT secretary, Michael Costello, for a vital role in rebuilding Cambodia in the Costello sponsored peace plan. We now find Senator Evans and Mr Michael Costello, the secretary to DFAT, according to DFAT administrative circular dated 10 August 1995, file No. 94/020051, confirming: In accordance with Senator Evans's wishes Mr Holloway will remain in his current appointment as ministerial adviser with the Cambodia ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation. A mushroom cloud of corrupti9n and nepotism hovers over DFAT. Many staff want an inquiry into its secretary and overall management. It is now a matter of national honour. In conclusion, I point out that it was Mr Costello who was reported in the media on 7 June as saying that he had not been responsible for the promotion or appointment of any known paedophile in the department, yet that administrative circular that I referred to otherwise states. I seek leave to table the circular. Leave not granted. Liberal Party: Western Australia",131
258,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"This week we saw the member for Moore (Mr Filing) sit in the parliament as an Independent. This followed his brutal deselection as the endorsed Liberal candidate for the federal seat of Moore at the next election at the hands of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party. Let us see the responses that we got to that. The Australian writes, 'MP's resignation highlights Liberal divisions.' An editorial in the Australian, headed 'Howard's unresolved WA problem', refers to the 'obvious helplessness' of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and his 'inability to resolve the factional war that continues to tear apart the Liberal Party in Western Australia'. The Australian Financial Review writes, 'WA disarray as Liberal MP quits.' An article in the Age headed 'Liberals face more defections after Filing' provides an interesting further development of this matter. In an article in the Australian headed 'MP's resignation highlights Liberal party divisions', we find references to 'deep divisions' in the Liberal Party. It states: Mr Filing's resignation ... is an embarrassment to the Leader of the Opposition ... It continues: Mr Filing told Mr Howard that he would continue to vote for and support the Coalition in the House of Representatives., Mr Greenlees writes in the Australian: Mr Filing's decision ... highlighted the woeful state of non-Labor policies in Western Australia. He will act as a reminder of the inability of the federal party to manage the divisions in its West Australian branch. This decision ... underlined Howard's impotence in the face of the internecine struggle in Western Australia. Filing presents indisputable evidence to West Australian voters that the State branchthat is, of the Liberal Partyis wracked by conflict. In the West Australian of Tuesday, 20 June 1995 there is reference to a Mr Simon Ehrenfeld, who is the president of the Young Liberal Movement in Western Australia and the campaign director of the endorsed Liberal  this article, reference is made to the Young Liberal Movement, which is described as follows: Set up by Liberal patriarch Robert Menzies in 1945, officially its objects are, ""To support and promote the objects, policy and platform of the movement and the party,"" and ""to provide political, educational, social, sporting and community activities for young people"". I wonder whether Mr Ehrenfeld, the president of the Western Australian Young Liberal Movement, was acting in accordance with the objectives and platform of the Young Liberal Movement when he rang Mr Alistaer Jones on 6 June. Mr Jones is the endorsed Labor candidate for the seat of Moore. In the course of that conversation, Mr Ehrenfeld identified himself as the campaign director for Paul Stevenage, the endorsed Liberal candidate for the seat of Moore. Mr Ehrenfeld said that he was seeking to develop a 'put Filing last' campaign. Mr Ehrenfeld raised the question of ALP preferences with the ALP candidate, Mr Alistaer Jones, and was quite correctly told by Mr Jones that that was a matter for the state or national secretary of the ALP. In the course of the conversation, Mr Ehrenfeld described the honourable member for Moore as poison. Mr Ehrenfeld said that he, as campaign director for the endorsed Liberal candidate for Moore and president of the Young Liberal Movement of Western Australia, would rather see the ALP candidate in parliament than the present member for Moore. In the course of the conversation, only the seat of Moore that was discussed; the seat of Cowan was also referred to. Mr Ehrenfeld told Mr Jones that Liberal Party polling suggested that the Labor candidate, Carolyn Jakobsen, was ahead of the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and that, if the member for Cowan did not improve over the next three months, he might not be there as a candidate at the next election. What do we have? Here we have in substantive terms the campaign director for the endorsed Liberal candidate for Moore and the president of the Young Liberal Movement in Western Australia saying that he would rather see in the parliament a Labor member for the seat of Moore than the current member for Moore, Mr Filing, who is known to be one of the strongest supporters of the Leader of the Opposition in this place. That is a view which we on this side of the House agree with. Geraldton: Cunderdin",132
259,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"O'Connor) (7.37 p.m.}- Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, each year I bring two students to Canberra as part of an ongoing scholarship scheme held with the cooperation of the high schools within the electorate of O'Connor. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ansett Australia Airlines for its kind assistance in supporting this scholarship scheme. This year I have brought the 37th and 38th students, and I am pleased to say that they are both in the Speaker's gallery tonight. They are Kerry Gorski from John Willcock Senior High School in Geraldton and Michael Parnell from the Cunderdin Agricultural College. Michael is a resident of the Perth suburb of Melville. Both Karen and Michael have written short speeches about the area in which they live and/or the school they attend. I wish to read these speeches into the Hansard. Karen Gorski writes that Geraldton was founded by Charles Fitzgerald and is 424 kilometres north of Perth. Situated in the midwest, it has a thriving sheep and wheat industry. Due to its proximity to the coast, it is the centre for Western Australia's fishing and crayfishing industry. The famous wreck of the Dutch ship the Batavia in 1629 has led to the coastal regions surrounding Geraldton being it was not known as the Batavia Coast. With a population of 24,000, Geraldton welcomes the flood of tourists that visit each year for its warm climate and beautiful beaches. The region is well known for its abundance of wild flowers throughout July and August. Many people also visit the area to see the Greenough Hamlet, a national heritage site which comprises restored buildings dating from the first settlers to the area. The high winds that have given Geraldton an international windsurfing reputation are the cause of the remarkable bent trees that one sees in this Greenough region. The annual sunshine and performing arts festivals are held in September and November. Established in 1975, the John Willcock Senior High School has approximately 750 students and was named in honour of John Willcock, who was Premier of Western Australia between 1936 and 1945. The school motto is 'enlighten' and the purpose of the school is to develop fully a student's academic, social and personal skills, enabling them to become a more productive member of society. The school caters for years 8 to 12 students who have the opportunity to study a range of subjects. Theatre arts is an important aspect of the school, with a production held for the public each year. The school offers a variety of career pathways, with the introduction of skilling through enterprise programs two years ago. Annual events include participation in WA Country Week where sporting and debating teams are sent to compete with other country schools. Michael Parnell writes that Cunderdin Agricultural College is one of seven agricultural schools in Western Australia arid it is situated in the central wheat belt, 160 kilometres east of Perth on the Great Eastern Highway-the main road link between Perth and the eastern states. The word Cunderdin is derived from an Aboriginal-language and means 'the place of many flowers'. In the spring months, the Cunderdin area is alive with pink and yellow everlastings, living up to that Aboriginal name. The site at which the college is situated was previously a World War II flying school which at anyone time housed approximately 534 trainee airmen. Many of these airmen participated in the defence of Australia and would currently be involved with the Australia Remembers 1945-95 program, which is, of course, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. The college is a fully co-educational, residential complex catering for 110 year 11 and year 12 students, who come from all over Western Australia. As I have pointed out, Michael is not a country boy but is, of course, gaining a wonderful education at this college. Acceptance into the school"" is based on an interview with the principal and a confidential report from the applicant's previous school. Forty-one students graduated in 1994, including five who have gained certificates of excellence from the Secondary Education Authority of Western Australia. Several graduates gained entry to Muresk Campus of Curtin University, with three winning firstyear scholarships. All graduates from 1994 had a commitment to further education, apprenticeships or employment. Cunderdin College comprises 1,600 hectares of land, some of which is cropped and grazed. The farm consists of a shearing shed, poultry units, slaughterhouse, butcher shop, machinery schools and farm workshops. All of these facilities are used by the students in their education, of which 50 per cent is theory and 50 per cent is practical Sport plays a big part in the life of the student at Cunderdin. Sports offered include football, squash, tennis, volleyball, basketball, gun club, hockey, salt lake sailing, netball and badminton. The students of this college have a great life, particularly for those seeking knowledge in the field of agriculture. The role of agricultural colleges in Western Australia creates good vocational opportunities by teaching practical skills suitable not only to those wishing to enter the agricultural industry but also to those wishing to undertake careers in boilermaking, motor vehicle repairs and many other practical areas of appointment. Lebanon",133
260,Mrs EASSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to speak tonight on Lebanon. Lebanon is a small country far away from Australia geographically but very close to us in our hearts. Over 100,000 Australians are descended from Lebanon and they have come to Australia to make homes and lives and to contribute. Due to great problems in the Middle East, Lebanon, being basically small and defenceless, has been victimised and made the butt of other people's problems. At the moment, Lebanon is substantially occupied by the Syrian army. The Syrian justification, in their own eyes, is that Lebanon is part of Syria. This claim is rejected by almost every other nation and Lebanon is a country in good standing and legitimacy within the international community. Lebanon is a member of the United Nations. On 18 July, the Australian government will be reopening its embassy in Beirut. It should never have been closed. I am aware that a fierce civil war raged from 1975 until recently; however, nations cannot tum and run as soon as problems arise. This has caused severe hardship for the citizens of Lebanon. When they have wanted to get visas to visit Australia, they have had to travel to Damascus. Not only did they often incur physical risks, but guards often had to be paid off to ensure safe passage. This situation is intolerable. Israel also has troops in southern Lebanon. This occupation is due to the use of southern Lebanon to shell towns in northern Israel. This shelling was carried out not by forces of the Lebanese government but by Lebanese agents of Iran and other nations in the area. Lebanon itself has never engaged in warfare with Israel or any other nation. The Lebanese themselves are not aggressive or warlike. War has been introduced into their country as a result of various serious political crises that have beset the region for the past 50 years. With the reopening of the embassy in Beirut will come the reopening of the immigration department office in Beirut. As I have previously said, all Lebanese migration matters have gone through Syria., This situation was always llllsatisfactory and I trust it will not be repeated. Despite recent carping about immigration, the cold facts are .that, without immigration, Australia's population will decline and age very rapidly. Who will pay for the costs of the retirees and who will provide the domestic market? I notice that in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald the Australian Bureau of Statistics remarked that the number of those who are 65 years and over will have doubled by the year 2041 and will represent 22 per cent of the population. Over the years, the Lebanese have proved to be excellent migrants and their pride in this country is boundless. The reason for this is that we took them in when they were in difficulty and they have repaid the debt with interest. The new immigration office will see a renewed interest in immigration. I recently met Dory Chamoun on his recent visit to Australia. He spoke passionately of his belief that Lebanon as we know it may cease to be a nation within 15 years if things continue as they are. He spoke of the desire of many people, especially Christian Maronites, to leave Lebanon. When I asked what Australia could do to help Lebanon, he said that education and skills training were the very important areas where he felt our expertise could be contributed and very much appreciated. It is. impossible to represent an electorate like mine without understanding my constituents' genuine concern for the country of their birth, although they now reside in the country of their choice. The Lebanese who have come to Australia have contributed mightily to our national welfare and if we had more of them Australia would be better off. As any observer of the Middle East will realise, the situation there is very volatile and security is a problem that is very serious for many ,people. The talents of people from the Middle East run very strongly to business and commerce and our Australian business presence in the Middle East, especially Lebanon, is minimal. This is' unacceptable and, given our large business community of Middle East origin, it is a mystery. As a matter of priority and urgency, the government must engage more rigorously in commerce with the Middle East. Austrade, an excellent Australian instrumentality, should be encouraged to be more active and more aggressive. Lebanon is a very modem and Westernised country. The capacity for successful Australian-Lebanese business is very high. We also should be involving more Australians of Lebanese descent in this bilateral growth. Australia cannot lose by the ideas I am proposing. Australia should be very grateful that so many Lebanese have come here and are available to help us return to the Middle East for commerce and cultural ties. Australia has a great future, but we must build it and we cannot do this without the help of the Middle East and the people of Lebanon. Prime Minister",134
261,Mrs BISHOP,ADJOURNMENT,"We learned today that Australia is now worse off than Mexico. This, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has told us, is as good as it is to get. This is the same Paul Keating who said when he was Treasurer that Mr Howard will wear his leadership like a crown of thorns and that in the parliament he would everything he could to crucify Mr Howard. This is the same Paul Keating who last week abrogated all reasonable responsibility leadership in the French nuclear testing crisis. Over a period of time. I have become concerned, as have others who have contacted me, for the mental well-being of the Prime Minister. Such was my concern that I spoke with a psychiatrist as to the nature of problem which the Prime Minister might be suffering. The psychiatrist asked not to identified for fear of reprisals, but referred to the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, and particularly the section entitled 'Hypomanic Episode'. The document states, among other things: The elevated mood of a Hypomanic Episode described as euphoric, unusually good, cheerful, or high. Characteristically, inflated self-esteem, usually at the level of uncritical self-confidence. The speech of a person with a Hypomanic Episode is often somewhat louder and more rapid than usual, but is not typically difficult may be full of jokes, puns, plays on words, and irrelevancies. More worrying is that the document states: Studies suggest that 5%-15% of individuals with hypomania will ultimately develop a Manic Episode. It could well be said that the Prime Minister is simply under too much strain in trying to run so many irrelevant issues in order to avoid the fundamental issue; that is, the huge international debt he has given to this nation. I have always said that what this country is being put through is not necessary. I would like the House to consider the following analogy. Take your ordinary household, which used to run with such a profit that you were able to buy shares here and overseas and lend money to others. Then within a few short years your house got into such extraordinary debt you could not even pay the interest on going the debt. Every month your debt grows and your children are suffering, but you tell them that they have never had it so good. You discuss everything but the problem and you do go to your neighbours, who are flush with money, and tell them they are doing everything wrong and explain to them how to run of their households. You attack your own family and blame everyone but yourself, and while your family suffers you yourself buy expensive Italian suits, French clocks and anything else you please. Shouldn't someone who is very the concerned for your welfare, for your own safety, suggest that you might seek help? Our be parents worked hard and fought for this me country and, indeed, some died for it. We inherited a way of life which was unequalled. We owed little to anyone and the people were then prosperous. But now it is the people who are poor and in debt and the Prime Minister is who is rich. It just isn't right. Labour Market Programs",135
262,Ms DEAHM,ADJOURNMENT,"I think the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) has earned herself a spot on Order in the House without doubt and will probably get the nuttiest speech of the week award. I am here to speak about youth training and labour to interrupt. It market programs. In the debate on the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill in the last sitting week, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) expressed the view that he did not think the youth training allowance was going to do anything for young people, and he was particularly critical about the government's labour market programs. In my speech which followed his, I obviously disagreed with him, particularly on the labour market programs, and cited as an illustration the young people who have been through LEAP, the landcare and environment assistance program, in my electorate. I had the great privilege last week of attending one of many LEAP graduations that I have attended in my electorate. They have all been greatly successful, but this one was of particular gratification to me. In some programs, as with all labour market programs, all training programs and I guess even university degrees, a number of people enrol, start the program and some drop out. In this particular program 11 young people were involved and they were all from the groups known as long-term unemployed or at risk. At the graduation it was a great delight for me to see that 10 of those young people had permanent jobs to go to after six months in that training course. You may not think that is amazing, but normally you are lucky if half of those young people get jobs. Others may have training opportunities or other connections that they can build on, or they have gained enough self-confidence to go for something else, but 10 of the 11 young people had received jobs. I thought it was eight when I got up to give my speech, but before I left I was told that two more of them had got jobs. Some could not get time off from their jobs to come to the graduation. One particular young woman who gave what I thought was an excellent thank you speech on behalf of the students-she wrote it herself, showed it to the leader of the group and he thought it was fine-had been unemployed for some time, came from a broken family and had a great deal of difficulties. she was working and she was proud of the fact that she was working. I think LEAP is one of the best labour market programs this government, or even previous governments, has ever initiated for three fundamental reasons. Firstly, it gives young people-I know it is a cliche to say that young people are our future-some work training. Secondly, and more importantly, it gives them confidence; it gives them a boost to their self-esteem. I was told that when some of the people first came to the group and had to stand up and say their names and where they were from one of them was so nervous she just rushed out of the room, and there she was at this group-very confident and very self-assured. The third reason why LEAP is so successful is that it deals with the environment. It is providing job training, confidence and helping the environment. In my electorate the environment is extremely important. As most members will know, the area in my electorate covers the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury area. We have the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system, which is in need of a great deal of care. We have national parks, bush reserves and areas that need assistance to regenerate, to remove weeds and so on. Some of the programs that have been carried out under LEAP are under the auspices of Greening Australia. I pay great tribute to Greening Australia as a wonderful organisation that does a fantastic on-the-ground job with the environment. LEAP has done such things as removing weeds and creating, out of an absolute mess, a reserve and walking track along the banks of the Hawkesbury River at Swallow Rock Reach reserve. It has cleaned up a lagoon in the Blue Mountains and created a reserve. The latest program that I mentioned created, out of a swamp, a recreational lake with picnic areas and walking tracks. It is a wonderful place for people who live in the Bligh Park. area, which is a huge new housing estate, to go to and enjoy themselves. LEAP and also REEP, of which this latest project was a part, are highly successful. The pilot REEP project in New South Wales is But based in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment. I am very proud that that was chosen in my electorate and several other members' electorates to be the first to deal with that sort of work. I commend the program. Education: Mid-West Queensland",136
263,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I represented, for some 20 years, the state electorate of what was then called Flinders. We were able to secure infrastructure for that area, which was unprecedented. Mr Gibson-When are you going to apologise to the people of Queensland for your corruption?",137
264,Mr KA TTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I absolutely love interjections of this type. I am very short of time so I suppose I should run on, but I cannot help but go sideways. The amount of $26 million selfof public moneys was spent, of which $26,000 went astray in the state of Queensland. I would say that inquiry proved we were the most honest government in all of Austral- . Ian history. The inquiry looked under our toenails and found that $26,000 of public money had gone astray after $26 million had been spent. In sharp contrast, in Western Australia $876,000 went astray and in South Australia $3,000 million went astray. We handed over the best economically run state in the Commonwealth. Not only did it prove our honesty and decency but we pursued, even to. the destruction of our own government, police corruption. We found out the corrupt police and we put them in gaol. Mr Gibson-And who was it who was corrupt? Your minister.",137
265,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"You might drag me sideways on Shoalwater Bay again. I would enjoy talking about how a man bought something that was worth absolutely nothing and then got $2 million off Mr Goss. So be careful and don't provoke me. In· Charters Towers, the magistrate and the state government geological office, the functions of which had been there for over 100 years, were removed by the government. At a time when Charters Towers is the biggest it has ever been, it had both of those services removed. At a time when it is the third richest government. gold producing city in Australia, it had those services removed. The assistance to schools has been cut in half in Queensland, whereas in 1987 and 1988 you could get all of the money you required from the government to go away to boarding school. All of the families in the mid-west towns, the towns west of Charters Towersnone of which have secondary school facilities that enable you to go on to universitiescould get the government to pick up the cost of sending their kids away to school. The cut in assistance has cost Charters Towers greatly. The schools there have lost enrolments because people are not able to send their kids to those schools. Far more seriously, the western towns in Queensland no longer have any equality in education. Families in those towns simply cannot afford to send their kids away to school. As cheap and as reasonable as those schools in Charters Towers are and as excellent as the service in those schools is, it costs $10,000 a year to send your child away to school, but now you get only $5,000 out of the $10,000. The four little towns between Charters Towers and Hughenden-Balfes Creek, Torrens Creek, Pentland and Prairie-have all lost their railway stations. In fact, Torrens Creek has lost the railway station, the police station and the school. Pentland's meat works closed down, with the loss of 300 jobs to the area. I am very proud to say that I was heavily involved with the AMIU in keeping the meat works open for that time. Hughenden has lost the railway control room, with over 20 jobs gone. Half the diesel workshops are closed, with over 20 jobs gone. The clerk of the court is gone. The industrial office is gone. The lands office, I am informed, is also gone. Richmond has lost a full-time doctor and the clerk of the court is gone. Julia Creek has lost its high school completely. It has also lost its clerk of the court. Greenvale's railway line has been closed and torn up, losing all of the jobs involved with it. It was a great facility and asset to the area. Every single thing that can be remotely taken away from these areas has been stripped away by a vicious, anti-Western",138

The group training schemes in Australia enable small and medium sized businesses to two areas the schemes cover-and, if a particular slotted into another enterprise but their training a time, the situation was that an apprenticeship person and if that person's business went through trainee had to be put off, they were left in young people. So the group training schemes, 1981, came into being so that we could try to without them running into the possibility that see them right through to the end The group training scheme is an excellent of small business and medium sized businesses, a mechanism for training skilled people. This to group training schemes and I am pleased is very important that we have this sort of adjustments in the economy, there is flexibility and traineeship level. The second issue discussed in this report is are not good links with the schools in regard needs to be a restructuring in regard to our TAFE colleges. This raises the question of the secondary and college sectors. This is a historical longer appropriate for our schools. The report alludes to one of the difficulties Australia between training mechanisms and thoroughly, we would find that the division end of year 8, instead of at the end of year we operate our schools, such as a segment year 13.

I believe that within Australia there schooling and training, and in how ANTA operates division of our schooling system into primary, division and I do not believe that it is any in regard to training: the lack of contact in schooling. If we looked at this area more in educational terms probably should come at the 6.

That is a shame because in this sector. The member for Braddon talked about labour training. That is an issue which government tried to address in recent years. Certainly about developing pathways and having a situation T AFE, secondary school or through labour qualifications that are real, are of value range of the changes that government is implementing should ensure that the results sought come to fruition. Another issue which was mentioned was concern was raised with the committee because of group training companies. We had circumstances had very significant financial One thing that also came through from the was a great variation in the level of accounting companies. The government has recognised that and that essentially, although group training forms of labour market programs and training that should be encouraged, the focus should traineeships, and that in those circumstances It should be recognised that sometimes there in financial balances according to group training company operating in the building industry-an lows---can, more than most other industries, apprentices in difficulty and needing subsidisation to get employment elsewhere.

289,Mr GEAR,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a)-(c) It is not possible to answer the questions presented by the honourable member without further details of his concerns. However, it is important to note that the child support legislation requires that the Agency obtain information of a confidential nature from its clients, or from other sources, to give effect to the legislation. Examples of this are the names of both parents, the names and dates of birth of the children, the taxable income of both parents and details of the payer's employer. In other circumstances, such as lodging a variation of income, making arrangements to pay arrears or during a hearing of the Child Support Review Office, information such as details of current income may also be requested. The Agency takes the issue of client confidentiality seriously and therefore has procedures which are to be followed to prevent a breach of privacy. If the honourable member has a specific example in relation to this matter, I would be pleased to provide a response.
