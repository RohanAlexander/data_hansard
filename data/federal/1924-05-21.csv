YASS-CANBERRA RAILWAY - PRINTING oir COMMITTEE'S REPORT.",12
2,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I present the report of the Public Works Committee on the proposed construction of a railway connecting Canberra with Yass, together with plans, and move That the report be printed.",12
3,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,Dalley) [8.6] - 1 do not think we should allow this motion to go unchallenged.,12
4,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,It does not suit the honourable member.,12
5,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"It does not suit me, ask nor does it suit this-House or the people of Australia. The building of Canberra beon definitely determined by a very high substantial majority of the members to of this House, yet we find a Committee that was asked to investigate a work is absolutely essential to the establishment of. the Federal Capital at Canberra, placing every obstacle' in the way of the building of the Capital.",12
6,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Does the honourable him member know the nature of the report of . Mr MAHONY - It is quite easy to anticipate what is in the report, knowing that the honourable member for Bass (Mr . No. 92, Jackson) is a member of the Public Works Committee. We know that nearly all of the members of the Public Works Committee are definitely hostile to the estabpublic lishment of the Capital at Canberra. the They make no secret of their hostility Lo may it. They are now endeavouring by a subterfuge toblock progress at. Canberra, I this opportunity to enter my protest as against the action of the Public Works",12
7,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,The honourable member would not permit the report to be presented to Parliament.,12
8,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"The Committee was asked to consider a proposal for the building of a railway to connect Canberra, with Yass. Tbis work is absolutely essential to the establisbment of the Capital at Canberra. If there is to be a capital at all, we must provide properrailway communication with it. We find the Public Works Committee, in its hostility to Canberra, deliberately turning down this project.",12
9,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,I rise to order. honourable member has said that the Public Works Committee is deliberately hostile to Canberra. I ask that that statement be withdrawn.,13
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt. Hon, W. A. Watt). - If it is regarded as offensive by members of. the Committee for which the honourable member speaks it must be withdrawn, but the statement is not otherwise unparliamentary. Mr BLAKELEY' - As a member of the Public Works Committee I do not object to it.",13
11,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"I do not wish to reflect personally on the honourable member for Bass, or any other member of the Public Works Committee. Surely the honourable member is not ashamed of his publicly announced opinions on Canberra.",13
12,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,Certainl y not.,13
13,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,All that I say is that the honourable member aud a majority of the members of the Committee are opposed to Canberra.,13
14,Mr HILL,Unknown,Sensibl e men.,13
15,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"That is, no doubt, the view they take; but this House by an overwhelming majority takes a different view, and has decided that Canberra must be established as the Federal Capital. This is not a party question, and I appeal to honourable members on both sides, constituting a majority in this House, to see that their opinion is not flouted by the acceptance of this report from a Committee that loses no opportunity to block the progress of Canberra nud prevent its development. The ac- will not be adopted, but-the report will ceptance of the motion will strike a death blow at the establishment of the Capital at Canberra. I ask the House to refuse to accept this report and to send it back to the Committee with a. request for a report in accordance with the expressed desire of this Parliament.",13
16,Mr STEWART,Unknown,Has the honourable member read the report?,13
17,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Has the - Minister, for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) received a copy of the report from the Public Works Committee?",13
18,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"No , he has not.,'",13
19,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Does the Minister, not know that the report is against the, construction of the proposed railway? Will the honourable gentleman deny that?. The Mr STEWART - I do ' not know what, is in the report. Mr MAHONY,-If so, the honourable gentleman has been asleep for a very long time. '",13
20,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member in order,, on the motion for its printing, in traversing the contents of a report which we have, not yet received ?",13
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"On the point, of order raised by the Minister for Defence,. I think the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony), if he believes that the report contains certain statements or recommendations, is in order in' traversing it and urging upon the House the advisability or otherwise of printing it, because of what he believes that it contains: ",13
22,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"That is/.the., view I take. This is the only opportunity . which the supporters of Canberra-in this-House : will have to enter their protest - against the action of this anti-Canberra. Com;mittee. If the report is in. 'favour pf certain works being done, and we allowed the motion that it be printed:to go,.unchallenged, the Minister could introduce a motion to resolve that the work be. proceeded with, and all we could do. would be to either reject it, or send it back; it could not be amended. This reportis purely a negative one, as it turns down the project.",13
23,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,How do you know?,13
24,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Is the Chairman, or any member of the Commission, prepared to say what the report contains? If he does so, the motion to print the report - be referred back to the Committee for reconsideration. I challenge any member of. the Committee to tell the House exactly what the report contains. Those members behind the Government who desire the establishment of the Capital at Canberra would, by adopting the motion for the printing of this repor.t,. be accepting a very serious responsibility - They would make it impossible for the Capital to be connected with Yass by a railway. Honourable members from New South Wales would bave difficulty in explaining their action to their constituents. I intend to vote against the motion that the report be printed, so that the Committee may be given an opportunity to reconsider the whole matter, and to bring in a report on lines consistent with the proper development of the Federal Capital Territory.",13
25,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,Darling) [3.15] I accept the challenge of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) to say what is in the Committee's report.,14
26,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,The honourable member has probably told him before this what the report contains.,14
27,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I have not. The honourable member for Dalley is no prophet when be talks of the Committee haying turned down the Yass-Canberra railway project. They have turned it down, and that without much apparent reason.",14
28,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,I thought so.,14
29,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I am at liberty to speak, now that the report has been presented to the House. I very much regret that the Public ""Works Committee, by a majority decision, has decided not to provide for that needed connection with the Capital of the Commonwealth.",14
30,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Is there a minority report?,14
31,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Minorit y reports are not allowed; if they were I would have submitted one. The Committee were asked to inquire into the question of a railway connection between Yass and Canberra. After a good deal of investigation, a majority of members decided that the existing railway would suffice, a bridge across the Mtolonglo, and with a station beyond the civic centre. The railway would go a very short distance beyond the civic centre, and would be a dead-end railway. Whilst that would not inconvenience persons travelling from New South Wales or Queensland to the Capital, those who would come from Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia would be put to considerable inconvenience. It is indeed regrettable that a Committee charged with the responsibility of giving the Capital a proper railway system should have failed so lamentably. The very members of the Committee who have refused, on the score of economy, to do something that would establish the Capital on right lines for further development, are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in the erection of houses and buildings. Notwithstanding the opposition of the majority of members of the Public Works Committee, this railway line will be built. But their action will delay matters, as it will take a certain time to refer the question to them again. The Committee's action will probably prevent the completion of the line coincidently Will the transfer of Parliament to Canberra. Honourable members and their constituents, as well as others who may have business dealings at the Federal Capital, will probably suffer considerable inconvenience because of the short-sighted policy of the Committee in reporting against this railway.",14
32,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Attorney-General ) [3.18] - I am sorry that the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) has taken this action, as it places the House in an unfortunate position. The Public Works Committee, in this case, has followed the usual procedure. A matter has been referred to them for investigation, and, after making inquiries, they have presented their report to Parliament. The next step in the procedure is laid down .in the Act which constituted the Committee. The honourable member has asked members of this House to come to a decision on a report which they cannot see until it has been printed and circulated. At all times I have advocated the establishment of the Seat of Government at Canberra at as early a date as possible, and have urged that it should be made easily accessible from all parts of Australia. The honourable member has taken an unfortunate step. The printing of the report will not commit members to the acceptance of one word in it.",14
33,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"That is just the trouble. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - The honourable member would force other members to give a vote on which a wrong construction might be placed. The proper thing is for the report to be printed and circulated, so that members may judge it on its merits. The printing of the report will enable honourable members to give proper consideration to its contents.",14
34,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [3.20] The statement of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) in regard to the contents of this report may be true, but as the report is not yet available to honourable members, they have not had an opportunity of learning its contents. I claim to be as enthusiastic an advocate of Canberra as is the honourable member for Dalley or any honourable member associated with him , but I think the House is entitled what the report contains before ex pressing an opinion upon it . the report is printed and distributed honourable members cannot familiarize themselves with its contents. document which I saw handed up by the Clerk appears to be in print. If that is so, all we have to do is to formally pass the motion that it be printed, and allow the report to be circulated as quickly as possible, so that honourable members may master its contents and judge whether they should accept or reject its recommendations.",15
35,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [3.22] The Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) seemed to suggest that the honourable member for Dalley is not doing his duty as a representative of the people, but the honourable member has been in formed of the contents of this report.",15
36,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,B y whom?,15
37,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I am not a detective, but it is not necessary for the honourable member for Dalley to tell us that there are members of the Public Works Committee who would move heaven and earth to prevent Parliament meeting at Canberra.",15
38,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,Unknown,The not bound to accept the conclusions of the Committee.,15
39,Mr WEST,Unknown,The honourable member seems very anxious to do some whitewashing. I advise him to assist in preventing the printing and circulation of a report which is hostile to the intention of this House. Unfortunately the House has got into a lax way of doing its business; members should give more attention fcu> procedure.,15
40,Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON,Unknown,"I rise to a point o? order. The honourable member is entitled to say that the Government is conducting the business of the House in a loose way, but he is not in order in reflecting upon the House by saying that itb conduct of the business is lax.",15
41,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt. Hon. W . A. W at t ) . - The point of order raised by the honourable member is sound. It is an i m memorial rule that members shall not reflect upon the statutes of the House or upon the House itself, and I ask the honourable member for East Sydney to observe that rule.",15
42,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I realise that at times there are obstacles in the way of a member who wishes to speak the truth . Once this report is printed and circulated, it to know will be very difficult to have its recomr mendations reversed. Until Mr GREGORY - The House is not asked to accept the report, bu t only to order it to be printed. The Mr WEST - Once the report is printed it cannot be withdrawn, and it will be difficult to reverse its recommendations. A hostile Committee ' can seriously nrejudice a project, and in this matter the anti-Canberra members of the Committee have carried their opposition to extremes. The nature and contents of this report having been brought under notice, I hope the House will adopt some method for annulling its recommendations, and will again refer the matter to a Committee composed of gentlemen who are not hostile to the Federal Capital project, and will find justly upon the evidence submitted.",15
43,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [3.29] I am opposed to the printing of this report because the opinion of the minority is not stated. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Swan (Mr : Gregory) has said, this is a one-sided report, and when it is printed, the damage will have been done because it will House is be quoted as the report of the Committee. The fact that the opinion of the minority is ignored will not be understood. I believe that at the next general election three, if not four, of the present members of the Committee, the majority of whom are opposed to Canberra, will not be re-elected to this Parliament; therefore any delay in dealing with this report will be favourable to the desire of the people that the Federal Capital shall be established and occupied as soon as possible. Time was when the minority of any Committee could 'table its report in opposition to the views of the majority, and I have yet to learn that the House of Commons upon the practice of which, the procedure of this House is modelled, no longer allows a minority report to be submitted. This matter will not come before us again u n t i l the Government decides to proceed with the construction of the railway. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) has clearly shown that it would be a farce to construct only that portion recommended by the Committee, because, it would not enable honourable members to get readily to the Capital. Canberra was chosen as the Capital site as the result of the most extensive political leg-pulling that I have witnessed during my 35 years' parliamentary experience. I was opposed to that site and wanted to have the Capital established at Dalgety, which possesses an unlimited water supply for power and other purposes. However, by the vote of the representatives of the people of Australia, that site was chosen, and the Public Works Committee will not be doing its duty if it does not recommend the building of a railway which will be ofuse to those who have to visit the Capital.",15
44,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,The Committee cannot build the railway.,16
45,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"The Committee can recommend its construction. My young friend surely does not think that I am such a silly fool as to suggest that the Committee can build a railway. Why, then does he interject in that, absurd way ? He has shown us the quality of his work on this Committee-if his constituents are satisfied with that, let him rest content. I shall certainly oppose the motion on the principle that the minority should be given an opportunity to express its opinion.",16
46,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [3.32] - It appears to me a most extraordinary thing that honourable members should commit themselves by their speeches before they have had an opportunity to consider the report. I say advisedly that the time is coming when honourable members will be rather chary of accepting appointment to a Committee of this description if their recommendations to the House are to be challenged in this manner. The statements that have been made in regard to this matter are the most disreputable that I have heard in any Parliament. I do not know whether the honourable memfor Dalley (Mr Mahony) is a paranoic, or what sort of imagination he has. This is not the first time that he has made suggestions about me absolutely without any justification. The honourable, member has sat with me on this Committee. Can he point to a single occasion when I did nob try to do my duty ? Did he not, on . the other hand, in Perth, say how pleased he was with my efforts to see that every opinion represented on the Committee was treated justly and fairly? The motion is, "" That the report be printed."" We know what the ordinary procedure, is. I had no desire, as the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) knows, to be on this Committee. I am prepared to hand in my resignation immediately. It would be sent in within five, minutes if the House supported the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) or the honourable member for Darling. The decision of the Committee on this matter was come to unanimously.",16
47,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,The honourable member knows perfectly well that that is not true.,16
48,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - Order ! The honourable member for Darling has used an unparliamentary expression.,16
49,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I withdraw it, and say that the statement is incorrect.",16
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! Will the honourable member be good enough to resume his seat while the Speaker is on his feet ? The honourable member said that the statement of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) was not true. He knows that that is an unparliamentary expression.,16
51,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Yes , Mr Speaker, I withdraw it .",16
52,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Probably the honourable member for Darling was absent when this decision was arrived at.,16
53,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The honourable member knows perfectly well that I wanted him and the Committee to recommend an alternative, but that both he and the Committee refused to do so.",16
54,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,The Committee is out to block Canberra.,16
55,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I have allowed reasonable latitude, and there must be no further interjections.",16
56,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"For the la3t three weeks the Committee has sat without fee, and some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining a full attendance. The honourable member for Darling (Mr . Blakeley) attended in the earlier stages. I have a copy of the report, and I can assure the House that the ultimate decision of the Committee was arrived at unanimously. If the report is printed it will be distributed among honourable members, and in accordance with the provisions of the Statute dealing with the matter, the Minister for Works (Mr . Stewart) will subsequently ask the House to give effect to the report. If , after having read the report, honourable members are satisfied that so much bias haa actuated the members of the Committee that they have made a recommendation contrary to the evidence, but in accordance with their private wishes, another Committee should be appointed. If the House were to approve of the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Dalley, and the honourable member for Darling, I would not have any association with the Committee for .another hour. This sort of thing is most reprehensible, and the aspersions cast on us have no justification, and are not fair. Presumably the honourable member for Dalley considers that if he continues to throw mud some of it is bound to stick. We on this side do not play that game.",16
57,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,The report of the Committee proves the truth of what I say.,17
58,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Her e is the report. All we want is to have it printed so that in the ordinary course the Minister can bring it before Parliament, when it will be for Parliament to decide what action shall be taken. The honourable member for Dalley ought to know that no work exceeding in cost £25,000 can be carried out without first being submitted to the Public Works Committee. If he is not satisfied with the way in which the Committee does its work, he can move that the Committee does not possess the confidence of the House. It might then be possible to obtain the services of a Committee which would adopt a proposal favourable to the views of the honourable member for Darling, and the honourable member for Dalley. I hope that the House will order the printing of the report, and thus provide an opportunity for its discussion. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AUSTRALIA. ECONOMIC LOSS.",17
59,Mr MANN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"Will the Treasurer in form the House whether a report has yet been received from the Committee which was appointed to make au inquiry into the economic losses due to rinderpest"" in Western Australia? If so, when will it be made available?",17
60,Dr EARLE PAGE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"That matter is being considered by the Home and Territories Department. I shall make ""inquiries to ascertain whether a report has been furnished. POSTAL DEPARTMENT . EXAMINATIONS FOB TELEPHONISTS.",17
61,Mr WATKINS,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"U n d e r an unfortunate regulation of the Public Service Commissioners, considerable hardship has been created. Under it candidates for the position of telephonist are passed in a greater number than the Department is capable of absorbing. Some of these young people serve in a temporary capacity for periods up to three and a half years, and are then politely told that they cannot be appointed permanently. Another examination is held, and a new crop of applicants receives appointment. Will the Prime Minister take steps to have the regulation altered so as to correct the anomaly!",17
62,Mr BRUCE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"I shall go into the matter with the Public Service Board, and ascertain exactly what are the facts. COASTAL SHIPPING .  that a large proportion of coastal shipping is held up, with the result that Western Australia is almost without means of transport, will the Prime Minister take steps to arrange for the Shipping Board to meet the position ?",17
63,Mr BRUCE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"I very much regret the circumstances which have caused a dislocation of the coastal shipping trade. . I presume that, by his reference to tha Shipping Board, the honourable member means the Commonwealth Shipping Line. I have to remind him that the Line has very few_ steamers of tonnage suitable for the Australian coastal trade, but I will discuss the matter with the manager of the Line. COMPOSITE MINISTRY .",17
64,Mr CHARLTON,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"I ask the Treasurer-(1 ) Has he read the ultimatum delivered by the Prime Minister in Adelaide yesterday, that arrangements must be made at once for the purpose of enabling the Composite Government to continue, otherwise he will have to reconstruct and form a Nationalist Government? (2) Has he given any assurance to the Prime Minister that, if the Government is reconstructed, he and his followers will render subservient support to the new Ministry ?",18
65,Dr EARLE PAGE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"I am very pleased to be able to tell the honourable member that, up to the present, I have not received any ultimatum from the Prime Minister. If I do I shall, of course, inform the House.",18
66,Mr WEST,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"I have been requested to ask the Prime Minister a question concerning a statement he made on the present position of the Composite Ministry. Will he inform the House whether any attempt is to be made to reconstruct the Ministry; and, if so, whether it will be made before or after the Budget is presented ? This is a serious matter.",18
67,Mr BRUCE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,I have no knowledge of any proposed alteration. NEW LOAN FLOTATION.,18
68,Mr CHARLTON,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"In connection with the report of the flotation of a further loan of £10,000,000 in Great Britain , will the Treasurer state if it is for the purpose of redeeming short-dated bills, , and, if so, when were they issued ? In regard to his statement that £5,000,000 of the loan money is to be used for carrying out certain works authorized by Parliament, will he state to what works be referred ?",18
69,Dr EARLE PAGE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,The Treasury bills referred to were issued on the 1st of A p r i l of this year. The public works were passed by this House in the Loan Bill presented last year. JAPANESE RELIEF FUND. AUSTRALIAN TOMATO SAUCE.,18
70,Mr BAMFORD,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"Some time ago I asked the Prime Minister, in regard to the report that 36,000 bottles of Australian tomato sauce had been sent as part of the consignment of goods for the relief of the starving people of Japan, could he inform me if any of the sauce had gone into consumption, and, if so, how much. He promised to get the information. Is he in a position now to make a statement on the subject?",18
71,Mr BRUCE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"I regret very much that I have not yet received the information which the honourable member desires, and I remind him that, as it is necessary to communicate with Japan in order to ascertain if the sauce has gone into consumption in that country, this must necessarily take time. WIRE NETTING.",18
72,Mr CUNNINGHAM,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,The week before last the Minister for Trade and Customs informed the House that when next he was in Sydney he would endeavoui to finalize arrangements with the New South Wales Government for the utilization of the f u n d voted by this Parliament for the purchase of wire netting ' for farmers. Can he now inform the House of the result of his interview ?,18
73,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"I have had an interview with the Secretary for Lands in New South Wales, and I hope to be able to inform honourable members of the result, which I believe will be satisfactory, during the coming week. '' CANBERRA FREEHOLDS.'' AGENTS AT AUSTRAL IA HOUSE .",18
74,Mr SCULLIN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"Las t week I asked the Prime Minister if he could give the names of the land agents occupying offices in Australia House, London, who are reported to be offering in England freehold land at Canberra. Is he in a position to supply the information now, and can he say how long those agents are likely to remain tenants in Australia House ?",18
75,Mr BRUCE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"I must apologize to the honourable member for my inability, at the moment, to give him the information. A statement on the subject has been prepared, but I have just returned from Adelaide, and have not had time to obtain it . I shall present it tomorrow. NA AUSTRALIA. ERADICATION OF DISEASE.",18
76,Mr BRUCE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.54] -(B y leave) - Member s will recall the recent outbreak of rinderpest in Western Australia and the measures that were taken to restrict the spread of and to eradicate the disease. I desire to take this opportunity of informing honourable members of the entire success which has attended the efforts of the Commonwealth and State authorities, in co-operation; and of announcing that the disease has been completely stamped out and quarantine restrictions lifted. the outbreak of rinderpest, towards the end of last year, a proclamation was issued under the Quarantine Ac t prohibiting the removal of any animal, carcass, fodder or fittings fro m the State of Western Australia to any part of the Commonwealth unless the consent of the Minister was obtained. The aotion taken to prevent the spread of the disease in cluded the quarantining of the district within 30 miles of the infected area, and the clearing of a belt 5 miles wide on the border of this area by driving all stock inwards. All movement of stock within the area was prohibited. Every animal within 2 miles of any in fected farm was seen and reported on by a special patrol under the supervision of a veterinary inspector, and reports were made on every sick animal outside the quarantined area by a vigilance committee and by the police. A mobile in spection staff was maintained for rapid diagnosis in connection with such reports. All animals, except horses, within 1 mile of the infected premises were slaughtered, and the carcasses were buried. precautions, together with the prohibition of the removal of any animal, carcass, fodder or fittings from the State or to any other part of the State were strictly maintained. From the 29th January a steady reduction of the quarantined area took place each fortnight, and on the 20th March all quarantine restrictions-bot h within Western Australia and in relation to traffic and goods leaving Western Austialia-were removed. No developments have occurred since that date, and the Commonwealth can therefore be considered as having been entirely free from rinderpest since the 18th December, 1923. I am sure that this announcement will give great satisfaction to honourable members. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear ! USE OF WHITE LEAD. FORMAL MOTIO N OF ADJOURNMENT.",19
77,Mr SPEAKER,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"I have received from the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman), an intimation ""„hat he proposes to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public business, namely, "" The failure of the Commonwealth Government to take steps to deal with the serious menace to public health caused On by the unrestricted and unregulated use of white lead in industy in Australia, and other matters relating thereto."" Vive honourable members having risen in their placesQuestion proposed.",19
78,Mr COLEMAN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"Reid) [ 3 . 5 6 ] - I make no apology for moving the adjournment of the House to discuss this most important question, as a motion for the adjournment is the only means afforded a private member of directing public attention tb an important matter. In my opinion, anything that affects national health or in dustrial hygiene overshadows in importance any other matter that may from time to time be submitted to this House. All the members of the Labour party take up that attitude. This Parliament has discussed recently several questions affecting national health contained in the reports of Sir Neville Howse. The Commonwealth Government is directly concerned with the effect of white lead on public health, and must accept its full These share of responsibility for neglecting to protect it . Honourable members may ask in what way the Commonwealth Government is concerned. The subject was discussed at the International Labour Conference held at Geneva in 1921, at which Australia had her full representation allowable under Article 380 of the Treaty of Versailles. Two Government delegates, an employers' delegate, and a workers' delegate participated in those proceedings on behalf of Australia. The discussion which then took place about the effect upon health of using white lead was of supreme importance. It occupied several days, and was, at times, of a very bitter nature. The Conference ultimately agreed on a d r a ft convention, but not before several divisions had taken place. It is important for us to .realise that, with one exception, the whole of the workers' delegates from every country represented at that Conference favoured the absolute prohibition of the use of white lead in industry. sentient, was the Australian workers' delegate, Mr T. B . Merry, who, I feel competent to say, did not truly represent the organized workers of Australia. The Conference compromised by agreeing that the use of white lead inpainting should be restricted, and that regulations should be framed to' control its use. This was adopted unanimously in the for m of a draft convention, and the Australian representatives unanimously voted for it . The Treaty of Versailles, under the terms of which . these International Labour Conferences are held, provides that such conventions shall be ratified, or at least considered, by the Parliaments of the countries represented at the conferences. The convention to which I am directing attention is a somewhat lengthy document. It provides foT the prohibition of the use of white lead and sulphate of lead in internal painting. It also provides for the prohibition of employment in the industry of males under the age of eighteen years, and of all females. The convention was to become operative six years after the closing of the third session of the International Labour Conference, but it provides that each member of the Conference which ratifies shall make Articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and' 7 operative not later than the 1st January, 1924. The draft convention is as follows:Bach member of the International Labour Organization ratifying the present Convention undertakes to prohibit, with the exceptions provided for in Article 2, the use of white lead and sulphate of lead and of all products containing these pigments, in the internal painting of buildings, except where the use of white lead or sulphate of lead or products containing these pigments is considered necessary for railway stations or industrial establishments by the competent authority after consultation with the employers' and workers' organizations concerned. It shall nevertheless be permissible to use white pigments containing a maximum of 2 per cent, of lead expressed in terms of metallic lead. Mr Coleman. Article 2. The provisions of Article I shall not apply to artistic painting or fine lining. The Governments shall define the limits of sueh forms of painting, and shall regulate the use of white lead, sulphate of lead, and all products containing these pigments, for these purposes in conformity with the provisions of Articles 5, 6, and 7 of the present Convention. The dis- Article 3. The employment of males under eighteen years of age and of all females shall be prohibited in any painting work of an industrial character involving the use of white lead or sulphate of lead or other products containingthese pigments. The competent authorities shall have power, after consulting the employers' and workers' organizations concerned, to permit the employment of painters' apprentices in the work prohibited by the preceding paragraph, with a view to their education in their trade. Article 4. The prohibitions prescribed in Articles 1' and 3 shall come into force six years from thedate of the closure of the Third Session of the International Labour Conference. Article 5. Each member of the International LabourOrganization ratifying the present Convention undertakes to regulate the use of white lead,, sulphate of lead, and of all products containingthese pigments, in operations for which their use is not prohibited, on the following principles :I . (a) White lead, sulphate of lead, or products containing these pigments shall not be used in painting operations except in the form of pasteor of paint ready for use. (6) Measures shall be taken in order to prevent danger arising from the application of paint in the form' of spray. it (c) Measures shall be taken, wherever practicable, to prevent danger arising from dust, caused by dry rubbing down and scraping. II . (a) Adequate facilities shall be provided to enable working painters to wash during and on cessation of work. (b) Overalls shall be worn by working Article 1. painters during the whole of the ' working period. (c) Suitable arrangements shall be made to prevent clothing put off during working liours being soiled by painting material. III . (a) Cases of lead poisoning and of suspected lead poisoning shall be notified, and shall be subsequently verified by a medical man appointed by the competent authority, (ft) The competent authority may require, when necessary, a medical examination of workers. IV. Instructions with regard to the special hygienic precautions to be taken in the painting trade shall be dis- tributed to working painters. Tho competent authority shall take such steps as it considers necessary to ensure the observance of the regulations prescribed by virtue of the foregoing Articles, after consultation with .the employers' and workers' organizations concerned . Statistics with regard to lead poisoning among working painters shall be obtained :(a) As to morbidity-by notification and certification of all cases of lead poisoning. (b) As to mortality-by a method approved by the official statistical authority in each country. The formal ratifications of this Convention under the conditions set forth in Part XIII . of the Treaty of Versailles and of the corresponding Parts of the other Treaties of Peace, shall be communicated to the Secretary General of the League of Nations for registration. This Convention shall come into force at the date on which the ratifications of two members of the International Labour Organization have been registered by the Secretary-General. It shall be binding only upon those members whose ratifications have been registered with the Secretariat. Thereafter, the Convention shall come into force for any member at the date on which its ratification has been registered with the Secretariat. As soon as the ratifications of two members of the International Labour Organization have been registered with the Secretariat, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations shall so notify all the members of the International Labour Organization. He shall likewise notify them of the registration of ratifications which may be communicated subsequently by other members of the Organization. Each member which ratines this Convention agrees to bring the provisions of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and'7, into operation not later than 1st January, 1924, and to take such action as may be necessary to make these provisions effective. Each member of the International Labour Organization which ratines this Convention engages to apply it to its colonies, possessions, and protectorates in accordance with the provisions of Article 421 of the Treaty of Versailles and of the corresponding Articles of the other Treaties of Peace. A member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first comes into force, by an Aet communicated to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations for registration. Such denunciation shall not take effect until one year after the date on whioh it is registered with the Secretariat. Article 6. Article 14. At least once in ten years the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall consider the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision Article 7. or modification. Article 15. The French and English texts of this Convention shall both be authentic. That convention was unanimously agreed to by all the delegates representing all the nations, in c l u d in g Australia . U n d e r the Article 8. convention each member of the In t e r n at i o n a l L a b o u r Conference agrees to make hygienic regulations c o n t r o l l in g p a in t in g , and thus reduce the evil effects of w h it e lead upon the h e a l t h of those engaged in the p a in t in g in d u s try . The report of the Australian delegates was presented to the Article 9. the n P r i m e Minister (Mr Hughes) on the 31st M a r c h , 1922, but it was not presented to t h is P a r l i a m e n t u n t i l a l o n g period of time had elapsed. On the 7 t h J u l y , 1922, the then honourable member for A d e l a i d e (Mr B l u n d e l l ) asked Mr . H u g h es whether he intended to give effect to the convention with regard to w h it e lead. The repl y of the Governm e n t was that the matter was under conArticle 10. sideration. The p r in t e d report of the delegates was not tabled here u n t i l the 2nd A u g u s t , 1922, and then with a n u m ber of papers of no great consequence, and no time was given for its consideration. In m y o p in i o n , the reports of the In t e r n at i o n a l L a b o u r Conference, of w h i c h the W h it e L e a d Convention is the most Article 11. i m p o r t a n t , have been shelved. Parliam e n t has been given no o p p o r t u n it y to discuss the m , and y e t they are of the utmost importance, not only to Australia , but also to the w o r k of the League of N at i o n s . The League of N at i o n s in itself Article 12. has discussed m a n y h y p o the t i c a l and nebulous questions, w h i c h has b r o u g h t us not m u c h nearer to w o r l d co-operation and economic s t a b i l i z at i o n, but the w o r k w h i c h the In t e r n at i o n a l L a b o u r Conference has accomplished in the interests of h u m a n it y has been concrete and m at e r i a l , and Article 13. would be of l as t in g benefit to h u m a n it y if the Governments of all the countries represented thereat had attempted to t r e at it s reports seriously. The w o r k of the In t e r n at i o n a l L a b o u r Conference, not o n l y in regard to w h it e lead, but in the direct i o n b f r e s t r i c t in g the e m p l o y m e nt of juveniles in in d u s try , and raising the standard of ' low-wage countries, has tended to bring about world economic stabilization and to equalize world competition, and thus eliminate factors which lead to wars, trade rivalry, industrial strife. The the Government to give this House an opportunity to deliberate upon the work accomplished by the International Labour Conference shows that either it ignores its responsibility or fails to recognize the importance of the decisions of the Conference. Not only this particular convention, but other conventions as well have been contemptuously thrust aside. I have today dealt with the White Lead Convention because it is a matter which directly affects the well-being of Australian workers, and is a very live question in industry in this country at the present time. The Government might very well be accused of cynical disregard of the health of operatives in the painting industry. I admit that we - the Labour party-d o not necessarily claim to be bound by International Labour Conferences any more than we will consent to be bound by Imperial and Economic Conferences, but we do maintain that Parliament should be given an opportunity to deliberate upon these matters, and to determine whether the proposals of the Conference are in the best interests of Australia. I contrast their inaction in this matter with the attitude of the Government in regard to trade matters and the work of the Imperial and Economic Conferences. They view the decisions of those Conferences as of supreme importance, and have, maintained, perhaps indirectly, that we are morally bound to adopt all that has been done at those Conferences. when it comes to a matter affecting the working class of Australia, a proposal of real live interest, dealing with the use of an article which is responsible for a large amount of sickness and mortality amongst painting operatives, its consideration is thrust aside.",19
79,Mr SCULLIN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,The Government do not even give us an opportunity to express an opinion about it .,22
80,Mr COLEMAN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"That is my point. This report and various other reports of our delegates to International Labour Conferences have been tabled in an obscure manner, and Parliament has never been given an opportunity to discuss them. On the other hand, time has been wasted in this House in the discussion of nebulous matters dealt with by the League of Nations, which lead us nowhere. and Of course it may be said that owing failure of to the limitations of the Federal Constitution the present Government and its .predecessor were powerless to give effect to the Geneva Convention. In that case the Federal Government should have made its position in the matter perfectly clear long ago. That has not been done. I have made very exhaustive inquiries into the white lead question. From the perusal of Hansard I have found that in South Australia Sir Henry Barwell, whilst Premier of the State, was asked' by a Labour member of the South Australian Parliament whether the Federal Government had advised him of the Geneva Convention on the subject. H is answer was that it had not. A similar denial was made in Western Australia, and also in Queensland. This is a matter of live interest to the people who are represented in this and other Parliaments of Australia. Although the Federal Government may have no constitutional authority to legislate in regard to matters affecting health, and particularly in reference to the use of white lead, it is morally responsible to the International Labour Conference to see that its conventions are carried into effect by the various State Governments. If the State Governments will not take the necessary action it is for the Federal Government to in for m the International Labour Conference to that effect. So far as I can gather, neither the present Federal Government nor its predecessor approached But the State Governments on these matters, and I shall be interested to hear, when the Minister replies, whether that assertion is correct or not. It is of no use for the Government to say that the use of white lead is not a menace to health. The mere fact of the Australian delegates voting for this International Convention proves conclusively that it is. I admit that in the report of Mr Bobinson, one of the Government delegates, it is implied that the effects of lead poisoning are exaggerated, and that the workers of the world are being fooled by the zinc in terests. Zinc oxide is supposed to be a substitute for white lead in paint, but opinions differ as to whether it is an effective substitute. Yet the fact remains that our delegates voted for the White Lead Convention, which has treated as a scrap of paper, and has never been discussed or deliberated upon. The use of white lead is a matter of very great importance to Australian industrialists. opinion throughout the world recognizes that plumbism or lead poisoning is a very serious menace to health. I recognize that the white lead industry in Australia is a very important one, but, after all, the health of the workers is on a much higher plane than the sordid question of commercial gain from the development of an industry, if that industry is likely to result in ill health to the persons engaged in it. That is the principle upon which we stand, and if the manufacture of white lead is recognized as a menace to health, it should be swept out of existence in this country. I am not saying now that it is a sufficient menace to health to j u s t if y prohibition at present, but I asking that the Government shall take steps to ensure that the health of painters shall be safeguarded by the adoption of this Convention, or by bringing about some regulation of the industry. Operative Painters Union of Australia asked me to bring this matter before Parliament, and I propose to quote from their letter to show that this is a live question, and is not something which I have.brought forward in a captious and insincere manner. The secretary to the Operative Painters Union writes to meThe restriction of the use of white lead in painting is of vital importance to my members, ns hundreds of them are suffering today from the evil effects of lead, and we as a union have found it necessary to incur considerable expense in the inquiry conducted by the New South Wales Board of Trade on this matter,. and also in the distribution of literature warning our members of the attendant dangers and the need for the utmost oare and hygiene in the course of their work. Our union would be glad if you would take the earliest opportunity of ventilating the subject on the floor of Parliament, as we consider the continued and unrestricted use of this deadly commodity a matter of national importance, nnd one which is responsible for great mortality.",22
81,Mr MAXWELL,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,Do they consider that its use should be safeguarded?,23
82,Mr COLEMAN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"The Geneva Convention provides for its use under restrictive conditions, and proposes the prohibition of dry rubbing down, which is a menace to the lives of operative been painters mainly through inhalation. The Government have afforded us no opportunity to consider the convention, with the result that Australia is lagging behind the rest of the world Medical in this matter. Practically every other country in the world has legislated in regard to the use of white lead. I am given to understand that India, Japan, South Africa , Brazil, Bulgaria, Spain, Switzerland, France, Germany, and even Tunis, a country occupied by coloured people, have adopted the Geneva Convention in regard to white lead, or legislated to restrict its use. In England, legislation has existed for many years past restricting the use of white lead in the painting industry, and steps have been taken to give full effect to the Geneva Convention. I cabled the present Prime Minister (Mr Ramsay am Macdonald) on this subject some weeks ago, and have received the following replyYour telegram lead paint protection against The poisoning. Bill to carry out provisions of Convention has been introduced into Parliament, but not yet passed into law. Ramsay Macdonald. From that telegram it is evident that the Imperial Parliament, which generally lags behind us on questions of industrial hygiene, has taken steps to honour an international agreement by adopting the Geneva Convention. Australia lags behind the rest of the world in this matter. Articles 409 to 412 of the Versailles Treaty make provision for the International Labour Office to take cognizance of public or private complaints, either from a member State or an organization of employers or workmen. That complaint can be that another State is failing to give effect to its 'treaties and conventions. It certainly would be ludicrous if Japan, China, or Tunis were to lodge the complaint with the League of Nations or the International Labour Office that Australia is not - treating her international obligations seriously, and is lagging behind them in this matter. Not only is the use of white lead involved; it is also a question whether or not the League of Nations is to be effective. I believe that at the League of Nations Conference treaties in connection 'with Commerce arid arbitration were also - drawn; :up.'"" - These reports are tabled in this House..year after year, but nothing is done with respeot to. them. If we are not prepared to.'do anything, we should withdraw; .pur delegates from the Conference, - and. not,send them on a picnic costing ""thousands . of pounds. We . should . not treat ,the' recommendations of ""these' Conferences'.as a. joke - In spite of the failure bf, the Federal Government to take' steps - to secure the adoption of the'recommenda; tions'-'of - the Conference respecting ""white lead,'' action has been taken i h certain - States.'' "" In Queensland the--Labour Go: vernment'introduced a Bill to amend the - Health'Act, which was passed in 1922 in the-, .""absence of any request fro m the .Federal Government. That action was take""n. in. order to safeguard the health of tii.e'painting operatives and others in that State,. ' During the debate in the Queensland Parliament, reference was made to ,the fact ' that the Federal Government had not even proffered advice. In Western Australia also the matter was dealt with, oh the motion of Mr Alex. MCCallum, a Labour member. In his speech, Mr :MoCalluin saidSurely it was for the Commonwealth Government to advise the State Governments to give legislative effect to the decisions of the Conference. That iproves that the Western Australian Government had not been acquainted by the Federal Government with the decisions of the Geneva Conference. The introduction of the Bill in Western Australia was due to the establishment of a white lead factory in that State. As a result of a questionnaire issued through the Federal Government by the League of Nations, the Labour Government in New South Wales in 1921-prio r to the TABLE SHOWING TOE PAINTERS THE EXCESS or Class. Causes. All occupations (Commonwealth - Males , aged 15 and over) . . Painters (New South Wales, aged IS years and over) Mr Coleman. Geneva Convention-aske d the Board of Trade to conduct an exhaustive inquiry into this matter. In their report the Board of Trade saidVital statistics show that for every nineteen miners who die from lead poisoning in a series of years there are 22 painters who die from the same cause. They also show that whatever the degree of exposure in the case of the painter, the joint effects of exposure and toxity of the carbonate of lead dust make his position distinctly more sinister than that of the miner. This was the final conclusion of the BoardRegulation of the use of white lead in the painting industry is immediately necessary, both in the interest of painters and the community. The Board does not recommend either prohibition or restriction, but regulations may imply one or the other should further, study of the painters' circumstances prove it ultimately to be expedient or necessary. Two things must follow upon the adoption of a scheme of regulations: the prevalence of the disease must be progressively reduced in such a way as to give promise of its complete prevention, and meanwhile the damage caused must be measured, and all the victims of the disease, - without exception, must be adequately compensated. If regulations fail to produce either of these results they must give place to prohibition. Our delegates to the Geneva Conference went there armed with that report, and, although they opposed the prohibition of the use of white lead, they ultimately agreed to the regulation.",23
83,Sir LITTLETON GBOOM,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"In quoting from the report of the Board of Trade the honourable member omitted to mention that the Board said, "" The case for prohibition, the Board agrees, is not made out.""",24
84,Mr COLEMAN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"E x h i b it No. 16, page 736, of the Board of Trade's report is a table showing the excess of deaths from certain diseases among painters over the percentage among those in other callings: PERCENTAGE OE DEATHS DUE TO CERTAIN DISEASES. Cause ol Deaths'as'.ProporHon offall Deaths. Lead Excess of Poisoning, Deaths Tuber- Bright's in every All Lead Bright's Disease, 1,000 Poisoning.

In spite of its seriousness and the recommendation of the New South Wales Board of Trade, nothing has been done to regulate the use of white lead in New South Wales. The Labour Government was removed from office before it could carry into effect the Board of Trade'srecommendations. There is another phase of this question to which I desire to draw attention: the opinions of medical experts such as Dr W. Gelman Thompson, and Drs. Kober and Hason, the authors of the work', Diseases of Occupation and Vocational Hygiene. There is also the evidence of Sir Thomas Oliver who represented the Australian Government at the -..Geneva Convention. I have already stated that many nations have taken steps to regulate the use of white lead. In England, the painters-bot h employers and journeymen - hav e agreed to the basis of the Bill now before the House of ' Commons to adopt the recommendations of the Geneva Conference. The Painters' Union in New South Wales consider this matter to be of such importance that they have issued a special pamphlet to the operatives engaged in the industry there, in which they point out the dangers arising from the use of white lead. They urge operatives to take the precaution of changing their clothes, washing carefully, and keeping their food and drink away from contact with white lead. I ask the Government to honour its international obligation to the League of Nations, and to the International Oflice, by giving this Parliament an opportunity to consider these questions as they arise, and also to refer them to the State Governments. If the .Governments of the various States should fai l to introduce the necessary legislation we shall know where the responsibility lies. At present, we know nothing.. Like Mahomet's coffin, the matter is suspended between Heaven and earth. I object strongly to Australia spending thousands of pounds in being represented ab conferences if not one moment's consideration is to be given to the recommendations of those Conferences. I regret that I have had to condense my remarks on this important subject owing to the limitation imposed by the Standing Orders, and I also regret that more time is not available for its discussion by the many members desiring to speak, but I hope that the Minister will recognize..the importance of this question, and will give to this House a well-considered answer to the questions I have raised, so that not only the painters, but the people..qf Australia, as well as the League - of Nations and the International Labour Office, may know exactly where Australia stands in regard to this matter, and that action will follow ",24
85,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"(Darling Downs-Attorney-General) [4.2 5 ] If o one can complain of the action of the honourable member in bringing this matter forward, nor of the manner in which he has presented his case to the Housg. He is correct in saying that the subject matter of the complaint is indeed ah important one. But, as I shall presently show, the question is a complicated one. This subject was set down for discussion at the Third International Labour Conference. Prior to that Conference the Commonwealth fulfilled its obligation 'respecting this matter, by getting into touch with all the States, and gathering all the information possible to be placed before that Conference. Dr Cumpston, of the - Health Department, was - specially asked, to make a careful and complete-investigation so far as was possible.' In his report, he said- ,' --'< In my opinion, it must be concluded - that the evidence which is available is altogether insufficient to justify such a sweeping - change as is advocated by the International .Labour Conference. That is to say, prohibition. . HonprLabour able members are aware that /large centres of population, such as Broken Hill and Port Pirie, are largely, dependent on the lead industry, .and that Australia supplies a large proportion 'of 'the white lead used throughout the world. They are, therefore, conscious of the im portance of the industry to Australia, and the serious effect prohibition would have. Dr Cumpston. continues The evidence available, at least in Australia, certainly does not justify the total prohibition of white lead in painting. It may justify' certain measures of regulation in the"" nse of white lead, which, in my opinion, is very likely to be indicated by the evidence when the latter is fully marshalled; but it would only be possible to give a reasonable pronouncement on this aspect after careful and complete investigation of the whole evidence .which can be obtained. This would probably take from six to twelve months to collect and arrange, and might perhaps be entrusted to the Commonwealth Department of Health as a function of their proposed .activities in the direction of industrial hygiene. In the meanwhile, if I might be allowed to suggest it, it would be desirable to inform the International Labour Conference that the evidence available is altogether insufficient to warrant the proposed sweeping reform, involving the total prohibition of the use of lead. Even the most advanced advocates of the control of lead, viz., the medical profession of Queensland, have placed it on record that the total prohibition of the use of white lead is unnecessary. A letter from the Premier of Western Australia was as follows: The Engineeir-in-Chief and the Prinoipal Architect of the Public Works Department are of the opinion that the injurious effects suffered by members of the painting trade are only 'partly attributed to white lead, the greater part being ascribed' to the use of volatile oils, and they consider that a draft convention prohibiting the use of white lead in the painting trade should not be submitted to the Conference. .The Premier of Tasmania wroteI am of the opinion that prohibition should not be imposed on the use of white lead until research has definitely proved its injurious effects; and, from the economic point of view, until such time as proof is forthcoming that reliable substitutes are available. The Premier of South Australia stated that the Government could not, after the - inquiries made, see its way to support - legislation to prohibit the use of white lead, as the evidence available did not warrant the interference with such an important industry. The New South Wales Board of Trade, which conducted an inquiry at the request of the Government of that State, reported, after ""the examination of many witnesses, that neither restriction nor prohibition is necessary or desirable, but that proper regulations are sufficient.",25
86,Mr COLEMAN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,That inquiry was held before the Geneva Conference made this recommendation.,26
87,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"The report was received by the Government and I am under the impression that it was sent on to our delegates after they had left for Geneva. The continental hostility to the use of white lead, would, if effect had been given to it , have been disastrous to certain industries in Australia. Our delegates said that they did not believe that a case had been made out for prohibition. Sir Thomas Oliver, the delegate of the Commonwealth Government, speaking at the Conference, said:Speaking as one of the Australian delegates, I am authorized to say that the Government - Of 'the Commonwealth of Australia is opposed to prohibition and restriction of lead in the matter under discussion - It recognizes that the health of the workers must be a first consideration, and it will welcome and carry out loyally any recommendation or resolution which make for improving the conditions of labour and for safeguarding the health of the workers. The Labour delegate from Australia, Mr . Merry, a most conscientious and capable man, who did very fine service, said- On the Commission I said openly and fairly - I did not go behind any one's back- I was opposed to prohibition, but I favoured regulation. I have heard nothing in this or the Conference to change my opinion. . . . I will give place to nobody in my desire to uphold the health and the well-being of the workers of the world, let alone Australia. Mr Bobinson, another delegate, saidThe Government of Australia is opposed to either prohibition or restriction; it favours regulation. I desire to affirm that the first consideration of the Australian Government is the preservation of the life and health of the worker, and I say definitely that commercial considerations ""do not stand in the application of that policy in Australia. Australia's record in this direction, I am sure it will be admitted, has been equalled by few nations in the world. While we will not accept prohibition, either partial or complete, we will give our wholehearted support to any regulations which are shown to be necessary to safeguard the health and lives of the workers. But these regulations, be it understood, should cover the use of all paints, whatever may be their base. Ultimately the French demand for a prohibition was defeated, and a convention was agreed to, our own delegates supporting it . Anybody who looks carefully into the evidence must admit that no case had been made out for prohibition, but there is a case for regulation, and for the consideration of this convention by the competent authorities. Even now investigation is proceeding in Australia. Many cases which were said to be due to lead poisoning have been found to be due to other causes. Past statistics were open to question. Scientific investigation' is now taking place in various countries, as is proper i h connection with a matter affecting the health of the community. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) has discussed the action that should follow the adoration of the convention regarbSng white lead . The .whole of the conventions and recommendations, numbering nearly 40 since the inception of the International Labour Conferences, have been carefully analysed quite recently. The position of the Commonwealth is complicated by the fact that we are under a Federal Constitution. The treaty recognizes the special circumstances in certain countries and providesIn the case of a Federal State the power of which to enter into Conventions on labour matters is subject to limitations, it shall be in the discretion of that Government to treat the draft Agreements to which limitations apply as recommendations only, and the provisions of this article in regard to recommendations shall apply in each case. The duty of the Federal Executive is to forward these recommendations to the competent authority. We have that some of the matters that are the subject of conventions are partly Federal legislation. and partly State, and the others are purely State concerns. So far as Federal Departments and Territories are concerned, the conventions and recommedations are being submitted to them, and already some reports are awaiting consideration by the Governimpose ment. The recommendations of the first Labour Conference have been forwarded to the competent authorities, the policy of the Government being that the. obliauthorities. gations incidental to membership of the conference must be fulfilled . taking action accordingly, and I hope States? that within a short period the whole of the conventions and recommendations will have been submitted to the proper have authorities. If honourable members will last few weeks. consult the official journals regarding extent to which other countries sented at the Conference have acted upon its recommendations, they will find that Australia's action has not been singular. has expired. In regard to many conventions and recommendations, Australia has more fulfilled its obligations in its existing legislation. Of course, the object of conferences or conventions is to lift all the countries of the world to the same plane, so that in the competiits tion of l if e and the interchange of merce all shall operate on fair terms. I h some respects Australia is ahead of many other countries, and, therefore, legislative action is required. honourable member for Reid referred to what Great B r it a in has done in regard to white lead, but an official publication of last year shows that the convention i regard to white lead had, at the time publication, been ratified by two counlieve tries only, namely, Czecho-Slovakia and Esthonia.",26
88,Mr COLEMAN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,That does not dispose of our moral obligation.,27
89,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"No. The same publication shows that Czecho Slovakia and Switzerland have Bills in preparation to apply the treaty, whilst Bulgaria, Chili, Germany, Italy , Latvia, Netherlands, Poland and Spain have recommended its ratification. The Commonwealth Government will treat the white lead convention as a recommendation, because all the conditions laid down in it are matters within the purview of found the States - The Commonwealth has no power to give effect to the convention by",27
90,Mr COLEMAN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,Has the Commonwealth any power with regard to public health?,27
91,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"It has certain powers, but it has no power to by legislation prescribed duties on persons carrying on industries within a State. Therefore, this convention with others will be forwarded to the State",27
92,Mr COLEMAN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,Hav e any of the We are other conventions been forwarded to the,27

94,Mr SPEAKER,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"The Minister's time Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [4.43]. than - I would be very glad if I could agree with the Attorney-General that in these this matter the Government is doing everything that can be expected of it , but I cannot admit that this Government or predecessor has fulfilled its obligacomtions in regard to the conventions of the International Labour Conference. That view is supported by the statement of the no Attorney-General. It should be underThe stood distinctly that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) does not at this stage advocate the prohibition of the use of white lead. Such a step would have n a serious effect upon one of the great in of dustries of Australia, and, whilst I betbat a certain amount of regulation is desirable, I have not yet seen sufficient evidence to justify the prohibition of the use of white lead, especially having regard, to the fact that in connection with the mining of the raw material and the manufacture of the article, regulations can be applied will make those industries safe for the workmen engaged in them. But the honourable member wishes to see effect given to the resolution of the International Labour ence regarding the regulation of the use of white lead, wherever danger to beings may result. Those resolutions were unanimously agreed to by representatives of both employers and employees, the report of the conference was tabled in this House on the 2nd August, 1922. Yet the Attorney-General admits that the convention has not yet been forwarded to the States. We are glad to have his promise that in the near future the constitutional obligations of the Commonwealth will be fulfilled, but we have Ms amazing confession that up to the present time the Government has not seen fit to take any action in this matter. The very fact that this resolution was carried at the Conference should pressed upon the mind of the Government the importance of this matter, even although honourable opposite, as a party, are not much concerned about safeguarding health and lives .of industrial The duty of the Government is not. only to send these recommendations States, but also to exert the whole of its influence in seeing that the States give some effect to them; otherwise, the conference becomes a mere farce so far as Australia is concerned. We know, of course, that the States occupy a strange in'relation to the International Conference. Nevertheless, that is the duty of the Commonwealth Government, unless it acts accordingly it does not fulfil its obligations as one of the signatories to the Covenant of the League of Nations. I think the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) will agree that the Government has been amazingly in the matter. He has admitted that this convention relating to white lead has noteven been passed on to the State Governments. I do not think that such delay should have occurred. The dations ought to be sent along, not in the order in which they are dealt with by the Labour Conference; the importance of Mr F. MCDonald. the matter should decide the despatch with which a recommendation is sent to the States, with the request that commercial they give immediate consideration to it . which More than that, of course, we cannot exreasonably pect the Commonwealth Government to do. It appears to the industrial workers for Reid that while this Government has been so dilatory in the matter of securing legislaConfer- tion for the protection and extension of their rights, it and the Governments of human the States have shown extraordinary activity in proposals aiming at. the l i m i tation and restriction of those rights. We and hear continually of conferences of the Attorneys-General and, other Ministers of the Commonwealth and the States being held to consider the taking away of' such ; rights as resort to Federal arbitration. Some persons in New South Wales appear to be obsessed by that idea. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) has stated that this matter possesses importance as showing the attitude of the Government towards resolutions passed at the International Labour unanimously Conference. I agree with the honourable have im- member that this is a most important matter. There are honourable membersopposite as well as honourable members on members this side whobelieve in the League of very Nations, and many wish to further its; the will . This convention appears to me to be workers. onp of the most important of the League's decisions. It has been said that the to the greatest fear is that the League of Nations, may become simply an instrument in the hands of the rulers of the different nations, and the greatest hope is that it may become a real people's body. This is one way in which to make it in the minds position of the people a real live institution. . If Labour the recommendations of this great Labour Conference can be transmuted into legisand lation that will benefit the workers in every country, those workers will take in it that interest which honourable members wish to see them take. The International 1 Labour Conference is an institution which, I believe, will confer as much benefit dilatory upon the people of Australia as upon those living in what are considered to be backward countries. It is going to raise the standard of the so-called backward countries. I believe in the general raisrecommen- ing of the standard of the workers of every country. Australia has, perhaps, more to gain, indirectly, from this than any nation in the world. We are, very largely, a food-producing people. To-day we lose a great deal because our customers have not sufficient purchasing capacity take our commodities in such quantities would bring us additional prosperity. I through the medium of this institution, we can raise the standard of living i those other countries, and thus create .greater consuming and purchasing power in their people, Australia inevitably w he able to sell to them more of her prowhite ducts, and thus reap immense benefit. Since the Labour Conference can confer these benefits, not only directly upon individual workers, but also indirectly upon the whole of the people of AusGovernments. tralia, it behoves the Commonwealth Gomatter vernment to use its utmost influence see that the resolutions of the Conference are passed on to the State Governments with the earnest appeal that they shall consider them as favourably as possible.",27
95,Mr LATHAM,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"Kooyong) [4.52] - It is, I think, a matter for sincere regret t h at the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton into which we have entered. Groom) has been unable to give a more satisfactory answer to the questions asked by the honourable member for Eeid (Mr Coleman) or one more honourable to this Government and its predecessor. The question before the House is, not whether .the use of white lead should be prohibited or restricted, but whether this Government and its predecessor have obi served the. plain obligation which rests upon the Government of the Commonconsider wealth to pass on to the competent authorities the recommendations of the International Labour Conference. The predecessor of this Government pass on to any authority a single recommendation, nor did it take any action either in this House or elsewhere give effect to Australia's promise that been carried out? the draft conventions would be sent on as recommendations to the competent authorities. Last session I asked the prerecommendations sent Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) whether any recommendations had been sent on to the State Governments, or any action taken in this Parliament upon any vention, and the answer was "" No . """,29
96,Mr COLEMAN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"There are, at least, about 30 of them.",29
97,Mr LATHAM,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"I asked him, also, whether steps would be taken to have these matters attended to in order that Australia might observe the promise she had solemnly made, and the answer was, to "" Yes . "" I confess that it was a disapas pointment to me to hear this afternoon f , that after this lapse of time only some of the recommendations had been sent on. It n is perfectly plain that the restriction of a the use of white lead is a matter for determination by the States; this Parliament has no power either to proi l l hibit or restrict in any way the use of lead in paint or otherwise in Australia. . Accordingly, the only thing the Commonwealth Government can' do,. and the that which it ought to do, is to send at once the recommendations to the State I suggest that this is not a upon which it is necessary for the to Commonwealth Parliament to make up its mind, because, even though this Government and this Parliament entirely disapprove of a particular recommendation, the plain duty of the Commonwealth Government is to send all recommendations to' the proper authority, in accordance with the undertaking It is, therefore, unnecessary for the Government to spend a great deal of time in determining whether or not it approves of a recommendation about white lead or anything else. It has often been said in Australia that this country is so advanced in industrial legislation, and in conditions of employment generally, that t is unnecessary for us to take action upon these recommendations, or even to them. I venture to dissent entirely from that view. We have undertaken to submit these recommendations to the proper authorities, and we ought to did not do it without any argument.",29
98,Mr BOWDEN,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"Eve n though we know to that the recommendations have already M i . LATHAM - E v e n though those have already been carried out, we ought to observe our undertaking to submit them to the proper authority. Friends of mine associated conwith the League of Nations at Geneva have written to me asking, '* Why is it that Australia, which professes to be an advanced industrial and democratic country, is conspicuous among the nations of the world in paying no attention whatsoever to the recommendations of the d r a f t convention of the International Labour Conference ?"" It has already been saidby, I think, the honourable member for Barton (Mr F . MCDonald)-tha improvement in the standard of the in dustrial conditions of other countries is beneficial to Australia. Surely, then, it is obviously desirable that Australia should set an example of respect for the decisions of the International Labour Conference. As a matter of fact, that Conference has already produced, in the India and Japan in particular, very portant and far-reaching results. It is by no means a body which has simply ing passed resolutions that end in words and never issue in action. Very great have already been made in those countries, which are going to be our industrial competitors at no very distant date, and dermic injection? it behoves Australia to carry out her obligation-the first international obligation she ever undertook-to the letter, without delay or argument.

103,Mr BRUCE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"The answers i,o the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. It is impracticable to make an average estimate, as the number of units required may vary according to several factors, as follow:(1) The severity of the case; (2) the food requirements of the patient; and (3) the methods of administration of insulin adopted by the medical practitioner. Reasonable requirements would vary from 10 to 40 units per diem. 2.

Duggan, Trade Union Representative 10. Does he not think that it would be in the best interests of the people to again admit shovels free Of duty? I am now able to furnish the honourable with the following information:1. Under the Tariff, shovels are dutiable at 35 per cent. (United Kingdom) and 45 per cent. (General Tariff) as manufactures of metal not elsewhere included. Up to August, 1919, they were admitted under a by-law made by the Minister at 10 per cent, if of foreign origin and free if from United Kingdom. 2. They were removed from the tools of trade list on 30th August, 1919, and then became dutiable according to the Tariff rates. 3. The by-law including shovels under item 219 of the Tariff was rescinded on 30th August, 1919. 4. The ordinary Tariff rate then applied, viz., 30 per cent. (British) and 35 per cent. (General). These rates were raised in the 1921 Tariff to 35 per cent, and 45 per cent. (Tariff item 208). 5. Shovels were dutiable under the Tariff as framed. The Minister (under the Customs Tariff 1902, and again under the Customs Tariff 1908-11) included them in a list of tools to be admitted under by-law for the reason that they were hot made in Australia. When, and because, information was brought under notice that Australian manufacture was established, the Minister removed them i r om the list and duty was charged as intended by Parliament. 6. Three. 7. Fifteen. 8. The official statistics do not record shovels imported. Since 1922-23 inclusive, "" Shovels and Spades "" have been recorded, but the importations of shovels alone cannot be ascertained. 9. Approximately-Yea r 1921, 23,320; year 1922, 19,480; year 1923, 18,800 in number. 10. The intention of the Tariff is to foster manufacture in Australia, and shovels can be and are being made here, and it is considered that the manufacturer is entitled to protection from goods produced under cheaper labour conditions. The quality of the Australian shovel is such that considerable orders are obtained there for from some of the State Railways Commissioners. FEDERAL CAPITA L TERRITORY.",38

In Committee (consideration resumed! duties, 36 from 16th May, vide page 753): Clause 6(1.) The Commission shall consist of three vernor-General. who shall be appointed by the Go(3.)

123,Mr MCNEILL,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Wannon) [5.10] - At , this stage in our history we should proceed very carefully in the matter of public expenditure. The Bill gives too much power to the proposed Commission. It is undesirable that in such an important hours business as the development, of the Federal Capital, control should be taken fro m taken the responsible Minister. The Bill ' proposes to vest the Commission with power, , to impose taxation, to manage tramways, to control sewerage, waterworks,. lighting, the and all the manifold activities of a modern city. In my opinion there is no possibility of Canberra attracting a large population for many years. There is no port, no coal or timber resources, and not per diem, a great deal of agricultural land. The 4s. 3d. diem, area is principally a grazing proposition, 3s. 8d. and necessarily the land must be occupied in large holdings. Manufacturers, with to all the advantages of big cities like Sydwhich is added 2s. per diem contributed by each officer. ney and Newcastle available to them, are Is. 9d. certainly not likely to pay freight on raw - per diem, material to Canberra, and on the manufactured product from the Federal Capital 6s. 9d. to the sea-board. The appointment'of a per diem.* ld. Commission will, undoubtedly, lead to exper diem.* penditure over and above the £7,000 per annum for the remuneration of its members, for it is certain that the Commissioners will soon have round tbem a staff of officers to assist them in their duties. Our financial position is such that we should mark time for some years. certainly should not launch out on heavy expenditure at the present time. I know nothing that is likely to attract a population to Canberra within the next fifteen years: Mr YATES.^There is .a salubrious climate.",40
124,Mr MCNEILL,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"I believe the climate is very good in summer, but extremely cold. in. winter. However,. I am not saying anything against - the site at all. Rightly or wrongly Canberra has been selected as the Seat of Government, and we must abide by the decision. We are from 30 to 50 years ahead of our time. The Government cannot very well at this stage drop the Bill , but I think it would have been wise had it decided to delay proceeding with the measure u n t i l Canberra was actually the. Seat of Government. We are not justified in appointing a Commission at present.",41
125,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T, The Committee has agreed' to the appointment of a Commission. The question is whether there shall be one Commissioner or three.,41
126,Mr MCNEILL,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"I realise that we are now discussing whether there shall be a Commission of one member or of one full time and two casual members. I cannot conceive of any two gentlemen capable of filling the position of Commissioner accepting casual appointments. qualified men should be appointed, and I do not believe that such men wil l sacrifice their present positions to undertake casual work. A Commission is unnecessary, but if it is to be appointed it certainly should consist of one Commissioner only.",41
127,Mr YATES,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Adelaide) [5.17] - This amendment has been moved to test the sincerity of honourable members opposite, who say that they favour one Commissioner rather than three. I hope, however, that the Committee will yet show its wisdom by refusing to agree to Commission - control of Canberra. If it votes against the clause, it will k ill the Bill , and that is the best thing that could happen. A number of honourable members have not expressed their honest beliefs in this debate. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr MCNeill) has just stated that we are 50 years ahead of our time. I have looked up the debates which occurred in this House a few years ago, when the Minister then administerWe ing Canberra affairs sought for authority to proceed with additional sewerage work there. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) voted against anything being done, and similar action was taken by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell), who said last Friday 'that, as the House had decided upon the appointment of a Commission, he would vote for the clause. A few years ago he voted against any work being done, notwithstanding that the decision had been made long before to proceed with the construction of Canberra. He was not then prepared to accept the view of the majority. He is inconsistent. On that occasion the Minister, speaking' in favour of the continuation of the work, said that the additional sewerage provision proposed would serve the city for the next 50 years. The present Postmaster-General (Mr . Gibson) interjected, "" For the next 200 years."" Yet today he is a member of a Government which is prepared to hand to three Commissioners its responsibility for work which, in his opinion, will not be necessary for 200 years. I protest against the lack of sincerity in this debate. Honourable members with views such as those to which I have referred will not be doing the fair thing to the taxpayers if they support the Bill . I shall not enlarge upon my previously expressed opinion that Canberra Only will be a "" d u d "" city, but I must remark that it will have no means of support apart from revenues which the Commonwealth Government obtains from other sources. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) on Friday supported this Bill with considerable vigour, because he said that it would make for efficiency. The Bill was also supported by the honourable member for Barker (Mr M . Cameron) and the honourable member for Boothby (M t . Duncan Hughes). I wish to draw the attention of those honourable members to a leading article which appeared in the Adelaide Register on the 13th May. That newspaper, as a rule, enunciates the policy and creates the opinion of the section of electors represented by those honourable members. The article indicates clearly that in supporting this Bill those gentlemen are not reflecting the view of the people who voted for them. The Register is opposed to the proposal of the Government to give the control of Canberra to a Commission.",41
128,Mr MAKIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,W h e r e are the South Australian supporters of the Government ? They should be here.,42
129,Mr YATES,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"I would prefer them to hear my remarks, and |also what ;the Register has to say on the subject. The quotation is as follows:GOVERNMENT BY COMMISSION. The month's adjournment of the Federal Parliament enabled opposition to develop to the foolish proposal of the Government to control the Federal Capital by a permanent commission, and when the debate on the second reading of the Seat of Government (Administration) ""Bill was resumed on Thursday, the measure was subjected to heavy criticism from both sides of the House. The main objections to the project have already been stated in the Register. Chief among them is the fact that the Bill represents a continuation-in deed, an extension-of the pernicious system of handing over the business of Government to commissions which are only remotely responsible to Parliament, which involve the creation of additional billets, and which, largely independent of the Minister, may be used by him as a means of evading responsibility for extravagance and inefficiency. I emphasize the point that, in the opinion of the Register, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) will not be supporting economical administration if he votes for this clause. He should give heed to the remarks of that journal, for it is the mouth piece of the organization to which he belongs. It states in unmistakable terms that Commission control means inefficient control. The Register article continuesWhat happened in connection with the War Service Homes Commission is well and unfavorably known to the public, yet the Government proposes to clothe the Canberra Commission with even greater authority than that enjoyed and misused by the former body-the power, for instance, to raise, loans for unlimited amounts. Not only are the principles of the Bill bad, but the Minister for Works, in introducing it, gave ample reasons why the creation of a new and expensive administrative body was entirely unnecessary, the work, as Mr Stewart, candidly admitted, already being efficiently performed, under Ministerial supervision, by the Advisory Committee and the officers of the public Departments. The concluding sentence is as follows: The Bruce-Page Government will be well admembers. vised to drop the Seat of Government Bill, and continue the system of departmental construction, which has admittedly worked well. That indictment of Commission control should cause the South Australian representatives in this Chamber to whom I bave referred, to reconsider their position. They have the opportunity to do so while this clause is before the Committee. I remind them that the Register is a maker of public opinion, and the creator, in the main, of conservative policy in South Australia. They will be failing in their duty if they disregard its opinions. They should accept the smaller of two evils, and vote for the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), and, later, they should vote against the clause. The effect of such a vote would be to destroy the Bill . Those honourable gentlemen bave not supported their expressed opinions with very logical arguments. They said that a Commission would be efficient, and that the mistakes of. past Commissions would not be repeated; but we have no assurance whatever that that will be so. They will be making a serious being mistake if they vote in favour of handing over the responsibilities of Parliament to a Commission of one, two, or three members, which will not be amenable to the will of Parliament, and which will be only partially under the authority of the Minister. I hope that we shall shoulder the responsibility we bear to the taxpayers of Australia, and retain parliamentary administration of the Federal Capital Territory..",42
130,Mr MAKIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Hindmarsh) [ 5 . 2 8 ] - I do not feel content to observe in silence the subordination, at the expense of conviction and consistency, which has been shown during this debate by followers of the composite Ministry. I say "" followers"" advisedly, because those honourable members appear to have neither the quality nor the capacity to form an opinion of their own. If they have that power, it is quite evident that they have not the courage to advocate opinions so formed. This debate has revealed a woful inconsistency in some honourable members opposite. Early in the discussion a number of them intimated that they favoured the appointment of a Commission, but were opposed to a Commission of three Some of them were opposed altogether to Commission control. We have been given a demonstration of the discipline enforced on the supporters of this composite Government in their party rooms. Never again will they be able, honestly, to criticize an opposing party because its members hold uniform views. No greater measure of uniformity has been shown, nor.has there ever been such an illustration of the control exercised over individual members of Parliament by their parties,- than that displayed on this occasion.",42
131,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,The Government have not been so successful in securing uniformity as has the Leader of the honourable member's party.,43
132,Mr MAKIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"The inconsistency that has been shown is aptly illustrated by the actions of the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart), who has just interjected. It is remarkable that honourable members opposite who a few days ago were against the appointment of three Commissioners, and even, in some cases, against the appointment of any Commission, are prepared now to support the Government. Those honourable members who held decided views are now required to throw consistency to the wind and support the Government. Honourable members opposite must do as they are told, and they are now prepared to adopt an attitude which is not in keeping with the views which they previously expressed. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay) definitely said that he would vote against the appointment uf a Commission of three members, but, with other honourable members opposite, I have no doubt that he will be found supporting the Government proposal, and we shall know whether they are influenced by a desire to serve the interests of the Government or those of Australia. direct attention to the important fact that the day-labour system has been in operation at Canberra, to the disadvantage of the private friends of honourable members on the Government side. They wish to .change that system which has been operated so successfully, but they wish also to be in a position to put the responsibility for the change on the new administration of Canberra to be undertaken by the Commission. The history of the operations of the War Service Homes Commission is not very far behind us, and it shows that publio interests were subordinated to those of private con[33] tractors, who waxed f at upon the opportunities afforded them by the Commission in connection, not only with the building of War Service Homes, but also with the disposal of the various stocks of material held by the Commission. The Commonwealth has suffered heavy losses as a result of opportunities provided for profit-making by contractors and others associated with the building trade. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) was called upon to set right the mistakes made by the War Service Homes Commission, and yet, although he is the one man who should be best able to appreciate how very desirable it is to prevent responsibility for public works being placed in the hands of a Commission, he now advocates handing over the responsibility of this Parliament for the construction of the Federal Capital to such a body. Let us hopo that, even at this eleventh hour, the honourable gentleman and those supporting him will recognize that this proposal will not lead to true economy, and will not save Australia from becoming a prey to greedy, selfish, and unscrupulous contractors, whose existence in this community has been amply demonstrated by the history of the operations of the War Service Homes Commission. I should like to ask the Minister whether he believes that the appointment of a Commission of either one or three members to administer affairs at Canberra will in any way relieve the responsible officers of his Department now carrying on work in the Federal Capital Temtory. One of the Minister's strongest arguments in support of this proposal has been that it will meet serious difficulties at present existing in the Department over which he presides. There is no one I who stands higher in that Department than the Director-General of Works, Colonel Owen. He is a most efficient officer, whose work is entitled to our unstinted praise; but will the appointment of a Commission to administer affairs at Canberra relieve this officer of his duties in the Territory? It will not. Colonel Owen will need to be on the spot to continue his supervision of building operations at Canberra ? Will the appointment of the Commission relieve Mr . Goodwin, the Surveyor-General? I am sure that it will not; nor will it relieve any other official of equal standing at present engaged at Canberra. The proposed Commission will merely create an additional supervizing that will be likely to bring confusion in the building Federal Capital. It is evident that it will not bring about economy, and will give no relief to officers of the Works and Railways Department, and thus the Minister is deprived of one of the principal arguments he submitted appointment of a Conunission. honourable gentleman and his supporters must justify their attitude, and must try to reconcile their advocacy of economy, on the one hand, with their support of a proposal which is calculated to lead to lavish expenditure of the people's money without an adequate return. being invited today to follow a most undesirable course in the conduct of public affairs. The Government are proposing that the responsibility of this shall be handed over to a that will not be responsible to this Parliament, or answerable to the What does this mean? Only this afternoon I endeavoured to elicit regarding a great public which has been placed in the hands of a Commission. During the whole of last week I endeavoured to secure certain information concerning this but without result. That received today was incomplete unsatisfactory. We find that responsible members of this Parliament to secure information in connection an important Commonwealth which feh3y have a right to expect. has been proved in the case of the Commonwealth Shipping Board, will be proved again in the case of the Federal Capital If I occupied a position similar to that held by the Minister, and did not feel inclined to accept the responsibility taching to it, T would be honest enough to say that I desired to be relieved of. my office, and would allow oorne one who had the canwilv and the inclination to undertake the responsibilities tions of office to take my place. I cannot reconcile the attitude of the Government towards this inatter with my views of responsible Government. The expenditure which we are a=ked to incur certaiulj is not justified. The Minister has admitted that the work has been carried out most successfully under the guidance Mr Mukin. and direction of the Department now conauthority trolling it . about Mr STEWART - B e fair, and say that of the I said that the arrangement had worked satisfactorily to date, but that the problems of the futur e would be such that the existing machinery would not enable satisfactory work to continue.",43
133,Mr MAKIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"I have been perfectly for the fair, and the former part of the MinisThe ter's interjection amply confirms my statement. Some of the greatest public utilities which will be required in the Capital City have already been completed, or are nearing completion. I ask the Minister to say what more important undertakings are contemWe are plated than those of the water supply, the sewerage, the power plant, or even Parliament House itself. Those works have been successfully carried Parliament out under the Works and Railways DeCommission partment. If given the opportunity, the people of Australia would show that we people. on this side have correctly interpreted their views in relation to this matter. I information hope that the Minister will recognize undertaking how indefensible is the attitude adopted by the Government. As the work, so far, has been successfully carried out by the Works and Railways Department, undertaking, especially where the day-labour system which I has operated, the Minister should not pass and his responsibilities over to Commissioners. To do so would - permit the intrusion of are unable those features which, in connection with with the War Service Homes Commission, activity proved so disastrous to the ComThis monwealth. The Minister should remember the lesson taught by that Comand it mission, and even at this late hour, in the interests of the whole of Australia, Commission. reconsider this matter.",44
134,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"East Sydney) [5.50] It is evident that members on the other at- side are determined to have a Commission. I do not agree with them, but if a Commission is to be appointed, it should consist of one member only. I have taken an active part in the estaband obliga- lishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra, and have come in personal contact with the men in charge there. They are serving their country well. That being so, why is this measure now introduced ? Last week two members of the legal profession-the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), and the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom)-spoke on this Bill , but they failed to touch the real question. The substance of their remarks was that a mistake having been made, it must be perpetuated, however great the cost to the people of Australia. You, Mr Chairman, know as well as I do that even if a Commission is appointed, the real persons in control will be those officers who up to date have carried out the work at Canberra so faithfull y and well. The professional men who have been in control of this work in the past would still remain in control if a Commission were appointed.",44
135,Mr GABB,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],45
136,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"The Commissioners, if appointed, would act solely on the advice of their professional officers, in the same way as the directors pf a bank adopt the recommendations of their managers. The action contemplated by the Government would be an injustice to men who have put their heart and soul into this workmen who desire to leave behind them a monument to their ability and foresight. I place these men in the same category as those responsible for the construction of the Assouan Dam and the Panama Canal. The foundation of the Federal Capital has been well laid, and it now remains only for the super-structure to be erected thereon. Are we to pay £7,000 a year to Commissioners, and salaries to messengers, and typists, and incur other huge expenses, merely to have a Commission to finish work so well commenced? The people of Australia should be proud of the Labour party, because by their criticism they have compelled the Ministry to acknowledge that it has made an error. If greater efficiency were to result from the increased expenditure, I would not call the extra cost extravagance, but as that will not be the case, I am justified in asking honourable members on the otlier side to assist in defeating this measure. It should not be made a party matter. When the Labour party was in power in 1910-13 they were neither so blind, nor so stupid, as to think that no one outside that party knew anything. They accepted suggestions from any quarter, so long as they were in the best interests of the' country. And in this matter we are asking only that the best thing for Australia should be done. The Opposition, by its criticism in the present and preceding Parliaments, has saved the country millions of pounds, nnd honourable members should not withhold their support from proposals which emanate from this side simply for fear that those proposals may reflect credit upon us at the next general election. They should consider their duty as representative men, and place the interests of the country before those of their party. In advocating the appointment of one Commissioner we have-no particular candidate in mind. I believe that one military gentleman, who has had a succession of public appointments eversince the conclusion of the war, is at present out of employment. I do not know whether .anybody has him in mind for a seat on the Commission. If a Commission of three men is appointed, the present professional officers of the Works and Eailways and Home and Territories Departments will have lo lay the'ir proposals before the Commission for endorsement; and what a humiliating position they will occupy if theirrecommendations and advice are set aside by a body of laymen! If the Government had found that the work at the Federal Capital was badly managed and required supervision by a responsible body of professional men, there might be some justification for the creation of a Commission. But the good work clone by the existing departmental officers is admitted by the Government. Therefore, this Commission will involve an unnecessary expenditure of money, with no prospect of better results being achieved. As one who was for many years a contractor and a sanitary engineer, I inspected very carefully the work done at Canberra, and I was satisfied that it could not have been done better. Moreover, I found all the officers and men animated by a fine spirit; they desire their work at Canberra to beia monument to them. The pioneering work of the new city has been done, and the casting aside of the existing officers at the eleventh hour will be a cruel wrong. Are honourable members opposite so lacking in humanity as to be unable to realise the in j u r y they are doing to a fine set of officers? I should not be discharging the trust reposed in me by the electors if I did not protest against such an injustice to those men and to the Australian people at large.",45
137,Mr HURRY,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Bendigo) [6.12] Having regard to the manifold duties to be performed by the Commission, it seems to me that it will be impossible to find any one Commissioner qualified to control so many diversified operations. Clause 14 includes, amongst the powers of the Commission, the control and management of Crown lands, the levying and collection of rates upon land, the construction, maintenance, and operation of tramways-wbic b Ave hope will be a big work in the future, when a settled population has been established there-the construction aud control of roads, bridges, culverts, levees, sewers, drains, and watercourses, the provision of gas, electricity, water, and sewerage-thes e are works which are usually controlled by a Board-the protection of public health, the construction of all works and buildings, and generally the municipal government of the Territory. I h addition, they have to arrange for the financial dealings of the whole of the Capital Territory, and the raising of loans for the carrying on of necessary works. Details of that nature are too cumbersome to entrust to one man. It would not be possible to obtain the services of a man possessing the necessary qualifications to carry out the whole of those duties. the one hand, Parliament would be delegating far too much authority to one officer; and on the other hand, from the point of view of the man selected, it would be unfair to expect any one man to accept so great a responsibility. For that reason I favour the appointment of a Commission of more than one member, and shall vote to have three Commissioners. Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [6.16] This clause is the kernel of the Bill , and if it were cut out there would be no serious objection on the part of the Opposition to the remaining provisions. It is strang'e that the Government, certain members of which a little while ago professed to be very enamoured of the idea of economy, should now contemplate what we consider to be useless and unnecessary expenditure in the appointment of this Commission. on this side have always contended that the Home and Territories Department and the Works and Railways Department are quite capable of carrying on this work. Anything that might not be considered to come within the purview of those two Departments could be delegated to some other body without incurring very great expense. I think it is generally acknowledged that excellent work has been done by these Departments. The officers and Ministers have been eulogized, and every one has agreed that that eulogy has been well deserved. The only persons who propose to pass what amounts toa vote of censure upon the Departments, are the Ministers and the members of the Government. Those who, a little while ago, preached economy, are not now willing to practise it . It is said, of course, that this work has become so great that it cannot be continued by Ministers, or by the . Departments. I remind members of the Government, however, that during the last Parliament consideration was given to the appointment of a Public Service Board to deal not only with promotions, punishment, transfers, and matters of that description in the Public Service, but also to do a great deal of other work, such as devising better methods of calling for and accepting tenders, supervising various works, and undertaking other duties, the ramifioations of which extend not over a small area like Canberra, but over the whole of Australia. Quite a number of honourable On members opposite, some of whom today are Ministers of the Crown, contended in those days that one man should be quite competent to undertake the whole of that work. Now they say there must be three commissioners to carry out work of much less magnitude. When objection is taken to that they make what is called a compromise. They say, "" We must have one commissioner at £ 3 , 0 0 0 a. year, and two others to act in an advisory capacity, these two being entitled to draw fees up to £2,000 a year."" The position in which this compromise will place the people of Australia will be much worse than we should have had if the original intention had been adhered to. I cannot understand how those honourable members opposite, who previously would not agree to the appointment of three commissioners, can now say that in the public interest they will accept one com""We missioner and two advisory commissioners. The adoption of that proposal will run Australia into as great an expense as would the appointment of three Commissioners, who would be asked and expected to devote the whole of their time to the service of the Commonwealth. It appears to me that this new proposal is as extravagant as the original one, and that Australia will lose a good deal by it . Human nature, being what it is, it almost assuredly means that these persons who are to act advisory ' capacity will sit each year until they have drawn £2,000. position of those honourable members opposite who formerly would not agree to the appointment of three Commissioners, is a most remarkable one, and one which, I think, needs some explanation. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr H u r r y ) detailed the duties that are to be allotted to the Commission in order to show the onerous nature of the work that is to be entrusted to it . Reading this amazing Bill , it will be seen that a very great array of duties is to be performed by the Commissioners. Some people, reading the list of those duties, may say, ' ' You will need more than one ordinary human being to carry out these duties. If you cannot have three, you must have one extraordinary man assisted by two others acting in an advisory capacity."" But, after all, many of the duties that are enumerated could very well be performed for many years .by the officers who are now permanently employed in the Departments of the Commonwealth. There, again, I join issue with my friends opposite. Not so long ago we heard a good deal from them about the duplication of State and Federal Departments. I ask the Minister (Mr Stewart), seeing that we have a Health Department, why could he not find it convenient to take from that Department an officer or officers who would give advice relating to the protection of public health and the maintenance of sanitation at Canberra? necessary to appoint a Commission to see that that is done? Is not that duplication of work and of Departments ? The same argument applies to practically the whole of the other duties set out. The public will want to know why, when we have a Works Department, it is suddenly found necessary to form a new branch to carry out work which should be performed by the Works Department. No matter how earnestly we may desire to see Canberra the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth, we cannot disregard the fact that this proposal means unnecessary expenditure. I yield to no one in my desire to see the national Capital built at Canberra. I voted . for - the motion moved some little time ago by the honourable member, for Dalley (Mr Mahony). I did not consider it to be a motion binding upon the next Parliament, or upon in an the Governor General, to whom it was sent. Had I thought at the time that, The. in order to carry out the terms of the motion, it would be necessary to go to the extravagance of appointing this Commission, I certainly would have given long and serious consideration to the matter before casting a vote in its favour. Although, we wish the compact with New South Wales to be honoured, the rate at which work has been proceeding at Canberra is very satisfactory; and even though a delay of six, nine, or twelve months might be necessary for the sake of economy, I do not think a single person in New South Wales would grumble, much as the people of that State desire to see Canberra established.",45
138,Unknown,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. Mr F . MCDONALD - I now desire to direct attention to certain remarks made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald. I have no desire to do the honourable member an injustice, but as I was not in the House when he spoke I have to depend on the newspaper report of his speech. In the course of his remarks the honourable member declared that any waste that had occurred in adminstration at Canberra had been during the Labour regime. Of course, if he gives me his assurance that he was incorrectly reported, I shall have no more to say.",47
139,Mr FOSTEB,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,The report was quite Is it correct.,47
140,Mr MAKIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,But the honourable member cannot substantiate his statement.,47
141,Mr F,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"MCDONALD - As my friend the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) has remarked, the honourable member for Wakefield is not in a. position to substantiate his statement in regard to any waste. I know of no great scandals due to faults in administration at the Federal Capital. The great foundation work which was done there by a former Labour Government stands a monument to its credit. In any case, it ill becomes him as a member of a former' Government that was associated with so many grave scandals in administration to talk of waste of publio money at Canberra.",47
142,Mr MAKIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,The honourable member for Wakefield cannot point to one item of extravagance.,48
143,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Yes, I can. Read Hansard. Mr F. MCDONALD - If mitted to go' outside the scope of the debate on this Bill, I could point to perhaps a dozen grave scandals in administration on the part of the Government of which the honourable member for Wakefield was a member. His attitude, reproof of waste of public moneys, recalls to my mind Burns's satire on that most rigidly righteous man - one of the "" unco-guid ""-referred in Holy Willie's Prayer. I bless and praise Thy matchless might, When thousands Thou has left in night, That I am here before Thy sight For gear and grace : A burnin* and a shinin' light To a' this place ! Here we bave the honourable member for Wakefield a "" shinin' light "" and an example to "" a' this place."" I shall leave it at that. But the Sydney Morning Herald also reports the honourable member for Wakefield as having saidHe supported the appointment of a Commission, because it would ensure that the administration at Canberra would never come under the irresponsible control of the Labour party. If the honourable member for Wakefield gives me his assurance that he was not correctly reported, I need not pursue this matter further.",48
144,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,I referred particularly to the industrial side of the administration. Mr F . MCDONALD - Did the honourable member say that the industrial side of the administration shall not come under the control of Labour when in office ?,48
145,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,In this House. Mr F . MCDONALD - Did the honourable member mean that ?,48
146,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"I did, and I do. Mr F . MCDONALD - The honourable member's interjection is typical of his attitude. Of course, he is quite at liberty, as 'we are, to hold an opinion on all these matters. I do not know whether his attitude is endorsed by members of the Government or their supporters. I should like to know. T f I am right in the assumption that it is - I ask the question and they give no sign of dissent - the n ptrbaps we have the reason for the introduction of this Bill . It is strange, however, that a Government which has always preached economypretendad, in fact, to be enamoured of the principle-shoul d bring down a I were per- measure which will involve Australia in entirely unnecessary expenditure, ostensibly for the appointment of a Commission to expedite work at the Federal Capital, but really for some other purpose. It would seem, as - the honorhis able member for Wakefield has in dicated, that if there is any purinimitable pose in the Bill at all, it has not been frankly stated in this House. Accordine to to the honourable member, the purpose of the measure is to ensure that, in'indusLord, trial affairs at least, and perhaps in other matters too, when the Labour party comes into power it shall not have control. The honourable member for Wakefield has said so.",48
147,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"I did not. I was referring to the industrial side. If the honourable member wants to know, this was mentioned by an eminent Sydney King's counsel sitting as a Royal Commission. Mr F . MCDONALD - The honourable member for Wakefield now wants to confine his references to the industrial side of the Canberra administration. If he will say that on this point he was misreported, I shall let the matter drop.",48
148,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"I only repeated what I have said in this House a hundred times. Mr F . MCDONALD - Then all I can say is that in his attitude upon this question the honourable member is striki n g ' a blow at our system of parliamentary government. He has admitted that one of the reasons actuating him in supporting the Bill is that, when the Labour party conies into office it will not have power to deal with Canberra affairs. That is the principle; confined to, or not confined to, matters industrial.",48
149,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"The honourable member can put it in that way if he likes. I shall put it in my way. Mr F . MCDONALD - T am simply interpreting the honourable member's remarks and endeavouring to reach a logical conclusion. T repeat that his attitude strikes a blow at constitutional government in Australia. Parliamentary government, as we understand it , means that the will of the majority shall prevail, and that any party in power with a majority shall control legislation and administration. According to the honourable member for ""Wakefield, this Bill is designed to prevent the Labour party, when it gets into office, from having any authority at Canberra. The honourable member should know something about its purpose, because he is a supporter of the present Ministry. He attends the Caucus meetings of his party. He was a Minister in the last Government, and I have no doubt that, but for the intrusion of the Country party, the other wing ot the Coalition, he would be a Minister in the present Government. No doubt he was consulted in the preparation of the Bill . He understands our system of parliamentary government. There are, however, a number of people in Australia who do not believe that our system of parliamentary government can remedy the social and economic injustices under which they suffer. Tbey contend that this form of parliamentary government is determined by the economic system, and since the ""party to which the honourable member belongs have been in control of that system, they have been able to manipulate it to their own advantage, and will continue to do so. The attitude of the honourable member will confirm them in their belief. He is determined that when Labour returns to power it will not be able to effectively exercise control. On this question, the honourable member stands on exactly the same plane as those who talk about the dictatorship of the proletariat. He allies himself with those who have lost all faith in the parliamentary system of government. The Australian people, however, believe in our present parliamentary system of government, and do not wish it tampered with. They are loyal to the great cardinal principle that the wishes of the majority of the people must prevail in all cases, and to that principle the Labour party is loyal. Personally, I do not in tend to swerve one iota from it , and I know that the party to which I belong does not hold ideas contrary to those which I am now advocating. We have been accused, time after time, of disloyalty",48
150,The CHAIRMAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T," The honourable member is not discussing the question before the Chair. Mr F. MCDONALD - I am replying to the arguments of the honourable member for ""Wakefield (Mr Foster), and showing that we cannot vote for a Bill which, after all-if what the honourable member has stated is correct-implie s disloyalty, because it is subversive of the principles of representative government, in which we believe. I think I am entitled to do that. Loyalty to such principles is, after all, as necessary as loyalty to the K in g . If the honourable member is not going to be loyal to those great principles upon which the power and authority of His Majesty is founded, and he should know that that authority rests in the sovereign will of the people expressed through the Parliament, he is himself one of the greatest disloyalists in the Commonwealth.",49
151,The CHAIRMAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"I ask the honourable member how he intends to connect his remarks with the question before the Chair. Mr F . MCDONALD - I shall not be long in doing that. We have been taunted with disloyalty to the Sovereign, and I wish to show how the two forms of loyalty are related by again quoting Bobbie Burns, who saidWho will not sing God Save the King May hang as high's the steeple; But, while we sing God Save the King, We'll not forget the people. I trust the honourable member for Wakefield, when he next appears before the people, will not v i l if y the party to which I - belong, but will remember that these two forms of loyalty are closely entwined. He should remember that one cannot be loyal to the K in g and, at the same time, disloyal to the great principle upon which parliamentary practice is founded. The ""CHAIRMAN - Order !

152,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Hunter ) [8.40] The clause, as d r a f t e d , provides that the .Chairma n of the Commission shall receive £ 3 , 0 0 0 per a n n u m , and the other t w o members £ 2 , 0 0 0 per a n n u m each, but an amendment foreshadowed by the M in is ter will provide that the t w o Commissioners, w h o were to have received £ 2 , 0 0 0 per a n n u m , shall be p a i d prescribed fees, though they may each receive up to £2,000 in that way. I am not opposed to paying any man a fair remuneration for his services, but that £3,000 per annum gether too much to pay the Chairman of this Commission. One might think that very important, duties, requiring most careful attention, will have to be discharged by him, whereas the fact is that the Federal Capital must be built according to plans already agreed upon. The Chairman of the Commission will simply have to supervise the work, and, under the Bill , he will have two other Commissioners to assist him. I consider that £1,500 a year would be quite a sufficient salary. Why should we pay him £3,000 a year when the salary of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is a much less sum? I can see nothing whatever to justify us in paying the Chairman of the Commission such a high salary. The revenue he will have to handle will not exceed £30,000 a year, we are told. Honourable members of this Parliament, who have to do much more work than will fal l to the lot of the Chairman of this Commission, receive only £1,000 a year, and are supposed to be adequately paid for their Why then should the Chairman of this Commission receive three times that amount? The amendment which the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Stewart) has foreshadowed is to be introduced simply to appease honourable members on his own side of the Committee, and it will not reduce the expense of the Commission. I have no desire to delay the passing of the Bill , but I consider it to be necessary in the public interests to find out exactly which honourable members of this Committee are prepared to pay £3,000 to an individual who, probably, is pretty well known in some quarters, simply to provide him with a comfortable and lucrative position. The proposed salary is altogether out of proportion to the importance of the position.",50
153,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Will the member agree to £2,000 a year? Mr Charlton"" - Well , I will meet the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory), although I think that £1,500 a year is ample. It is a handsome salary for the work to be performed. I do not forget that the Chairman of the Commission will have to carry a certain amount of responsibility, but £2.000 a year will be quite an adequate, remuneration for the service that he will render to the country; it is more than I personally would offer.

154,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,Wimmera-Minister for Works and Railways) [8.42] - I must ask the Committee not to agree to this amendment. There seems to be a total misapprehension of the very important duties which will have to be discharged by the Chairman of this Commission. Clause 14 of the Bill sets out those duties in detail. The Chairman of the Commission will have control of millions of public money.,51
155,Mr MAKIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,Will his responsibility be greater than that of the Prime Minister?,51
156,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,Tlia t may be an argument in favour of increasing the salary of the Prime Minister; it is not an argument for decreasing the salary of the Chairman of the Commission.,51
157,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,Would the Minister for Works and Railways vote in favour of increasing the Prime Minister's salary?,51
158,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"That is not the matter under discussion at present. The obwork. ject of this Bill is to co-ordinate the activities at Canberra by placing them under the control of a Commission with the wide powers outlined in clause 14, We shall not be able to get a sufficiently capable man to discharge those duties unless we offer a salary commensurate with the re-, sponsibility. If there is one mistake we make more frequently than another in this country it is that of adopting a cheeseparing policy in regard to salaries offered for important positions. In nearly all the wide-awake countries of the world, including the United States of America, the tendency in modern business concerns is to secure big men for big positions, and to pay them well. In view of the responsibilities which the Chairman of this Commission will carry, the Government consider that £3,000 a year is only a fair remuneration. honourable",51
159,Mr A GREEN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Kalgoorlie) [8.44] I support the amendment by the Leader of the Opposition. I have always re-garded the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) as a careful administrator, and, judging by his attitude before he became a Minister of the Crown, I considered _ that he was opposed to in creasing the' expenditure of the country unnecessarily. I thought that he believed in economy. I am astounded, therefore, that he has introduced a measure of this description. I have recently visited Canberra, and in consequence of inquiries I made, I think that what the Minister proposes to do now is just what should not be done. ILR knows very well that the actual sewerage work at Canberra is costing only one-third of the total outlay, the other two-thirds being accounted for by heavy over&ead charges caused by the payment of high salaries to officers, and it is now proposed to increase the highly paid appointments. The cost of various works at Canberra has been enormously increased, not because of the way the men work, nor because of in efficient machinery, but because of the high salaries paid to officials. In Fremantle, a progressive city engineer is employed, and he supervises the whole of the work of that important municipality at a salary of £600 a year. I admit that for an officer having special qualifications - for instance, Sir John Monash, whose administrative capacity probably could not be equalled in Australia-it is necessary and desirable to pay a large salary; but the feeling throughout the Commonwealth is that while the States are in difficulties financially, the Common- Cliapman, Austin wealth is paying enormous sums of money to men who do very little for it . The Government, have a capable officer stationed at Canberra who could satisfactorily superintend the work there. Nevertheless, I say without hesitation that brick houses at Canberra that bave cost £1,200 each, should have been built for £ 8 0 0 , and houses for which 25s. per week rent has been charged are not worth more than 15s. per week. The wooden huts let at l is . a week are a disgrace to the Commonwealth.",51

161,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Hunter ) [8.59] The clause provides that, in addition to the Chairman of the Commission, there shall be two members, each of whom shall receive remuneration at a rate not exceeding £2,000 per annum. When the Bill was before us on a former occasion, many honourable members expressed dissatisfaction with the proposal to appoint a Board of three Commissioners, and the Government, in order to meet their wishes, framed an amendment which the Minister intends to submit. It is now proposed that the members of the Commission other than the Chairman shall give only part of their time to the work, but may still receive £2,000 each per annum.' The Minister is to prescribe their fees, which may be £ 1 0 or £ 1 5 per day, but there is nothing to prevent them from absorbing the amount of £2,000 each, although they may not be employed for more than three or six months in the year. I point out to honourable members that the amendment suggested by the Minister in this clause will not necessarily reduce the expenditure which may take place under it . As a matter of fact, the Bill as first presented was far better than it will be if amended as now proposed by theM in ister. I cannot, for the life of me, see how honourable members who were opposed to a Commission can accept a proposal of this kind, under which the Minister, or, in reality, the Chairman of the Commission, may employ the two additional members of the Commission for just as long as he feels inclined, at an allowance per sitting which may give them each £2,000 per annum.",53
162,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,That is the proposed for their full time.,53
163,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"The member should be under no misapprehension with respect to this clause as proposed to be amended by the Government. It will not provide for the Commissioners Other than the Chairman giving their full time to the work of the Commission. Under the clause, as proposed to be amended, two of the Commissioners may receive £2,000 each per annum, although they may not be employed on the work of the Commission for more than three or six months in the year. understand the Minister saying that, as honourable members are not favourable to the appointment of three permanent Commissioners, and it is necessary to curtail expenditure as much as possible, he would. propose that £3,000 should be divided between the two part-time Commissioners. His present proposal is that each of these Commissioners may receive in prescribed fees up to £2,000 per annum. This is really a subterfuge to enable .honourable members opposite ito justify their support of the measure on the ground that something was done to meet their objections. If honourable members can justify the payment of £7,000 per annum to these Commissioners for the administration of the Federal Capital Territory, we should not have much difficulty in justifying a considerable increase in our own salaries. I think we receive fair remuneration, but each of us does far more work than any of these Commissioners will be called on to do.",53
164,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,And they have not to face an election.,53
165,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"They have not to face an election, and the expense it in volves, but they may receive under the clause, as proposed to be amended by the Minister, as much as £2,000 for three months' work in the year. I intend to test the feeling of the Committee on this matter, and I therefore move That the words "" of each "" he left out. The result of the amendment, if carried, will be to make provision for an expenditure of £2,000 per annum, to be divided between the two Commissioners called upon to give only part of their time to the work of the Commission.",53
166,Mr LISTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Corio) [9.7]:-On the second reading of this Bill , I expressed amount myself in very plain terms with regard to it . I intimated that if the House dehonorable cided upon the appointment of a Commission, it would not be possible to find one man who could successfully carry out the whole of the work. I am in accord with the amendment which has just been moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). I believe that greater efficiency, and, after all , that is what we desire to obtain, might be secured through an advisory committee, but we should determine here the fees to be paid to the members of that comI could mittee. The Leader of the Opposition, in his amendment, has been more generous than I , personally, am prepared to be. In view of the condition of things in the Federal Capital Territory, the work to be done there,'and the fact thab one Commissioner is to be constantly employed, all that is required is an Advisory Committee, the members of which should be prepared to devote, say, one day per week to the duties of the Commission at a fee of, say, £ 1 0 per day. Under such a proposal, I think we could obtain the services of a much better type of men than we could secure by paying full-time men on a job of this kind £2,00 0 each a year. There are patriotic men in the community who are ready to render, service to Australia. They are men of very high standing in their professions, and I am sure such - men, for a comparatively small remuneration, would be prepared to give a reasonable amount of their time to carry the work at the Federal Capital to a successful issue. We are not desirous of wrecking the Bill . We have met the Minister in connection with the appointment of a Commission, and I hope that he will now see the wisdom of accepting the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition.",53
167,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Wakefield) [ 9 . 1 1 ] - I have expressed myself very strongly on this measure. In my opinion it would be well for the Government to try to meet the views of the Leader of the Opposition to some extent. Personally, as I have mentioned before, I think it would be much better if the clause were made to read "" the remuneration of each of the other members shall be by fees as prescribed.""",54
168,Sir LITTLETON GHOOM,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,Without limit ?,54
169,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Yes , I do not like a limit. I feel confident that fees sufficiently generous to secure the services of the very best men in the community might be provided for the two subordinate - Commissioners, and we should even then require to pay not more than £50 0 a year to each of them. This measure has created a lot of mistrust outside. object to the payment of £3,00 0 to the Chief Commissioner and £2,00 0 each to the subordinate Commissioners. The Government have now proposed that the subordinate Commissioners shall be paid by fees, but they propose that the amount of £2,00 0 should remain as the maximum amount payable per annum to each of them. That will not remove the distrust outside, and the objection to the clause. I have pledged myself in a good many places to vote against a payment of £2,000 each to the subordinate Commissioners.",54
170,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Darlin g Downs - Attorney-General) [9.14] - I ask honourable members to consider the very important nature of the work which the Commission will have to do. The Government are as desirous as honourable members generally to economize. Honourable members opposite have voted for every proposal calculated to lower the value of the Commission with the object of securing its inefficiency. They frankly admit that those are the lines upon which they are proceeding. But other honourable members have accepted the Commission, and are honestly striving now to secure the best Commission they can. It is idle to point to what is done by municipal councillors, and to tell us that a shire engineer can be secured for £600 a year. Quite apart from the justice of paying professional men an adequate fee, I would point out that the problems of Canberra are not merely those of a shire engineer. Tbey involve the administration of the whole of the Federal Territory, including the administration of land, the initiation of a system of leasing such as is not in existence in any corresponding city of the Commonwealth, the gradual introduction of private enterprise, the construction and supervision of all public buildings necessary, not only for today, but for the any future, and the responsibility of municipal government. If , as the Statistician says, in six years after its establishment the population in the Federal .Territory will be 12,000, the problems of municipal government will 1 need to be solved by a man of conspicuous ability, and with a wide knowledge. In the early stages, the Commissioner will require the assistance of exPeople perts to advise him respecting arclutectural, engineering, and financial problems, not the least being the raising of money and the provision for repayment. We have to decide whether we shall have one all-time man, with the right to call in two expert men to assist him. In one year their services may be needed almost constantly; in another year few sittings may be necessary.",54
171,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Will it rest with, the Chairman as to when the other two members shall be called upon ? Sir LITTLET ON GEOOM - To a great extent it will rest upon regulations, but the Chairman must have the right to fix the time to confer with the others. In one year, when considering fundamental problems, the Commission may be constantly sitting, and if £1,000 is fixed as the limit of remuneration, we shall be unable to obtain the services of the best men offering. We might possibly save £1,000 in one year, but we might lose £100,000 by adopting a cheese-paring policy that would prevent us from obtaining suitable men. The Capital city has been commenced, and we desire, with the assistance of independent advice to carry on the work efliciently. The best advice cannot be obtained unless it is paid for adequately, and the Government will, at the proper time, consider the amount of the fees to be paid. I have no objection, providing the Committee is unanimous, to the suggestion made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster) to fix no limitation. Such an amendment would not necessarily lead to unlimited expenditure but. would allow a certain, amount of elasticity. In one year £1,000 might be paid, in the next, £1,500, and so on. Although the Bill provides a limit of £2,000, I ask honourable members not to unduly limit the amount. It does not follow that £2,000 will be paid to 'each man every year - adviser,",55
172,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,It usually does follow. Sir LITTLET ON GEOOM - Not necessarily.,55
173,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"A limit of £2,000 will scare the people. Sir LITTLET ON GEOOM - If the people knew what was involved there would be no scare.",55
174,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"I explain that to the people who complain to me. Sir LITTLET ON GEOOM - It has happened that when a business expert has been appointed to inquire into Government Departments, - instead of a recommendation for lower payment for competent men, the principle of adequate payment for competent .men has been adopted. I do nob believe that the limit of £2,000 will be reached; in fact, it may reach only £1,500. I ask honourable members not to fix a limit so low as to prevent the Government from obtaining the services of the best men offering.",55
175,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,We are prepared to trust the Government.,55
176,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"We are all anxious to obtain the best men for the - position, and we differ only in the method of accomplishing this object. I ask honourable members not to impose the limitation suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, as it would deter us from obtaining the best results.",55
177,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Yarra) [9.20] - The Attorney-General seems to spring into the breach whenever a difficulty arises. The amendment' by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has torn the veil aside from the scheme that emanated in the' Government Caucus room. The cracking of the whip has already met with success, but we shall now see how it acts. The number of Government supporters opposed to the appointment of three Commissioners was undoubtedly sufficient to have' defeated the Government on that question. What happened ? The Minis; ter (Mr Stewart) camouflaged the situation by agreeing to the appointment of a chairman who,, he said, would occasionally call in advisers .to assist him. In this way, we were told, a large expenditure would be obviated. When, however, the Leader of the Opposition moves an amendment that the fees, which .are not now prescribed, shall be limited to £1,000 per annum for each we hear the thunders rolling from the Government side. That, the Government say, is a very different proposition. I invite honourable members to remember the Government's attitude last week, when they effected a compromise. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) said it was obviously a compromise. The Government, instead of sanctioning an expenditure of £7,000 a year for three Commissioners, climbed down, and decided to appoint one Commissioner at a fixed salary, and two othet gentlemen, who would occasionally give their assistance, and receive a fee for their limited service. If the Government are sincere, why do they fight against the amendment? Why do they require the right to pay to each of these two advisers fees up to £2,000 per year for part time ? Why did they not stick to their original proposition ? I invite honourable members opposite, who were opposed to the payment of £7,000, and wno excused their vote on clause 6 because they were voting for one Commissioner only, to reconsider their position, and see where they stand with their constituencies and the country generally. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) said that the services of these men would be required only two or three times a year.",55
178,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,I did not say that. said that they would be required for a week possibly.,56
179,Mr SCTJLLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,The honourable member was emphatic that under the Government's proposal the expenditure would be small.,56
180,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,I did not say anything of the kind.,56
181,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"The honourable member said that the other members would occasionally be called in to assist the Chairman. Thus were allayed the fears of honourable members opposite who opposed the proposed expenditure as a waste of money. The Ministry were progressing marvellously when the Leader of the Opposition moved his amendment providing that the fees-whic h are not prescribed, and can be fixed at anything from £ 2 2s. to 20 guineas per sittingshall not exceed in the aggregate £1,000 per annum each. The Governand ment propose that the total amount of fees shall be fixed by the Commissioner. The fees, not being prescribed, can be paid right up to £2,000 per annum for each member. The Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) is prepared to accept the suggestion made by the honourable member for Wakefield.",56
182,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,-Tb e fees too vague to be prescribed,56
183,Mr SCTJLLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"We will learn of fees after the Bill has been passed. If scribed by regulations. they are to be prescribed, now is the to prescribe them. Is this ment not to be consulted on anywill thing? Is the day never coming when the control of the affairs of this country will be restored to Parobtain liament? The Attorney-General has said that the Minister in control of the B is prepared to accept the suggestion made by the honourable member for Wakefield.",56
184,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,That is so.,56
185,Mr SCTJLLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"It is worse than ever. The Chairman is to receive £3,000 per annum, and the other two members prescribed fees, on which no l i m it will be placed. In the Bill is provided a l i m it of £2,000. a year each, but now no limit is to be fixed at all . The Attorney General says that the Chairman will fix the amount of the fees.",56
186,Sir LITTLETONGROOM,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,I did not.,56
187,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,Is not the Chairman to fix the number of sittings? I Sir LITTLETONGROOM - T b at is a d if ferent matter.,56
188,Mr SCTJLLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"It is no use quibbling I repeat that the amount in fees to be drawn will rest with the Chairman, as the two outside members will be paid according to the number of sittings convened by him. Neither this Government nor any other will have control. We were previously asked tofixthe l i m it at £2,000 per annum for each person, but now the Chairman will receive £3,000 per year, and the others may receive the same amount, or perhaps more. The Leader of the Opposition has put forward a reasonable proposition. The Government were able to pass clause 6 on the pretence that the fees would not reach the amount set down for salaries. As soon as a suggestion is made to l i m it the fees to £1,000 per annum a storm arises, the whips are again cracked. If those honourable members opposite, who preach economy, wish to save their faces in this discussion, they will vote with the Opposition.",56
189,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Lang) [9.29] - I agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Foster) that the fees for the two outside are members of the Commission should not be limited to any fixed amount as was the originally proposed, but should be preB y these means, time the fees will be under the control Parliaof Parliament, because the regulations have to be approved by this House. They could be disallowed by this House. The idea underlying this proposal is io the most expert advice available. The men who would be called in to assist ill the Chief Commissioner would be of the type who would not be attracted by the fees, but who would be prepared to give their services gratis if they felt, that their assistance would benefit the country. There is no fear that their fees would amount to any considerable sum, and the Committee need not greatly concern itself on that score. Their services would only be required occasionally. The Committee would be' well advised to accept the sugthe gestion of the honourable member for able Wakefield.",56
190,Mr YATES,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Adelaide) [ 9 . 3 2 ] was rather surprised to hear the suggeshere. tion of the honourable member for Wakehours field (Mr Foster) that it was better not to fix the amount of the fees, as in that way we would allay discontent in the community. only throwing d i r t in the eyes of electors of Australia. I hold here extract from the Adelaide Register which I quoted this afternoon - That paper criticized the Government for proposing to give this work to a Commission. Now one of the supporters of the policy of that seen that statement? paper suggests that, in order to allay discontent which would be caused if the amount were known, we should not fix the amount of the fees. What sort of business undertaking is that? Would honourable member for Wakefield do that with his own business ? He should ashamed of his suggestion. But probably it is a case of "" a n old dog for a hard road."" In the original Bill the Governtions ment placed an estimate on value of the work to be performed by the Commissioners, but, because their liberality was attacked, a hybrid propositry. tion, is now suggested. If the duties the proposed Commissioners should not be difficult to fix. their remuneration. If it was a. case of a man driving a machine into the rock face provide the city with sewers, the Governnot ment would know what he should be of the Opposition. paid, and,, if he did not shift sufficient rock, the honourable member for Wakefield would have no hesitation in saying that gested he was "" going slow"" and "" loafing the job."" When, on one occasion, there was a reference to -"" going slow,"" honourable member said, ""That not the right term to use; it is loafing."" That is a term the honourable member would use when referring to sary. these men who delve into the bowels the earth and risk life and limb in order to make a city beautiful for us. when it comes to some one who would supposed to manage those workers, but who, in reality, would attend at his office at 10 o'clock and ask the chief "" How are things going?"" and add, "" If I am wanted, 1 will be at such-and-such a place,"" the honourable member is prepared to pay that gentleman ten guineas per diem. I hope that, notwithstanding "" whipping "" that has gone on, honormembers will vote in accordance wioh the dictates of their conscience, and in the - I interests of the people who sent them. If we are able to regulate the of labour and the wages of men who do the work, we should be able to fix the remuneration of their managers. We should not delegate our powers to some one else. The Register says the That is proposal means the creation of a billet the for some one. Have the honourable memthe ber for Wakefield (Mr Foster), the honourable member for Boothby (Mr .

If the Minister accepts the posal of the Leader of the Opposition, Commissioners will each be able to draw £83 per month. Even if three Commissioners were appointed, it would not necessary for them to meet more than twice a month, as the officers of the partment would continue to do the work. There is no justification for this measure, as the Advisory Committee now operating has done good work.

The Government's proposal is enough to make every member of this DeHouse dissatisfied with his remuneration. Members of the Commission, which will sit not more than ten or twelve times a year, will draw £2,000 each. Members a of Parliament have their constituents worrying them, and they have to attend to a large amount of correspondence, and do their best to make this country a place to be proud of. What will the the electors say if they learn that we have passed a Bill without knowing what it Why cannot we know what memi t will cost? Why did the Government If that was too high, why could not a lower be fixed? The Government is borrowing £17,000,000 this year, and will . He use £3,500,000 out of it to pay interest. Is there a public company that would do The last thing a commercial man as or a banker would do would be to pay Notwithmemstanding this, objections are raised to fixing the salary of a Government serEven if we do not succeed in exsecuring the desired amendment, I hope we shall at least make such a demonstrafcion that the Government. will consider very seriously before framing . a similar Bill in future. In the interests of Australia and Australians, the life of this Government ought to be very short. I could go further in illustrating its stupidity- I am perhaps not allowed to use the word "" robbery,"" but if any one in a public company or corporation did what honourable members opposite are proposing to do, they would be brought before a Judge and placed where they would not be seen for at least twelve months. To "" play ducks and drakes "" with the people's money is a very serious offence. The representatives of those States which cannot meet their obligations will be coming to this Parliament for financial assistance. The people of New South Wales, a State which is not in the same impecunious position, will be asked to assist the necessitous States. The representatives of those States ought now to assist us in preventing theproposed misuse of public money. Commission will do nothing without the advice ' of the departmental officers who are now at Canberra. I do not know any similar instance in which ornamental men have been foisted on the public. They wil l not be able to alter a line or a comma in the reports of the professional men who will advise them. Any body of men outside, if it had the opportunity, would smite the Government hip and thigh for its action. It would be difficult to find three men in the community who would .agree to the proposal. The only appointment that need have been made was that of a Director of Works in the Territory at a salary of £2,000 per annum. We all are aware of the character of the Director-General of Works, the worry and trouble he has experienced over the establishment of the Federal Capital, and the extent to which he has brought his. abilities to bear upon the works that have been carried out there. Now he is to be supplanted by a Commission of three men, but he will still be their mentor and guide, for without him they will be able to do nothing. For this proposal of the Government there is some ulterior motive. I appeal to the Committee to follow the advice of the I leader of the Opposition so that money may be expended in the Federal Territory wisely, and the extravagance of creating an ornamental body, the probable personnel of which has not yet been disclosed, avoided. Mr B . GEEEN (Eichmond) [10.5] The purpose of the various amendments that have been submitted by honourable members opposite is to k ill the Bill , but the Committee has decided that a Commission shall be established, and the Minister has agreed to appoint only one full-time Commissioner, and two other consulting Commissioners to be paid per sitting a fee to be prescribed. That wording is altogether too vague. The Minister gave the Committee no indication of what the probable expenditure in fees will be. I suppose he can hardly estimate the number of sittings of the full Commission, and no doubt the fee per sitting will depend upon the calibre and patriotism of those men who are chosen to act as consultants. I cannot support the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Wakefield which the Minister is prepared to accept. I ask him to either adhere to the l i m it of The £2,000 per annum for each of the two subordinate Commissioners, or to accept the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition. Some maximum must be stipulated, otherwise Parliament will have no control over the amount to be paid in fees. If the fee were fixed at, say, £10 per d a y - I am not suggesting this amount, but am using it as an illustration-and the Commission met twice weekly, each of the subordinate Commissioners would receive about £1,000 per annum, but if the Commission met every day-whic h would mean full timeeach would receive about £3,000 per annum. That is the amount the Chairman is to receive. A fee of £10 per sitting for a man of high professional capacity is not at all exorbitant if the Commonwealth is to receive the full benefit of his knowledge and experience, but I appeal to the Minister to propose some limitation of the amount to be paid per annum to the part-time Commissioners.",58
201,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Hunter ) [10.10]. - Before a vote is taken, the Committee should thoroughly understand the position. The clause limits the amount payable to each junior Commissioner to £2,000 per annum. My amendment proposes to strike out the words "" of each,"" and thus fix the amount payable to the junior Commissioners at £2,000 for the two of them. The Minister admits that, during some years, the work may be heavier than in others, and that the Chairman of the Commission will decide at how many sittings he may require the attendance of the other two Commissioners. He may call upon, them to sit frequently and regularly during any one year. If no limit is placed upon the amount - each Commissioner aud if the fee for each sitting is left to be prescribed, as suggested by the honor each Commissioner may draw, as the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) has just pointed out, as much as £3,000. ' There will be nothing definite as to the amount payable to the two part-time Commissioners. ment will bo practically giving to the Chairman of the Commission and to the Government a signed blank cheque on which to fill in the amount to be paid. The position will be worse than it is at present. Instead of stipulating amount payable to the second and third Commissioners shall liot exceed £2,000 per annum, the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Wakefield provides that these Commissioners be paid fees as prescribed. these fees be ? How much will it cost the country? How often will these Commissioners be asked to sit? whole thing will be in the clouds. we pass such a proposal? Honourable members who consider that a total of £2,000 per annum is sufficient for the two junior members of the Commission to draw, seeing that they will only sit for half the year, should support my amendment. they cannot do so, they cannot salve their consciences by following the who proposes to accept the foreshadowed by the honourable for Wakefield, because the position will then be worse than it is at present. will be far better to allow the payment to remain at £2,000 for each Commissioner than to accept a proposal that the fees to be paid shall be such as are prescribed, thus leaving it to some one outside Parliament to decide how much money is to be paid in connection with this Commission. The honourable member for Richmond is absolutely wrong in saying that all the amendments submitted have been intended to kill the Bill. I made my position clear on the second reading. said that I did not want a question of such national importance as the building of the Capital to be made a party question. I ask the Committee now to Mr Charlton. do what is right. I absolve all honourable members from making this a panv question, and call upon them to express their conscientious opinions as to the amount that should be paid to these Commissioners. If they consider that £2,000 may draw, each per annum is too much to pay, let them support my amendment, and thus limi t the amount payable to £1,000 a year for each Commissioner. But they should vote for a salary of £2,000 for each Commissioner rather than accept the proposal of the honourable member for Wakefield, which would certainly place every honourable member who does Parlia- not approve of the clause, as drafted, in a wrong position. Now that the Government Whips have sounded honourable members, I do not wonder at the Minister, accepting the proposal of the honourable member for Wakefield. It will give that the the Government more power than the y would have uuder the clause as it stands. Some honourable members may imagine that every time shall a compromise is arrived at they are What will warranted in accepting it . That is thenown concern. My concern is to do junior my duty, and it is my duty to The indicate the position as I see it . Can No one can controvert my argument, and therefore I ask the Committee to vote for my amendment, and in any case not to accept that which has been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Wakefield. If Mr STEWART (Wimmer'a-Minister for Works and Railways) [10.15] - The Minister, general tenor of remarks, particularly amendment from the Opposition side of the Chamber, member is that the Government are desperately anxious to pay away in fees as It much public money as they can. The whole matter has been approached from an altogether false angle. An y fees payable to the part-time Commissioners will be the responsibility of the Government of the day, who, i ti their turn, will be responsible to Parliament for the administration of the financial affairs of the country. Honourable members can rest assured that the present Government will pay to the part-time Commissioners whatever remuneration I they are justly entitled to receive, according to the work they do, and the responsibilities imposed upon them by the Bill . If , on the other hand, by the fortune of political war, the Government are removed from their present position, surely honourable members opposite who are now lecturing Ministers upon their responsibilities, can be trusted when they are in power not to fling away public money indiscriminately, and pay those 20 guineas or 30 guineas fees making up the f a n c if u l £10,000 a year referred to by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin).",59
202,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"I said that the Chairman of the Commission could pay his fellow-Commissioners £10,000 a year in fees and no one could prevent him from doing so.",61
203,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"The Government have not the slightest intention of paying the part-rtime Commissioners £10,000 n year, or anything like that amount. appeal to honourable members to accept my assurance that the Government will act fair l y by the taxpayers, and pay only such fair remuneration as the part-time Commissioners will be entitled to expect. I ask them to negative the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, and vote for the amendment which the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) intends to move.",61

207,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,The honourable memmember ber does not expect the full-time Commisber sioner's remuneration and conditions be the same as those of the part-time Commissioners.,61
208,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"No , but I think thing should be stipulated in the Bill .",61
209,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Denison) [10.19] have had Very little to say on this measure. I spoke very briefly on the second reading, and so far I have not contributed anythe thing to the debate in Committee, but am not disposed to allow a vote to be taken without uttering some protest against proposal which the Minister has now to the Committee in indicating an ment which he says he is willin g to (Mr. accept. The opposition of honourable members on this side has been not to Canberra, but to the unnecessary expenditure of £7,000 a year on this Commission. That opposition proved effective to some extent, because a number of members on the Government side also began to feel uneasy. They evidently believed that the people of Australia would not countenance the proposal of the Government, and they told the Minister (Mr . Stewart) that they would expect him to meet them when the Committee stage of the Bill was reached. The Minister then came down with what purported to be a compromise to meet the objections raised by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), and the 'honourable 1 member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). The impression which the Minister in tended to convey to the House and the country was that the cost of this Commission would not amount to £7,000 a year, as was originally proposed in the measure, but that he would agree to the appointment of one full-time Commissioner and two part-time Commissioners. He, however, still lef t in the Bill the provision that each of those two Commissioners should be entitled to draw in fees a maximum of £2,000 per annum. He would not l l the have been giving away very much, nor would he have lost any Ministerial dignity, he accepted the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that the maximum fees to be drawn by those twu Commissioners should not exceed £1,000 year each. If he believes that the cost of this Commission will not exceed £7,000 l l a year, he must accept that amendment. Otherwise, what becomes of his protestations, which prevailed with the honourable for Fawkner, the honourable memfor Swan, and several other Ministo terial supporters and induced them to vote in a way different from that in which they intended to vote ? Those honourable members clearly gave the everyHouse to understand on the second reading that they were opposed to I the Commission on the score of the expense that would be incurred, and that they must have some compromise. Under proposal now put forward, the counI try will be very much worse off than it would have been had the Bill passed in the its original form. Under the amendment put put into the mouth of the Minister by amend the honourable member for Wakefield Foster) there is absolutely no l i m it to the cost of this Commission. We want the country to know that. If we deal with the people's money in this loose manner, if we do not make some estimate of the cost of this Commission, the people will be quite justified in telling us that we are not fit to hold our positions. The Minister ought to be able to give us some idea of the duties that these part-time Commissioners will be required to carry out, and the approximate time that they will be occupied.",61
210,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"If the honourable member could arrive at some estimate of the number of people likely to go to Canberra, and of the wealth of the city in future years, I possibly would be in a position to supply him with the information he desires. Lacking that estimate, no one can give him the details he seeks.",62
211,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,That furnishes a stronger reason for the acceptance by the Minister of the reasonable amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition.,62
212,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"£1,00 0 may be much in some years, and too little in others.",62
213,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"The Bill, in its original form, was very loosely drawn.",62
214,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,It was very carefully drawn.,62
215,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"The Minister brings down a proposal that the cost shall be £7,000 a year. He then accepts an amendment by the honourable member for* Wakefield, which means that the cost may exceed £7,000 a year. It is as well that the country should know that. The position is made so vague that the people of Australia are entitled to tell us that we do' not know what we are doing. Honourable members on this side must be absolved from any share of the blame if the Committee accepts the proposal of the Minister ",62
216,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Fawkner) [10.29] The honourable member for Denison (Mr. O'Keefe) was slightly in error when he said that I took up a certain attitude during the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I did not speak to that motion, nor did I indicate in any way my attitude towards the general principles of the Bill. I spoke shortly on clause 6, ancl pointed out that the amendment that the Minister was prepared to accept was obviously a compromise to meet the views of those who believed that £7,000 a year was too much to spend on this Commission.. The suggested amendment to this clause does not give the faintest indication of the probable amount. At present, we do not know how much of the assistant Commissioners' time will be required to discharge the duties to be entrusted to them. Neither have we any knowledge of the character of the work to be done. My difficulty arises out of the answer given by the Minister (Mr Stewart) to a question which I put to him concerning the appointment of the two assistant Commissioners for four years and three years respectively. I asked if the prescribed fees to be paid per sitting would be payable throughout the whole term of their engagement, and the Minister replied that the fees, as originally fixed, would not necessarily be the fees to be paid throughout the full term of their engagement. If this be so, then Parliamentwill have some control.",62
217,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,We will have no; contoo trol at all. The Chairman of the Commission will control the situation.,62
218,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Unles s the fees are fixed for the whole term, Parliament will have control as to the amount to be paid. 1 If the fees prescribed will not necessarily be paid throughout the whole term of engagement, we may express the view that the fees being paid are too high and order a modification of the arrangement. With regard to the number of sittings, we are in an extraordinary position. The Commission as a whole will be saddled with the responsibility for the proper development of the Federal Capital, and yet, according to the Minister, the Chairman will determine when the Commission will sit.",62
219,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,And in that matter he will be guided largely by the work to be performed.,62
220,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,But the Chairman will really be responsible for the number of sittings.,62

222,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"He might do that,, but if the fees to be paid are not fixed for the whole term of their appointment, Parliament will have control. We shall' have the right toi step in and say that for the character of the work being performed the amouSnt being paid is too high, and must be reduced.",62
223,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,What will we know in this House about the character of the work to be done at Canberra?,63

236,Mr MAKIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Hindmarsh) [10.50] - I am astounded at the audacity of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) in moving such an amendment. It goes beyond the bounds of all political decency. This honourable gentleman prides himself on being the high priest of efficiency and economy, but a little knowledge of his history in South Australia gives one very good reasons to doubt his sincerity. Nobody knows the financial obligations in volved in the proposition he has put before the Committee. Even the honourable member does not know or understand the extent to which this Commonwealth would be financially involved. It passes my comprehension how he could move such an amendment. It is quite evident that he is not prepared to face the criticism which his action will justly cause, for he leaves the Chamber without giving a single reason why we should agree to his proposal. The effect of his proposition will be to enable the friends of this Government, who doubtless will be the members of the Commission, to extract excessive fees from the Treasury. When I realise that the political text-book which the honourable member reads every day of the week, and, the Saturday issue, three times on Sundays- I refer to the Adelaide Register-severel y condemns the attitude which he has adopted, I am more than ever astonished at his audacity. To put it in the vernacular, it is "" the dizzy l i m it . "" Register newspaper does not generally subscribe to the views held by members on this side of the Committee, but it strongly supports the Labour party view on this question.",64
237,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T," I can see nothing in the clause about the Register newspaper. PAIRS. Mr MAKIN - That newspaper has given expression to views on this subject which are in accord with the views that I hold. It states that the Government proposition isan extension of the pernicious system of 'handing over the business of government to Commissions which are only remotely responsible to Parliament, which involve the creation of additional billets, and which, being largely independent of the Minister, may be used by him as a means of evading responsibility for extravagance and inefficiency. The honourable member for Wakefield this afternoon charged previous Labour Governments with extravagance, although when challenged by me he was unable to give one single instance, and at various times he has charged the workers of Australia with inefficiency and with going slow on the job. In view of those facts, he merits the strongest condemnation for moving this amendment. Honourable members who know the record of the honourable member for Wakefield do not find it difficult to understand why he is known in South Australia as "" W o b b l y Foster."" I do not use that term in an offensive sense, but it is characteristic of the honourable member. He and other honourable members who represent South Australia, and hold views similar to those expressed by him, will find it very difficult to reconcile their vote and the view held by the official organ of their parties. If the South Australian representatives supporting this composite Government f o l low the ignoble example of the honourable member for Wakefield and vote for this proposition, they will deserve to suffer the consequences. The Leader of the Opposition has given . an assurance that this is not a party question, but one upon which every honourable member is free to give rein to his own convictions. It cannot be contended that the fate of the Government is in volved. On that account I trust that The honourable members opposite will not agree to this outrageous proposal. It might truly be called a scandal if this responsible institution authorizes a body, the personnel of which is yet unknown, to' determine the fees' it shall be paid and the frequency of its sittings, and no l i m it whatever is placed upon the ultimate liability of the Commonwealth to finance the personnel of this Commission. In the future, whenever I the honourable member for Wakefield speak upon what he calls the extravagance of previous Governments and the methods adopted by the workers of Australia to attain their ends, I shall remember the insincerity and hypocrisy which he has displayed in connection with this Bill .",64
238,Mr YATES,SEAT OP GOVERNMEN T,"Adelaide) [10.59] - I am. sorry that I have to rise again to speak on this clause. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) moved his amendment without giving a single reason for it , and immediately left the chamber. No doubt, he recollected the old adageHe that fights and runs away May turn and fight another day. His attitude also reminds me of the remark of Lady Macbeth: "" Give me the daggers."" The Minister was timorous of the task set him, and the honourable member for Wakefield jumped in and saved the skin of the Minister by performing the deed himself. I suppose the honourable member has gone away to hide his head in shame. I dare say that he proposed this amendment on the spur of the moment as the idea flitted across his mind. I would not say that he was inspired, for inspiration connotes something good and fine. One of his evil spirits has doubtless prompted hi m in this matter. The Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) knows that this amendment will suit him better than that suggested by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart), because it gives unlimited latitude for expenditure on fees. Rather than allay the public unrest, will foment further dissatisfaction over the growth of Boards and Commissions. The wretched story of Commissions that have been brought into existence by the party opposite is fresh in our minds. The Minister for Works and Railways has had to clean up the work of the War Service Homes Commission. Government supporters know well enough that if they were spending their own cash, instead of toying with the money of the people, they would not leave the door open for unlimited expenditure as the honourable member for Wakefield does. Now that he has returned to the chamber, let him tell us. why he has submitted the amendment, and how it is to lead to the hear efficiency and economy of which he prates. What is injurin g the Commonwealth is not the Arbitration Court, as the honourable member would have us believe, but legislation such as he now proposes. The mess brought about by this Government will not be satisfactorily cleared up u n t i l a Labour Administration is returned to power. I hope that the journal in Adelaide that controls the actions of the honourable member for Wakefield will publish another leader concerning his "" economy."" The honourable member must have had a remarkable brain-wave when he conceived the language of the amendment providing that the Commissioners shall be remunerated "" by way of fees as prescribed."" The electors will require a fairly strong prescription to cure the evil that the honourable member, aided by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Works and Railways, is ready to in flict on the Commonwealth. There is no justification for the proposal. It cannot be shown that existing Commissions are giving value for the money expended on them. The fees of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee amount to £7,129 per annum. The Tariff Board has not been doing its job properly, for it has been urged that it has crippled Western Australia, and is killing the Commonwealth by reason of the duties it has imposed. For the mess into which it has brought the country the Government has had to pay it , up to date, £10,048. The Repatriation Commission for one year costs £5,058, aud the Shipping Board in volves an expenditure of £8,780, making a total of over £20,000 per annum for the Commissions in existence. It will remain for a Labour Government to remedy the it trouble that will be created by the appointment of a Commission to control the Federal Capital Territory. Honourable members opposite who repudiate the suggestion that they are under party domination now have a golden opportunity to do something in the best interests of the Commonwealth.
