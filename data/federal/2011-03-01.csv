5,The SPEAKER,NEW ZEALAND EARTHQUAKE,"I remind the House that the address-in-reply will be presented to Her Excellency the Governor General at Government House at 5.30 pm tomorrow. Tomorrow's sitting will be adjourned at approximately 5 pm. I should be glad if the members for Robertson and Lyons, together with other honourable members, would accompany me to present the address. NA Carbon Pricing",17
6,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to a visit I made today to Arthur and Rita Clark at their fruit and vegetable shop in Queanbeyan, whose $6,000 a month power bill will increase by $1,500, and that is just for starters, under the government's carbon tax. Why won't the Prime Minister be honest with the Australian people about the impact of her carbon tax on the cost of food?",17
7,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, even in the words of his question he is continuing his campaign of misleading and generating fear amongst the Australian community. If the Leader of the Opposition today hung out at a fruit and vegetable shop and said to the owners of that shop the words he said to the parliament today, he has done them a great disservice. He has told them an untruth; he has told them something he knew not to be true at the time he said it, and he did it for no other purpose than to further his fear campaign and his political interests. It is not right to go around saying things that are untrue in order to generate fear in the Australian community, and that is what the Leader of the Opposition is doing. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: we on this side stand for giving businesses, like the one that he went to today, certainty so that they know, as they make the arrangements for their business, what arrangements actually apply so that they can do their business plans with certainty. It seems to me a little interesting that at one point the Leader of the Opposition actually thought certainty was important for businesses. At one point, on 19 July, he was wandering around saying things like, ‘I think businesses deserve certainty,' and, ‘I think what business needs is a period of certainty and stability.' The shadow Treasurer said on 21 July: We now accept the Australian people want certainty and stability out of Canberra. Now, of course, what is the Leader of the Opposition promising Australian businesses? He said it on morning TV today. He was asked: Big business is obviously a little concerned, a little confused. Where does it leave them in all this? The Leader of the Opposition said: Well, completely up in the air and with no certainty. With those words the Leader of the Opposition has named his own campaign-create fear and try to stop a confident nation dealing with the challenges of the future. If his fear campaign fails and we price carbon on 1 July 2012, as I intend to do, then he will go to the next election with a plan to wreck the Australian economy with economic vandalism, a plan to rip away from businesses the certainty that they need, a plan to trash this nation's reputation in international markets, a plan to render void important investment decisions that Australian businesses have made, a plan to see electricity prices rise and rise because there is no certainty in investment in electricity, a plan to rip out of the hands of households the assistance we have given them, a plan to make sure that hard working Australians have less money in their purses and their wallets than they have had before, and a plan to destroy Australia",17

9,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Minister for Trade and the member for Flinders continue, they will be able to go outside and have a cup of tea while they have their discussion.  of order. The Prime Minister was asked about power bills rising $1,500 for an average business. If she does not know the answer or refuses to come clean, you should ask her to sit down.",18
10,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,18
11,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the question is: the figure is a product of a campaign that is designed to mislead and scare Austraof lians. The political party in this parliament that stands for increasing power prices is the Liberal Party, with its plan for chaos and uncertainty. We will get on with the job of pricing carbon and assisting households on the way through.",18
12,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question of the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the answer she has just given. She cannot tell people the rate of the carbon tax, she cannot tell people how long the carbon tax will last and she cannot tell people what the compensation will be. Where is the certainty in that, Prime Minister?",18
13,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That contribution reminds me of the Sunday that I sat with the Council of Australian Governments, with the leaders of the nation, and struck a new national health deal-and before I walked out of that room to announce it the Leader of the Opposition did a press conference to try and trash it. What he is doing now shows that either the Leader of the Opposition has paid no attention to this debate because he has been so keen to run his fear campaign, or his question now is once again intended to try and mislead the Australian people. As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, what the government has announced is a carbon pricing mechanism. The government made it clear on the day of the announcement that we would be announcing the carbon price and the household and industry assistance, and then we would bring legislation to this parliament. And when we bring legislation to this parliament that is when it gets interesting, because, as the member for Wentworth reminded the world on BBC-he has gone global, Mr SPEAKER his policy position of pricing carbon is supported by half the Liberal Party minus one. So on the day that the legislation comes into the parliament it will be very interesting to see how the Liberal Party responds, because I believe that there are Liberal Party members over there who are sick of the race baiting, there are Liberal Party members over there who are sick of seeing politics played with grief order. The Prime Minister is required to be directly relevant to the question. She was asked to end the uncertainty around her carbon tax plan and she was talking about everything other than carbon",18
14,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,19
15,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about the further progress in carbon pricing and I am talking about the day of the vote, when members of the Liberal Party will be called to account. I do believe that there are Liberal Party members who are sick of the race baiting, sick of the politics being played with grief, who are pro the NBN, who are pro pricing carbon, who actually want to make a contribution to this country",19
16,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,19
17,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will resume her seat. There are a number of people in this House who could bother to spend a bit of time on self-reflection about the way they carry on within the House. That is on both sides. Respect is a word that I think has left the lexicon of many members of this place. They might just think about it. The Prime Minister has the call.,19
18,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On that day we will see who stands for a prosperous Australia, for the jobs of the future, for assisting households, for making sure that this nation does not get left behind the standards of the world. We will see who lives in the past, who stands for less prosperity, fewer jobs, who stands for rising power prices with no assistance. On that day we will record the vote. I believe that there are some Liberals who that day will walk into this place with a very heavy heart as they are forced to follow the Leader of the Opposition down his path of economic destruction. NA",19
19,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon a senator and two-term member of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, Dr Lee Hye-Hoon. On behalf of the House, I extend to her a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Carbon Pricing",19
20,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, how will a price on carbon help to create a clean energy economy, and what would be the impact of rolling back a legislated carbon price?",19
21,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. She, as all members of the government and other people of goodwill in this place are, is interested in the future of this country and making sure that we have a clean energy economy for the future.",19
22,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,19
23,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I expect the opposition to interject because, of course, they are a party of the past. Let me explain in detail our mechanism for pricing carbon. The first proposition is an incredibly simple one. At the moment carbon pollution can be released into the atmosphere for free. There is no disincentive for doing that. We will put a price on carbon, a price on every unit of carbon pollution. It will be paid for by businesses and as a result, because our business community is smart and adaptable and innovative, they will work out ways of pursuing their business and generating less carbon pollution. They will work out ways of making sure they pay less of a price when carbon is priced. Then they will enter into contracts, they will make investments on the basis of understanding the rules and understanding that carbon will be priced. And as they go about making those transitions, innovating, making the new investments of the future, we will work with those businesses in transition to a clean economy. Having priced carbon and seen that innovation, yes, there will be pricing impacts; that is absolutely right. That is the whole point: to make goods that are generated with more carbon pollution relatively more expensive than goods that are generated with less carbon pollution. But because we are a Labor government this will be done in a fair way. We will assist households as we transition with this new carbon price. What that means is that people will walk into a shop with money in their pocket, the government having provided them with assistance. They will see the price signals on the shelves in front of them-things with less pollution, less expensive; things with more pollution, more expensive-and they too will adapt and change. They will choose the lower pollution products, which is exactly what we want them to do. Between the business investment and innovation, between households who have been assisted in a fair way by a Labor government responding to price signals, we will see a transition to a cleaner economy, to a clean energy economy, to a low-pollution economy. What does that mean? Put very simply, it means jobs. It means that our economy will keep pace with a transition that is happening around the world. Our economy will keep pace and we will have the jobs of the future. What is the alternative? The alternative is to keep emitting carbon pollution. It is to see Australia left behind the tide of history with a high-pollution economy. It is exporting jobs to the rest of the world-jobs that Australian kids could have to build a future on. It is leaving households to deal with escalating electricity prices, which are going up because of a lack of investment certainty, and without household assistance in their pockets. And, of course, if we follow the Leader of the Opposition's plan, it is also about ripping $30 billion off taxpayers. The efficient way to transform our economy is to price carbon and that is what we will do. NA",19
24,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of an APEC delegation from New Zealand. This is the eighth delegation under APEC from New Zealand. It comprises a member of the parliament, Iain Lees-Galloway, who is accompanied by senior members of parliament staff. I notice the trans-Tasman strength of the whips club. The leader of the delegation is the house manager for the government whips' office. That will go without comment from me-but I am worried about the whips getting control! In all seriousness, I iterate the expressions of condolence and solidarity with the people of New Zealand. I would ask that the delegation take those expressions of sympathy back with them. I warmly welcome you today. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Carbon Pricing",20
25,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer her to her statement during the election, when announcing a citizens' assembly, that action on climate change ‘must have as its foundation the genuine political support of the community'. Given the Prime Minister's unequivocal promise that there would be no carbon tax under any government she led, wouldn't a Prime Minister of integrity seek a mandate at the next election before departing from her commitment not to introduce a carbon tax?",20
26,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once again the Leader of the Opposition forgets what he said yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition comes into this parliament every day and, because he is a hollow person of no consistent beliefs, he believes that he can come into this parliament and say something today and not be held to account for what he said yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition should reflect that in the period of the parliament between 2007 and 2010, when the Leader of the Opposition was adopting different climate change position after different climate change position, when the member for Wentworth was writing of his embarrassment at the political hollowness and weathervane politics of the Leader of the Opposition, in all of those twists and turns of inconsistent statements, the Leader of the Opposition said that he accepted the government had a mandate to price carbon. We went to the 2007 election campaign saying we would price carbon. Here is some news for the Leader of the Opposition, who seems to think that everybody has forgotten yesterday: so did Prime Minister John Howard go to the 2007 election promising to price carbon.",21
27,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The Prime Minister seems to believe that the words ‘carbon tax' are unparliamentary. Are they unparliamentary?",21

30,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Some of those on my right, on the back benches, who are inviting me to take action against the member for Flinders, might think about that when they are interrupting proceedings in the way that they do. The House would do well, to both the left and the right, if they sat there in silence. The Prime Minister has the call.",21
31,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am a bit surprised that the member for Flinders would come to the dispatch box. He has caused me to ponder whether, if you walk away from your honours thesis, you get your honours degree stripped off you? I think someone needs to answer that question for us, because his honours thesis makes very good reading. I happen to have extracts of it here. He said: … the market is the preferable regime as it better ensures that the polluter bears full responsibility for the cost of his or her conduct. Good words. He wrote: Businesses' greatest concern, according to the Liberal Party, is the need to have a certainty which would enable them to plan for the long term. I could not have written it better myself. I am glad he got first-class honours. I am a bit ashamed he is walking away from it now. In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the Leader of the Opposition well knows that the Labor Party went to the 2007 election saying we would price carbon with an emissions trading scheme.",21

35,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Indi! The Prime Minister has the call.,21
36,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister Howard went to the 2007 election saying he would price carbon through an emissions trading scheme. I went to the 2010 election saying I would price carbon through an emissions trading scheme. We, at the 2010 election, said to the Australian people: we believe mate change is real, we believe it is a caused by human activity, we believe in order to tackle climate change you need to price carbon and we believe the most efficient mechanism for doing that is an emissions trading scheme. What I announced last week will be an emissions trading scheme, a market based mechanism, a permanent system, with a fixed price for the first years. The Leader of the Opposition raises with me community consensus and community debate. Let me assure the Leader of the OppositionMs Julie Bishop interjecting",21
37,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned!,22
38,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"we will be out there in every community across the country advocating the need to price carbon and exposing his hollow, phoney, sham fear campaign for exactly what it is. Mrs Mirabella-Go out there and sell it!",22
39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Indi is warned! Carbon Pricing,22
40,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Why is pricing carbon important for business certainty; and what would be the impact for business of rolling back a legislated carbon price?,22
41,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Of course, she understands the need for certainty, having been a small business person herself and because she is in touch with her local business community. I think it will amaze people who are watching this parliament today that the Liberal Party, of all political parties, think that business certainty is something to laugh about. They would prefer economic chaos, in their modern incarnation under this Leader of the Opposition. In pricing carbon we will clibe providing businesses with certainty. We need to convert our economy to a clean energy economy for the future. By world standards, we are very big emitters of carbon pollution-the biggest emitters per capita in the developed world, with 27 tonnes of carbon pollution per person. That is more than the United States and it is significantly more than the per capita emissions of places like three to five China and India. What we need to do is price carbon to give business certainty. Let me refer to the words of Brad Page, of the Energy Supply Association, who knows about the need for investment in energy generation. People who are genuinely concerned about rising energy costs for Australian families should listen to these words: Uncertain greenhouse gas emission policy adversely impacts on new energy supply decisions … An equitable and enduring greenhouse gas emissions price signal is required to promote investor confidence, deliver greenhouse gas abatement and reward the uptake of new low-emission technologies. Industry is crying out for certainty-crying out for certainty. I look over at the member for Groom because he is a man who, in the past, has talked about the need for business certainty. He said it in the following wordsthese are the words of the member for Groom: What I hear from small business is that they want certainty. They want to know where they are going to be in 12 months time. He also said that they said to him, and this was about the GST: What we don't want is roll-back. We do not want roll-back. It will complicate our business. It will mean wholesale changes. It will mean wave after wave of reform. Never a truer word was spoken about the consequences for businesses if they fear a loss of certainty, if they do not know what is going to happen next. The Leader of the Opposition himself once supported business certainty. In July last year, he said business ‘deserves certainty'. Again in July last year, he said: … I think what business needs is a period of certainty and stability. But today he was on morning television, proudly saying in answer to a question about business certainty: Well, completely up in the air and with no certainty. That is his vision of the Australian economy. Let us be very clear about what this loss of business sense of certainty will mean. It will trash Australia's reputation around the world as a safe place to invest. It will strand investments that people have made on the basis of a carbon price. It will cost jobs. It will rip out of the hands of householders money supplied to them that they are relying on to meet the costs of living. It will leave Australia a poorer place. The right strategy is to ensure we have the clean energy jobs of the future. We will do that by pricing carbon, despite the fear campaign, despite the campaign of uncertainty. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: is it in order for the opposition duct ballots for whatever position it is during question time, or can they do it at other times, because it creates disorderly conduct?",22
42,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,As long as they do it quietlyAn opposition member-We are!,23
43,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There are one or two that are collecting ballots that at least are quiet, and I am glad the member for New England and the member for MCMillan are not standing in the aisles conferencing! They could do that outside. Mr Ewen Jones interjecting",23
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The members for Mitchell, Herbert, and I will include Hughes because they are starting to be a bit of bad trio, will sit there quietly. NA",23
45,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Federal Republic of Germany. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to the members. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Carbon Pricing",23
46,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her unequivocal statement on Sunday, reiterated by Labor backbenchers today: Every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households … How can the Prime Minister be trusted when the government entered into an agreement in December last year that requires the government to give a reported 10 per cent of any carbon tax raised to a United Nations climate change fund?",23
47,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of to con- the Opposition has asked me how money raised from carbon pricing will be used. I refer her to what I said at the press conference last Thursday. When I announced the carbon pricing mechanism I said: Every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households, helping businesses manage the transition and funding climate change programs. And the government will always support those who are in need of assistance with cost of living pressures. That is where the money will go. When I was on the Today show on Sunday I said: … I do want to be clear. Every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting helping businesses transition, and to programs to tackle climate change. But the highest priority will be assisting households. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister is referring to a quote she made on Thursday. I am talking about what she said on Sunday and what every backbencher who did the doors today said about",23
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question. The Prime Minister has the call.,24
49,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition more broadly, I have very little idea of what she is on about but I am not on my own there. Whenever you meet one of the Liberal backbenchers in the corridors, they are very keen to offer an assessment about not knowing what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is on about",24
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will come to the question.,24
51,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has any real interest in assistance for Australian households than let me advise her of this: if she is really interested in assistance for Australian households, she will be supporting the government. Today, in a press conference shortly before question time, when her leader was asked about household assistance he said: It sort of defeats the purpose of making everything more expensive and it creates this giant money-go-round. Of the Leader of the Opposition's utterances today, what we do understand is that he thinks that a carbon tax is the simplest way to price carbon and he is opposed to household compensation. That is what he said today. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is genuinely interested in household compensation, she will be endorsing the governhouseholds, to ment's position. On the question of foreign aid, what I can say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that the government will make its own decisions. You will get yours from One Nation. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting",24
52,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that she was warned earlier. It is one more warning than she really needs today. If she continues to interject, she will be dealt with. I think I recognise the member for Lyne. National Disability Insurance Scheme",24
53,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. In light of media reports today of cross-parliament support for a national disability insurance scheme, will you outline how you intend to progress this important reform as a matter of urgency within government?",24
54,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyne for his question. I hope that he, in his appearance, is setting a trend for those who work in Parliament House, including some members of the press gallery-Phil Hudson and Dennis Shanahan, amongst others-so congratulations to him. He asked me about a very important Productivity Commission inquiry which is underway-an inquiry into how this nation could better assist Australians with disabilities. The interim report of the Productivity Commission was made available yesterday and I am pleased that the interim report has got some general acceptance across the parliament as a very good piece of work. As the member would know, this is the interim report. There is now a further comment period for people who are interested. So many people around the country have a disability or are a carer or a family member or a friend of an Australian with a disability and will want to have their voices heard in this inquiry process. So there will be a further period in which people can provide their comments and then the final report will be made available in July. After the final report is made available, the government will respond to it. As the member is probably aware, the Productivity Commission does genuinely take on board feedback between the interim report and the final report and we may well find that some parts of it are changed from what has been made available now. I do endorse what the member has said. This is an incredibly important area of work. It is somewhere where the government has made a start, but there is more to do. We have doubled federal funding, providing more than $6 billion over five years to deliver more and better specialist disability services. We have improved access to specialist employment services because many Australians living with a disability do want to work, but they may need that extra bit of assistance to get into the workforce. Of course, we have delivered a historic pension increase to assist people with a disability and their carers, something that made a very big difference to them. These are Australians that live under a great deal of pressure. The government is also funding the Better Start for Children with Disability program. This is all about early intervention for dren diagnosed with sight and hearing impairments, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, fragile X syndrome, and it follows in the wake of the earlier successful program to assist children with autism. But, despite these investments, I acknowledge and the government acknowledges that there is more the nation needs to do to support Australians with disability. I think, with the interim report yesterday, we are off to a good start on working out major new policy improvements. I am glad to see that that has received bipartisan support at this point. I do genuinely hope that that bipartisanship lasts as we go through the next stage of the process, which will be the final Productivity Commission report in the middle of the year. Carbon Pricing",24
55,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Why is moving to a carbon constrained economy dependent on setting a price on carbon? How can we encourage investment and business certainty through the implementation of policies to address climate change?,25
56,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his very important question. Economists and the business community understand that having a carbon price is a very important part of our economic evolution. Over 30 countries around the world have moved to a carbon price and, unless we move, we are at serious risk of being left behind. We do have to move to the lowpollution economy of the future; it is absolutely essential to future prosperity. Of course, there are even those opposite who think a move to a carbon price is inevitable. The shadow Treasurer himself said on 20 May that we have to, it is ‘inevitable'. And we have had the shadow minister for climate change who has written a thesis saying it is absolutely imperative to have a price on carchil- bon. And we have got the member for Wentworth, who has had this to say-and he only said this on 12 June 2010: … we cannot cost effectively achieve a substantial cut in emissions without putting a price on carbon. We have to put a price on carbon. So that is the view of three senior shadow ministers across the other side of the House. But we really heard the truth of it last night when the member for Wentworth was on the BBC and he said: ‘Look, it would have otherwise been different. I was only beaten by one vote.' So there are a lot more opposite who do really believe in a carbon price. It is one thing to oppose what the government is going to do on a carbon price. It is an entirely different thing to say that it would repealed. Nothing could be more damaging to investment in this country. You could not send a more damaging message to international investors and particularly to investors in renewable energy than a promise to repeal. I think that demonstrates how desperate are all of those opposite. They are prepared to do anything to trash our economic reputation and to trash our standing in the international community. Nowhere is this more damaging than when it comes to the energy supply sector. We have seen five-year forecasts in that sector fall from $18 billion in 2009 to $8 billion in 2010. As the Prime Minister was saying before, if we do not get a carbon price in place we will not get the investment in the energy sector, and electricity prices will be higher than they otherwise would be. Responsibility for that will be directly at the feet of all those opposite. This decision not just to oppose but to repeal strikes at the heart of business certainty, strikes at the heart of investment in jobs in our economy. If anything demonstrates how irresponsible they are and how they have no economic credentials or capacity to govern, it has been this decision. What we have opposite with the Leader of the Opposition is a political con man who is not game to take a tough decision, a con man who wants to believe dealing with climate change is cost free.",25

65,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement just six days before the last election: … we will go back and seek to reconstruct a community consensus about how we deal with climate change … We'll look at where we are going in 2012. Treasurer, how can Australians trust you at your word when there is clearly no community consensus and, even on your reckoning, it is not 2012?",26
66,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased the shadow Treasurer has asked me that question because it enables me to go back to our commitment to price carbon, which is long standing and enduring-a lot more long standing than the shadow Treasurer, who was only 12 months ago saying that he believed in a price on carbon. We have announced an emissions trading scheme. That puts a price on carbon. First of all we are going to have a fixed price and then we are going to have a floating price. What we have done is to take the courageous economic decision for the future of this country. Yes, there is political risk ciated with that courageous decision, but we are putting the national interest ahead of our own political interest. Of course, what you have seen here from the scare campaign that has been run by the opposition leader, who is a political con man, who wants to pretend that dealing with climate change is cost free",26
67,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will withdraw.,27
68,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker. ",27
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I say to the member for Sturt: often people excuse his behaviour because he is the Manager of Opposition Business, but he does not need to catcall at all times. He should try to sit there quietly.",27
70,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is well-known that the Leader of the Opposition is a climate change sceptic. He is the best friend that carbon ever had. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is simply relevance. It goes to the words of the Treasurer talking about community consensus and not doing anything on climate change until 2012.",27
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Treasurer will directly relate his remarks to the question.,27
72,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a stark contrast between the government and the opposition. Labor has got its sleeves rolled up and is taking the tough decisions for the future of the country to support jobs, and what we are getting from the opposition is just negativity and scare campaigns-reaching the dizzy heights of negativity. You can just see him at the next campaign, out there saying to the Australian people: ‘No, we can't! We can't deal with the challenge of climate change. assoWe can't deal with making our country more prosperous by investing in infrastructure. We can't invest in the NBN. No, we can't.' Well, I will tell you what: the Australian people respect those who have the guts to take the tough decisions for prosperity. That is what this government is doing, and everybody knows that what is being said by the opposition is a big con job. Pretending you can deal with carbon emissions in a cost-free way is nothing other than a con job. Those opposite want to tax families and hand the money to polluters. What we want to do is charge polluters and give the money to households and industry. Economy",27
73,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Why is a unified approach important to policymaking when it comes to major economic reforms? What is necessary to maintain public confidence in reforms?,27
74,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Putting a price on carbon in our economy is a major economic reform that is in this country's long-term interests, and it will drive cuts in pollution, it will drive investment in clean energy and it will provide a stable environment for investment in the future. The government's policy proposal, the framework that we announced, is responsive to the climate science and it also applies market principles as the lowest cost means to reduce pollution across our economy. The fact of the matter is that on the other side of this parliament, of this House, they are deeply divided. They are divided about the climate science and they are divided about the policy responses. The Leader of the Opposition, as we know, has had multiple different and contradictory positions on climate change himself. At various times he has advocated a carbon tax; he has advocated an emissions trading scheme on other occasions. Then, he has opposed both. He has been suspicious of market mechanisms. He has said he thinks the science is crap, although at other times he has supported action on the basis of an insurance principle. He has time travelled back to Roman times, as we heard yesterday. He checks into the One Nation website to have a look at things. Today he had an interesting experience at a press conference. After boasting that he had all these letters of support from authoritative figures supporting the coalition's so called ‘direct action' policy, he was interrupted by a journalist to say the following: ‘Sorry to labour the point, Mr Abbott, but your office actually sent me your letters of support and all these people who have supported your scheme. I rang them and most of them didn't actually support your scheme, and those that did weren't actually scientists.' There are a few accusations about ple being loose with the truth and gilding the lily-a little bit of it applies on the other side. On the other side of the House there is one member in particular who has maintained a consistent and principled position that I certainly have respect for, and that is the member for Wentworth. He said only yesterday in an interview on the BBC: In terms of the principles that I was standing forat the time of the last debate about this issueI think those principles are right - I maintain them today. Just in case there was any confusion about any of this, last night on Q&A the member for Wentworth said a number of important things about this policy issue. He said: ‘I think there should be a price on carbon', ‘I would prefer to put a price on carbon via market-based mechanism' and ‘I don't think there's a people's revolt so much about putting a price on carbon'. In relation to the coalition's policy on direct action he said, ‘Well, I can't cite any economists that agree with it'. He also said: ‘The coalition's policy of the government spending money to put a price on carbon with taxpayers' dollars is another way,' of dealing with it, but, ‘There is always a risk when governments are making decisions like that that there will be, you know, fiscal waste. That is a risk.' This is the position. They are deeply divided on that side of parliament about the science. We well know the member for Tangney's point of view and those in other contributions that have been made from time to time. There are others that think it is a communist conspiracy. There are others that adhere to the science and recognise the best way of approaching this issue is through a market mechanism. They are deeply divided. peo- The more we get into this debate the more those divisions will be evident. Carbon Pricing",27
75,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement on 12 August last year, just nine days before the election, when he was asked on The 7.30 Report: … are you going to rule out a carbon tax in the next term of the Government - yes or no? to which he replied: We have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out. Treasurer, why should the Australian people ever believe anything you say again?",28
76,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for asking me the same question he asked me before and the answer is, of course, the same. We have been committed to an emissions trading system for many years. The shadow Treasurer was committed to an emissions trading system until about a year or a year and a half ago when he changed his mind, proving yet again that he has no principles whatsoever. We are committed to an emissions trading scheme. We have announced a scheme with a fixed price moving to a floating price. That is what we have done. We said all the way through the election campaign we were determined to price carbon. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the Treasurer ruled out a carbon tax before the election; now he wants to introduce one.",29
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The question went on to ask why people should ever believe anything the Treasurer said, which opens the question more than just slightly. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.",29
78,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was drawing a very clear contrast with our policy and that of the now opposition. The now opposition have a plan to tax families and to hand all of that money to polluters. That is what they are proposing to do-$10 billion worth of so-called direct action initiatives, we are told, which are going to be paid for by the Australian people and handed to the polluters. We, in contrast to them, will charge polluters and provide assistance to households and industry. You could not get a clearer contrast between both those approaches. Our approach is strongly supported by many others opposite, as I was saying before. I will quote the member for Wentworth, again from 8 February 2010: Having the government pick projects for subsidy is a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale, and there will always be a temptation for projects to be selected for their political appeal.",29
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will relate his remarks to the question.,29
80,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What we have here is a scare campaign being run by a mob of people who have not a clue about what we need to do to protect our prosperity.,29
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will bring his answer to a close.,29
82,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We know that they were missing in action when the global recession threatened. It took Labor to have the courage to put in place a range of policies to support employment and small business. It was opposed every step of the way. That was for the good of our country,29
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will bring his answer to a close.,29
84,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and so is our commitment to an emissions trading system. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders,29
85,Mr ABBOTT,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately: (1) That this House suspend proceedings forthwith so that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer can defend themselves against the very serious charge of deceiving the Australian people about the introduction of a carbon tax, in particular, that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer address the following questions before the full scrutiny of this House: (a) how the Prime Minister can claim any semblance of a mandate for her carbon tax when she said, five days before the election “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead”; (b) how the Prime Minister can maintain the trust of the Australian people when she said one day before the election that “I rule out a carbon tax”; (c) how the Treasurer can be trusted with a trillion dollar economy when he said six days before the election that he “rejected this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax … we certainly reject that”; (d) how the Treasurer can ever be believed again when he said, in relation to bon tax, that “we have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out”; and (2) that the Prime Minister and Treasurer stand before the people of Australia whose trusts they have abused and whose mandate they do not have, to argue why a carbon tax won't destroy jobs, the economy and our standard of living. The Prime Minister today stood up before her caucus colleagues and said that she was very confident she could win a debate on the carbon tax. If she is so confident, why did she not have the debate before the last election? If she is so confident, why will she not have the debate with the next election? The fact of the matter is that this Prime Minister knows she cannot win any debate on a carbon tax because she knows (a) that it is bad policy and (b) that it is based on a lie. We had the Treasurer stand up in this parliament today boasting-hysterically, almost-about what a courageous decision it was. I will tell you what, Mr Speaker: it would have been courageous to talk about it before the election. That is what courageous governments do: they talk about things before an election, not after an election. The courageous thing for this government to do now would be to seek a mandate for the carbon tax that it ruled out before the election and now has ruled in. If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were so confident about the case for a carbon tax, why did they go to the last election running on a lie? They say that they want to give business certainty. If the Prime Minister was so keen to give business certainty, why did she sabotage the former Prime Minister's campaign to have an emissions trading scheme in the last term of parliament? Perhaps it was not the Prime Minister who went into see Kevin Rudd and sabotaged the ETS; perhaps it was a body double? Perhaps it was not the Prime Minisa car- ter who stood up before the Channel 10 cameras during the election and said, ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Maybe it was a body double. This is the Prime Minister who understands business so well. Oh yes, she knows what business wants. She knows that business demands certainty. The certainty that it is going to get from this government is the certainty of taxes, taxes and yet more taxes. That is the last certainty that the businesses of Australia want-higher taxes. I have a little lesson for the Prime Minister and for the Treasurer. Higher taxes do not generate more investment. Higher taxes do not improve an economy. Business might want certainty, but it does not want the certainty of ever more taxes under a government that it just cannot trust. Let me remind the House of these words that should echo around this chamber every day between now and the next electionthese words that will haunt the Prime Minister every day that is left to her in this parliament. She said: ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead. I rule out a carbon tax.' The truth is-I regret to say it of the person who holds the highest elected office in this country-that she told a lie to win votes and she broke a promise to form a government. It was a breach of faith",29
86,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,Order! I remind the Leader of the Opposition that this is a motion for the suspension of standing and sessional orders. It is not a substantive motion and therefore he should be very careful with his language. On that occasion he should withdraw the remark.,30
87,Mr ABBOTT,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"In deference I withdraw. I accept your admonition but I am entitled to say, Mr Speaker, that this Prime Minister broke faith with the Australian public. This Prime Minister behaved in a contemptible way by telling a deliberate untruth to the Australian people before the last election. It is very important that we suspend standing orders and we give this Prime Minister a chance to come clean. Why did she say it? Why did she say, ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? Did she think a carbon tax was bad in principle? Did she suffer from blind political panic just a few days out from an election? The Prime Minister must have known at that stage of the parliament that the Greens were likely to hold a balance of power in the Senate, so we cannot have any of this subsequent rationalisation, any of this obfuscation: ‘Everything changes after polling day.' She knew full well that the Greens were likely to have a balance of power in the Senate and she knew full well that the Greens wanted a carbon tax. So why, oh why, did this Prime Minister stand up and say repeatedly, ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government that I lead'? But that is not the only untruth that we heard from the Prime Minister during the election campaign. Remember the climate change citizens' assembly? Remember the 12 months that the Prime Minister was going to spend building consensus? Well, 12 months have not passed; consensus has not been achieved and yet we now have, in total breach of faith with the Australian people, a carbon tax foisted on the Australian people by this bad, untrustworthy, lying government. Let's not hear any more from this Prime Minister, ‘I'm following the John Howard precedent.' John Howard was a gutsy Prime Minister. John Howard was prepared to tell people before an election what he wanted to do. He would never have said one thing before an election and done something completely different after an election. So let us be absolutely crystal clear about what this government is doing: this government has broken faith with the Australian people. This government is seeking to do what this parliament has no mandate to do. This Prime Minister is asking this parliament to engage in a conspiracy against the Australian people. Only one member of this parliament-the member for Melbourne-had the guts to say to the people before the election, ‘I support a carbon tax.' Not one single member of this parliament apart from him had the guts to say that. This parliament has no mandate for a carbon tax. For this parliament to seek to impose a carbon tax would be a betrayal of democracy. It would be a betrayal of the Prime Minister's word. It would be a betrayal of any trust between the people and the government. Any carbon tax that is legislated by this parliament would be the l-i-e lie tax. I would like to think that deep within the heart of even this Prime Minister is the desire not to live a lie. So do not put this tax in; seek a mandate first",31
88,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw.,31
89,Mr ABBOTT,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,I besought the Prime Minister not to live a lie but if,31
90,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw.,31
91,Mr ABBOTT,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,that is offensive I withdraw.,31
92,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,Is the motion seconded? Mr Ewen Jones interjecting,31
93,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,The member for Herbert is warned. Mr Albanese-I rise on a simple point of order. You asked the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw. He knows how to do it and he should do it properly.,32
94,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"I believe he withdrew, eventually. He withdrew.",32
95,Mr HOCKEY,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"I second the motion. On a number of occasions over the last few days we have asked the Prime Minister of this country and the Treasurer of this country to defend their integrity. We have asked them to explain why, immediately before the election on numerous occasions, they deliberately sought a mandate to rule out a carbon tax and yet after the election they want to implement a carbon tax. We have asked them to stand up for their courage. They have refused to do so. We have asked them to stand up for their integrity. They have refused to do so. These are the two most important public figures in the land-the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-and they are refusing to protect their personal integrity. Their sole defence is to attack the integrity of others. Their sole fence is to say something about another person, but they do not have the courage to defend themselves. They do not have the courage to defend their words. This means that this couple, who have become the Bonnie and Clyde of public policy, are not fit cupy the offices. They have no mandate for government, they have no mandate for a carbon tax and they have no courage at all-not in this place, not amongst the public. It is quite unbelievable",32
96,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,Order! I remind the member for North Sydney that this is a motion for the suspension of standing orders; is not a debate upon the substantive motion.,32
97,Mr HOCKEY,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"This is why we are inviting the government to join us in suspending standing orders so there can be a debate about their integrity. We are providing a format and a platform for the Prime Minister to show courage, to show personal integrity, to show Australia that she is a person with some conviction. We are inviting the Treasurer to come before the Australian people and show that he does have some semblance of courage. But that courage was not on display when the Prime Minister announced the new tax. This is a Treasurer who has overseen the introduction or increase of 13 new taxes in four years and, for the most spectacular and largest of them all, he was cowering under his desk while the Prime Minister was outside in the parliamentary courtyard explaining to the Australian people why she was breaking a solemn promise. The Treasurer can cower under his desk like a modernday George Costanza, but I say to him you cannot come into this place and run away from a debate on your integrity. You cannot come into this place and pretend that somehow everyone else is responsible for your foibles. If you seek to occupy a high office in this land, at some point in time you have to dehave the courage to look the Australian people in the eye and be honest. You have to have the confidence to explain to the Australian people why you want to introduce new policy. The fact is that today in this place the to ocTreasurer is running away from questions about his integrity and the Prime Minister is running away from questions about her integrity. It leaves the Australian people wondering who is running the shop. You can see the dynamics on their side of the House. Last night on Q&A Bill Shorten could not mention Greg Combet's name enough, tying the it minister for climate change to the Prime Minister and wrapping them around each other. They are solely responsible for this initiative, he said. How true it is! I say to Lady Macbeth watch out for the others because they will come after you. Ultimately, what did the previous Prime Minister inand you held the knife",32
98,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,The member for North Sydney will address his remarks through the chair and address members by their titles.,33
99,Mr HOCKEY,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,What did the previous Prime Minister in was that the Australian people no longer believed him-and now his successor can no longer be believed. I say to these people stand up for your integrity and show some courage. Do not give us the hilarious and hysterical laughter; actually give us some leadership. You were elected to lead. Do not cower away from the Australian people.,33
100,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,The member for North Sydney will address his remarks through the chair.,33
101,Ms GILLARD,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"And now we have heard everything in this parliament-a lecture on courage from a man who tweeted and asked people to tell him what he should think on climate change! He is the man for whom the expression ‘no ticker' was actually generated. He is a man who is hollow, without courage, and does not know what to believe in. He tried to get the leadership of the eral Party on the basis that he would say: ‘I don't know anything, I don't think anything, I don't believe in anything. Everybody on the backbench can have a conscience vote.' He is a man without courage and a man without integrity, because he has said in the past he stands for a price on carbon and now he is walking away from it. There are some days in question time where there is one moment that symbolises and comes to be the fulcrum on which a debate changes, and we have had that moment today. I have been saying to the Australian people that this is a desperate fear campaign built on a foundation of lies from the opposition-and we have had that proved today in just one moment. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition came into the parliament today and put to me the following question: I refer the Prime Minister to her unequivocal statement on Sunday … that: Every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households … What she did in formulating that question was to cut the sentence in half. What I said was that every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households, to helping businesses transition and to programs to tackle climate change. This was one moment that symbolises a campaign of dishonestybringing in a transcript and deliberately cutting it in half to give a false and dishonest impression to the Australian people. That one moment symbolises what this opposition is about: a campaign of dishonesty. The Leader of the Opposition has been out saying to the Australian people, ‘You'll pay this dollar figure more, or that dollar figure more for the things that you buy.' Well, let us just go to a statement from Woolworthsand they'd know a bit about pricing, wouldn't they! They have said very clearly that they could not forecast the potential Lib- price impacts until more details of the scheme were released. Every time the Leader of the Opposition has used a dollar figure, every time he has stood in a shop, every time he has stood next to a car and put petrol in it he has been misleading the Australian peothat ple-a campaign of dishonesty, a campaign of fear, a foundation of lies from the Leader of the Opposition. Let us continue going through the dishonesty, the foundation of lies, that the Liberal Party now relies on. Let us look at the track record of the Leader of the Opposition in dealing with the question of pricing carbon. This will tell you how contentless he is, how he will say anything, how he will do anything on the question of climate change. He has said the following in relation to the Rudd government: The Rudd government has a mandate to deal with climate change. He was in this parliament today denying a mandate. He said about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: If the government substantially accepts our amendments then there is no reason why this legislation cannot be passed. He said that in the past. He has said in the past: I also think that if you want bon, why not just do it with a simple tax. They are statements made by the Leader of the Opposition, and when the government moves to price carbon, despite him having made those statements, despite him having supported pricing carbon, despite him in fact having directly supported a carbon tax as the best system, he decides that his political interest lies in generating fear. It is a campaign built on dishonesty and a foundation of lies. Should it be a surprise to the Australian community that this man, when faced with choosing between the nation's interest and his own political interest, would say every time, ‘My own political interest comes first'? He believes in profiting at the nation's expense. He believes that if he can profit from the nation going to economic ruin, if he can prosper from the economy going downhill, then he will do so. Mr Ruddock interjecting",33
102,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,The member for Berowra is warned!,34
103,Ms GILLARD,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,The authority for thisthat he always puts politics first-is actually the Leader of the Opposition himself. Mr Simpkins interjecting Mr Symon interjecting,34
104,The SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,The member for Cowan is warned! The member for Deakin should be careful.,34
105,Ms GILLARD,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"He has said, for example: Look, certainly, I think the politics of this issue has changed. I think the politics of this issue has changed dramatically. This is a man who basically has admitted that the only thing that drives him is the politics. He went on to say: I don't think my assessments of the science or of the policy ever changed that much. I think all that really changed was my assessment of the politics to put a price on carof the issue. He is a man who believes in nothing, who will do and say anything, who will say any misleading statement that comes into his mind in order to politically profit. Who has caught this the best? Who has best summarised this for the Australian people? Is it me as Prime Minister, as someone here who debates in this parliament? Is it someone on the government benches? Is it someone in the media? No, it is not. The person who best caught all of this about the Leader of the Opposition is the member for Wentworth, when he said: Many Liberals are rightly dismayed that on this vital issue of climate change we are not simply without a policy, without any prospect of having a credible policy but we are now … also without integrity. We have given our opponents the irrefutable, undeniable evidence that we cannot be trusted … This was the member for Wentworth's critique of the leadership of this Leader of the Opposition.

Rarely has it been mentioned in the debate. The Prime Minister has the call.",35
109,Ms GILLARD,PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER,"Of course we know the shadow Treasurer, in his bitterness and his shame, does not want to hear the words of the member for Wentworth about the Leader of the Opposition, but they are true words about the Leader of the Opposition. Let us be clear about this debate and where it will lead us. We went to the last election saying to the Australian people, ‘We have to price carbon.'

119,Mr SLIPPER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It has been drawn to my attention that during my response to an unprovoked attack on me by former Liberal member for Longman Mal Brough shown on Channel 7 Sunshine Coast last Fridayoddly enough, read by Mr Brough's brother Rob, who is a nice guy-I was reported as saying that, if Mr Brough wanted to return to politics, he should contest his former electorate of Longman, now so ably represented by the honourable member for Longman. What I in fact said, referring to the last election, was that if Mr Brough had been interested in returning to federal politics then he should have contested the seat of Longman. It was incorrect to suggest that I implied that the honourable member for Longman should stand aside for someone already comprehensively rejected by the people of that electorAUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS Report No. 32 of 2010-11",36

121,Mr ALBANESE,DOCUMENTS,"Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings, and I move: That the House take note of the following documents: Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency-Quarterly report of the Chief Executive Officer-1 October to 31 December 2010 Broadcasting Services Act 1992-Review of local content requirements for regional commercial radio-Final report, March 2011 Debate (on motion by Mr Hartsuyker) adjourned. NA Carbon Pricing",37
122,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The impact of the Government's carbon tax on the Australian economy. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",37
123,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is very important that we debate the impact of the government's carbon tax on the Australian economy because this is perhaps the biggest single tax change ever proposed for our economy and it is a tax change that has not been thoroughly scrutinised by the Australian people. It is the biggest change in years, yet it is not a change that this government had the guts to take to the Australian people at the last election. It is very interesting that the Prime Minister apparently told the caucus today that she was very confident that she could win a debate about the carbon tax-that confidence I hasten to add did not actually lead to her doing this prior to the election-but one she presumably is not confident she could win is the debate we sought to have earlier today about her integrity. She shirked a debate about her own integrity. It is very understandable that she did not want to have that debate, because the words that are going to haunt this Prime Minister to her political grave are: ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Those are the words that she repeated in one form or another before the last election and the words she has subsequently given the lie to by her behaviour. There are two important things: first, we have a Prime Minister who would not defend her integrity before this House and, second, we have a government that did not actually want to have a debate on this matter of public importance. They preferred that this MPI debate not proceed, given the suspension that took place earlier today. The impact of the government's carbon tax on the Australian economy will be immense and it will ramify. The first impact of the government's carbon tax on the Australian economy will be that no-one looking at our economy will believe anything that this Prime Minister says and no-one looking at our economy will trust this government with anything, given that you could not trust this government or this Prime Minister to tell the truth about their intentions before the last election. It is very damaging to have a government that has utterly lost any reputation for integrity. A Prime Minister's word should count for something. A government's word should be able to be believed. This government cannot be trusted, and this Prime Minister's word can obviously be jettisoned as soon as it suits her political self-interest so. That is the first impact of the government's carbon tax on the Australian economy. It will damage confidence and it will damage the faith that investors have previously had in our economy. It will damage the reputation for being a low-tax economy that we used to enjoy under genuinely reforming governments in the years up to 2007. The main impact of the government's carbon tax on our economy will be that it will drive prices up and it will drive employment down. Over the last few days members opposite have claimed that we have no justification for our statements that the price of electricity will go up $300 a year per household on average and the price of petrol will go up 6.5c a litre, and that is just for starters. I tell the House and the listening Australian public that those figures are based on the $26 a tonne carbon price that was precisely the price on which the Treasury modelling was done to underlie the emissions trading scheme that this government was formerly committed to. We are simply taking the figures that were good enough for the Treasury and were good enough for the government. If they were good enough for the government before the election, they are good enough for us after the election. We will keep using those figures because they are true. I tell you what: that is just the start; that is just the beginning. The price per tonne will rise month after month, year after year because the only way the government will be able to achieve its objectives and stop people from turning on their air conditioners and stop people from driving their cars is if the price becomes prohibitively expensive, so there will be a massive rise in prices and a massive cost in jobs. I will give you some examples of the varito do ous estimates and forecasts that were made of the government's former emissions trading scheme by reputable modellers such as ACIL, Access and IPART. There will be a 25 per cent increase in electricity prices, up to a five per cent rise in grocery prices, 126,000 jobs lost in regional Australia and 16 major coal mines closed, with 10,000 jobs lost in the coal industry. This increase in prices will be on top of the massive increase in prices that we have seen over the last three years, which were at least in part driven by the poor economic management of this government. The struggling families of this country are hurting because this government cannot be trusted to manage an economy. This government cannot be trusted to prudently and frugally manage the finances of this nation. This government has turned a $20 billion surplus and an international reputation for prudence, frugality and fiscal responsibility into a $57 billion deficit. Last year it was a $40-odd billion deficit. This year they say that they will eventually get back into surplus on the basis of their mining tax and their carbon tax. They never will because they are addicted to spending. It does not matter how high the taxes are, they will never keep pace with this government's addiction to spending. Do you know why they want this carbon tax? It is really crystal clear. They want a great big new tax to give them a great big new slush fund so they can provide great big handouts to politically favoured groups and buy their way to an undeserved victory at the next election. The households of Australia are struggling. The families of Australia are struggling, and if members opposite were not so cocooned in their political closed shop they would understand better. Electricity prices are up 44 per cent since December 2007. Gas prices are up 29 per cent since December 2007. Water prices are up 46 per cent. Health costs are up 15 per cent. Education costs are up 17 per cent. Bread is up 12 per cent. Groceries are up 10 per cent. Rent is up 19 per cent, and it is all going to get worse. Mr Hartsuyker-Much worse.",37
124,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Much worse under the government's carbon price, because making electricity more expensive makes everything more expensive. Making fuel more expensive makes everything more expensive, because a modern economy simply cannot work without electricity and fuel. Power and transport are the foundations of a modern economy. Power and transport are the foundations of our standard of living. Power and transport are the foundations of our way of life, and they want to undermine those foundations. They will make everything worse. It is no wonder that the chief executive ficer of one of Australia's largest manufacturing companies, BlueScope Steel, said that this government's carbon tax is nothing short of economic vandalism, and he told the truth when he said that this government seems to hate the manufacturing industry. It does not understand the manufacturing industry of this country and it is trying to destroy it by driving jobs offshore, by destroying employment in this country, by sending jobs and employment to countries where they are not guilty of the kind of economic vandalism of which this government is so obviously guilty. Why does this government hate the coal industry so much? What is wrong with the coal industry? Why does this government want to ensure that so many regions of this country-the Illawarra, the Hunter, Gippsland, the Bowen Basin, Central Queensland-are destroyed? Why does this government want to destroy the economic foundation of those communities? Why does this government want to take away the livelihoods of those struggling families? Why suck the life out of the economy of regional Australia by putting the coal industry under a handicap that will surely kill it? Why does the government want to do this? This government must explain, and this opposition will make this government explain day in day out, moment in moment out, all the time until the next election, because this change should not be happening without the opportunity for a full consideration by the Australian people. The most shameful thing about what the government are now proposing to do is that they have tried to hoodwink people, to hide this from the Australian people. That is the only possible explanation. There is no other possible explanation for the statements of the Prime Minister, who said, ‘There will be no carbon tax ofunder any government I lead; I rule out a carbon tax,' and the statements of the Treasurer, sitting opposite, who said, ‘It's just a hysterical allegation.' Well, Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, I am afraid that it has come true and, if you want to have any shred of integrity left, you have got to explain to this House, to the people and, above all else, to yourself why you made that statement. Come on, Treasurer. Are you a man? If you are, give us the explanation. And while you are dreaming up the explanation, let me tell the House that there is a better way. Let me say it, lest it be questioned by members opposite: climate change is real; mankind does make a contribution; we should take sensible precautions against the risks of climate change. And that is exactly what the coalition are doing with our practical and effective plan to take direct action. We will actually reduce emissions. We will not make our way of life prohibitively expensive in the hope-the vain hope, I suspect-that people will suddenly decide that they cannot drive and cannot use their air conditioners. We will not whack a $13 billion tax on the economy, and that is just for starters. We will spend up to a billion dollars a year; we will plant more trees; we will get better soil; we will use smarter technology; and we will make our industrial processes, our power generation and our farming more efficient and more effective. We will reduce emissions in sensible ways that will provide all sorts of additional environmental benefits. That is what we will do. That is a better way and, above all else, it more honest way. That is the plan we had before the election. That is the plan that we had after the election. That is the plan we have. That is the plan we will continue to have, because the most important thing of all is the trust that the Australian people should be able to repose in their leaders. I understand-we all understand-that sometimes people change their minds. But, if they are honest and they really have changed their minds, they should take the new position to an election. Have a bit of guts, have a bit of honesty-and that is what you should do, Deputy Prime Minister.",39
125,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just heard from a political conman who does not have the guts to take any difficult decisions. He behaves like a political faith-healer, who thinks he can simply wave his arms and every problem will simply go away. Electricity prices: no problem.  of order: the Speaker has already ruled the statement of the Deputy Prime Minister out of order during question time, and I would ask you to ask him to withdraw it now.",40
126,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I would ask the Deputy Prime Minister to assist the House by withdrawing.,40
127,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker. He behaves like a faith-healer, who somehow pretends that if he waves his arms",40
128,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Could the Deputy Prime Minister withdraw using the words, please.",40
129,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I did, Mr Deputy Speaker; I withdraw. He behaves like a political faithhealer pretending that he can solve any problem. If he stands up in the House and says he can solve it, he can solve it. Electricity prices is a would be going down if he were in power, according to the Leader of the Opposition. He can do something fundamental, he says, to reduce prices across the board. This is nonsense. This is fairyland stuff. This stuff is la-la land politics and la-la land economics. I can see the embarrassment on the faces of many opposite who know the emptiness of what the Leader of the Opposition is talking about. Like all conmen, he will be found out in time. He wants to slide into the prime ministership of this country by demonstrating that he has absolutely no economic expertise whatsoever. Difficult problems such as climate change, such as dealing with a global recession and such as responding to floods require difficult decisions. What this Leader of the Opposition has proved during the global recession, during the floods in Queensland and during this debate is that he cannot be trusted in times of crisis and he most certainly cannot be trusted in times of challenge. He simply does not have the expertise, he does not have the economic knowledge and he does not have the temperament to deal with these challenges like a national leader does need to deal with these challenges. The fact is the business community of this country absolutely understands the need for a price on carbon, for business certainty. It goes to the very core of our future prosperity. In the past in this country Labor governments have had the guts to take tough decisions, to take decisions which are hard politically. But we have done it in the long-term interests of economic reform and of wealth creation. Floating the dollar, bringing down the tariff wall, enterprise bargaining and competition policy are all great reforms of previous Labor governments. But the big reform that is required in the 21st century to cope with the biggest market failure in the history of the globe is to put a price on bon, because the failure to price carbon has meant that it has been omitted in ways in which it should not be and it is gradually poisoning our planet. We have a responsibility to deal with it, not just an environmental responsibility but an economic responsibility. It is a great economic challenge. Economists around the world from both left and right, governments from both left and right and think tanks from both left and right all understand the importance of putting a price on carbon, but not the Leader of the Opposition. I know at least half of those opposite understand the importance of a price on carbon. After all, they voted for it in the last leadership contest within the Liberal Party. They voted for a price on carbon, which is why the member for Wentworth was so explicit in his interview on BBC television when he reminded the interviewer that he only lost by one vote. What he was simply saying is a carbon emissions trading scheme in this country was not implemented because of one vote in the House of Representatives in the Liberal and Nationals party room. That is what it came down to. The threat that then flows from that to this country's prosperity into the future is indeed substantial. Of course, there is a furious debate about this, and so there should be. It is a very important economic decision. It is one that we have argued for long and hard for a long period of time. Following the last election, we thought it was our responsibility to get the price of carbon in place, working with the composition of this parliament, and that is what we have done. We do not apologise for that. We understand there will be political pain associated with it. But that is the right thing to do by the country. I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition thinks of companies like Shell, Origin Energy, Santos or BHP Billiton, but they are very, very big investors in this country. car- They are responsible for a large number of jobs in our economy and they are making more and more investments. But the Leader of the Opposition comes in here and talks of anyone who is supporting a carbon price as if they are somehow irresponsible. The irresponsible person in this House is the Leader of the Opposition, who is wrecking business certainty in this country not just by opposing a carbon price but by now saying to the people of Australia and to the international investment community he will repeal it if it is passed. That is a very substantial threat to investment in our community, and it is absolutely reckless for the Leader of the Opposition to make that statement and for the Liberal Party to talk about it in those terms. What we do know is that he will be giving to subsequent generations, if we do not act, an even bigger burden of paying the price for climate change. He is transferring the cost to subsequent generations, to our children and to our grandchildren. That is why we need to be brave now, why we need to be firm now: to put in place the arrangements that will assist in getting this in place, so they will benefit. The cost of inaction is far greater, far greater, than the action. This is not something that the Leader of the Opposition understands but it is something that the investment community understand. Our largest companies understand. They certainly understand that we have to become much more carbon efficient. What this requires in particular is investment in cleaner energy and of course renewable energy, particularly when it comes to our power sector. What appalled me in the comments from the Leader of the Opposition today was his ignorance of the fact that the failure to invest in that sector is what is driving electricity prices upward and that, if we do not deal with certainty of investment in that sector, they will go higher and higher, and",40
130,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is completely false. It is not remotely true.,42
131,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Flinders will resume his seat.,42
132,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"those opposite will be responsible for that. So this is a very important reform for Australia-on a par with floating the dollar, on a par with bringing down the tariff walls, on a par with introducing enterprise bargaining-because it goes to the very foundation of productivity and efficiency in our economy. That is where it goes. But we do not see any understanding of that. The Leader of the Opposition would rather be Prime Minister of a high-polluting, struggling economy. He would rather have an economy that was high polluting and struggling than one where the right decisions were taken for future generations. That is what he is effectively saying. He would rather see the country fail than see this government succeed in preparing us for the future. That is how irresponsible he has become. In addition, there is the way in which the Leader of the Opposition is characterising cost of what we have already done and how we are planning to put in place a price on carbon. That is important. Our plan charges polluters. It charges polluters so we can provide assistance to households and to industry. That is what it does. The plan that the Leader of the Opposition is outlining is to tax families so he can hand money to polluters. That is the difference. It is a clear, stark difference-not one that the Leader of the Opposition understands, but I know it is one that is understood across the back benches over there and of course on the front benches, because the member for Wentworth has put it very clearly. He had this to say on 8 February 2010 of such a plan: Having the government pick projects for subsidy is a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale, and there will always be a temptation for projects to be selected for their political appeal. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition wants the people of Australia to pay-and pay and pay. If they are going to get the emission reductions that are required, he will be spending a lot more than $10 billion. This is the crew that had a $10 billion costing con job in their costings for the last election, where the Treasury said they were so incompetent they could not even put together a budget. Of course, the opposition were warned about the approach that they are still articulating in the Treasury blue book. This is what the Treasury said to the coalition about their so-called direct action: Direct action measures alone cannot do the job without imposing significant economic and budget costs. That is what the Treasury advised the opposition. The other big lie we have had in this House from the Leader of the Opposition is to do with his use of the word ‘tax'. He runs around the place talking about carbon pricing as if it is a revenue-raising measure which is just going to some general government services. It is doing no such thing. All of the revenue, every cent, that comes from the carbon price will be going back to households, into industry and into climate change policies, as it should. It does not suit his three-word slogans, but that is where it is going. There will be a day of reckoning for those opposite when budget time comes around and they have to stump up one or two alternatives. It will be a real day of reckoning. Ms O'Dwyer-We cannot wait! Mr Frydenberg interjecting",42
133,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order!,43
134,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Then we had his ridiculous discussion of the MRRT. This is a mob,43
135,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The members for Higgins and Kooyong ought not to be interjecting from outside their seats.,43
136,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is a mob of people who, at a time when our mining companies have record profitability, some making super profits, have the view that the mining industry is paying too much tax. What planet do they live on? The mining industry is paying too much tax! So when we put in place a regime which picks up the resource rents and uses that money to cut corporate taxes, they oppose it. The once great Liberal Party have come to that. It is just unbelievable that they could oppose a revenue stream from a resource rent tax on the mining industry, particularly one which is going to assist the ings of people on low incomes, build infrastructure and give a corporate tax cut. ‘Oh, no, we can't have that. We should give the miners more money. They should pay less tax.' Nothing demonstrates more than that how incompetent and bizarre those opposite have become in the bitterness of their opposition. We also saw this kind of display when it came to the flood levy. Before then, there had never been a levy that Tony Abbott did not support. He supported six levies while the Howard government was in-never a levy he did not support. But then a levy came along that was for Queenslanders and Victorians, and he voted it down. It was a modest levy, far less than any other that he had voted for previously. Yet again, this demonstrates how irresponsible and reckless the Leader of the Opposition is. They have another big lie about tax. That mob opposite was the highest taxing government in Australian history. They got the tax to GDP share up to 24.1 per cent. The other lie is their pretence that a global recession never happened. They pretend it did not happen and talk about the fact that we should not have gone into deficit to fund the stimulus. But what if we had not done that? Where would Australia be today? Unemployment would be far higher. Tens of thousands of businesses would have hit the wall. We acted responsibly and, all the way through that, we got more of this opposition. They opposed us every step of the way, once again proving that they are simply not capable or up to the mark when it comes to modern economic management. When this country was threatened by recession, we put in place a worldclass stimulus which produced world-class results for Australia. The reason that unemployment at the moment is at five per cent is that the actions of this government put in place the correct economic policy to support savour economy at a time of need. And we were opposed every step of the way. We were opposed when we put in place the bank guarantees that were absolutely fundamental and we were opposed on the stimulus, because they are not up to handling the big challenges that Australia faces. All of that is surfacing in this very important debate. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition was talking about Treasury modelling as though somehow what we are doing now is absolutely identical to what was done in the CPRS. I do recommend reading the CPRS material-and he did use some of it-but we have not yet taken the decisions on coverage in this emissions trading scheme. So there is no way anybody could make the sorts of assertions they have been making about cost impacts. But there is one big difference between us and those on the other side of the House: we will provide the assistance to households that are affected. There is no plan for assistance by the opposition to provide for all of those people who are being hit by rising electricity prices right now. We will do the right thing by the people of Australia, the right thing by our economy in the long term and the right thing by our industry so that we can put in place the reforms which will produce the next generation of prosperity in this country and maximise all of the opportunities that should flow to this country from the mining boom. We will get the investment in renewable energy that is required. All of these things are essential decisions for Australia. They are the hard decisions and they are the decisions that the Liberal Party has not got the guts to take.",43
137,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The headlines last Friday said it all: ‘PM's broken promise will hit families hard: $300 TAX SLUG', and that is only the beginning of the new taxation regime this government is determined to impose upon the Australian people. But what is also fundamentally at stake in this debate is the credibility of the Prime Minister, the woman who leads this country, and the peonow ple who sit behind her. She said to the Australian people on 16 August 2010: There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. Was she telling the truth? Were the Australian people expected to believe her, on the eve of an election, when she said that there will be no carbon tax under the government she leads? Maybe I should put a good construction on this; maybe she was telling us the truth. Maybe when she announced the reversal of policy it was early advice of her resignation and she is no longer going to be the leader of the government. Or was she telling the Australian people, ‘Actually I do not lead this government at all; it is actually Bob Brown who is the leader of this government.' If anybody can remember the pictures in the Prime Minister's courtyard, when the Prime Minister came out surrounded by a bevy of Greens and Independents, Bob Brown shoved her away from the microphones so that he could make all of the key announcements. Maybe the Prime Minister is right: she does not lead this government and therefore she is free to break all of her promises. Indeed, wasn't it strange that the Treasurer was not in the Prime Minister's courtyard? It was completely taken over by Greens and Independents and there was no room for the Treasurer, even though the Prime Minister was announcing the biggest new tax in Australian history. The Treasurer was not even there to be involved with this big announcement. What is more, the gossip tells us that the Prime Minister did not even consult the cabinet about it before she made the announcement, let alone the zombies who have all disappeared from this chamber. They were not consulted either. The Prime Minister just said, ‘We're going to have this great big new tax.' With all of my attempts to excuse her I really cannot explain away why on 20 August, right on election eve, she said: I rule out a carbon tax. The Treasurer said similar things. He ruled it out; it was not going to happen. This government has not told the truth to the Australian people. Some people actually believed her when she said that there would be no carbon tax. The Commonwealth Bank's ACCI survey of business expectations says, ‘Eighty per cent of small business took her at her word and have not factored a carbon tax into their business plan.' When she said no, people said, ‘We believe no.' In fact, when she said no, was she already meaning yes, or have the Greens taken over and delivered this new tax to all Australians? What we need to be aware of with Labor's great big new carbon tax is that this is a tax on everything we do, every day of our lives. This great big new tax will add to the cost of every item on every shelf in every store. It will not just add to the cost of those will add to the cost of everything we do with those items. Indeed, it is designed to do that very thing. It is designed to make things so expensive that we do not do them anymore. We cannot afford to run our air conditioners, so we turn them off. We cannot afford to run our lights, so we live in darkness. That is the purpose of this tax-to change people's behaviour. The cost of things on the shelf will go up. The cost of petrol that we use to drive the goods home to our houses will go up. The cost of the refrigerator that we put our fruit and vegetables in will go up. The refrigerator itself will cost more. The electricity to run will cost more. When we cook the meal the stove will be more expensive. Electricity and gas will be more expensive. When we take the garbage to the dump, it will cost more. Transport, to cover the fill, will be more expensive. It will cost more to build your house in the first place, as it will cost more to build your roads and streets, install the services, operate the sewerage systems and the like. They will all cost more. Your car will cost more. Your bus fares will cost more. Your aeroplane fares will cost more. If you want to go somewhere, it will cost you more. Your holidays will cost more. Indeed, the Minister for Tourism is on the record as saying that a carbon tax would kill the aviation industry, both domestic and international. So he knows that this tax will be very damaging to the Australian people. Your birthday cake will cost more and your funeral will cost more. This is an invasive tax that you will pay again and again and again. It will multiply and cascade through the cost of everything that you buy. It is $300 for electricity now, and we know that this is a tax which is also designed to go up, up, up and up. The government intends to continue to collect more and more. We know that this items; it will tax everything that we do. There is another thing it will tax that ought to matter to all Australians: it will tax your job. It may well tax your job out of existence, because this government is designing a tax that will put an extra burden on the price of doing everything in Australia. It will be more costly to manufacture here. It will be more costly to visit this country. It will be more costly to grow food in this country. It will be more costly to do the things that we need to do to earn our way in the world. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency said on the ABC only yesterday that it was too early to tell how a carbon it price will affect farmers' costs. Yet if he had read the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics paper of August 2009 he would know that they estimated that the additional charges will cut a beef farmer's income by 13.6 per cent, dairying by 9.7 per cent, sheep by 11.4 per cent and wheat and other crops by 8.5 per cent. But if you move to manufacturing you get exactly the same story. We are told that shopkeepers expect that they will have to put up prices80 per cent said they will have to put up prices and 70 per cent said they will have to get rid of staff. That is the direct effect of Labor's great big new tax. Let us look at what Labor intends to do with the revenue it proposes to raise from this massive new tax. Firstly we are told everyone is going to get compensation. The government is going to give everybody compensation, or even make a large number of families better off, the Prime Minister said. Only Labor could believe that a new tax will make people better off. I have never seen a tax that makes people wealthy, but this government thinks it is going to do that. It is going to provide compensation to people, so why turn off the light bulb? Why make a change? Why save CO2 emissions if, in fact, you are going to get more than adequate compensation for every additional cost you have? There are no grounds for making the savings that the government wants us to make. So in reality the tax will not even work. It will not reduce CO2 emissions at all because the government intends to compensate people. Of course, we know that all will not be compensated and that most Australians will be worse off. The government also intend to spend some of this money on green programs, things like reducing CO2 emissions. Maybe they will have a new home insulation scheme. That is something they could spend it on-four dead, 200 homes burnt down, billions wasted. Maybe a new green loans fiasco-where millions have been spent training people but there are hardly any to be given. Or what about the green car fund? We could reinvent that-axed at the beginning of this year because it had not brought any new technology to our country in spite of the spending of tens of millions of dollars. And what about cash for clunkers? We have got the money now. We can afford to have cash for clunkers-axed before it even began. Now we will have a new tax to pay for this kind of nonsense. Labor cannot be trusted with $12 billion a year. So perhaps they could have a citizens assembly to decide how to spend the $12 billion. What we do know is that Labor will that waste this money. They intend to give $2 billion away, incidentally, to other countries to spend because they know they will waste it themselves. They have got more confidence that maybe Libya or Zimbabwe can spend it more wisely than they. This is in fact a tax that everyone will be paying. The Treasurer said today that some people are not paying enough tax. I do not think there is anyone that Labor thinks is not paying enough tax. What this will do is affect families.

This government has not been truthful and it should not be trusted to deliver compensation or any kind of program that will make a difference to our climate. (Time expired)",44
138,Mr DREYFUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (4.10 pm)Again we have heard from the opposition, from the Leader of the Opposition and from the Leader of the Nationals, the disgraceful scare campaign that we are going to hear more and more of. That is what has been promised over coming months from the opposition. Since last Thursday, since the announcement was made by the Prime Minister of the framework for the carbon price, all loans that we have had from the oppositionparticularly from the Leader of the Opposition and from the member for Flinders, and we have just heard a bit more of it from the Leader of the Nationals-is made-up figures, nonsense about what the carbon price scheme is going to be and taking quotes out of context, which is what we had from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in question time today. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting",46
139,Mr DREYFUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Only half of the quotation that was read by the Leader of the Opposition in fact was said by the Prime Minister. Ms Julie Bishop-It was a UN climate change document.,47
140,Mr DREYFUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition now mentions the false accusation that she made in question time based on a false story that appeared in the West Australian about the government's intentions in relation to contributions from Australia to any green climate fund, being the fund that was negotiated and is in the process of being established following the agreement reached at Cancun in December last year. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition well knows that the document she was quoting from was a United Nations document produced by a task group assembled by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in which a number of individuals participated. One of them was Bob MCMullan, not in his formal capacity as a parliamentary secretary because he had retired from that position and had retired from the parliament. I would ask for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, if she is going to raise this again, to actually read the document and to stop making false accusations about where funds will go. As I said, we have a disgraceful scare campaign by all of the opposition members who have spoken thus far today and, indeed, since Thursday. It consists of making up figures, taking quotes out of context and failing to recognise that what has been announced is the framework for the carbon price-in other words, the mechanism. It is what has thus far been discussed, and agreement has been reached on, by the multi-party Climate Change Committee. We know on this side of the House that a carbon price will cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy. We know on this side of the House that a carbon price is the cheapest and fairest way to reduce pollution and invest in clean energy. And as a Labor government we will always support those who need help to meet an increase in their cost of living, especially pensioners and especially the most vulnerable. We have announced that a carbon price could start, if agreement on all of the details is reached and legislation is passed, by 1 July 2012. We have announced that the mechanism that we favour, and that some level of agreement has been reached on in the multiparty Climate Change Committee, is a market mechanism commencing with a fixed price for a specified period of three to five years. The clear intent is that, following this fixed price period, there will be a smooth transition to an emissions trading scheme. As the opposition well knows, although you would not know it from the scare campaign that they have mounted, detailed issues including the starting price, the length of the fixed price period, and assistance arrangements for households, communities and industries are to be dealt with in subsequent discussions. We have had, from the opposition, no recognition of the state of the parliament, no recognition of the fact that, for every single piece of legislation that comes before this House-and indeed through the Senatethere needs to be negotiation of the terms of the legislation and agreement reached for the legislation to get passage. The way in which the government has proceeded since the election is to work through a process of negotiation and agreement on a carbon price mechanism, which will be the subject of legislation. In that way, there will be certainty for business and for the Australian community. The opposition would recognise that if they were concerned about economic matters at all. It is patently obvious that they are not; it is patently obvious that all the opposition is interested in is drumming up fear and confusion about what role a carbon price is going to play in the Australian economy and about the need for a carbon price to push the Australian economy in the direction it needs to go-the direction of becoming a lowcarbon economy. The Leader of the Opposition has continued to make up numbers-he has massive form for making up the numbers on the back of a cigarette packet and spruiking them as fact. In the wake of the election campaign, honourable members will remember, we saw a gaping black hole in the coalition's election costings of some $11 billion. With a little bit of smoke and a few strategically placed mirrors, they summoned it from nowhere. You would think that, after having an $11 billion hole in your costings, and with that sort of thing having happened in the past, you might have learnt something, but not the Leader of the Opposition. He again rolled out the smoke machine at a petrol pump in Western Sydney-you can expect him at petrol pumps near you!-and, another media photo opportunity, at a bus depot in Queanbeyan, which the Sydney Morning Herald described in these terms: Abbott donned a fluoro safety vest. He filled the petrol tank of a bus. He back-slapped workers (one of whom called him ‘‘ Mr Costello''. Awkward.) It is awkward, because the Leader of the Opposition is not Peter Costello. The Leader of the Opposition entirely lacks the economic credibility of Peter Costello-he has none. He demonstrates it every time he opens his mouth on the subject. Imagine the surprise of the lucky drivers on Sunday, who had the Leader of the Opposition leaning into their car windows, petrol pump in hand and cameras in tow, telling them that they would pay exactly 6.5c extra per litre at the bowser. Today's effort was at the Queanbeyan fruit shop; the Leader of the Opposition seems to think he is back on the campaign trail. The AAP reported: At the Queanbeyan fruit shop, Mr Abbott brushed aside the idea of an assistance package for households, saying: ‘It sort of defeats the purpose of making everything more expensive and it creates this giant money-go-round'. That is showing how little Mr Abbott grasps of economics-that is the sort of incredible economics we are getting from the Leader of the Opposition. As any of the people in this parliament involved in the serious negotiations on the carbon price mechanism could tell him, we have not set out what the carbon price is going to be-nor have we set out what the level of assistance is going to be. Ms Julie Bishop-Why did you announce it?",47
141,Mr DREYFUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is interjecting again, asking why we announced it. As the Prime Minister made clear, we announced the progress that has been made in the negotiations that are taking place in the multi-party Climate Change Committee.

But, no, the Leader of the Opposition and some others in the opposition-not all of them; there are massive divisions in the Liberal Party on this-are back on the campaign trail. They are not interested in debating issues of public policy, discussing how we can build Australia's economy and making the big decisions for the future of this country. (Time expired)",48
144,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter of public importance today, at its heart, is about jobs. The coalition is fighting for tens of thousands of Australian jobs. The Prime Minister is interested in only one job, and that is her own. The Prime Minister was a lawyer in another life. Before she became the ‘Prime Misleader' of this nation she was a lawyer in training and practice. This Prime Minister knows what it is like for people to be on trial. When she said in this place, in her own words, that there should be a standard for honesty in public life, she invoked her legal background. She said: If the minister had been a businessman and offered a promise like that and not kept it, he would have been sued. If the minister had been in a court of law and made a statement like that and it turned out not to be true, he would have been tried for perjury. If the minister had been in a church and made a statement like that and it turned out not to be true, the congregation would have known that he had broken the ninth commandment. I do not see why the standard should be different in business, should be different in churches or should be different in courts from the standard in public life. If anything, the standard public life should be higher. Do you know what this Prime Minister did on that occasion? She called for the resignation of a minister because she said he said one thing before the election and another after. Members of this House, the Prime Minister is on trial. She is on trial in the court of public opinion. Specifically, it is the integrity of the Prime Minister and the character of this Prime Minister that is on trial. As the Prime Minister said on this occasion to the House: This minister went to the Australian electorate before the last election and gave his word, and he did not keep it. ‘The minister should resign' were the words of the Prime Minister. On the fundamental question, ‘Did this Prime Minister lie to the Australian people at the last election over a carbon tax?' is she guilty or not guilty? Opposition members-Guilty! Mr Truss-Guilty as charged.",49
145,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The people in the electorates around Australia are saying this Prime Minister is guilty of misleading the Australian people in a most fundamental and significant way. If the Prime Minister wanted to claim a shred of integrity, she would take her carbon tax to the Australian people, let them exercise their democratic right and let them judge her on her honesty and on her integrity, because she gave a solemn promise at the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. By now, the Prime Minister's promise, on the eve of the election, that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led is indelibly imprinted in the minds of all Australians. But the Prime Minister misled the country in yet another respect. She promised, when she gave a major climate change speech, that she would not take action on climate change in until she had built community consensus. Let me spell this out in case anybody on the other side missed it. The Prime Minister now claims that she spent the whole of the election campaign arguing for a carbon price. Oh no, she did not! I have gone back to the speech that this Prime Minister gave when she launched the government's climate change policy and it shows there are even greater levels of deceit than we had realised. The Prime Minister gave a speech in July to launch-wait for it-‘Moving forward together on climate change'. This is the speech that promised the now defunct citizens assembly, which was the first broken promise of the post election Labor-Greens government. It is a speech worth reading in detail as it is somewhat different-I say, diplomatically-from her current argument that she made it abundantly clear before the election that she would implement a carbon price after the election. It is worth noting that her only reference to ‘carbon' and ‘price' in over 4,700 words was in just one sentence. There is no mention of a carbon tax, but in one sentence she said: Adopting a market based mechanism to price carbon will transform the way we live and the way we work. Such a major change cannot be made and unmade on the oscillations of the political pendulum. Obviously, this has nothing to do with the carbon tax that she now seeks to introduce, but it is referring, in a loose kind of way, to some sort of emissions trading scheme. But this is the critical point: the Labor policy to not proceed with an emissions trading scheme or any other such mechanism without creating bipartisan consensus first. So the various statements she made in that speech that day include-and I will read them into Hansard: We need national consensus on this vital, long term issue of national interest. We need consensus among political parties. But we need consensus in the community even more. When that community recognition and support existsMs Marino-When.",49
146,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Prime Minister said ‘When': it means that a choice by a political party to reverse bipartisan support would not destroy the consensus. Instead the consensus would remain and the political party would be repudiated by the Australian people. She went on-there is more: In my view, consensus on this issue should not depend solely on a fragile agreement between political parties. … … … … this transformational change must have as its foundation the genuine political support of the community, a consensus that will drive bipartisanship. Listen to this statement by the Prime Minister: And if I am wrong, and that group of Australiansthe citizens assemblyis not persuaded of the case for change then that should be a clear warning bell that our community has not been persuaded … as required about the need for transformational change. What is absolutely crystal clear is that the Labor election policy-Labor's solemn promise-was not to proceed with action on climate change, not to proceed with an emiswas sions trading scheme or anything like it without bipartisan and community consensus. And then, on top of that, the Prime Minister promised there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. This was the Prime Minister before the election. Yet the Prime Minister throughout the community consensus dropped what has become another stinker of a policy, a citizens assembly, and she did her secret deal with the Greens. The Prime Minister has no community consensus, the Prime Minister has no bipartisan support, the Prime Minister has no mandate, the Prime Minister has no credibility on this issue and the Prime Minister's integrity is in tatters. The coalition will abolish this carbon tax if we are elected. As for the carbon tax and the impact on the economy, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Peter Anderson, said this: … is a blow for the competitiveness of Australian business, especially small and medium sized enterprises. … … … The extra lead in the saddlebags of Australian business will not reduce overall global emissions, nor will it help save the jobs that will be exported offshore to countries without a carbon scheme. I think these are rather interesting headlines from today's Australian: ‘Abbot vows to scrap tax' and in the line underneath, ‘Labor loses key carbon supporter'. For those who did not see the front page of the Australian today let me read a little from this article. It says: Tony Abbott has vowed to scrap Julia Gillard's carbon tax and demanded she seek a mandate for the plan as Labor's closest business adviser, Heather Ridout, refused to back the Prime Minister's package. The article goes on about Julia Gillard being a fraud and then it says: … Ms Ridout, the Australian Industry Group chief executive, last night declined to back Ms Gillard's proposal to introduce a fixed carbon price from July 1 next year and an emissions trading scheme three to five years later. “The jury is very much still out on the introduction of a carbon price in Australia, with industry very concerned about the competitive impacts,” Ms Ridout said. “In this regard, all options should still be on the table, including that of rollback until the final shape of the government's proposal is clear.” The article further quoted Ms Ridout: “While certainty is important for decision-making around major long-term investments, this certainty should not come at the cost of a loss of competitiveness that sends jobs and emissions offshore or risks the continuity of energy supply.” This government stands condemned for misleading the Australian public. For trying to take away Australian jobs this government stands condemned.",50
147,Ms BIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I rise to speak on the matter of public importance before the House. Mr Truss-The coalminers will be pleased!,51
148,Ms BIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"With great pleasure I do so. As I come from five generations of coalminers I have great pleasure in supporting the government in its actions to introduce a price for carbon into our economy. It may well interest those opposite that the previous member for Throsby, Jennie George, the current member for Throsby, Stephen Jones, and I worked closely with our community through the various issues in terms of pricing carbon, and we were returned with increased majorities at the last election, you will be very pleased to know!",51
149,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,51
150,Ms BIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I say to those opposite that they might want to settle down a little bit. Perhaps they are interested in generating their own levels of carbon with the heat and light they are creating in this debate but the words in today's Illawarra Mercury from Mr Andy Gillespie, the AWU organiser in the area, should be heard well by those opposite. He says. The scaremongering over the effects of a carbon price should stop. If those opposite were genuinely interested in the well-being and future of an economy like mine in the Illawarra I would encourage them to contribute by having an informed and calm debate about this policy issue, which is of national significance, rather than engaging in the scaremongering that they are running in communities, including communities such as mine and the member for Throsby's. This has been an issue that has been confronting this nation for several years now. It is a difficult issue. It is jor reform for your economy. It is never easy, and it should be the subject of an intense debate in this place and in this nation. It may surprise those opposite that we would welcome that. We would welcome a proper debate on this issue but we are not getting it. There are enough of those who sit opposite who understand economic reform and who believe that the point that I am making is absolutely correct. I think we saw that on display last night on the television. We need a debate about the future of this nation as we transform to confront a carbon constrained future and work out how to ride the back of that to grow this economy into the opportunities that can exist for us into the future. In the Illawarra we know the challenge. We live it. We are at the forefront of every economic reform, and we come out stronger and more diversified. Mr Fitzgibbon-It is also true of the Hunter.",51
151,Ms BIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is also true of the Hunter, as my colleague indicates. We come out stronger not because we run around like Chicken Little waving our hands and saying, ‘The sky's gonna fall in' and ‘How can we make people afraid of reform?' The members of the great party of economic reform on the other side should hang their heads in shame about the standard of debate they are putting up in this case. We come out stronger because we rise to the challenge. We have been doing that for several years now in our region. Together with Jennie George, the former member for Throsby, I have worked closely with existing traditional industries including the companies-such as BlueScope Steel Australiaand their workforces and representatives. Along with Stephen Jones I will continue to do so. We work closely with our coal industry. We also work closely with our diversia challenge to do mafied economy. The reality is that the RDA Illawarra has been working for a number of years now on a Green Jobs Illawarra program which looks, for example, at the opportunities for windmill creation on the back of our steel industry. We understand the capacity for transformation in addressing and dealing with the challenges of a carbon constrained economy and we want to get on the back of the opportunities that that creates. We want to build jobs for the future so the kids of our region have really good, long-term, sustainable jobs in manufacturing, in the mining industry and more broadly in research and development, tourism and education-all of the areas where we have built on our existing strengths to diversify our economy. The great disappointment in the whole debate has been the fact that there are some among those opposite who are capable of engaging in an informed debate about the mechanisms by which we should address the challenge confronting us. They have the knowledge and understanding about reform agendas and how to drive them. They may have some legitimate issues that they want to raise with us about the ways in which we are doing that but they are silent. They are not being heard. They are not being heard because they have a leader driving their agenda and driving their party on the basis of scaremongering and looking for the lowest common denominator: ‘Don't look at the national interest; only look at what is going to get us a bit of a poll increase in the immediate future. Find or grab whatever you can in order to create fear, uncertainty. Distract the community from dealing with the very real challenges that confront us.' That is the great shame in the whole debate that we are having in this nation. I can only hope that more members-like the member for Wentworth last night-come out and engage in a debate that is actually about the national interest. Sitting opposite are members of a oncegreat party of economic reform. It was a party that believed in the capacity of the market to drive real growth and opportunity into the future. Over many decades we have engaged, across the chamber, on the details and processes of those sorts of reforms. We should be doing that now, and we are not. What we are dealing with is a Leader of the Opposition who has had so many different positions on climate change that it is most impossible for me to enumerate them in the 10 minutes I have available to me today. He has said himself that his position is predipeople cated on wherever he sees the political advantage on that day-it is not even that week, or that month, or that year, it is that day; it changes as regularly as that. The question for those of us engaged in this important national debate is: how on earth do you debate somebody who moves their position around constantly and, in an even greater disappointment, moves the party around in the same way? I am sure there are people sitting on the opposite side who actually understand that this is an important nomic reform debate and have something they can contribute to that. I do not presume that contribution to be agreement with us, but I presume they would have something of value to add to the debate. But they are gagged and silent-and more shame to them. This is a generational reform debate. This is about communities like mine in the Illawarra. The international community is moving towards addressing and dealing with the carbon challenge that we have internationally. There are countries that are moving to address those forms of pollution in their own economies. We will confront the reality of their decisions in the future and we will have to deal with them. There are countries in the European Community that are jumping on board. President Obama recently said about his own community that here is an opportunity. How do we get in there and develop businesses and industries and innovations in our own economies that are going to allow us to be the world leaders into the future and build wealth for our own people and our own nation into the future on the back of this reform? But what are we doing in Australia? We are a country that has driven so much innoal- vation. Why do we say that we punch above our weight in this nation? I will tell you why. It is because we have researchers and tradeswho have capacity to lead the world in innovation and adaptation. That is what we are so good at. That is why we punch above our weight. They deserve a government that supports that. They deserve a government that is driving that agenda. They deserve a government that is interested in long-term economic reform and building future wealth. That is what this government is all about. That is what this debate should be about. That is what the responsibility of every member of this House is about. That is eco- what our commitment and responsibility to our communities and our nation is about. Those opposite are failing this nation abysmally in the standard of their contribution to this debate. You could forgive that if you assumed that, at the end of the day, that is the best capacity they have got. You could forgive that if you looked around the ranks and thought: ‘It is a pretty poor standard and there's a failure of debate and a failure of national commitment, but they are really not able to do anything else anyway. This is the level of their capacity and ability.' But that is not the case, and those opposite know it. I challenge them to rise above the scaremongering lowest-common-denominator politically expedient debate of their leader on a nationally important issue and rise to the challenge of having the debate that we need to have in this nation. (Time expired)",52
152,Mr BANDT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is worth reflecting on why we are even having this debate. We are having this debate because the scientists have told us with certainty that the planet is heating up. The last decade, from 2000 to 2010, was the hottest on record. We also know, with as near to certainty as one can get on questions as complex as the planet's weather system, that humans are contributing to it and that there is a tipping point not far away from us, after which we will not be able to predict the effects of runaway climate change. But we do know that in some sense the effects are going to be potentially catastrophic. In the same way that we would not get on a plane if it had a 50 per cent, a 20 per cent or even a 10 per cent chance of crashing, it is incumbent on us now to manage the risk we know is there that we might exceed that climate change tipping point. What do the scientists, especially Professor Will Steffen from the ANU, tell us about how close we are getting to that tipping point? They are telling us that, as a planet, we have a carbon budget that we can spend between 2000 and 2050 to give us a 70 per cent chance of staying under that tipping point. They have also told us that, in the 10 years of that 50 years, we have spent 30 per cent of that budget and, if we keep on going the way we are going, within a couple of decades we will put ourselves at risk of exceeding the climate change tipping point, after which we do not know what the effects will be. Feedback loops will increase. As Arctic Sea ice starts to melt and exposes more of the dark surface of the sea, the process will speed up. We know that the same feedback loops are likely to occur elsewhere in the Arctic. As more ice melts, the permafrost is exposed, more methane is released into the atmosphere and the process speeds up. It is this guardrail that we have to avoidand at Copenhagen all the leaders from all around the world committed to staying below it-and firmly keep in mind when we are having this debate. This is not about whether something that was announced as a scheme by one party during an election amounts to a tax. It is not about the confected outrage from the party that invented the distinction between core promises and non-core promises in terms of whether a statement is being met. It is about what we are going to do to address the looming climate emergency. In that context it comes as no surpriseand indeed it was the hot topic during my election in Melbourne-that there are distinctions between the Greens and the Labor Party on the question of how best to deal with climate change. For example, despite the confected outrage from the opposition, I note that the coalition and Labor are in agreement that all we need is five per cent pollution reduction targets by 2020. That is nowhere near the range that has been recommended by scientists and by the Bali roadmap, which says we need to be looking at 25 to 40 per cent. We will also continue to say to the Labor Party and the Labor govfirst ernment that, just as the market has never built a single piece of infrastructure in this country that has lasted the country, we are also going to need significant government investment to make sure that the renewable energy grid is up to speed, a feed-in tariff that will encourage a solar and large-scale renewable energy industry in this country, and continue to find appropriate amounts of money for research and development. But despite those differences the occasion is on us and this parliament gives us the opportunity to start to find areas of common ground. One thing that is absolutely clear and that the Greens stand very firmly on is that putting a price tag on pollution is sential element if we are to tackle climate change. Without doing that, none of the other measures will have enough effect. We need to put a real price tag on pollution. Part of that means having an honest debate about what it means to put a price tag on pollution. Not a misleading debate, but an honest debate. What it means is this: up until now, we have treated the atmosphere as if we could put as much pollution into it as we would like without consequences. Big polluters have continued, and still do continue, to put carbon dioxide and other polluting gases into the atmosphere and imagine that it has no consequences and pay no cost for the privilege of doing it. We have dealt with this problem as a community before when companies used to pollute rivers, and we said, ‘Although it might save the company a bit of money, it has a detriment to the community so we are going to do something about it.' Now, by putting a price tag on pollution, we will do the same with carbon dioxide and other polluting gases. We will say that those big polluters, if they are going to put pollution into the atmosphere, must pay for doing so and they must do so in order to reduce the amount that is going in there so that we stay below that guard rail. If they choose to pass some of that cost on to consumers, then consumers will be compensated for it from the revenue that is raised,. But overall it will have the effect of driving Australia's transition to a renewable energy economy-an economy that has an enormous number of clean energy jobs, the kind of jobs that can set Australia up for the 21st century. The Climate Institute recently said that with a $45 a tonne carbon price there will be 8,000 permanent jobs and 26,000 temporary jobs created as we move Australia to that clean energy future. But we do not have a rational debate about that; we have a debate an esthat is reduced to cheap political pointscoring about lies or not lies. And we have a manufactured scare campaign, the likes of which we have seen many times before. We have seen it from big tobacco and we have seen it from the big mining companies. Just as the big mining companies and the ‘Rolex revolutionaries' took to the streets of Perth in their billionaire protest, so too are we going to see the big polluters pretend to be proletarians again over the next few month. They will no doubt take to the streets, arm in arm with the radio talk-show hosts and the opposition, as they seek to confect outrage. The Leader of the Opposition has come out swinging on this as hard as one could imagine, but as every prize fighter knows, you have to be aware of the rope-a-dope. You have to be aware of punching yourself out too early and getting to the point where your warnings become increasingly shrill. That is what is going to happen over the coming years. Certainly in my electorate of Melbourne and right across the country-and especially amongst our young people, who read the science and understand the threat that is coming to them, that they are experiencing now, and that they will have to deal with in their lifetime-people understand that we need to take urgent action and that Australia needs to do its fair share to commit to the global effort to combating climate change. There is growing support. I am confident that, once the Australian public has the science in front of them, understands that low-income earners and households are going to be compensated, and that this is going to have the effect of making Australia's 21st century economy a clean-energy, renewableenergy-jobs economy, there will be support for this. In the same way that there was howling from the rooftops that the flood levy was going to be the end of this government and how could anyone support it-no-one talks about that any more-yet that seems to have sailed through, so too will this be in place. If we can reach an agreement for an environmentally and economically effective outcome, this will be in place and people in Australia will see that the opposition is full of so much hot air on this question. The opposition has made this about a number of questions-about integrity, about truth and about what was said-but there is one question that the opposition has not addressed, and that is: what if the mainstream science is right? What if the science is right and in 20 years time people are reading the Hansard of this debate and looking back at the opposition's contribution to the single greatest issue facing our planet at the moment and realise that it was not about putting an alternative plan about how we are going to get Australia on the road to a clean energy economy but it was one about cheap political point-scoring. They may not have realised it yet, but the debate is moving on. And as I said-and I will conclude on this-many people, especially young people, in my electorate come to me every day and they say: ‘We've been taught the science at school. We understand that we only have 10, 20 or 30 years to act. Why aren't we doing it? Why are there still people who even want to debate whether the science is real? Why aren't we getting on with it?' It is that tide of history that is ing and is going to sweep the opposition away, and there are many on the opposition benches who know it.",54

155,Mr BOWEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-On 18 October last year, the Prime Minister and I announced that the government would move the majority of children and vulnerable family groups out of immigration detention facilities and into community-based accommodation by June this year. This was an important announcement and I want to update the House on its implementation. Let me say at the outset that the government will be meeting this commitment. Through to the end of June, there will be carefully managed movement of several hundred people into residential arrangements. Since October, my department has been managing the expansion of the community detention program, with my advisory Council for Immigration Services and Status Resolution (CISSR) working closely with them to support this process. I want to thank  and the other members of the council for movtheir invaluable assistance as we implement what is an ambitious program. I would also like to thank the Australian Red Cross and Life Without Barriers, who have been working intensively with the government to source suitable accommodation for the minors and families released into the community, as well as appropriate carers and case managers, particularly for unaccompanied minors. I would also particularly like to thank the CEO of Red Cross Australia, Robert Tickner, for his support for this initianey, tive and his assistance in ensuring that the Red Cross has been able to devote the appropriate resources to this undertaking. We need to make sure that a comprehensive and people-focused care plan is prepared for all people placed into the community to ensure that appropriate services and support arrangements are in place for each person. We need to ensure that appropriate health and support services are available and we need to ensure that they have access to schools and other education services, such as English language classes. This sometimes takes a little bit of time but we are making progress. Since our announcement in October, 268 people have been approved for release into the community. This includes almost all of the male unaccompanied minors who are under 15 years old and all but one recently arrived female unaccompanied minor. The focus at this stage is on the youngest unaccompanied minors and families with young children, single-parent families, families with pregnant women and other particularly vulnerable families. As we work through these groups, the priority will be extended to older unaccompanied minors and other family groups. A great deal of preparatory work has been done to set a sound platform for this program. A reference group has been formed, including representatives of faith-based, notfor-profit and welfare agencies, the Australian Red Cross, Life Without Barriers, members of CISSR, senior departmental officers and a representative of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. This group is providing ongoing advice about the development and implementation of the program. Roundtable meetings with key stakeholders and potential partners have been held in Melbourne, SydAdelaide, Perth, Brisbane and Hobart, enabling more detailed discussions about the ongoing implementation of this undertaking. A number of organisations have been engaged by the Australian Red Cross through an expression of interest process to provide services to support the expansion, and this process continues. These organisations are providing high-quality expert services to support families and unaccompanied minors in the community. The location of community-based accommodation is largely driven by the availability of appropriate housing, while regional and rural locations may be used depending on the availability of other services. Public housing will not be used. Housing is being sourced through faith-based, not-for-profit and welfare agencies and other nongovernment organisations. Some of this housing is currently unused or is being used for another purpose, such as office space. Market rent will be paid for properties housing people in residential determination arrangements. I update the House on this because of the significant community interest in the release of children from detention. This is a controversial and emotive issue. When the Prime Minister and I announced this measure, an Essential poll, for example, found that 53 per cent of people disapproved of the government's decision to move children and their families out of immigration detention centres. Only 33 per cent approved. We clearly did not do this because it was popular. We did this because it is the right thing to do. Whatever one's views about asylum seekers, I would hope the House would agree that we have a special duty of care to children. It is well known that I believe, and the government believes, there needs to be an international solution to break the people smugglers' business model. But, while children's refugee claims are being processed in Australia, they should be treated with care. Regardless of whether they are recognised as genuine refugees or returned to their homeland after consideration of their claims, they should be given the chance to learn and grow while they are here. In this vein, I call on the opposition to support the removal of children from detention facilities-something they have not done since this decision was announced on 18 October. In recent weeks, more Australians have seen the human face behind the issue of children in detention facilities. Perhaps, if another poll were held today, the figures I shared with the House earlier in relation to public support for the removal of children from detention facilities would be different. However, this is not a matter of political popularity-it is a matter of providing appropriate care for vulnerable people. The government will meet its commitment to remove the majority of children from detention by June. I will provide the House with further updates as we approach the end of June and also beyond that date. We will meet this commitment because it is the only responsible thing to do. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Cook to speak for five minutes. Leave granted.",56
156,Mr BOWEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Cook speaking in reply to my statement for a period not exceeding five minutes. Question agreed to.,58
157,Mr MORRISON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I join the minister in acknowledging those working with the department to implement the residence determination orders for the 268 individuals who, the minister has advised, have been subject to these decisions.  respected and long-time adviser to governments on these difficult issues over many years. In October last year the minister announced his intention to use the residence determination powers established by the Howard government to release children into the community. That is what those laws are for. Those laws are coalition policy and are the legacy of the Howard government's management of these difficult issues. These powers have been available to this government from the day they were elected. It is they who chose to wait three years before using them. In November 2007, the Howard legacy also included the fact that there were just 21 children in the detention network-15 of them in the community and the other six in alternative detention arrangements. There were none on Christmas Island. The grand total of people in the detention network who had arrived illegally by boat when the Howard Government left office in November 2007 was four. Today that same figure is a record 6,382, and there is a record 1,027 children in the detention network. In June 2005, the Howard government removed children and families from formal detention. No child has been held behind razor wire since. I note that the Prime Minister sought to deceitfully appropriate these changes to her own government last year. It seems she was being as economical with the truth on that occasion as she has more recently been with her decision to introduce a carbon tax. When the Howard government announced that children would be released into the community in June 2005 there were just 59 children in the detention network. Six weeks later they had all been released into the community. When the minister made his announcement last October to use the Howard government's residence determination powers to put children into the community, there were 752 children in the detention network and only 10 of those children had been placed in the community. The other 742 were in places like the Asti Motel, Port Augusta and, of course, Christmas Island. Four months after this announcement, the minister advised today that 268 people have been subject to residence determination orders. What he did not say is what he said last Monday an interview-that only 120 have actually been released into the community. The minister spoke today about the special duty of care we owe to children. I have no doubt about the minister's personal commitment and sincerity to that duty, and I share his commitment. The challenge, though, for the government is to explain why it took so long for the government to exercise the resigraceful dence determination powers available to it under the act that were established and ised by the Howard government. Why would we oppose the government's use of such powers when we created them? By contrast, between November 2007 and October 2010, on Labor's watch the number of children in the community fell from 15 to 10, while the number of children in the work rose from 21 to 752. Why did it take the government so long to act? Since making their decision in October, another 275 children have entered the network after turning up on boats. Under the government's failed policies we now have more than 1,000 children in the network who have come here by boat. There is nothing compassionate about that. The government will use the Howard government's powers to place children in the community but refuses to restore the Howard government's powers and policies that stopped children getting on these boats. Our detention network is in crisis. This is a product of failed policy. The government has rolled back a successful border protection regime that reduced the number of people coming on boats to fewer than 300 people over six years. We have had more people turn up on boats in the last two months, including more than 100 last Saturday, than in the six years after the Pacific solution was introduced. Is it any wonder this government has sought an additional $290 million in opin erating expenses for asylum seeker management this year, more than what it cost to run the Pacific solution for almost six years? Under Labor's failed policies, more than 200 boats, carrying more than 10,000 people, have arrived, including the ill-fated SIEV36 that was set alight and SIEV221 that tragically crashed against the rocks at Christmas Island last December. And there was the disasylum freeze policy introduced by the government to deny refugee assessments utilto Afghan and Sri Lankan asylum seekers. That side of the House is the only political party and government that has introduced, while I have been in this House, a discriminatory immigration policy in this country. This asylum freeze resulted in 500 more children in the detention network and a dounet- bling of those in detention. The government's asylum policy is in crisis, yet it remains in denial and unrepentant of its failures. If the government wants to look after children, then my message is simple: stop pursuing these policies that have encouraged more than 1,000 children to get on boats. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",58
158,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Wentworth's private members' business notice relating to the disallowance of the Public Works Committee Amendment Regulations 2010 (No. 1), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2010 No. 173 and made under the Public Works Committee Act 1969, being called on immediately. I do not intend to speak at length to this suspension motion. This will facilitate the member for Wentworth moving his motion and then I will respond with the reasons why the government will not support his motion-because we believe it is just another tactic to delay the National Broadband Network rollout. Question agreed to. NA NA 2010 (No. 1) Disallowance Motion",59
159,Mr TURNBULL,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,"I move: That the Public Works Committee Amendment Regulations 2010 (No. 1), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2010 No. 173, and made under the Public Works Committee Act 1969, be disallowed. Mr Albanese-Can you tell us the detail of what that means?",60
160,Mr TURNBULL,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,"See if you can repeat it. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport is enjoying a little bit of mirth because of all of the details in this motion, but at the heart of this is a very grave matter of accountability. The government says that we want to delay the National Broadband Network, that we want to frustrate the NBN. There is nobody in this House more committed to the universal availability of affordable fast broadband in Australia than I am. The coalition is as committed as the government is to the speedy availability, where it is not currently available, of fast broadband on an affordable basis. The object of the policy is completely bipartisan. There is no material disagreement between us on this point. The issue, however, is simply the fundamental one which I come back to again and againand I fear I will come back to again in the future-and that is financial responsibility and accountability. When this government came into office in 2007, it said that it would not undertake or fund any major public infrastructure project without a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. What does a cost-benefit analysis involve? Let us just reflect on that for a moment. A cost-benefit analysis in this context means no more than this: identifying your objectiveand for this purpose, all Australians should have fast broadband at an affordable price. That is the objective. The cost-benefit analysis seeks to identify the most cost-effective way of achieving that, stacking the various options up against one another and working out the one that delivers the service most expeditiously and at the least cost to the taxpayer. It is no more than fundamental, basic common sense. So when the government came in and made that commitment to doing a cost-benefit analysis on major infrastructure projects, it was widely welcomed. They established a specialist body, Infrastructure Australia, an expert body with distinguished people from the private sector on it, and the public sector, I might add, with the express role of identifying major infrastructure projects around Australia, prioritising them, and performing cost-benefit analyses. If the honourable members have regard to Infrastructure Australia's website, they will see there that they have their whole cost benefit analysis set out. It is very detailed and very careful. That is all, in a nutshell, we have asked the government to do. We are not trying to get into an argument about this technology or that technology-you can make all of those cases and people will take different views. The truth is that broadband in the future will be delivered, just as it is today, over a variety of technological platforms depending on the needs of the particular user, their location and the applications they are deploying. The real issue is: what do we need to do to deliver this objective-fast broadband for all Australians-and how do we do it at the least cost to the taxpayer? That is the fundamental question. You would think that a government that came to office with the policy of doing a cost-benefit analysis for any major infrastructure project would not hesitate to do one for what is the largest public infrastructure project in Australia's history. We are not ing about small change here. The total expenditure by the government on this project will be $50 billion. How much of that is netted off by revenue will depend on the performance of the network. Needless to say, the company's business case, insofar as we have seen it, is based on some very optimistic assumptions. I say without any criticism of Mr Quigley or the staff of the NBN that all of us are familiar with the melancholy experience of commercial life, that every business that goes bankrupt began with a highly optimistic business plan. None of them started off with a business plan that said that they were going to go broke. They all said they were going to go gangbusters. Sadly, all too often, they do not. This involves a huge expenditure and huge risk on the part of the Commonwealth, so a cost benefit analysis is thoroughly appropriate. We have argued that that should be undertaken by the Productivity Commission. That would be very well employed to do it, but if the government was prepared to have Infrastructure Australia do the work, I am sure that they could do it with equal or comparable effectiveness. When the minister gets up to speak in a moment he will take half a paragraph out of an Infrastructure Australia report in which the members of Infrastructure Australia, I think you could say, genuflected respectfully in the general direction of the idea of a national broadband network without actually giving any opinion on the cost-effectiveness of this particular proposal. The government have never been able to answer the challenge of their failure to do this work other than to accuse the opposition of being Luddites or opposed to technology or addicted to wireless or stuck in the dial-up era, or some other curious slur to sling against us. That failure to undertake that work leaves this parliament in a very, very difficult position. We are literally going into talk- a huge investment almost blindfolded. As parliamentarians we do not know, we do not have the information to know, whether this is the most cost-effective way of undertaking this exercise. We do not know whether there are better alternatives. We all have views on that-some of us have views that are more informed than others-but we do not have an authoritative objective, a rigorous study that identifies what those alternatives are. Yet they are spending more money on this project than our country has on any other infrastructure project in our history and we are doing that at a time when there are huge claims on our government and our governments for investment in public infrastructure. We are just about, it would seem, to raise a $1.8 billion levy to fund infrastructure for flood reconstruction. If money is so short that we need a levy to raise $1.8 billion, why are we spending $50 million without a cost benefit analysis? We know that there are substantial existing telecommunications assets in the ground, presently working and with many years of life ahead of them, which can deliver fast broadband on a fixed line platform to Australian homes. Indeed, even if you buy the rather spurious proposition that the entire copper customer access network is defunct or out of date and rendered obsolete, the HFC network passes 30 per cent of Australian households and that can be used for fast broadband at speeds equal to, if not greater than, those promised by the NBN. These are all the critical issues that need to be examined. While the government can choose not to refer it to the Productivity Commission for a cost-benefit analysis, in the normal course of events this project would come before the Public Works Committee. The Public Works Committee is a committee of this parliament established 100 years ago to oversee reckless government spending on public works. The objects of the Public Works Committee Act are, for example, to enable better decisions about major projects, given that large projects have financial, social and environmental impacts on local areas and the community at large, and to provide objective scrutiny of the various different options for delivering a project. I grant you, the Public Works Committee is unlikely to be able to do as rigorous a job of cost-benefit analysis on the NBN as the Productivity Commission could, although it could seek expert advice and conceivably could ask the Productivity Commission to assist it. But the act-and this is an act that a century old-requires the committee, for example, to report on the stated purpose of a work and its suitability, the costeffectiveness of the proposal, the amount of revenue it will produce if the work is revenue producing, and the current and prospective value of the work. Looking at the NBN, this is what the Public Works Committee would do. It would identify: what are we trying to achieve? Presumably, the answer to that would be universal broadband at an affordable price. It would then seek to ask the question: is this a costeffective way of achieving that agreed object? It would then examine the amount of revenue. Is this really a commercial project? Is this genuinely going to produce revenues to offset the massive Commonwealth government investment? And-and this is a particularly important one-it would look at the current and prospective value of the work, because the value of the work is a very material issue for the government. The government is, for the time being, working on the financial fiction that the dollars that it is investing in the NBN and that it is taking from cash-borrowed cash, of course-are being replaced, following the investment, with an asset equal to the amount of cash invested. There is nobody, not one person, in the telecommunications world who believes that this investment will be worth anything like, anything approaching, the level of investment by the Commonwealth in the NBN. The consequence will be that at some point there will have to be a massive write-down. The National Audit Office will require the government to take a hit, and that will have to go through the budget. But that, I suspect, is some time off. One can recognise why the government does not want the Public Works Committee to do its job. The Public Works Committee is would, if it were doing its work, seek to answer the very questions that the government is trying to avoid having addressed. The rather dispiriting irony of all of this is that the government goes to great lengths to prevent the Public Works Committee examining this project. As a member of the Public Works Committee, I found myself up in Brisbane considering a Commonwealth government project-a public work-of $50 million. In other words, it is of a value 1/1,000th the size of the NBN. The NBN will involve expenditure of $50,000 million or $50 billion. This was $50 million for vehicle sheds, some tarmac and some classrooms for the reception, inspection and deployment of new wheeled vehicles for the Army-important work but not the biggest project ever undertaken. Nonetheless, it was our duty, because it was more than $15 million, to look at it. The Department of Defence turned upuniformed officers and bureaucrats-and described how they had undertaken a cost benefit analysis. That is what they had done for a $50 million project, yet this government-so reckless-is determined, if this regulation is not set aside, to prevent the Public Works Committee doing that job on this, the biggest public infrastructure project in our country's history. The minister will say in a moment that they have a better idea and that they have a joint committee. Mr Husic interjecting",60
161,Mr TURNBULL,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,"Well, you do not have a lot to say in your defence, so you may as well be brief. He will say that they have a joint committee that is designed to supervise the NBN or keep an eye on the NBN. But the joint committee's terms of reference are very different to the Public Works Committee. They do not provide for the investigation of the cost-effectiveness of the proposal. They do not provide for the committee to look at the stated purpose of the work and its suitability for the purpose. In other words, the committee is based on the assumption that the NBN is a given, that the decision has been taken and that the only role of the parliament is to get six-monthly reports about how much money has been spent, without any ability to influence or calibrate or ign or change the way in which this project is being rolled out. The honourable member there, the member for Chifley, is shaking his head. He has had a distinguished career in the telecommunications trade union sector. Nonetheless, he would be the first to recognise that there are billions of dollars invested in telecommunications and that it performs a great task for Australia but that every investment carries with it an opportunity cost. This is the fundamental point: whether you are stuck in a traffic jam because there is no public transport or the roads are no good, whether you cannot get your kid into hospital because there are inadequate medical facilities, whether the schools are inadequate, whether your water supply is inadequate-all of these are legitimate claims on the public purse for infrastructure. Every dollar that is spent on the NBN that is in excess of that which is required to achieve the objective of universal, affordable broadband for all Australians-every dollar that is spent in excess of that objective-detracts, as Treasury Secretary Ken Henry said, from Australia's welfare. That is why he has said again and again and, indeed, why the government echoed, in the days when we thought they were fair dinkum about this, that a cost-benefit analysis is required. The Public Works Committee was established by our forebears in this parliament a century ago to supervise government investment in infrastructure and endeavour to ensure that it was not wasteful or reckless. That Public Works Committee today is being excluded from doing its duty by a government that is unaccountable, reckless and determined to spend this money regardless of whether it is needed to achieve the policy objective which we all share. The Public Works Committee must be allowed to do its redesjob. If the Productivity Commission were doing a cost-benefit analysis, there might be an argument for not having the committee involved. But the Public Works Committee is there to do a job and it should be allowed to do it. It is only a government that is afraid of the facts, afraid of its recklessness being exposed, that would seek to exclude the committee from examining this gigantic project.",63
162,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Hartsuyker-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,64
163,Mr ALBANESE,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (5.24 pm)The government does not support this motion. While I was listening to the member for Wentworth address this motion, my mind went back to when I was the shadow minister for water and the member for Wentworth was the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. In an address one January, the then Prime Minister announced $10 billion, done on the back of a serviette, for a national water plan which not only did not go to the Productivity Commission or the Public Works Committee; it did not even go to cabinet, it did not go to Treasury and it did not go to Finance. There were no costingsnothing, zip, absolutely nothing. Mr Husic-How much?",64
164,Mr ALBANESE,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,"Ten billion dollars. So the member for Wentworth comes to this issue with a bit of form. He also has form in trying to undertake his task-which he was assigned by the Leader of the Oppositionto ‘demolish' the NBN. That is the task that he was given. This motion today is another opposition tactic to delay the NBN rollout. The regulations in place are an interim measure until the bill is passed. Without the proposed exemption, NBN Co. would breach the Public Works Committee Act and be liable for potential criminal penalties if it commenced a public work with an estimated cost above $15 million before a long series of processes had concluded-a referral to the PWC, examination and report by the PWC and agreement by the House that the work could proceed. The process of referral to the committee would have a high compliance cost and inhibit NBN Co.'s flexibility. The exemption reflects the fact that NBN Co. operates in commercial markets and will roll out networks in response to market conditions. This is why a similar exemption has been granted to Australia Post and why exemptions were previously granted to Commonwealth owned carriers such as Telstra, AUSSAT and the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation-all with bipartisan support, supported by both sides of this chamber as a common-sense approach to what is necessary for a government owned entity. NBN Co. will remain subject to full parliamentary oversight. The Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network produced five reports. NBN Co. appears at Senate estimates three times a year. There have been hundreds of answers to questions on notice. We have a House of Representatives committee and, immediately after this debate, there will be a motion proposed to establish a joint committee on the NBN. Both will provide additional transparency and oversight of the NBN. Furthermore, NBN Co.'s annual report is tabled in parliament. The motion moved by the member for Wentworth today is designed simply to delay and destroy the rollout of the NBN, to the detriment of end users. That is why it should not be supported. The fact is that we have released already a large amount of material on the NBN: the summary of the expert panel report, tabled 23 October 2009; the MCKinsey-KPMG implementation study, with comprehensive financial analysis, released on 6 May 2010; NBN Co.'s 2009-10 annual report, tabled 29 October 2010; and the NBN Co. corporate plan, statement of expectations and ACCC advice on points of interconnect, released on 20 December 2010. There has been significant involvement by the parliament and the community for many years. Now we have two parliamentary committees to scrutinise the NBN, the proposed joint standing committee as well as the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications. Quite clearly, this motion moved by the member for Wentworth will only have a delaying impact. That is why it is being moved. The fact is that it is totally inconsistent with the attitude the coalition had over many, many years with regard to other instrumentalities, such as Australia Post, Telstra, AUSSAT and the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation. It is about time that the opposition stopped playing these political games under the guise of wanting transparency and acknowledged the inconsistency of their approach. If they were fair dinkum, the motion moved by the member for Wentworth would include, for example, Australia Post now. He is the shadow minister for communications and I do not see that occurring. The fact is that this is simply yet another step in the tic to delay the NBN rollout. It is something that the government will not support because the government is determined to bring communications in Australia into the 21st century and make us a more competitive, more productive economy. I urge members to oppose this motion.",64
165,Mr HARTSUYKER,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,"I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion because we have a very important issue at stake here-that is, the accountability of public funds that are going to be provided by hard working Australian taxpayers. It is quite interesting when you look at the scale, the width, the breadth of this project and the issue of cost benefit. Generally, when you look at the internal control measures that you would put in place to supervise and manage a project, those measures should be commensurate with the size and scale of that project. We have in this case the largest government infrastructure project in the nation's history and yet we are going to provide that project with a far lesser level of scrutiny than that normally accorded to much smaller projects. It is quite astounding that we would be going into this project without a proper cost benefit analysis. It is one thing to flick and tick, to ensure through audit processes that the funds are disbursed in accordance with appropriate accounting standards and so on and so forth. But the most important thing to do in a project of this scale is to ensure that we have the expenditure proposal right, that we are getting the maximum value for money and that the technology we are investing in is going to deliver the best outcomes for the taxpayers who are providing it. One thing that is absolutely missing from all of this is transparency. We see through all of the reports this veil of secrecy that the government wants to cloak round the NBN tacso that it cannot be properly scrutinised, so that the Australian people will not know that this government is driving them down a very dark road indeed-a road that is going to lead to a massive capital loss on behalf of taxpayers. It is going to lead to a massive loss in value-a loss that is made not by the Australian Labor Party but by the Australian taxpayer. It seems astounding that we would not have a cost-benefit analysis for this project. When you look at the business case you see secrecy everywhere. Only 160 pages of the 400-page NBN Co. business plan were actually released. Why is that? Mr Husic-It is commercial-inconfidence.",65
166,Mr HARTSUYKER,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,"Commercial-inconfidence - everything that the Australian Labor Party does not want people to know about this project is commercial-inconfidence. We have the member for Chifley chiming in there. Everything that people are not supposed to know is commercial-inconfidence. We look at issues such as cherry picking that are coming up in the legislation before this House. Why should a project of this magnitude-if it is as good as it is supposed to be, if it is going to deliver the overwhelming benefits that are supposed to be delivered-need to be protected from competition by competing technologies? Why does it need to be protected from competition with Telstra's copper line network? Why does it need to be protected from competition with the HFC network? Why does it need to be protected from alternative fibre operators who might be operating in competition with the NBN? In fact, that very same business plan, shrouded in secrecy as it is, indicates that the return falls to very unacceptable levels. From what I would say is a very miserly internal rate of return of seven per cent-which is pretty much the best case that the government dare put its name to-it falls down to five per cent, hardly a return that would be prompting an investment of this magnitude in a project of this magnitude. A return of five per cent would not even cover the interest on the project, and you actually have to protect it from competition. Mr Husic interjecting",65
167,Mr HARTSUYKER,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,The member for Chifley continues to interject. His mates down at the ETU are probably revving him up. Mr Husic-They are.,66
168,Mr HARTSUYKER,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,"I am sure they are. The situation is very clear. This project should be properly scrutinised. This project should have the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee. This project very much needs far more scrutiny, not less scrutiny. It is interesttude ing to note that the Public Works Committee was actually formed by the ALP and Prime Minister Fisher, yet we have this government attempting to avoid scrutiny. Mr Turnbull-One hundred yearsAndrew Fisher would turn in his grave.",66
169,Mr HARTSUYKER,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,"Yes, Prime Minister Fisher would turn in his grave to see the deteriorating integrity on the other side of the House. It is a vitally important issue that this project be subject to not only scrutiny by the Public Works Committee but a proper cost benefit analysis. Before one more dollar is spent there should be a cost-benefit analysis. This government refuses to do that. They will be condemned by history for the waste of taxpayers' money that is to ensue and that is why it is important that this House properly consider this motion.",66
170,Mr FLETCHER,AMENDMENT REGULATIONS,"Bradfield) (5.36 pm)There is one question before the House today. That question is whether the default in our public policy, which is that significant pieces of public expenditure should as a standard and routine practice be subject to the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee, ought to apply to the National Broadband Network. That is the question we are considering here in the House today. In other words: should the parliament, should the legislature, should the people's representatives have the opportunity to scrutinise a particular project which has been put forward by the executive branch of government? As we ask ourselves that question, let us just ask a little bit about what you might expect would be the characteristics of a project which would appropriately attract the scrutiny of the people's house. If, for example, the government came forward and said, ‘We are proposing the biggest infrastructure project in Australia's history,' would you think it was a good idea that a project of that magniought to be subject to the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee, the routine, default, standard procedure employed in government in Australia for many, many years? If you saw that the project involved the expenditure of an enormous amount of money, $41 billion of taxpayers' money being put at risk, an amount which the most elementary calculation will tell us is over 10 per cent of the budgeted annual expenditure of this Commonwealth government-if you saw that an amount of this magnitude was proposed to be spent, would you say to yourself, ‘This looks to be a good candidate for being subject to the routine, standard, business-asusual, ordinary mechanism of oversight and scrutiny by the people's house'? I think you would say that that was a good candidate. Would you say that a project was a good candidate for scrutiny by a committee of the House of Representatives if you discovered that the proposed financial arrangements for this project involved the Commonwealth incurring a weighted average cost of capital of over 10 per cent? The source for that number is the corporate plan of NBN Co., issued publicly in December last year. If you saw at the same time, from reviewing that corporate plan, that the rate of return to be earned by this project-which this government considers it is a good idea to allocate $41 billion of taxpayers' money to-was seven per cent, you might start to ask yourself some questions and say, ‘This appears to be a particularly good candidate for scrutiny by the Public Works Committee, the routine, standard, default, business-as-usual mechanism by which the parliament maintains scrutiny over public works to be carried out at the instruction of the executive government.' You might very well also say to yourself: ‘This is extremely interesting. When I compare a weighted average cost of capital of over 10 per cent with a rate of return of seven per cent, what do I find? One of the most basic propositions of corporate finance, and that is: if your rate of return is less than your weighted average cost of capital, you are losing money, you are vaporising taxpayers' capital.' So the net present value of this project is heavily negative. And that alone might very well be enough for this House of Representatives to say: ‘Actually, we're not too enthusiastic about this bright suggestion from government that this project ought to be exempted from the normal mechanisms of scrutiny and oversight. Actually, we've seen quite enough to think that alarm bells ought to be ringing. Actually, we think it would be a very good idea if there was the capacity for the House of Representatives, the people's house, to exercise independent scrutiny and oversight of this project because, quite frankly, what we've seen gives us very little confidence that the executive branch of government has this thing under control. On the contrary, it is clear from the papers they have issued that they are vaporising taxpayers' capital at a remarkable rate.' You would also see as you looked at the papers which have been released by the executive branch of government in relation to this project that even that paltry rate of return of seven per cent, which they have the temerity to suggest to the Australian people that their money ought to be allocated to, is based upon a series of highly unrealistic assumptions. You would learn, for example, from the corporate plan issued by NBN Co. just before the end of last year that the current rate of penetration of wireless households is slightly over 13 per cent. You would also learn that that rate has risen quite sharply in the last few years. If you were to look at the trajectory at which the rate of wireless broadband homes is increasing, you would think that it was highly likely that that rate of penetration would increase, particularly having regard to the fact that it is the policy of the Gillard government-a policy not contested by this side of this House-that it will shortly auction off spectrum in the 700 megahertz band and that the telcos, should they be successful in acquiring that spectrum at auction, will use it to deliver 4G wireless broadband. So you might very well think that it was likely that the proportion of wirelessonly homes was only going to increase. You might again think that the answers which have been provided by this government to those questions are wholly unsatisfactory and give you and, more importantly, taxpayers no satisfaction or certainty at all that taxpayers' money is being spent wisely. And you might particularly think that when you turn to the page of the corporate plan which states that it is assumed the penetration rate of wireless households will reach only 16 per cent by 2025, notwithstanding the fact that it has risen from four per cent to 13 per cent in only a few short years. There are a host of reasons why any objective observer looking at this project might say that the ordinary, normal, business-asusual scrutiny mechanisms which apply to major public works under the act, and have applied for many years, ought to apply in this circumstance as well. You might also turn your mind to the political background of this project. What was first proposed was that $4.7 billion of taxpayers' money would be committed to this and it would be a fifty-fifty joint venture with a private sector company. We later learned, in 2009, that that promise, that proposal, that project, was being scrapped, junked, because Labor could not deliver it and it was being replaced with a proposal to spend $43 billion on this project-that should ring some very serious alarm bells. At least we were assured at that time, by the then Prime Minister Rudd, that all $43 billion was not going to come from the public purse because there was going to be significant private sector involvement as well. Then, in May 2010, we learnt that that had gone by the board as well and it was going to completely funded by public sector investment-that was the recommendation in the implementation study. Now, we learn that it will be funded by $41 billion of public money. We heard previously from the minister that there were no grounds to suggest that the ordinary arrangements ought to apply because there had been plenty of scrutiny, and he instanced the implementation study. But he did not mention the fact that the implementation study, having been provided to the government in December 2009, had been dropped by this government in May 2010three short days before the budget. What kind of commitment to openness and scrutiny is that? The question before this House is a very simple one: is this a project which is of such little moment, which raises so few issues of substance, which ought to trouble the taxpayers and citizens of Australia to such a little extent that we ought to waive the normal, default arrangements under which the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee would apply? It is very clear, from even the most cursory examination of the circumstances around this project, that the opposite is true. If ever a project deserved the bright light of scrutiny through every mechanism available to this parliament as the people's House, on behalf of the taxpayers and citizens of Australia, it is this project, and that is why we moved this motion. Question put: That the motion (Mr Turnbull's) be agreed to. The House divided. [5.51 pm] (The Speaker- Mr Harry Jenkins) Ayes………… Noes………… Majority……… NA Abbott, A.J. Alexander, J. Andrews, K.

171,Mr ALBANESE,COMMITTEE,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (5.57 pm)I move: (1) That a Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network (NBN) be appointed to inquire into and report on the rollout of the NBN; (2) that every six months, commencing 31 August 2011, until the NBN is complete and operational, the Committee provide progress reports to both Houses of Parliament and to shareholder Ministers on: (a) the rollout of the NBN, including in relation to the Government's objective for NBN Co. Limited (NBN Co.) to: (i) connect 93 per cent of Australian homes, schools and businesses with fibre-to-the-premises technology providing broadband speeds of up to 100 megabits per second, with a minimum fibre coverage obligation of 90 per cent of Australian premises; and (ii) service all remaining premises by a combination of next-generation fixed wireless and satellite technologies providing peak speeds of at least 12 megabits per second; (b) the achievement of take-up targets (including premises passed and covered and services activated) as set out in NBN Co.'s Corporate Plan released on 20 December 2010 as revised from time to time; (c) network rollout performance including service levels and faults; (d) the effectiveness of NBN Co. in meeting its obligations as set out in its Stakeholder Charter; (e) NBN Co.'s strategy for engaging with consumers and handling complaints; (f) NBN Co.'s risk management processes; and (g) any other matter pertaining to the NBN rollout that the Committee considers relevant; (3) that the Committee consist of 16 members, 4 Members of the House of Representatives to be nominated by the Government Whip or Whips, 4 Members of the House of Representatives to be nominated by the Opposition Whip or Whips, and one non-aligned Member, 3 Senators to be nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, 3 Senators to be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and one Senator to be nominated by any minority group or groups or independent Senator or independent Senators; (4) that: (a) participating members may be appointed to the Committee on the nomination of the Leader of a Party in either House or of an Independent Member in either House; (b) participating members may participate in hearings of evidence and deliberations of the Committee and have all the rights of members of the Committee, but may not vote on any questions before the Committee; and (c) a participating member shall be taken to be a member of the Committee for the purpose of forming a quorum of the Committee if a majority of members of the Committee are not present; (5) that every nomination of a member of the Committee be notified in writing to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives; (6) that the members of the Committee hold office as a joint standing committee until the House of Representatives is dissolved or expires by effluxion of time; (7) that the Committee elect an independent (non-aligned) member as Chair; (8) that, in the event of an equally divided vote, the Chair have a casting vote; (9) that three members of the Committee constitute a quorum of the Committee provided that in a deliberative meeting the quorum shall include one Government Member of either House and one non-Government Member of either House; (10) that the Committee have power to call for witnesses to attend and for documents to be produced; (11) that the Committee may conduct proceedings at any place it sees fit; (12) that the Committee have power to adjourn from time to time and to sit during any adjournment of the Senate and the House of Representatives; (13) that the provisions of this resolution, so as they are inconsistent with the standing ders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders; and (14) that a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting that it concur and take action accordingly. The establishment of this Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network with very wide terms of reference and a balanced membership demonstrates the government's commitment to openness and transparency for the NBN. Unlike those opposite, who are determined to destroy the NBN under the guise of subjecting it to continuous political process and delay, the government supports genuine transparency. The establishment of this joint committee honours an undertaking given by the Prime Minister to Senator Xenophon during the passage of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010 late last year. It is a bill that delivers historic reforms to the telecommunications sector and improved consumer protections, one that the opposition obstructed for almost a year. The committee will compose seven government members and seven coalition members, drawn from each house, with a non-aligned member from each house. Any member or senator will be able to participate upon a resolution of either chamber. The government has agreed to support the Independent member for Lyne, Mr Oakeshott, should he nominate as the chair of the committee. This is an important part of transparency for the National Broadband Network. I commend this motion to the House.",69
172,Mr TURNBULL,COMMITTEE,"The opposition supports the establishment of this Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. This is certainly a second-best option to the joint committee that we proposed and it does not have the same clear focus on the cost-effectiveness of far the proposal that the Parliamentary Standing orCommittee on Public Works had, but it is certainly better than nothing. One question that the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has not outlined-and if the minister could pay attention to what I am saying hereMr Albanese-We are discussing Jamie Briggs's new child!",71
173,Mr TURNBULL,COMMITTEE,"Thank you, Minister. Nothing could be more important than that. Scarlett Briggs is a matter of great interest to every member! Ms Julie Bishop-It is in Hansard.",71
174,Mr TURNBULL,COMMITTEE,"She is in Hansard. She is just a baby and she is in Hansard! I will leave the distraction of the beautiful Scarlett Briggs. Her father tells me she looks just like her mother. He is very modest too; he is a modest member! I have a question for the minister which he may be able to respond to. I know it not question time but it is a matter that could be addressed. It is not at all clear what resources this committee has available to it. We are dealing with a highly technical area of investment. We all accept that the members of the committee will give it their full diligence, and due care and attention will be paid to it-and it will apparently have an extraordinarily and recently clean-shaven chairmannonetheless it would benefit greatly from some expert advice. A question the minister may care to address in the course of this debate is: what resources will the committee have? Subject to that and the start date of the committee-which we believe should be immediate and not put off to the middle of the year, which we understand is the government's plan-we will support the committee. It is a second-best option. The only consolation we can glean from this is that if we had not pressed for the joint committee of our design, or indeed for the attention of the Public Works Committee, we probably would not have even this much from this government. Question agreed to. NA COMPANIES BILL 2010 Cognate bills: NA NA (NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK MEASURES-ACCESS ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 February, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time.",71
175,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I thank the member for Lyne for agreeing to put me ahead of him at this time. It certainly helps my diary immensely and I thank him for that. I welcome this opportunity to speak today on the National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010 and cognate bill. I really am very concerned at the way the government is trying to push these bills through so quickly to avoid part of the public scrutiny. We have seen much in the media but there should be more public scrutiny of the flawed NBN plan. The National Broadband Network Companies Bill will govern ownership. It will also be about the operations and the legal status of NBN Co., the Commonwealth owned builder and operator of the broadband network. It limits NBN Co. to business activities directly related to supplying wholesale communications services and sets out some arrangements for its eventual privatisation. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network Measures-Access Arrangements) 2010-I know it is a long title-also amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and the Telecommunications Act 1997. It requires the NBN Co. to provide open and non-discriminatory access to retail carriers using its wholesale services and imposes similar access rules and NBN compatible technical requirements on non-NBN fibre rollouts. I, like many of my coalition colleagues, am committed to ensuring that there is a universally available, high-quality broadband‘high-speed internet' is probably a better term-available at affordable prices. The National Broadband Network is a $50 billion investment-let us be clear about this-on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia. Whilst it may not be on budget it is still a Commonwealth funded proposal. I have no doubt that we have to build our nation's network, and it is the government's role to ensure that where the network failsand there have been many failures in the past, dating right back to the days of the PMG-the government should be there to invest in what I call the nation's backhaul. In other words, we are building the nation's network infrastructure-I call them our highways-through optic fibre cable and the network. The government should be there where there is a market failure. Markets do fail. We need to develop the nation's backhaul. We should be replacing, as part of the NBN proposal-we are still waiting to hear from the government on this-those singlechannel radio systems that are the legacy of the PMG and Telecom, before Telstra, out in the outback of my electorate. There are single-channel radio systems in this day and age! There are microwave links going right out into the outback and up into the gulf and the Torres Strait Islands. These are technoloBill gies of more than a century ago and we should be replacing them. But the market will always fail to provide the upgrade of those facilities and that is where there is a role for the government. The government rolled out, through NBN Co., a $250 billion optic fibre cable link between Darwin and Toowoomba. Many out in those committees thought, ‘The optic fibre cable is coming through my town; we're going to get access to high-speed internet.' I have had to tell them, ‘No, it is actually a duplication of existing optic fibre cables are owned by Telstra.' NBN Co. have upset many of my constituents because they felt that they could go through people's properties and just advise them by letter, ‘We're coming through.' We have had many fights on the way with NBN Co. They thought they had greater rights than the title deed holder who pays rates on this land. Maybe it is going to be good infrastructure in the long term but, even when they came from east of Mount Isa through to Cloncurry, if they had used the Landsborough Highway between Cloncurry and Winton it might have made a little bit of sense me. But no, they went further east, to Marathon, and cut across Mitchell grass plains to Winton. They could have used the national highway-and the communities of Kynuna and MCKinlay are along that highway. That would have enabled providers at some time in the future to connect national phone towers along a national highway that links Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Darwin. But, no, they did not take that 300 or 400 kilometre route, which would have made sense. It is that backhaul, that connectivity, that would have enabled a connection to be made at some time by third parties rolling out mobile phone and wireless networks, albeit along a lonely stretch of highway north-west of Winton. The other thing that concerns me is that this bill will mean there will not be appropriheard ate parliamentary or public scrutiny of the NBN Co. The NBN is the single largest public works project in Australia's history and it should be subject to some parliamentary scrutiny. It should be subject to investigation by the Productivity Commission as to whether it is appropriately funded and whether the money is being spent appropriately. Public works is part of it, but we on this side of the House are suggesting it that should be investigated by the Productivity Commission. If the government believes it is such a good project then surely an independent analysis would be the best way to ensure we get value for money to provide the best services at the best possible prices. But no, the government is not going to let Public Works or the Productivity Commission oversight the greatest investment by the Commonwealth in any public works in our history. This is probably only the tip of the iceberg for taxpayers, who are ultimately going to fund this project, but it does concern me that to we have not had that public scrutiny. I am the voice of the people of the seat of Maranoa, which covers 45 per cent of the landmass of Queensland. The distance between the east of Maranoa and the west is further than the distance between Brisbane to Melbourne, and from north to south it is further than from Brisbane to Sydney. Across my electorate, communications are very important. I believe communications are a fundamental right. It should not be considered a privilege to have affordable modern communications-not only voice but increasingly data as well. The tragedy of this legislation thus far, unless there is going to be a change of heart from the minister, is to see some of the nation's backhaul, the nation's network, being built where markets fail. We have not really from the minister; we have had soundings from him. I only hope he will listen to some of the councils in my electorate. What the coalition said prior to the last election was that we would have a fund that would be available to third parties to build an open access network where markets fail. One of those areas, in my own electorate, is the outback shires of Diamantina and Barcoo, where a single channel radio system connects Birdsville to Bedourie. They have a single channel radio system from Windorah to Jundah-Stonehenge. These could connect with Defence's over-the-horizon radar facility. There is an optic-fibre cable from Stonehenge through to Longreach. It is the network they use to receive information from the over-the-horizon radar. These shires are prepared to put something like $2½ million to $3 million on the table. They have said that to the minister. I have supported their letters to him to replace those single channel radio systems. So in my electorate and, I am sure, and in other parts of remote Australia there are communities that are desperate to see that old technology replaced with opticfibre cable. Because of the importance of it, it will be there in 20, 30 or 40 years time servicing those communities. It will allow a whole lot of other activities, including emedicine. There is also a growing tourism market out there, so small businesses would be established around outback tourism. We have got to upgrade the infrastructure. I have not yet seen any proposal put forward by the government that is going to guarantee to those communities a partnership arrangement between the Commonwealth, through NBN Co., and those two local council areas. I use them as an example because they are in a very remote part of Australia. From the coalition's point of view, they are not forgotten people, and I just hope they are not forgotten people from the government's point of view. The coalition government provided for this with the Future Fund. We put it into law that the money earned by the Future Fund would be spent every three years where there were market failures. I would like the minister to also respond fully to the Glasson review of communications in rural and remote Australia. The coalition lost government in 2007. From 2007 to 2009 there was, we understood, some $300 million to be spent on addressing market failure out in those rural and remote parts of Australia and, in some cases, metropolitan parts of Australia, where markets also fail. I am sure the member for Macquarie can understand that-when you get into the Blue Mountains. There are market failures close to our large metropolitan cities. The Glasson review and its recommendations have not been fully responded to by this minister. When we left office there was a fund of $2 billion that was earning something like $300 million over a three-year period that was to be used without having to go back to budget. The Treasurer cannot use the argument, ‘Oh, we were hit with the global financial crisis and we had to find savings.' The money was there, invested by the Howard government to make sure that, where markets fail, we could address those market failures without going back to the taxpayer. I would like a minister to respond to that. I want to touch also on Telstra Country Wide. I really want to know, with the agreement between the government and the board of Telstra, what they intend to do with Telstra Country Wide. Telstra Country Wide is out in those rural and regional areas. We put them there by regulation to ensure that they would be in regional Australia when Telstra was fully privatised. We did fully privatise it. Telstra Country Wide has been out there in the community with across-the-counter, faceto-face services. They have been invaluable, I can assure you, in the recent devastating floods and natural disasters. The minister at the table, Minister Bowen , would know. He came to Charleville in the March floods of last year. He knows how important it was to have Telstra Country Wide in the community, providing mobile phones and replacement phones for those people who may have lost them as a result of the floods. We saw it again in Dalby, Chinchilla and Condamine this year. They were there again. I wonder whether under NBN Co. and the separation of the wholesale and retail operations of stra what will happen to Telstra Country Wide. The Prime Minister says that this is a government for regional Australia. I am sure the member for Lyne heard that. This is a government for regional Australia. As part of this bill the government should tell us what they are going to do in relation to Telstra Country Wide and make sure that they continue to build the outback networks. (Time expired)",72
176,Mr CHEESEMAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak on the National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010 and the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network Measures-Access Arrangements) Bill 2010. The National Broadband Network Companies Bill is about telecommunications, but it is also important to note that it is about future of our health system, our education system, our commerce system and, importantly, our economy. This bill is about the long-overdue change that creates a telecommunications market that has integrity. As usual, it takes a Labor government to achieve this. The bill consolidates the separation of wholesale and retail parts of the telecommunications markets. It is also the mark of one of the most important economic reforms that the Australian government is undertaking. It is perhaps the most important thing we can do to increase the productivity of businesses in this country and particularly in areas like Corangamite. It will lead to a revolution in the use of household technology and it will open up new horizons for household entertainment. The Australian government's national broadband strategy, which this bill addresses, will also lead to a revolution in the delivery of health services. Similarly, the NBN will lead to a revolution in educational services delivery. This legislation goes to four things. The Telprimary bill, the National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010, limits and focuses NBN Co. on wholesale-only telecommunications activities, consistent with its mandate as established by this government. It also sets out the Commonwealth ownership arrangements and provides for the eventual sale of the Commonwealth's stake in NBN Co., subject to parliament's approval. The accompanying bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network Measures-Access Arrangements) Bill 2010, establishes new access, non-discrimination and transparency obligations for NBN Co., and it provides a level regulatory playing field for superfast broadband infrastructure. It surprises no-one that the Leader of the Opposition continues to oppose the deploythe ment of the NBN network. He is opposing this great economic reform that the Gillard government is delivering. Mr Abbott is opposing the health service delivery revolution that will take place as a consequence of the deployment of the NBN network across this country. He is opposing the billions of dollars that will open up our economy and open the up our health system. He is opposing the speedier, more timely delivery of health services to regional and rural Australians, and in particular to remote Indigenous communities. Mr Abbott is opposing the educational services delivery revolution that the NBN can bring. He is opposing the expansion of educational services to regional and remote communities. He is opposing the billions of dollars this will ultimately save the Australian government in educational services delivery. For years people who have a passion for this policy area have been dreaming of the day on which the NBN would be deployed, the day the retail arm would separate from the wholesale arm, and the day there were clear transparency obligations in how wholesale telecommunications business operate. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network Measures-Access Arrangements) Bill 2010 amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. This bill introduces open access, transparency and non-discriminatory measures for NBN corporations under clear oversight by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. It also requires owners of superfast networks that are rolled out, upgraded or altered after the introduction of this bill parliament to supply a wholesale layer 2 bitstream service on open and equivalent terms. The NBN access bill also simplifies the making of industry codes and standards for fibre infrastructure and services so new fibre-to the-premises networks are NBN consistent. I think this is great legislation. We have listened for a long time to what industry are saying. We have listened to what consumers want. We made changes in the exposure bill, taking on board the suggestions of industry, such as the scope for the minister to allow NBN Co. to directly supply specific end users. We have listened to industry about matters such as that. I just want to make the point that this important bill, covering these parts, will cause significant, economy-wide opening up of my region. My region-the City of Greater Geelong and the G21 region, as it is sometimes known-has been working very closely with my office to ensure that it can take full advantage of deployment of the NBN. We have in my region some 25,000 small businesses, with the lion's share of those businesses in my seat of Corangamite. Many of those small businesses are tourism operators, and of course they rely upon the internet to market and sell their businesses on the world stage. There is no doubt that the NBN will assist those businesses to access the world stage, and I certainly believe the National Broadband Network will dramatically increase productivity coming out of my region as a consequence. We also have within my region many design companies, architects, tradespeople and building companies who need to send very large files to their customers, and the current network is inadequate for them to be able to do that. We also have very large areas within my electorate where year 12 kids cannot actually email files from their school to their home or to from their home to their school because of the inadequate telecommunications infrastructure that is in place. The NBN will very much assist those students in being able to undertake those very important activities, and I certainly believe that, as a consequence of the deployment of the NBN, educational opportunities will open up, enabling those students to achieve the very best of marks. Also within my electorate we have Deakin University. Deakin is a critical institution for our region. It is one of the largest employers within the region and certainly is the largest employer within my seat. Deakin also has campuses on the Geelong waterfront-in the federal seat of Corio-in Warrnambool and in Melbourne. Deakin, as I said earlier, is the largest employer within my seat, and it has thousands of students studying there; it is providing that educational opportunity. Deakin University is also driving economic and business reform across our region, producing new industries and new jobs. The NBN again will play a vital role in enabling Deakin University to assist our economy in innovation, which is very important. Deakin University is training many GPs, nurses and allied health professionals, who will service our region into the future. Of course, we know that there is going to be a revolution taking place in the health profession over the coming years, and I believe that internet based technology will play a very important role in enabling those doctors, nurses, surgeons and the like to communicate with a much wider audience than they have been able to in the past. I certainly believe the National Broadband Network will play a very significant role in that. This is a very large and important investment, and I think it will be the foundation for productivity growth going forward. Of course, with all of these very tough and challenging reforms, Tony Abbott has consistent form on this. He continues to oppose everything that this government does in terms of opening up our economy and providing opportunities for this nation going forward. The NBN is critical to my region, it is critical to the nation and, as a consequence, I implore both sides of the political divide to support this legislation to enable the government to deploy the National Broadband Network as quickly as we can and particularly to assist regional Australia to get a leg up and get on a level playing field with our metropolitan cousins.",75
177,Mr OAKESHOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I also rise to support the National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010 and the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network MeasuresAccess Arrangements) Bill 2010. I am quite obviously a supporter of better information and communication technology for regions such as the mid-North Coast and for regional Australia generally. I consider this more than just an NBN; I consider it an NDN-a national decentralisation network. Many members of parliament have talked about decentralisation, the importance of that and its place in building and empowering regional communities. This is, if done correctly, the opportunity to achieve that. I know many members have long been advocates for better ICT and for getting as close to equity as possible in the delivery of ICT services in the regions, whether mobile phones, television services or the internet. Something that has been a frustration for a long time-in fact, it was mentioned in my first speech-is the example of a year 9 student living five minutes from a regional town who had to access the internet via dial-up, as much for technology reasons as for financial reasons. In all of this, we should not forget that while, yes, this is about technology it is also about the financial situation of many people and their ability to tap into the technology improvements that we are seeing rapidly coming into Australia. So this is fulfilling my commitment to her as a student in a regional area-trying to allow her as many opportunities as a metropolitan student. Hopefully we will allow the issues around rates of participation in education to finally start to be addressed in a way that we have not done before. Also, there is the issue of employment opportunities, and I know the previous member talked about business opportunities. I quote the example of a veterinary business just outside of Wauchope that has been growing successfully and has become one of Australia's leading veterinary oncology services. When I first heard about it I did not know and I suspect many people here would not have known that there was such a thing as a veterinary oncology service. They obviously now want to send files of a decent size, and they want to stay in a regional community to do their business. They are enormously frustrated by the lack of support with regard to both the speed and bandwidth abilities of existing services. If they want to grow their business then we have to provide better speeds and bandwidth to allow that innovation and entrepreneurship to flourish in a regional location. That is an existing business; we have not even started to explore the opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship that may and will come if we do this right for Australia. I separate the issues to do with the National Broadband Network into three areas: the technology, the spend and the politics. I am not going to talk about the politics tonight-I think that has been played out by plenty of others-but I will talk about the technology and the spend. The technology, I would hope, is broadly recognised across this chamber as a sensible approach to the future for Australia. Fibre cabling is unmatched for both speed and bandwidth. I was having a look inside the blue cabling the other day, and it is worthwhile for everyone who is interested to have a look at one of these pieces of cable, to see just what we are actually ing now and the opportunity for technological improvement still within the scope of the fibre cabling. Inside one of those blue cables there are about 12 mini cables, and inside each of those-correct me if I am wrong, advisers in the chairs-there are 12 of what are the equivalents of mini cables within cables. To use 100 megabytes per second, I was informed that we are only using two of those 12 within the 12 inside the cabling. There is enormous opportunity for technological improvement of speed. It is about the connections at the ends. I gather we are up to onegigabyte connections in the technology at the moment. And this same fibre cabling can handle that technological improvement. So the argument that this is a rollout we are going to pull out in 15 years and that everything will have moved is wrong. There is opportunity within this rollout for technoof logical improvement. That is an important fact that I think gets lost in this debate. That room for growth in technology within the fibre structure is a huge opportunity for Australia in innovation. Hopefully, over the 15year life of the cabling, it will be taken up and we will all be the better for it in our education and employment and our general life opportunities. The issue of complementary measures is also an important one. I saw some of the commentary around the 4G release by Telstra. I know that in communities such as mine, and right around Australia, there are sometimes arguments thrown up that wireless or WiMAX or other technologies are competing with fibre. I would strongly argue that these are complementary, not competitive, measures. We do need a base network if we are going to run these complementary measures. We are not going to be able to get 4G in regional locations without the backbone of this fibre technology. So, if we do not want to just replicate what we have alusready done in the past, which has been the great criticism of our approach to ICT, and allow the market to solve the problem; if we are not going to just have 4G in capital cities and maybe a few regional locations; if we are genuinely going to chase the principle of equity; and if we are to allow the technology to do its job of allowing 22 million Australians to communicate with each other and with the world, then we have got to build the backbone-the backbone that will allow those complementary measures to hang off it-for that innovation to really be worthwhile. We need the backbone. As to the wireless technologies-the WiMAXs-I think they are all valuable and important contributions. I hope we see more of them and I hope that that technology improves. But I think we sometimes get lost in the woods of the debate around speed and forget the importance bandwidth. I think it is the dual contribution of speed and bandwidth which make a fibre network and platform important. From that, we then get into some conversations around the costs. I have said many times before that that is the fertile territory for all of us: to try and minimise the initial costs and maximise the efficiency in the rollout. That is the challenge that I hope this parliament is willing to take up. I am pleased to take on a role in the proposed Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network and I hope there are 15 other members in this place who, with similar intent, with me will do what they can to make sure we get value for money, we have an efficient spend and we minimise the overall costs to government for this important rollout for Australia. I am particularly heartin ened by the terms of reference. There is a whole range of issues for the committee to monitor in the progress of the rollout, particularly paragraph (2)(g) which gives the members of the committee fairly open scope to look at ‘any other matter pertaining to the NBN rollout that the Committee considers relevant'. In the debate that has happened until now there has been concern that the government is hiding something or that there is a fear of scrutiny or a fear of anyone having oversight to look for value for money. I hope with 15 other committee members we can provide that oversight and scrutiny to make sure we get the efficiency from taxpayers' dollars that I know we are all looking for. I also give my private members' bill, the Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2011, a bit of a plug. To many people's surprise, the Auditor-General has some limitations on jurisdiction in any oversight or auditing role regarding government business enterprises, one of which is NBN Co. I hope the bill currently before the House will broaden that scope and allows for an auditor-general to follow the money trail from the point of receipt from taxation to the point of delivery. That point may be through a state, a national partnership agreement, a GBE such as NBN Co. or a contractor-and there will be many people working on a contract basis for Commonwealth dollars in this rollout. The Auditor-General Amendment Bill is important in allowing the Auditor-General to provide backup support so that we really do chase those principles of value for money and efficiency in this rollout. I think a wholesale platform built without vertical integration is an important starting point in this technology improvement. The concept of bundling is one I hope the government talk a lot more about than they have the past because people are generally confused about why we are upgrading one internet service with another. People forget that this is a bundling opportunity for all technology to the home. Telephony services and television services will potentially come down the one fibre line and the cost to the household needs to be considered in the context of all those bills received by householders. That is the bundling opportunity in a rollout such as this. I think when most people do that maths they will see a huge opportunity for a reduction in their living expenses through what will be done by this rollout over the next decade. As well, I hope the commitments given about the roll-in stay in place. I think it is a very important part of engaging regional Australia in this technology advance. I even encourage, if possible, some point-to-point rollout that allows for networks within the network to be built as quickly as possible: for example, a hospital-to-hospital network or a school-to-school network as an approach to trying to get as much benefit in the build process as we can as quickly as possible. My final point is that we should not be nervous about having a conversation about an end point and where and how any sale opportunities at the end could or should arise. Again, my personal view is that economic forces on the platform do not stack up. More than likely government is going to be a monopoly owner of this platform for a long time. But where they do stack up-and metropolitan areas would be the obvious location-I do not think this parliament should be shy of that conversation and starting to frame how we would look for sale opportunities at an end point to reduce the cost to the taxpayer, so long as we keep vertical integration as a core principle behind the wholesale platform. That is a conversation I hope we can start alongside the rest. I hope we now can get on with the job of building the thing.",77
178,Mr ZAPPIA,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I take this opportunity to speak briefly in support the National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010 and cognate bill. Before I get on with my remarks, I commend the member for Lyne for his contribution to this debate. Few issues that I can recall from my time in this parliament have been debated as often as this matter has been. The claims and counterclaims have been expressed time and time again and the coalition's criticism has been rebutted time and time again. The Australian people are quite understandably losing their patience on this matter. It was a key election issue in 2007. It was a key election issue in 2010 and, in particular, the cost of the NBN was a key election issue for the opposition in the 2010 election. Australian people have not been persuaded by the coalition misinformation and scare campaign on this issue which continues to date. It is a campaign which would have you believe that the cost of this project is something like $50 billion when the coalition know full well that the taxpayer contribution is about half of that. If members opposite do not understand the importance of the NBN, let me assure them that the Australian people do. The people I speak with in my electorate do; the Independents in this place do, and we have just heard from the member for Lyne; the Australian people do. Clearly opposition members do not understand the significance of the NBN. They simply do not get it. Over 12 years in office they did nothing, and Australia fell further behind the rest of the world in the provision of high-speed broadband internet services. For the past three years the coalition have opposed the government's NBN legislation every step of the way and at every opportunity available to them, most recently with a matter of public importance on this very matter only last Thursday. The member for Wentworth, who led that MPI as shadow communications spokesman, I believe does of understand the importance of the NBN, so I asked myself, ‘Why the objection?' I can only conclude that their political strategy is to block the NBN rollout so that at the next election they can go to the Australian people and say to them, ‘The government has failed to deliver the NBN.' What is extraordinary is that the opposition, as the alternative government, do not have a credible alternative policy of their own, again highlighting that they simply do not understand the importance of this issue. Their view is that the market will sort itself out and that the private sector will build the necessary networks and provide the necessary services. That simply has not happened, and it did not happen during the 12 years of the previous coalition government. Again, there has been no credible alternative policy put forward by them-or, in fact, by the private sector-to provide the services that are needed. Other speakers have spoken-I notice the member for Corangamite did earlier this evening-with regard to the productivity efficiency gains to be made from a modern, high-speed NBN. Those productivity gains would run into billions of dollars each year. Each year the rollout is delayed costs the nation billions of dollars. If there were ever sustainable charge of costing Australians billions of dollars it would apply to the coaliIn tion for their opposition of the NBN rollout. But it is not just about dollars. It is as much about the personal and human benefits associated with a high-speed NBN. Whether it is in health, education, research, social life or entertainment-in fact, in every aspect of life-there are noticeable personal benefits from a high-speed NBN. In Makin, the electorate I represent, poor access to reliable internet services is one of the most common issues raised with my office. The patience of the people waiting for decent internet services is wearing thin. They understand what the government is proposing and they want the government to get on with it. They have heard the opposition claims and simply are not persuaded by them. I welcomed the announcement last year that the national rollout of the NBN would commence in a number of areas, including the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide, which is the area that I represent. I know that when I speak to residents in those areas they are quite excited by the thought that they might be one of the first communities to finally get some decent access to broadband services. I am also aware of the importance attached to a high-speed national broadband network by business. During the Howard government years businesses in the northern region of Adelaide had to enlist the support of Salisbury council to secure a decent broadband service. Salisbury council, to its credit, was able to deliver for them where the Howard government had failed to do so. I have listened to this debate at length and I have listened to all sides of it, and it seems to me that the debate comes down to what I would suggest are three critical areas. The first relates to the cost of the NBN. The second relates to the monopoly situation that is being created as part of this proposal. The a third relates to the cost and benefit of it. I want to talk about each of those areas briefly. respect of the cost: yes, of course the cost is substantial. This is a significant national project, and if you compare the cost of the NBN rollout to the cost of other significant national projects in years gone by, it is not unreasonable. From my recollection, we went through an extensive tender process to come up with the proposal that we have before us right now. For all of the criticism by the opposition, they have not been able to put forward a credible alternative policy that delivers the same service at a better cost. I am also pleased to see that the governmentwe heard this only an hour or so ago in this House-will be establishing a committee to oversee the NBN rollout process. Finally, cost comparisons have been made with similar systems in other countries and the costs of rollouts in those countries. It is my view that you cannot properly compare what is required in Australia to what is required in another country. Issues such as population density, distance between cities and other unique Australian factors simply cannot be factored in such a way that you can get accurate comparisons to other countries. If it could be done cheaper, I am sure it would have been. I turn to the question of monopoly and the criticism that this will create a monopoly for the NBN network. National infrastructure has quite often been owned by governments in a monopoly situation. It is not at all unusual for governments to do that. In fact, there are still many examples of government monopolies over key public infrastructure. For example, if you look at who owns much of the water systems, the electricity distribution systems, the gas distribution systems, the postal services and telecommunications of this country, you see that they are all sentially either federal or state government owned monopolies. Previously we also had the government involved in things like aviation and a whole range of other areas where today a monopoly no longer exists. The roads throughout this country are owned by the government. So to suggest that there is something unusual and something wrong about a company being a monopoly owner of key government infrastructure is, I believe, a very flawed gument. In fact, more often than not it has taken a government to make the necessary investment and then in subsequent years, once the system is running, to sell off the asset to private investors. The third matter I want to talk about is cost-benefit analysis. Again, this is a matter that you can debate at length, and it is very, very difficult to come to any finite conclusion. It is extremely difficult to accurately assess the benefit that will accrue as a result of having a modern, high-speed national broadband network. Let me use a couple of examples. Recently, with respect to the floods in Queensland, I heard several speakers commenting on how important it was that people were able to communicate with one another at critical times during emergency situations. It was because of that communication that people perhaps were able to save lives. How do you ever put a value on a life saved as a result of having the communications ability that a modern national broadband network would be able to provide? We know that the NBN system will be able to provide cost benefits for our health system throughout the country. There are proposals in hand which will ensure that a high-speed broadband service in this country will be of immense value to our medical system and our health system around the country. Again, if one life is saved as a result of es- that system, how do you put a value on that? But, if you want to go to productivity gains, I do not think anyone in this House would deny that having a high-speed NBN around this country would generate millions and billions of dollars of productivity gains for this country. I do not think that is in dispute. The sooner we have the system up and running, the sooner we will be able to benefit from those gains. Finally, with respect to the cost-benefit aranalysis, I say this: we still do not know today what the infrastructure that we are dealing with will be able to do for us in the future. The applications and the systems through which we will benefit are still evolving and, in some cases, perhaps have not the even been thought out. So how do you value something like that? I do not believe you can. I believe that there are questions that we need to ask. What systems do we have available to us today? Is there a shortfall? I think the answer is yes. How do we best proceed to ensure that we have the most efficient system for this country as quickly as possible?' I believe the proposal before us does exactly that. That is why I support it. I commend these bills to the House.",80
179,Mr SECKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010 and cognate bill. I think it is interesting to construct the story about the cost of this huge white elephant. People sometimes get confused about ‘a million' or ‘a billion', but as I point out to people a million seconds is about 12 days but a billion seconds is about 34 years. So there is a lot of difference between a million and a billion. This legislation is proposing a $50 billion cost, which will end up being a cost to the Australian taxpayer. To put it in those terms, it is about $2½ thousand for every man, woman and child in Australia, whether or not you use the service. It is about $10,000 for the average family. The Labor government's broadband policy is to construct the National Broadband Network-or NBN, as we have come to know it. This will be a Commonwealth owned monopoly. The estimated completion date is 2021. I find it interesting that my friend over the other side, the member for Makin, suggested that they would do it as quickly as possible. Well, 2021 is hardly quick, Member for Makin. It is 10 years-and there is no guarantee that it will actually happen in that time. Labor believe-and they keep telling usthat when the NBN is completed it will reach all of the nation's 10 million homes and business. That is poppycock. Connectivity will be provided by fibre optic cable to 93 per cent of premises-but that does not mean that they will actually use the service-and by fixed wireless or satellite service to the remaining seven per cent of premises in regional and remote areas. Of course, that is where an electorate like mine, Barker, will come in. We will be a large part of that seven per cent. A large part of my electorate will be paying for a service, at $2½ thousand per person-man, woman and child-and they will not actually have access to that service. That is hardly fair. Labor's stated objective to ensure that 93 per cent of households have fibre to the home. That has become Labor's so-called single solution and the end of the policy, when it should only be one of several possible means. It is also the least costeffective available. It is worth looking at the history of this National Broadband Network. I think colleagues on both sides would understand that at the 2007 election Labor promised a system for $4.7 billion-not $50 billion or $43 billion-and it was going to cover 98 per cent of Australia's households. We said at the time-before the 2007 election-that that simply was not possible. And guess what? They got into government and after about a year they worked out that it was not possible. So, instead of saying, ‘We can't do this for $4.7 billion and get 98 per cent of homes covered,' they said, ‘We'll have the big bang theory-$43 billion; we'll go for a $43 billion system,' even though most Australians, at the rate of five to one, are actually connecting up to wireless as we speak. That is the market. They are connecting to wireless, for the simple reason that those speeds are also increasing and it is far more flexible. More and more homes in Australia are not actually connecting to a telephone line; they are just using a simple handpiece, mobile phone or a dongle on their computer to get a wireless service, because they can take it anywhere and do not have to worry about a hooked-in line. Fibre networks may be fine if you live in the city or if your business is in a built-up area, but the Labor government are selling this broadband plan to the whole of Australia and, realistically, not all of Australia will be connected to fibre-and they know that. Many of the residents in my electorate of Barker reside in areas that are considered black spots. The NBN will be of no use to is these people. It will be of no use to the farmers in my electorate. It will of no use to the people who live in the smaller towns-of which there are many in my electorate. About 100 towns in my electorate will not be able to get fibre to the home, because they are considered too small-villages, perhaps. Most of these residents are already connected to the internet via a wireless servicewhich, interestingly, was brought about by subsidies that we brought forward when we were in government during the Howard government years. We did that on the basis of equity. We actually had a plan in 2007 that would have been completed by June 2009, and 99 per cent of Australians would have been covered. This government scrapped the OPEL plan and, as a result, we have still got a lot of people out there waiting for connections because there has been no replacement program. I think it is very instructive to note that Dr Jay Guo, the leader of CSIRO's Broadband for Australia research theme, says that wireless is eminently suited for regional Australia. I believe so; I have got it at homesince it can be rolled out more quickly and cheaply than the fibre network. As I said, in many places in my electorate they will never have that fibre service-not in my lifetime. Dr Guo said: In terms of the cost to cover rural regional eas, especially given the fact that most rural gional areas have sparse populations, the wireless solution will be much cheaper. This is exactly what the coalition had planned. We were not one-eyed when we developed our policy. We looked at what would be most effective and, more importantly, what would be cost effective. More and more people are using mobile devices. You only have to look around this chamber. Everyone has at least two-and maybe three or four-electronic devices, such as personal computers, smartphones and iPad style tablets. Those are predicted to outsell traditional PCs this year, for the first time. Let us just think about that fact for a minute. In 2011 we are faced with facts suggesting that wireless style computing devices are going to outsell fixed devices, and that trend is growing. Yet the Labor government thinks it is a good idea to push ahead with a fixed-line monopoly that will not be completed for another 10 years. I cannot begin to fathom why the government would still continue with the National Broadband Network. I am concerned for the residents of Barker, who will be paying for a network for years to come that, on completion, will be outdated and hugely expensive. How can this government present a model such as NBN and promise speeds and advances in technology in 2011 but then tell everyone that it will not be rolled out completely for another 10 years? This solution might be up to date right now, but let us be honest: what are the chances that this model will still be relevant in 10 years time? I would not bet on those chances. Interestingly enough, Telstra unveiled its newest 4G technology. This will be a significant upgrade to its mobile network that will allow users to obtain speeds similar to home ADSL broadband connections while on the argo. This will boost mobile internet speeds in re- capital cities and some regional areas by the end of the year-not in 10 years time but by the end of this year. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, is confident that Telstra's new technology will not interfere with his fibre-optic plan. He said, ‘Wireless is an important complementary technology to fibre.' It is complementary, but it is more than that; it is actually taking over. The minister has said that wireless is important; so why has he forgotten all about wireless when developing the NBN policy? Why has he presented this inferior model for the NBN that does not utilise the best technology, which is changing every day? The technology used in the NBN is not the only problem; it is one of many. The cost is a huge concern. It concerns me, and the rest of Australia should be concerned also. The government estimates that NBN Co. will require around $27 billion in equity funding and will need to borrow a further $10 billion to roll out the network. This $27 billion in equity funding has not been forthcoming. Nobody is putting their hand up and saying, ‘We want to invest in this. We think it's a goer. We think people would be prepared to pay $200 a month.' They are not coming the way of the government. If they do not, who is going to pay for it? The taxpayer. If the NBN Co - Telstra deal currently under negotiation goes ahead, NBN Co. and the government-hence the Australian taxpayer-will make payments to Telstra worth $11 billion in present-day post-tax terms for the use of its conduits and migration of its customers. The commonly used $50 billion price tag for the NBN adds these together: equity, debt and payments to Telstra. The head of NBN Co., Mike Quigley, has been quoted in CommsDay acknowledging that his construction budget is under pressure from the skills shortage, which has been made worse by the demand for skilled labour to clean up the damage caused by the storms and floods in Queensland. Mr Quigley said: … we've done a detailed analysis of the skills we need in the company in order to build the network … there is a straight issue of will there be enough people to do this type of work in the construction industry? What I can tell you is that the view of the company won't be such that we will just keep building regardless of the cost-if we find that costs are going up regardless of labor, we will go back to the shareholder and talk about that very carefully … The shareholder will be the Australian taxpayer. In other words the NBN chief is saying that, if labour shortages mean his construction cost estimates are going to blow out, he will go back to government to get an okay to proceed at a higher cost or, alternatively, slow down construction until labour shortages have eased. It beggars belief that a government could proceed with the NBN when the cost blowouts have already made this an outrageously expensive rollout of technology that is very likely to be outdated before it is completed. What sort of arrogant government digs its head in the sand whilst the alarm bells are ringing? Taxpayers have every reason to be worried, as am I, that these problems are a sign of things to come with the NBN. Going by Labor's track record of ‘easier to beg forgiveness later', the NBN cost blow-outs could be massive. Will Labor just wait till the project is half rolled out then ask for more money from taxpayers to finish it, essentially giving them no choice in the matter? I have seen this previously with the Labor government, in schools in Barker affected by Labor's flawed Building the Education Revolution program. One school in particular had their hall ripped down and half rebuilt before they were told they would need to find half a million dollars of their own money to finish it. This government expected a drought ravaged town struggling to survive to come up with its shortfall. This ruthless government has exercised this sort of careless behaviour in the past; the NBN will be no different. As the price rises, so will the cost for taxpayers. The problem with the NBN is that the government has kept it secret. Taxpayers should be concerned when a government refuses to let a huge, costly project go under the microscope. Only 160 pages of the 400page NBN Co. business plan were made public. This is very concerning in itself. Then the government asked MPs who viewed the whole business case to sign confidentiality agreements. This is outrageous. It is deeply concerning. Australia has the right to know what is in those pages. You would not invest in shares without studying their performance and you would not buy a house without looking at the plans, so why is this government asking the Australian taxpayer to fund a $50 billion broadband model that they have no proper details about? The bills before us today attempts to vent the NBN from being scrutinised by the Public Works Committee Act 1969. Since 1988 all major government infrastructure projects have been subject to joint parliamentary committees, so why not this one? What have Labor got to hide? This is the first tions. time to my knowledge that such a major project, the greatest project in cost of any ernment outlook in the future, is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Labor, you should hang your heads in shame.",82
180,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (7.10 pm)in reply-I believe that the people who are opposing this bill and opposing the National Broadband Network should indeed hang their heads in shame. We have known for years that those opposite had countless plans-perhaps 20-which amounted to us being in the position of falling behind the rest of the world. As government speakers have made clear, the NBN will provide broadband infrastructure to underpin productivity, prosperity and creativity into the future. Even opposition members have agreed that there is a need for much improved broadband services, noting a litany of poorly served areas. These bills ensure that NBN Co. delivers key objectives. Together the NBN companies bill and NBN access arrangements bill will ensure that the NBN operates on a wholesale-only, open and equivalent access basis, both now and into the future, subject to strict ACCC oversight. Under this legislation there is transparency of the services NBN Co. provides and the terms and conditions on which it offers them. As a wholesale-only, open access network and without the conflicts that occur with also having a downstream retail operation, the NBN will drive fair and effective retail-level competition in the telecommunications sector across the country. It will premean more choice, more affordable prices and higher quality services for Australian households and businesses. Industry is crying out for this legislation to ensure NBN Co. adheres to the mandate the government has set it and to provide for its future operaThe bills provide a clear framework for govthe operation of a superfast universal national broadband network with genuine retail-level competition for the first time across the country. In fact the bills are an important part of this government's plan to transform the industry and provide genuine access to vastly improved broadband services across Australia. This is about advancing the future agenda in the national interest. Passage of these bills will ensure the new arrangements are in place as soon as possible, providing certainty for NBN Co., certainty for industry and certainty for the community.

(12) Clause 49, page 41 (lines 19 to 22), omit subclause (1), substitute: (1) This section applies if it is proposed to enter into an NBN Co sale scheme and there has not been a previous reference to the Productivity Commission under this section. (13) Clauses 50 and 51, page 44 (line 14) to page 46 (line 4), omit the clauses. (14) Clause 52, page 46 (lines 10 and 11), omit “unless the Commonwealth ownership provisions have ceased to have effect”, substitute “until 15 sitting days after the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Ownership of NBN Co has reported to both Houses of the Parliament”. (15) Clause 53, page 46 (lines 16 and 17), omit “unless the Commonwealth ownership provisions have ceased to have effect under section 51”, substitute “until the completion of 15 sittting days after the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Ownership of NBN Co has reported to both Houses of the Parliament, under paragraph 3(1)(b) of Schedule 2, on the Committee's examination of the report of the Productivity Commission inquiry mentioned in section 49”. These amendments all deal with the provisions in the bill that are designed to make it almost impossible for the Commonwealth to sell the NBN. Essentially, the bill currently provides that the NBN cannot be sold until it is complete. That will take many years, and it may be that no government will complete the NBN. Indeed, the general view in the telecommunications industry is that this project is so misconceived and so expensive in terms Subof the required capital investment that it will never be completed. Tying the hands of future governments in this way is simply not good practice. We seek to delete those provisions in the bill that seek to tie the Commonwealth's hands. In so doing, we seek to eliminate the attempt by the government and the Greens to make this massive government-owned monopoly be permanently and perpetually in government ownership. The simple reality is that Australia does not need another massive government-owned telecommunications monopoly. We had one of those-it was called Telstra. Before that, it was called Telecom. Before that, it was the Postmaster General's Department or a division thereof. Mr Stephen Smith-PMG.",87
184,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"PMG-exactly. A very good decision was taken to privatise it, and now the government is seeking not only to turn back the clock but also to make it practically impossible for this new government-owned monopoly to be disposed of. We note that there is a proposal to have a Productivity Commission inquiry prior to any sale, assuming that the network has been completed. It is remarkable that the government would agree to have a Productivity Commission inquiry into the sale of a $50 billion investment but not to have a Productivity Commission inquiry into whether it should be established in the first place. But this is just one of many incongruities that we see in the government's approach to this matter. That is the first set of opposition ments and it relates, as I said, to the Commonwealth ownership provisions.",87
185,Mr ALBANESE,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (7.19 pm)The government does not support these amendments. Under part 3 of the National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010, NBN Co. cannot be privatised until five clear steps have been taken. First, the communications minister must declare that the NBN is built and fully operational; second, the Productivity Commission must conduct an inquiry into the NBN; third, a parliamentary joint committee on the ownership of NBN Co. must examine the Productivity Commission's report; fourth, the finance minister must declare that conditions are suitable for entering into and carrying out an NBN Co. sale scheme; and, fifth, it must be the case that the parliament does not disallow the finance minister's declaration. It is very clear that the retention of NBN Co. in public ownership until the network is complete and operational is designed to ensure that the network can be rolled out consistent with the government's objectives and as recommended by the implementation study. The effect of the coalition's amendments would be that a future government could sell NBN Co. at any time, even if only a small part of it had been built. As such, the coalition amendments would jeopardise the rollout of the NBN as a national network providing new broadband infrastructure to all Australians. It is not surprising that the ideological free marketeers opposite want to repeat the mistakes they made with Telstra. We know that, when Telstra was privatised, it went from being a public institution to being a privatised monopoly with consequential negative impacts on consumers. Most importantly, we know that because the structural separation question was not addressed by those opposite amendwhen they were in government there was a failure of public policy that had to be fixed up by this government when we passed legislation dealing with the question at the end of last year. The opposition is proposing amendments that also remove the right of a future parliament to disallow any sale. But this government considers that a sale decision would be best made in the future by the government and the parliament of the day. The amendments do retain both a Productivity Commission inquiry and a joint parliamentary committee inquiry on ownership of NBN Co., but the amendments do nothing more than pay lip service to them. The amendments would allow a future coalition government to sell NBN Co. regardless of what the commission and joint parliamentary committee decide. The main purpose of the amendments is simply to enable a future coalition government to sell NBN Co. as quickly as possible, regardless of the needs of regional and rural Australians and the public benefit from restructuring the telecommunications market. That is why the government simply does not support these amendments. We need to move forward in a positive way towards the future; not to look backwards at the mistakes of the past and repeat them. But those opposite are ideologically opposed to the idea that the government should address market failure, which is what we have seen in the telecommunications sector. We have seen market failure in practice, with 20 failed plans and a lack of services, particularly impacting on regional Australia. So the government will not support these amendments and, indeed, is strongly opposed to them. We say to the opposition: it is one thing to make mistakes in government-and they were made time and time again and reinforced by the coalition when in office-it is another thing not to have the capacity to step back, examine the consequences of those mistakes and concede that they were indeed mistakes and should not be repeated in the future. The government opposes these amendments.",88
186,Mr HARTSUYKER,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"Certainly, the coalition very much supports action in telecommunications where there is market failure. But the reality is that so much of the money expended in this project is going to be in areas where there is no market failure and where there are other, cheaper alternatives. Let me return to the substance of the amendments in relation to the coalition's view that it is not the role of government to hold this project in perpetuity and that we should not make it more difficult than need be to achieve a sell-off of this project. It is vitally important that we get a highly efficient and highly effective telecommunications system. History has shown that government as the owner has not been particularly effective in running business enterprises. That is clearly done more efficiently and effectively by the private sector. It seems astounding that we are going to have a situation where there is a Productivity Commission investigation with regard to the sale of this project when we were denied a Productivity Commission investigation into the viability and important aspects of the business itself. It just seems absolutely unreasonable that you would propose to give the Productivity Commission input into the sale and yet not give the Productivity Commission input into the actual proposal itself.",89
187,Ms ROWLAND,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"I find it absolutely laughable that those opposite come in here and want to make it easier to privatise NBN Co. As the minister has said, there is one group of people in this parliament you should never take advice from when selling a telco-it is those opposite. There is one group who wrote the playbook on how not to do it-it is those opposite. With these amendments they want to remove the very sensible protections that we have decided to put in there to make sure that a national piece of utility infrastructure is sold down in the national interest. The provisions in this bill will ensure that the government plays an important role in the sale when the government does sell down its interest. The important issue is that we step away when the environment is right. The steps in this assessment include reference to the Productivity Commission. What a paradox it is indeed that those opposite are so ready to call on the Productivity Commission to prevent it from being built but then they do not want to call on the Productivity Commission to make sure that it is sold properly. These people want to reject assessments by the Productivity Commission, they want to reject parliamentary committee recommendations and they want to reject the ability for the minister to actually make an informed decision at the time of the sale to determine whether or not a sale is appropriate. Most importantly, the finance minister will need to declare-and there is a very strict process that is set out in the bill for the finance ister to declare-that favourable market conditions exist for a sale. How sensible is that? It is eminently sensible to ensure that when the sale is done it is done properly, it is in the national interest and it does not adversely affect the national interest. This is critical because there is the ability within this bill to ensure that the government can determine what is an unacceptable ownership or control situation. It is a very importralia. tant constraint on the ownership of NBN Co. Again, these provisions reflect the government's intention that NBN Co. be a national piece of utility infrastructure. We have heard the other side talk about what prudent investors would do in certain situations, but no prudent legislature would ensure its biggest piece of national utility infrastructure be privatised without considering the potential future of the industry. That is exactly what did not happen in the T2 and T3 sales. In this process we are doing a very important thing in considering the role of government early in the process, and in the latter stages the role of the private sector. It is a well thought out plan which is documented in this bill before us. These are absolutely necessary protections to prevent what the coalition did to Telstra, the most productive outcome of which was to split the telco act into two and not much else. The most productive thing it did was to create more paper and split one telecommunications act into two. These provisions will ensure that the selldown process is done in a managed way. It will ensure that it is done in a manner that reflects prudent investment and prudent financial judgment, and I urge all members present to reject the amendments that have been put before us, because they will simply repeat the mistakes of the past.",89
188,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"I want to respond to some of these points. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport demonstrated touching concern for the plight of regional and rural Australia and done broadband services therein and said that there had been failed schemes. One scheme that failed to take effect was the OPEL scheme that was established by the previous government. That scheme would have delivered fast broadband services to regional AusThat scheme was fully funded and was abandoned by the Rudd government immediately on coming into government. The melancholy truth is that people in regional and rural Australia would have access to broadband now if the Howard government's plan for broadband services had been allowed to go forward. Let me respond to the member for Greenway, who said that the only consequence of the privatisation of Telstra was the production of a lot of paper. Presumably, some of that paper was produced by the legal profession, which did very well with Telstra. She was a distinguished member of that noble profession. Her denigration of the sale of Telstra is a little unconvincing on that ground. In a nutshell, without going through these amendments in the finest detail, they simply remove the obligation for the National Broadband Network to be completed before it is sold. That is the major amendment. The member for Greenway said it was a good idea to legislate that the finance minister says that circumstances are propitious for a sale. That is like legislating for ministers to do their duty. Obviously, no government-of any persuasion, one would hope-would sell a major asset other than when conditions were suitable for a sale. If our amendments are accepted, there will remain a provision for a Productivity Commission inquiry to be held into the sale and for consideration by the joint parliamentary committee. This is not a question of parliament being, if you like, prevented from having oversight of the process. Our amendments would prevent this parliament from binding the hands of many future parliaments, because this network will take many years-perhaps many decades-to complete. This network cannot be sold until such time as it is complete. The provisions we are seeking to delete are effectively the poisoned pill designed to make it virtually impossible for the NBN ever to be sold. The reality is that we are a free market economy. We have had a lot of lectures in the context of climate change from the Prime Minister about the virtues of the market, the law of supply and demand and the benefits of taking market approaches to measures. She is not very consistent, because this is an area where for decades there was a common commitment to getting government out and getting competition into the sector. What we have here is government going back into it at a level of investment that is staggering. We should remember that, for considerably less than the total amount of the investment in the NBN, the government could actually buy Telstra at its current market price. I am not suggesting that it should renationalise Telstra, but it gives you some idea of the scale of investment. Ms Rowland interjecting",90
189,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"You could have a complete integrated telecommunications company with mobile, broadband and retail for a lot less than they are spending on the NBN. The member for Greenway says it is a great idea. Maybe that is something you can submit to a cost-benefit analysis. We commend these amendments to the House.",91
190,Mr HUSIC,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"It is sad when you see great people forced to do things that deep down they just do not believe in. I will give the member for Wentworth credit: there is panache in the way he does it and it is inspiring. In many respects it is greatly disappointing. I love the fascination with a cost-benefit analysis. It was reflected upon earlier by the Leader of the House that the water plan that the member for Wentworth had responsibility for never had a cost-benefit analysis. It was $10 billion and a cost-benefit analysis was never called for, never sought, and never put in place by them. When the member for Wentworth mentioned OPEL, it brought to my attention Henry Ergas, who the opposition have quite a deal of enjoyment quoting to us from time to time. In his book Wrong number: resolving Australia's telecommunications impasse he talks about how almost $4 million through your 11 years in government was spent addressing telecommunications issues in regional areas. I do not know that at any point at that stage the opposition called for a cost benefit analysis. Ms Rowland-None.",91
191,Mr HUSIC,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"Right, member for Greenway. There were other claims made during the debate too. Let me go back and quote directly from Wrong number: resolving Australia's telecommunications impasse: Since 1997, over $3 billion, at 2007 prices, of taxpayers' money has been appropriated to schemes aimed at promoting the availability or use of telecommunications, mainly in non-metro areas. In mid-2007 the government committed a further $958 million to the Optus-Elders OPEL consortium for the construction of a WiMAX network in non-metro areas. I do not know where the cost-benefit analysis was. I would be more than happy for anyone opposite to point out where that actually was. There were some other outstanding claims. For example, the member for Wentworth said that people in the sector believe this may not ever happen, that the NBN may not ever get built. One, I would love to hear where he is quoting that from and, two, if it is the case, how come we have got over 30 construction companies lining up ready to participate in the build, ready to put people on to make this happen? Again he has no proof and no ability to back it up. He just puts a statement up. The other thing too is the whole notion of the scare campaign on the monopoly. The fact of the matter is that we needed to get into this space due to the failure previously to be able to address the market failure because, effectively, we had what I would liken to a hundred year war between Telstra and regulators: Telstra saying that it would not invest unless it got a return rate that would see prices at a level that consumers would not bear, and the government of the day refusing to allow for Telstra to do this. We had a system where there was no investment in broadband because Telstra was-and I know this sounds hard for people in this chamber to believe-playing hardball against regulators, against government and against anyone that did not want to play by the ground rules set by Telstra. That is why I shuddered when the member for Wentworth was suggesting for that moment that we could almost buy Telstra back. I do not know whether you would want to buy them back in a million years. There is a reason we got to this place, and the member for Bradfield quoted this back on 23 February. He was wondering why we went from a $4.7 billion plan to what we have now. You know exactly why: you had the strategic genius of the entrepreneur Sol Trujillo, backed up by Don MCGauchie, whose great contribution to HR in this country was alsatians on the docks, saying, ‘We'll put in a five-page tender and that is all we will do in relation to a multibillion-dollar program,' and it was clear that the major telecommunications company in this country was not prepared to play ball on broadband. Optus could not foot the bill, Telstra was not ready to play, so we basically had the position put where we needed to move into this space and do so in a big way. They know exactly why this is the case. And if we are in this area, we need to provide stability and certainty for the construction phase and at the proper point go to sale, unlike the situation before, where it was a grab for cash by the opposition. It failed to go through the issue of structural separation, which we have had the courage to undertake in government and then to ensure that the NBN is in a position to be let loose in the market at that point. What these guys are playing with they know is unsustainable. (Time expired) Question negatived.",91
192,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"I move opposition amendment (5): (5) Clause 9, page 15 (lines 4 to 8), omit the clause, substitute: 9 Supply of eligible services to be on wholesale basis (1) An NBN corporation must not supply an eligible service to another person unless the other person: (a) is a carrier or a service provider; and (b) will use the eligible service to supply a carriage service or a content service to the public. (2) For this section, a service is supplied to the public if: (a) it is used for the carriage of communications between 2 end-users, each of which is outside the immediate circle of the supplier of the service; or (b) it is used for point-to-multipoint services to end users, at least one of which is outside the immediate circle of the supplier of the service. (3) In this section: immediate circle has the meaning given by section 23 of the Telecommunications Act 1997. This amendment deals with the issue of the supply of services by the NBN. I encourage the honourable members opposite not to be reactive and Pavlovian in their response here and immediately reject what I am putting to them. Mr Albanese-Automatically opposing is",92
193,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"Okay, thank you. Steady on! It is common ground that the NBN should be a wholesale entity-that is apparently part of the scheme-and should not be able to go into the retail space. That is the big idea, as they say. Unfortunately, this is not perfectly achieved, because we have in this bill too many loopholes to enable the NBN-and this is something a number of the telcos have alerted the Senate committee to-to provide services directly to companies who could, as has been pointed out by a number of the telcos, very readily acquire a carrier licence. A bank could do that, or Woolworths or any other large corporation could acquire a licence. So why is that a problem? It is a problem because, firstly, the object, as we understand it, is that this will be a purely wholesale business. Secondly, we know that the NBN is a very expensive undertaking. It is going to be very heavily capitalised-we say excessively capitalised-but there will be an incredible pressure on it to generate additional revenues. That is inevitable, and that will apply whether the government of the day is Labor or Liberal or whatever; it does not matter. The finance department, the Treasury, will be saying, ‘You have got to find some more cash for us.' So the natural temptation for the NBN will be to move upstream into retail services. There will be plenty of big companies saying: ‘Look, we don't want to deal with the middleman. We do not want to deal with Telstra. We just want to do a deal with you.' There is too much opportunity in the legislation at the moment to enable the NBN to get around that. So what we are proposing here in amendment (5), in clause 9, is really a belt-andbraces provision to delete that clause which simply says that you cannot supply services to somebody unless they are a carrier or a service provider. It is very easy for a company to get a licence to be a carrier or a service provider and then just provide services to itself. We propose that this be fleshed out so that it says: (1) An NBN corporation must not supply an eligible service to another person unless the other person: (a) is a carrier or a service provider; and (b) will use the eligible service to supply a carriage service or a content service to the public. Then there is a further fleshed out definition of ‘the public'. I believe that is a critically important amendment and one that has the support of a whole series of players in the industry, both Telstra and Optus and a number of the other carriers. It really is quite consistent with the objects of the legislation and I would encourage the government, and indeed the crossbenchers, to consider this very carefully. It is quite consistent with the objectives of the act.",93
194,Mr ALBANESE,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (7.44 pm)The government does not support opposition amendment (5). The National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010 as drafted makes NBN Co. a wholesale-only provider. The mechanism it uses is a restriction on selling to any party other than a carrier or carriage service provider or specified utility. The proposed amendment puts a further restriction on the parties NBN Co. can supply. It leaves the requirement that NBN Co. supply only carriers or carriage service providers but only those carriers or carriage service providers that, in turn, provide a service to the public. A couple of points can be made in response to this. First, NBN Co. will only supply a service that by its nature is a wholesale service-for example, a layer 2 service on the fibre network. This is not a service that can be used by an end user as considerable resources and capability is required in order to turn a layer 2 service into an end-user or retail service. Secondly, the restriction proposed by the opposition would prevent an arrangement that has been permitted by the legislation since 1997 that a person can become a carrier even if that person wishes to supply services primarily to his or her own operations. The opposition amendment is poorly drafted and has the effect of preventing service providers from reselling services to other service providers, which I am advised is a common arrangement. For these reasons, the government does not support this amendment.",93
195,Mr HARTSUYKER,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on opposition amendment (5) because I think it is important that proper commercial activity is protected from mission creep by this massive monolith that the government has created. It is an organisation that is being protected from competition in a range of ways. I think it is important that we put in place the sorts of protection that would ensure that NBN Co. does not creep its way into providing retail services by stealth. It has certainly been represented to me by people in the industry that they are very concerned about that prospect. Also, when you look at the new exemption with regard to utilities, once again we see a situation where a service that could be provided by a range of other persons or corporations active in the industry may be usurped by the sale by NBN Co. direct to utilities. So I certainly speak in support of this amendment. I certainly reject the notions put forward by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport that it is not an appropriate amendment. I think it is one that the House should support.",94
196,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"In response to the remarks of the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, I am not sure whether the notes relate to another set of amendments but the point here is a very basic one. In Telstra's submission to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee-and I do not agree with all of its submission but I do agree with this part of it-the point is made: … nothing in section 9 requires that the fundamental characteristic of wholesale supplyparticipation in retail end-user markets via onsupply to the public-be present at all. The key problemas its submission goes onis that statutory concepts of “carrier” and “carriage service provider” are … ill-suited to the important task of defining NBN Co's scope of business. There are a large number of licensed carriers who do not provide services to the public but hold carrier licences for other reasons. The Telstra submission goes on to point out: There are a number of large entities that are already carriers or CSPs, and who could therefore be directly supplied by NBN Co under the proposed draft. For example, the current TIO membership (of which a CSP must be a member) includes: large corporate and business customers, including Woolworths, NEC Australia, Port of Brisbane and CBIT; - educational institutions, including University of Queensland IT Services and Sebastopol College, a community college in Ballarat; - Government agencies, including the Library Board of Victoria and South West Healthcare, which covers most Government health deliverers in south west Victoria; and - local government … The simple fact of the matter is that everybody in business, if they can manage it, would like to cut out the middleman. They will see the retail service providers-the private sector part of the telecommunications industry in this NBN world, if we get to itas troublesome middlemen that they will not want to deal with, and we will discuss that further in the next amendment. The consequence will be that NBN, acting quite rationally in terms of its own commercial objectives, will creep further and further into the province of the retail service providers. What we will see is the gradual evolution of the NBN from being originally a wholesale carriage provider to becoming a wholesale carriage provider with a large retail, government and corporate business. In other words, the only part of the retail telecommunications business that it will not be undertaking is that to residential and small businesses. But all of the larger customers will be eligible for assault from NBN. I make one other point. A company may become a carrier for the purpose of this-so eligible to be sold to by a carriage service provider, eligible to be dealt with by the NBN under this clause, simply because it is in the business of supplying telecommunications services of a completely different kind as part of its business. It might be a mobile reseller, for example. So there is a huge scope for the NBN to puncture through the limitations that, supposedly, the government wants to set up around it. This is going to become a telecommunications equivalent of Frankenstein. It will literally take over large sections of the telecommunications business in Australia and it will do so unfairly and unjustly because it benefits from a massive subsidy from the government. Remember that there is no level playing field between the NBN and anybody else because it has access to unlimited funds with no commercial or even realistic return on the capital expected. This is a shocking invasion of the private sector, a shocking incursion on competition, and, if the government is serious about NBN being wholesale only, it should support this amendment, which, as I said, has broad support within the telecommunications sector. Question negatived.",94
197,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"I move opposition amendment (6): (6) Clauses 10 to 16, page 15 (line 9) to page 17 (line 32), omit the clauses. These clauses are just below the previous area of amendment I referred to. These provide express exemptions from the already sieve like restriction on the supply of eligible services referred to in clause 9. These provide complete exemptions in respect of a series of utilities. In other words, transport services, electricity supply bodies, gas supply bodies, water supply bodies, sewerage bodies, stormwater drainage services and road authorities can all deal directly with the NBN. So, for exactly the same reasons I articulated earlier, we are seeking to make that amendment in order to reinforce the importance of the wholesale-only nature of the NBN. The utilities are very keen on these amendments of course, and what is interesting is that they are keen on them because, they say quite bluntly, they do not want to deal with the middleman. That is their language, literally. They see the RSPs-that is, Telstra, Optus and others-as being unnecessary, troublesome middlemen. The problem with that is, once you provide an exemption of that kind for these utilities, why shouldn't any other large entity be able to have it? The member for Chifley is shaking his head, and I know what he is going to saythat these services would only be used for providing smart grids. There are two points there. The provision of machine-to-machine telecommunications services is probably going to be the fastest growing area of telecommunications over the next few years. It will not be too long before most devices and most machines are connected to each other, and many of them, naturally-particularly those that are mobile-will be connected wirelessly. Nonetheless, that is a legitimate area of the telecommunications industry to be engaged in. These exemptions will have the effect of taking that away from the private sector in large measure and giving it to the exclusive preserve of the NBN. The simple fact is that we understand why Energy Australia, AGL or Sydney Water would rather not deal with a middleman. They would rather buy wholesale services directly from NBN. We understand that. But, in allowing them to do that, the government is seizing even more of the territory of the existing private sector telecommunications companies. It is for that reason-and it is exactly the same principle that I described earlier in respect of amendment (5)-that this amendment should be supported. I perfectly respect the interests of the ties, wanting to have the legislation drafted in a way that protects their commercial interests. But the House must remember that the object of the NBN, so we were told, was to provide a wholesale-only, common carrier that did not provide retail services and did not compete at the retail level with the private sector. Yet, both in the loopholes in clause 9 and now in these provisions, clauses 10 to 16, that we are seeking to excise, we are seeing a great opportunity for NBN to take over that part of the private sector's business.",95
198,Mr ALBANESE,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (7.57 pm)The government does not support this amendment. The general rule is that NBN Co. can supply only carriers and carriage service providers, but NBN Co. can also supply to specified utilities, for limited purposes. There are three reasons why we need to permit supply to utilities in this legislation and therefore should not support an amendment deleting those clauses. Firstly, under existing legislation, utilities can do things that would otherwise make them carriers or carriage service providers without being classified as carriers and carriage services providers under the Telecommunications Act. The bill simply seeks to allow NBN Co. to treat them as carriers and carriage service providers when it comes to the supply of services. Secondly, these arrangements will support the growth of smart infrastructure management in Australia, including smart management of energy supply. A very important component of the future productivity growth of this nation is the development of smart infrastructure. Thirdly, it puts pressure on telcos to provide utilities with the services that they need. The bill imposes tight limitations on the way the utilities use NBN Co. sourced serutilivices. They must use them for the sole purpose of carrying communications necessary to monitor and administer their own networks. Utilities cannot use these services to provide retail services to end users. Utilities and transport authorities will still need to purchase normal communications services, like telephony or broadband internet, from retail providers. Services that NBN Co. make available to utilities should also be available to other carriers and carriage service providers, and they could offer these to utilities if they wished. This amendment moved by the member for Wentworth would deprive utilities of the benefit of arrangements they have now as well as undermine efforts to develop smart infrastructure and reduce incentives for carriers. That is the reason why the government does not support these amendments.",96
199,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"I do not know whether the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has been sold a pup, because quite a large pup has been sold to the Greens-which we will come to later. What he just said to the House is absurd, frankly. The utilities have been quite clear about what they are seeking to achieve. The Energy Networks Association, in their submission of 24 February to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee, said: Even if retail service providers do offer an priate NBN service type, the requirement to deal through a third party would add additional costs, without adding value. That is no more than saying, ‘I always prefer to buy wholesale; I do not want to deal with the retailer.' On that basis the NBN will dominate totally all of the government and large corporate telecommunications business in Australia. Again, I do not know whether the government has been sold a pup on this by the department or by the energy and utilities sector, but there is no limitation on what utilities can do. They obviously cannot resell the telecommunications services to the public unless they have a carrier licence, but if they do have a carrier licence they are entitled to. In terms of their own services, consider clause 11, which deals with electricity supply bodies. It says that the prohibition on providing services to persons other than carriers does not apply if: … the sole use of the carriage service is an electricity supply body to carry communications necessary or desirable for: (i) managing the generation, transmission, distribution or supply of electricity; or (ii) charging for the supply of electricity … What else does an energy supply company do? That describes the entirety of its business. It manages the generation, transmission, distribution or supply of electricity and it charges for it. Literally everything it does is for that purpose. I challenge honourable members on the other side to tell me and the House a function of an electricity utility that is not covered by those general words. I cannot think of one. It covers the entirety of their operations and the same language is there in clause 12 for gas utilities, clause 13 for water utilities and so forth. With respect to the honourable minister, this is an exemption that will basically mean approthat there will no longer be any fixed line telecommunications services provided to any of these utilities in Australia other than by the NBN. All of the corporate and utility business of Telstra, Optus and other providers will be gone. The NBN, because it has the benefit of this enormous government subsidy, will be able to undercut anybody else. It will have the dominant if not monopoly fixed line infrastructure and it will take over that business. If the government seriously believes what the minister just said, it has been deluded, conned or misled. I recognise that we are not going to divide on this amendment tonight, but this is something that I would commend to the government and the Senate committee to reflect on very deeply. I listened very carefully to what the minister said and if the object that he sought to achieve in this bill was as he described, that object is not there. He has been sold a pup. Question negatived.",97
200,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"I move opposition amendment (7): (7) Clause 41, page 35 (after line 30), insert: (3A) An NBN corporation must not supply an eligible service that is higher Layer 2 in the Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model. This can be dealt with fairly quickly because we are talking about the same issues. This refers to the layer 2 bit stream service. We are proposing here that, on page 35 of the bill, in clause 41, a new subsection is added which provides at 3A that an NBN corporation must not supply an eligible service that is higher than layer 2 in the OSI reference model. This is designed to ensure that NBN does not creep up into higher value added services, creep up the value chain, if you like, and depart from what is said to be its objective as a provider of that layer 2 service. This is a fairly technical area. I will not say any more about it simply because I know there has been quite a lot of correspondence between the government and the telcos and I think this section is probably in the stage of tentative amendment following those discussions. It is probably a matter that will be dealt with in the Senate committee. The bottom line is once again that this is a massive, highly capitalised government monopoly. The government has said it is to be wholesale only and it is to be like the freeway on which the retail service providers will be able to run their electronic buses, trucks, cars and trains and so forth. This amendment is needed, just as the other amendments were, to ensure that the wholesale-only freeway does not start to get into the retail carriage business. I hope that I have demonstrated to the House that there is ample scope for it to do so under the bill as it is currently drafted and that this restriction here is effectively some legislative belt and braces to ensure that it does not escape the bounds that we are seeking to set for it.",98
201,Mr ALBANESE,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (8.07 pm)than The government does not support this amendment. NBN Co.'s corporate plan and the government's statement of expectations very clearly set out that NBN Co. will operate at layer 2 of the network stack, but, for very good reason, the bill does not include that restriction. The government is reluctant to include technology specific limitations on NBN Co. unless and until there is a demonstrated need to do so. An inflexible rule could be counterproductive in terms of the services provided to customers. That was recognised by Telstra in its submission to the Senate committee that is examining the bills that the member for Wentworth referred to. Once the market situation is clearer, and should such certainty be required, clause 41 of the bill provides for the minister to make licence conditions on what services NBN Co. must or must not supply. With suitable carveouts, a restriction of the type contemplated by this amendment would most appropriately be dealt with by a carrier licence condition, if the need arises. For that reason the government will not be supporting this amendment. Question negatived.",98
202,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,I move now to my amendments (16) and (17).,98
203,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,Are you going to do (18) and (19)?,98
204,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"No. In fact, because we will divide on (17) I will just deal with that one now. Accordingly, I move opposition amendment (17): (17) After clause 96, page 79 (after line 15), insert: 96A Freedom of Information Act NBN Co is taken to be a prescribed authority for the purposes of the dom of Information Act 1982. This amendment is designed to make the NBN Co. a prescribed authority for the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act 1982. I will speak in apprehension of the amendment coming from the Greens, which, regrettably, is one where the Greens have been sold a big pup by the government. Initially the Greens were proposing to move the same amendment that we describe here. This would have had the effect of bringing the NBN under the ambit of section 9 of the Freedom of Information Act, so it would then be an agency within the meaning of that act and would be subject to that act. This does not mean that every document of the NBN could, willy-nilly, be produced. The NBN would then be able to claim exemption under part IV of the Freedom of Information Act, including section 42, ‘Documents subject to legal professional privilege'; section 46, ‘Documents disclosure of which would be contempt of parliament or contempt of court'; section 45, ‘Documents containing material obtained in confidence'; and section 47, ‘Documents disclosing trade secrets or commercially valuable information'. It is absolutely critical that the NBN is thoroughly accountable in this regard. Unfortunately, the amendment that the Greens will propose shortly-and the House may consider this in some detail when they propose it-has the effect of making the NBN completely immune in practical terms from the Freedom of Information Act. The Greens amendment, which I understand the government has persuaded them to put up, has the effect of making exempt all documents of the NBN which can be described as being ‘in relation to its commercial activities'. Given that the NBN is a business, it has no activities which are other than commercial. The words ‘in relation to' have been Freeconstrued by the courts on many occasions as being of very great ambit. So if ‘commercial activities' has a defined meaning-and of course that has a very broad meaning; it is hard to imagine a term that is more generous in its compass-adding the words ‘in relation to' makes it wider still. I would ask the member for Melbourne, when he moves his amendment, to advise us what documents of the NBN would not be exempt under his amendment. We have, frankly, the farce of the Greens, who are claiming that they are interested in accountability and transparency but have been gulled or conned by the government into a set of amendments that will make the NBN, for all practical purposes, completely immune from disclosure of any documents under the Freedom of Information Act. The amendment that we propose, and which the Greens did in fact support some time ago, is much more appropriate. It makes the NBN a prescribed authority under the Freedom of Information Act, which makes it an agency for the purpose of the act. The act gives it extensive exemptions that we are all familiar with, including those that I described. This is an effective Freedom of Information Act amendment which will result in the NBN being accountable without commercially confidential, trade secrets, legal documents et cetera being obliged to be produced. (Time expired)",98
205,Mr ALBANESE,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (8.14 pm)The government do not support this amendment moved by the member for Wentworth. This amendment makes NBN Co. subject without express exception to the FOI Act. The government are committed to transparency and scrutiny of our NBN policy, so we have agreed to have NBN Co. subject to the FOI Act with appropriate protection for its commercial activities. I indicate to the House that the government will be opposing the amendment moved by the member for Wentworth but we will be supporting the amendment to be moved by the member for Melbourne. I indicate to the House that it might be convenient for members of the House for the amendment moved by the member for Melbourne to be considered immediately after this amendment is dealt with, given that, my understanding, the opposition will not seek to divide on the remaining amendments moved by the member for Wentworth and, I would assume, will support the third reading of the act. The government has agreed to support amendments being moved by the member for Melbourne to subject NBN Co. to the FOI Act with the same exemptions that apply to other government business enterprises like Australia Post. This is just a common-sense provision, one that maximises transparency whilst ensuring that we protect the confidentiality of NBN Co.'s commercial activities. It is worth pointing out that NBN Co. is not covered by the FOI Act because the act does not apply to Corporations Act companieswhich NBN Co. is-which are not prescribed authorities. Prescribed authorities are entities which are by default covered by the FOI Act. So, contrary to some coverage of this issue, no decision was made by the government to exempt NBN Co. It is exempt simply because of its identity as a Corporations Act company. The government opposes the amendment of the member for Wentworth because it considers that it is too broad and disregards NBN Co.'s legitimate commercial interests.",99
206,Mr TURNBULL,NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK,"I must correct the minister. He said that the amendment of the Greens-and I appreciate we are effectively debating these together-will put NBN Co. in the same position as Australia Post. That simply is not true. Division 1 of part II of the Freedom of Information Act is titled ‘Agencies exempt in respect of particular documents'. It lists, for example, the: Australian Broadcasting Corporation, in relation to its program material and its datacasting content … So the commercial activities of the Austrait is lian Broadcasting Corporation-and it does engage in quite extensive commercial activities, as we know-are not exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. It refers to the: Australian Postal Corporation, in relation to documents in respect of its commercial activities … I would encourage my friend the member for Melbourne to listen to this because I am trying to save him from an embarrassing blunder here. Section 7, subsection (3)(a) defines ‘commercial activities'. It is said to mean: (a) activities carried on by an agency on a commercial basis in competition with persons other than governments or authorities of governments … So it is only the activities of Australia Post that are competitive with other companies' activities that fall into that definition. However, the Green-Labor amendment proposes to insert the NBN Co. in this list of agencies that are exempt in respect of particular documents and to state that the NBN Co. is exempt in respect of documents in relation to its commercial activities, but to define ‘commercial activities'-in a new subsection, 3A, to go into section 7-as meaning activities carried on by NBN Co. on a commercial basis. A ‘commercial basis' really means any basis other than a charitable basis, so-the member is shaking his head, but I can assure him I am right here-any basis on which the NBN Co. is providing services in return for reward is clearly a commercial basis. It is not going to be providing services for free. Given that the entirety of the NBN's activities is conducted on a commercial basis, no documents would fall outside of this exemption. So the government has gone to the Greens and said, ‘Oh, look, that amendment you're proposing which is the same as the opposition's is just a little too broad; we can tighten it up a little bit and you'll still get what you want.' But the NBN Co. will be, for all practical purposes, completely exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. So the amendment of the Greens which we are going to consider after this and which we will divide on, we will vote against it, is a solemn farce. It is an insult to this House. It is a con. The Greens have been sold a pup. The party that claims to have been part of the group to ‘let the sunshine in' is in fact a party to the government locking it out. Our amendment on the other hand, as I said earlier, will make the NBN Co. a prescribed authority and, hence, an agency covered by the act, with all of the traditional exemptions, including those relating to documents that are commercial-inconfidence and commercially valuable. All of those exemptions will be there, and appropriately so. Our amendment, which I commend to the House, will let some sunshine into the NBN Co. The Greens amendment will lock it out forever.

207,Mr TURNBULL,NOES,"by leave-I move together amendments (16), (18) and (19) circulated in my name: (16) Clause 96, page 79 (lines 13 to 15), omit the clause, substitute: 96 Public Works Committee Act NBN Co is taken to be an authority of the Commonwealth to which the Public Works Committee Act 1969 applies under section 6A of that Act. (18) Schedule 1, clause 1, page 82 (line 6), omit “(1)”. (19) Schedule 1, clause 1, page 82 (lines 12 to 25), omit subclauses (2) and (3). Amendment (16) has substantially already been dealt with today in the motion about the Public Works Committee but it would have substituted a new clause 96 to have the NBN Co. taken to be an authority of the Commonwealth to which the Public Works Committee Act applies. I will not repeat the arguments I made about that earlier today in respect of the motion. The other amendments are designed to ensure that the ability of the NBN to go into retail businesses is limited. I am referring now to page 82. The aim would be, for example, that an NBN company would not be able to buy a retail carriage service provider at all. Under the current proposed bill the NBN would be able to acquire a retail carriage service provider but dispose of it after 12 months. There is no justification for that, because, frankly, if they were to buy a company that had fixed-line infrastructure but had a retail service business attached to it then it would not be very challenging to so PAIRS agree that the retail service business would be disposed of prior to the completion of the acquisition. This is another example of the rigorous, belt-and-braces approach we are taking to ensure that the NBN is genuinely a wholesale-only business. What we are proposing here is entirely consistent with the objects of the act. There is simply no need for the NBN to be able to hold or control a retail service provider for any period at all.",102
208,Mr ALBANESE,NOES,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (8.36 pm)The government does not support these amendments. Amendment (16) is to change the fact that the bill makes the NBN Co. exempt from the Public Works Committee Act. The amendment moved by the member for Wentworth attempts to remove that exemption. He is still proceeding with this amendment in spite of the fact that the parliament carried a resolution earlier today to establish a joint select committee, which will be chaired by the member for Lyne, to look into these very issues. It is an extraordinary proposition and, frankly, I am surprised that the member for Wentworth continues to pursue this position, which has already been rejected by this parliament once today. The government does not support amendments (18) and (19). As drafted, the bill contemplates that NBN Co. might purchase other companies where this might help in the rollout of its network and the provision of high-speed broadband services. However, NBN Co. is required by the bill to be a wholesale provider, a rule that would breached if NBN Co. acquired a company with retail operations. NBN Co. would therefore need to put in place transitional arrangements for divesting any acquired retail operations. Under the bill, there is a 12month window for such transitions, a period that the government and NBN Co. consider to be reasonable and that is long enough to avoid NBN Co. having to engage in fire sales at possibly reduced prices. The proposed opposition amendment removes the period within which NBN Co. must divest the retail operations. The effect of this would be to prevent NBN Co. from acquiring a business that has retail operations until that business had divested its retail arm. This would likely lead to delays in the rollout. There seems to be no real justification for such an amendment and it would have the effect of promoting fire sales, to the benefit of others, limiting NBN Co. flexibility. The government does not support this amendment, as it does not support the other amendments which have been moved which attempt to constrain the success of NBN Co. Those opposite are determined to undermine the NBN. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition gave the member for Wentworth the task of destroying the NBN. These amendments, which are designed to undermine the success of the National Broadband Network, should be rejected by this parliament. Question negatived. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

On current estimates the NBN will see one of the largest sums of public money invested in one of the largest infrastructure projects in our history. Accordingly, the Greens believe that the public does have a legitimate interest in how the project propre- ceeds and should have access to all relevant information through the FOI regime as well as through parliamentary mechanisms such as Senate estimates, the committee process and questions to ministers. The Greens are not prepared to see the continuation of a long-term trend of gradually corporatising government services and of then claiming information is commercial-inconfidence. That trend has to be rolled back and NBN Co. is the place to start. We also believe that maximum transparency is in fact the best way to build public confidence in the NBN. Senator Ludlam announced in mid-January our intention to take action to make NBN Co. subject to the Freedom of Information Act, and it is that announcement that these amendments implement today. The amendments provide that the NBN Co. is subject to the freedom of information regime under the Freedom of Information Act. The amendments seek to have the NBN Co - and this is an important point, because it has been raised in the debate so far-subject to the same level of transparency as Medibank or Australia Post, while affording NBN Co. a level of protection for material that is genuinely commercially sensitive. I have listened to the contribution from the member for Wentworth, who has suggested that this is somehow a deviation from our original intention. The point that we made at the start was very, very clear-that is, we always wanted the FOI regime to apply but not in such a way that it would put NBN Co. at a commercial disadvantage. I understand from what the member for Wentworth has said that he does accept that it is appropriate for trade secrets and other commercially valuable information to be outside the reach of FOI as it applies to the NBN Co. However, the approach that has been taken by the opposition is that, rather than treating the NBN Co. similar to other government business enterprises such as Australia Post, they would rather apply FOI to the NBN Co. in the same way that it applies to departments of state or public sector agencies. That would force NBN Co. to defend trade secrets and other commercially sensitive information on a case-by-case basis as each request is received, which in turn would lead to a significant risk that NBN Co.'s competitors would gain access to its trade secrets and would also significantly divert its resources. There has been a lot of talk about ‘pups' and suggestions that the Greens have been sold one. The member for Wentworth seems keenly able to identify a pup when he sees one. I would ask him or his colleagues, if he believes that is the case, to ters when the amendment to the bill comes before the Senate inquiry, because it is something that we will consider in good faith. Our intention behind these amendments is to have a narrow definition of commercial activity that essentially puts the NBN Co. on the same footing as Australia Post or a similar government business enterprise. Information is central to knowing how our elected representatives are exercising their power and to holding our representatives to account. Transparency and accountability is particularly pertinent in the expenditure of taxpayers' money. The Greens believe that open and transparent government is a prerequisite to an effective democracy.",103
211,Mr TURNBULL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I was touched to hear the member for Melbourne say that the Greens were committed to open and transparent government! I was interested to hear the member for Melbourne say that this amendment would ensure that the NBN was subject to the Freedom of Information Act but was able to keep protected only those documents that were really commercially sensitive. This is where the member for Melbourne does his party, this House and this country a great disservice moving this amendment, because it is, as I said, a con. I will take the member for Melbourne through this. His amendment will include the NBN in division 1 of part II of the Freedom of Information Act-this is on page 173 of the Freedom of Information Act. His amendment will say that its documents are exempt if they are in relation to its commercial activities. His amendment also adds an additional subsection to section 7-that is at page 17 of the Freedom of Information Act. I am sure that the member has got that at his fingertips! That new section 3A defines commercial activities in respect of the NBN as being activities that are carried out ‘on a raise these mat- commercial basis'. I ask the member for Melbourne-and he has the opportunity to speak as often as he likes in these debates-to give the House one example, just one, of a document or a class of document that would not be exempt under the amendments he has moved. The NBN is a commercial enterprise. It is a businessnot a particularly well-constituted business and it is not, certainly, going able one, but it is a business-so all of its activities are conducted on a commercial basis. He said that this would be similar to Australia Post, but it won't, because the definition of commercial activities that applies to it are activities which are carried on in competition with persons other than governments or authorities of governments. So the NBN, which will be a monopoly on a fixed-line basis but will nonetheless be in competition in some parts of its business and not in competition in others, will nonetheless be exempt in respect of documents right across its entire business. I would invite the member for Melbourne to give us an example of a document or a class of document which his amendment will enable to be produced under the Freedom of Information Act and will not be exempt under his amendments.",105
212,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (8.50 pm)The government supports the amendments moved by the member for Melbourne. They get the balance right between transparency and accountability whilst also making sure that we provide appropriate protection for the confidentiality of NBN Co.'s commercial activities. The member for Wentworth, of course, always thinks he knows better, which is maybe why he is the member for Wentworth and not the Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that we have received advice from the appropriate departments, including the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, that the amendments do indeed create the effect that is intended by the member for Melbourne. They are therefore supportable because they do get that balance right and do not undermine the effectiveness of the National Broadband Network. I commend the amendments to the House.",106
213,Mr TURNBULL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,I would repeat my call to the member to be a profit- for Melbourne,106
214,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,The member for Wentworth is straying. I think you are straying into abuse of a member.,106
215,Mr TURNBULL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I respond to the minister by noting that neither he nor the member for Melbourne, despite my invitation, has been able to nominate one document or one class of documents that would be disclosable or discoverable under the Freedom of Information Act by the NBN after these amendments are enacted. They have not been able to do that, because there are not any. Every document of the NBN is in relation to ‘commercial activities', which is defined to mean activities carried out on a commercial basis. It does not carry on activities, one hopes, other than on a commercial basis. So this amendment is a solemn farce. The minister says that the member for Wentworth thinks he knows best. I am inviting him and the member for Melbourne, whose amendment it is, to correct me and to demonstrate the types of documents that will be disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act following the passage of this bill as amended in these amendments.",106
216,Mr BANDT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I hesitate to rise to the bait, but I have two points. The same classes of documents that can be FOIed from Australia Post, Medibank Private or similar government business enterprises will still be able to be FOIed under this amendment. It puts them on an equal footing, and that is a very square and clear answer to the member for Wentworth. Secondly, the member for Wentworth seems far better able to identify a pup than anyone else, and I invite him or his colleagues to bring their dog identification skills to the Senate committee that is looking at this, because, if he is able to give more persuasive advice than we have received or than has come from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, we will look at it. But so far we are convinced that this amendment gets the balance right: it makes sure that the NBN Co. is not subject to an unfair situation which would put it at a commercial disadvantage, but still ensures that it is subject to the FOI regime. Question agreed to.",106
217,Mr TURNBULL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"by leave-I move amendments (1) and (2) circulated in my name together: (1) Schedule 1, item 50, page 21 (lines 20 to 32), omit subsection 152AXC (4), substitute: (4) NBN must not discriminate between access seekers on the basis of the ume, number, quantity or amount of goods, services or other things that cess seekers acquire or agree to acquire. (2) Schedule 1, Part 3, page 47 (line 1) to page 69 (line 4), omit the Part. Amendment (1) is a very important amendment. It really deals with a critical issue of fairness. Members in this House have complained often and loudly about the dominance of Telstra-or, indeed, other big telcos, such as Optus. What we are seeking to do here is to ensure that the NBN cannot discriminate between access seekers-retail service providers, whether big, small or medium-sized-on the basis of volume, number, quantity or amount of goods, services or other things that access seekers acquire or agree to acquire. It will come as no surprise to the House that Telstra do not support this amendment, because naturally, as they will be the biggest foundation customer of the NBN, they no doubt look forward to discounts based on volume or other services that are being exchanged or transacted between the NBN and themselves. So this is the first amendment. I ask the government: are they serious about a level playing field? Do they seriously believe they are creating a level playing field in the NBN? If they do then we should delete proposed subsection (4) of proposed section 152AXC-which, of course, basically permits types of discrimination-and insert a new provision which provides that there cannot be any discrimination on the basis of volume. The second amendment deals with what has been called ‘cherry picking'. This is a matter of white-hot concern to many players in the telecommunications sector, large and small. This amendment involves part 3, and we are proposing to delete all of it. What this is designed to do is to ensure that any other broadband service or facility comparable to vol- the NBN that can provide fast broadband services must offer its services on exactly the acsame terms as the NBN. Let us make no mistake: this is an anti-cherry-picking device. What this is designed to do is to prevent other companies from having infrastructure in cities or more densely settled areas or for particular corporate customers and, if you like, cherry picking the better parts of the Australian fixed-line broadband business. The government justifies this extraordinary restriction on competition on the basis that it needs to protect the economics of the NBN. That has been made quite clear in the explanatory memorandum, in the MCKinsey study and in the business case. So, having set up this massive, overcapitalised, government-owned monopoly-which it should not have set up in the first place-the government is now restricting competition from other telcos in order to preserve the economics of that body. It says, ‘If PIPE Networks, Internode or Optus competes and offers services in the cities, it will stream off some of the profitable areas and that will make it harder for us to provide services in the bush.' We say that if broadband services are going to be provided in the bush-and they should be-and they cannot be provided on a commercial basis then the subsidy should be absolutely explicit, and it should come out of the budget. There is no reason to impose higher telecommunications charges on people in urban and metropolitan Australia to cross-subsidise the bush. (Time expired)",107
218,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (9.00 pm)Defending the interests of his electorate against regional Australia is an interesting position for the member for Wentworth. One thing the National Broadband Network is aimed at is overcoming the tyranny of distance, by providing access to people in regional Australia, who have been denied access by the failure of the previous government. The government does not support these amendments. With regard to volume discounts, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network Measures-Access Arrangements) Bill 2010 as drafted provides the default position that NBN must not discriminate in the terms and conditions on which it provides access. In order to provide opportunities for innovation and differentiation by service providers, the bill allows for different treatment by NBN Co. but only where it aids efficiency. The ability to discriminate to reflect demonstrable efficiencies is well accepted in economics. It is already provided for under part XIC of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. While stakeholders have been generally supportive of the principle of this kind of discrimination, there have been some concerns about the possibility that it will favour Telstra in particular, which it is could benefit from volume discounts. The bill, therefore, includes appropriate safeguards. Under the bill, volume discounts would also have to satisfy the efficiency test and, as an added safeguard, NBN Co. will not be able to offer a volume discount unless it is in accordance with an undertaking that has been approved by the ACCC. Any differentiated deals must be published, so there will be full transparency and the ACCC and access seekers can take action if they consider that the rules have been breached. The government's view is that the discrimination permitted by the bill is good policy and that there are strong protections against preferential treatment based on volume that does not aid efficiency. This amendment is unnecessary and, in fact, goes well beyond the stated intention of banning volume discounting. In fact, it prevents NBN Co. from offering any sort of differentiated terms to aid efficiency. Further, this amendment would reduce the opportunities for service differentiation and innovation that increases productivity and efficiency, which is why the government will not be supporting it. I now address amendment (2) that has been moved by the member for Wentworth. The government also does not support this amendment. Under the proposed rules, new, upgraded or significantly extended fixed line access networks offering speeds in excess of 25 megabits per second and servicing residential and small business customers will need to offer a wholesale layer 2 service on an open access basis. The provisions do not prevent firms entering the market; they simply require them to comply with supply and access requirements comparable to those applying to NBN Co. when they do. The provisions do not require competitors to feared match NBN Co.'s actual terms and conditions; they simply subject them to comparable layer 2 open access requirements. The object of these requirements is to ensure that end users have access to the same kinds of service outcomes available on the NBN regardless of the network provider. Moreover, the rules will mean NBN Co. is not hindered in delivering its objectives, ticularly uniform national wholesale pricing, by strict regulatory requirements while competing against other less regulated providers of superfast broadband. NBN Co. indicated in its corporate plan that it intends to implement the government's uniform national wholesale pricing objective through subsidising high-cost, low-revenue regions with revenue raised from low-cost, high-revenue regions. It is not fair to simply allow competitors to opportunistically target lucrative markets while leaving the challenging high-cost, low-revenue ones to NBN Co. The requirement is forward looking and will have minimal impact on existing providers and their operations. Exemption and transitional mechanisms have also been included in the bill to provide sensible flexibility. The opposition's amendment has the potential to leave some communities' service outcomes below those available on the NBN and to undermine the government's policy that NBN Co. deliver uniform national wholesale prices. The government does not support this amendment and the government believes that this amendment is contrary to the objectives of the National Broadband Network and contrary to the government's view that equitable delivery of NBN is vital for Australia and vital particularly for those who live in regional Australia. (Time expired)",108
219,Mr HARTSUYKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I welcome this opportunity to speak on opposition amendments (1) and (2) to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network MeasuresAccess Arrangements) Bill 2010. Certainly it is of concern that we are going to create potential discrimination between telcos when we are really keen to encourage as much competition in the market as possible. The offering of volume discounts, on whatever par- basis, does have the potential to create an advantage for the larger telecommunication companies over the smaller ones. Cherry picking is an important concept. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport referred to the fact that regional and rural Australia is of concern in this area. Where there is market failure that is where the government should be stepping in. That is the role for the government. What we do not want is government interfering where there is no market failure. These cherry-picking provisions have the potential to discourage innovation and new services. It is vital that the free market has the opportunity to compete right across the spectrum. We see highlighted here the very concerns that the opposition has been putting forward about this bill and this project-that we are going to have a subsidy being provided to the NBN. We have a massive financial subsidy through massive investment of government funds that would not be available to other competitors in the market. On top of that we have a distortion of the market through anticompetitive legislation that prevents competition. What will that result in? It will result in consumers paying more. So Australian consumers will be paying an effective subsidy to prop up the NBN project, as well as paying the massive capital cost that they are actually incurring. So, whilst we believe very much that there is a role for government in regional and rural areas to ensure that there is high-speed broadband, that role should not be achieved through artificially propping up the cost of broadband in metropolitan areas or on highvolume markets. It is a very important concept. If we are going to make Australia a 21st century superpower, we need highly efficient broadband services, and the way to do that is not to put restraint on competition and not to artificially stop innovation. We should be encouraging those things and we should be encouraging competition in every area of the market. In fact, the very cherry-picking provisions that you refer to as providing some form of subsidy for regional and rural areas, effectively at this point in time are retarding the rollout of fibre in a range of regional centres. People are concerned about the impact and suppliers are concerned about the impact of these very same cherry-picking provisions. So, contrary to what the minister has said in relation to the fact that this is somehow going to be the panacea to the problems of regional Australia, the reality is quite different. It is going to drive up the cost in metropolitan areas and, at the same time, it is retarding the rollout of fibre in some regional centres.",109
220,Mr TURNBULL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Our two leading telecommunications companies have made very good submissions to the Senate committee on this subject-PIPE Networks, which is a smaller company, and obviously Telstra itself. I want to refer the House to the submission of PIPE in particular. It states: Cherry-picking … is simply put the practice of a competing network operator building its network in areas where it is profitable to do so, and not building its network in unprofitable areas. Notwithstanding the pejorative terms used to describe this behaviour, such as ‘opportunistic cherrypicking', this behaviour in fact reflects the simple commercial reality that businesses-in telecommunications or in any other market-will only compete in a particular area if it is profitable so. It goes on to say: If building fixed-line networks in metropolitan areas but not regional areas constitutes cherrypicking, then PIPE and every other telecommunications carrier with infrastructure in the ground in Australia is guilty of cherry-picking. As the PIPE Networks' submission points out, what the government claims to be doing is creating a level playing field, but there is no level playing field. The NBN is a massively advantaged corporation. It has tens of billions of dollars of free capital provided by the taxpayer. Nobody else has got that. It has got an exclusive deal in respect of Telstra's infrastructure. Their conclusion is-and this is PIPE's submission, and indeed it is Telstra's too, substantially: … the proposed anti ‘cherry-picking' regime will give NBN Co a de facto monopoly on future competition in fixed-line telecommunications networks in Australia. The very purpose, they say, of the anticherry-picking regime is to deny network owners the benefits that flow from network ownership. It will require network owners to supply wholesale services to third parties on the same terms that they supply them to themselves and, in that way, disincentivise investment in competing fixed line telecommunications networks, leaving NBN with a de facto monopoly. That is exactly what the NBN implementation report says is the object of the policy. The Telstra submission makes a very powerful point by saying that Telstra has a monopoly fixed line business because of its historic background. Telstra has had to put up with cherry picking in the past. As it says: If by ‘cherry picking' the Government means competitive entry in areas where this is efficient, then it is not clear why this should be discouraged. This type of so-called ‘cherry picking' has been a feature of telecommunications markets into do Australia and around the world for the past two decades. Telstra's competitors have been able to enter in precisely this fashion, without access obligations being directly imposed by legislation. In other words, Telstra has been able to cope with cherry picking but the NBN, with all of the billions of dollars of additional free capiprop tal behind it, will not be able to do so. As far as regional and rural Australia are concerned-and the honourable minister talked about Marrickville in his electorate and Kempsey in my colleague's electoratethe simple fact is this: the people of Marrickville should be able to get access to telecommunication services at the lowest cost the market will deliver and insofar as people in Kempsey or any other regional centre are not able to get comparable services because of distance then there should be a clear, transparent subsidy through a USO or some other provision that comes out of the budget. Cross-subsidising by preventing competition in the city is anathema to anybody who believes in markets, in economic efficiency and indeed in a competitive approach to telecommunications. This cherry-picking legislation is another example of how this NBN is designed to suppress and subvert competition and promote monopoly instead of fostering the competitive market we should all be supporting. (Time expired)",110
221,Mr HARTSUYKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The issue of cherry picking is a very important one insofar as what it actually says about this project. The fact that we have these provisions at all should sound a warning bell to the taxpayers of Australia, a very loud warning bell, in fact, because we have a situation where we have a business plan, much of it kept secret, but in that business case that we have had published-the small section of the total document-we see an internal rate of return of only seven per cent, a very, very low rate of return indeed. It is not a rate of return which would encourage investment in a project of this magnitude, not a rate of return that would provide the required return on capital. It really is a finan- try. cial disaster for the taxpayers of Australia. But when we look at the issue of why we have these cherry-picking provisions, it is to up that very poor and feeble rate of return. When we start factoring in real, live competition-competition that the businesses of Australia have to meet every daythen the project goes from abysmal failure to something far worse than that. We get to a situation where, when we factor in competition at an arms length without the protection of cherry picking, the IRR falls to a point where you cannot even cover the cost of the interest on the project. It should be of great concern to the taxpayers that this government is going to invest in a project that is only kept viable through anticompetitive legislation. I wonder what the response of the government would be if one of our major corporates came to them and said, ‘Business is a bit tough. We are not really achieving the return we want for our shareholders, so we want you to put in a bit of legislation that is going to hamstring our competition, to prevent the competition from competing on a level playing field.' This is a very bad outcome for Australia. It is a bad outcome because Australian consumers are being denied the benefits of a fully competitive market. Australian consumers are being denied the benefits of a market that would be encouraging innovation. Instead, we have a situation where the government has, through legislation, created a massive monopoly, a big fat monopoly. Competitive pressures are the way that we provide a better outcome for consumers, not through creating a massive monopoly. We have a situation where the government is propping up this monopoly through anticompetitive legislation. This legislation is going to effectively drive up the cost to consumers, drive up the cost to business and eliminate innovation. That is a bad thing for this counIf the government is keen to ensure that we have the very best technologies and communications available to the people of this country then it should be encouraging innovation and competition. It should not be deterring it. If the government was really serious about providing the maximum return on funds invested, it would not be investing in a project that was only viable by virtue of anticompetitive legislation. It is an absolute outrage that the government would be investing in a project that requires not only a massive investment of taxpayers' funds but an incredible anticompetitive regime to keep it vaguely commercially viable. An IRR of seven per cent is far from commercially viable. It is not the rate of return that would encourage commercial investors to invest in the project. You would have to look in amazement at anyone who would commit $50 billion to a project on this basis. But, then again, if you look at the money that was poured into pink batts and if you look at the money that was poured into the BER, I guess the same sorts of decision-making processes apply. If there is a good outcome that can be spun, it is worth the risk to the taxpayer. Question negatived. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",111

I commend very much this historic next step forward in the creation of the National Broadband Network. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 MEASURES No. 5) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 November, on motion by Mr Shorten: That this bill be now read a second time.",112
223,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"This Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 5) Bill 2010 has seven schedules. I will run through each of those schedules briefly at the outset and outline the opposition's position on this bill. As with most tax laws amendment bills, members would be aware that many of the schedules are not contentious. With this bill there is one schedule that the coalition wants to see further information on and reserves its position on until the outcome of an already underway Senate inquiry. I will run through each of those schedules. As I said, there are seven schedules. The first schedule deals with film tax offsets. The second schedule deals with amendments to the capital protected borrowing provisions. The third schedule relates to capital gains tax in situations where there is a compulsory acquisition taking place. The fourth schedule deals with deductions in benefits for terminal medical conditions related to superannuation. The fifth schedule deals with non-profit subentities. The sixth schedule deals with technical details related to running balance accounts. The seventh schedule deals with education expenses, tax offsets specifically related to school uniforms. As I said at the outset, the coalition do not regard as contentious most of the schedules in the bill and we will not be opposing the bill in this House. However, with regard to schedule 2, relating to capital protected borrowings, we do note that there is some history to this and it does warrant further consideration, which is occurring, as I said, through a Senate committee inquiry that is underway. I should also point out that, as the shadow Treasurer has previously indicatedI think in the debate on the last tax laws amendment bill-we on this side of the House will be moving an amendment to this legislation to add a schedule, schedule 8, to provide for the public to receive a tax receipt for the tax that they pay. That has been canvassed and debated in this House and, unfortunately, rejected previously by the government. But we live in hope that, under the new paradigm of letting the sunlight in, the government will see the folly of rejecting a sensible amendment to provide taxpayers with tangible information about how their taxes are spent. I will deal with each aspect of the billand I am sensing, looking at the benches opposite, that it would probably suit the parliamentary secretary on duty, the member for Ballarat, if I dealt with these matters in some detail, for up to and including about 5½ minutes! Schedule 1 deals with two changes to the eligibility criteria for accessing the film tax offsets, reducing the qualifying expenditure threshold for the post-digital visual effects offset from $5 million to $500,000, and removing local production expenditure requirements for films between $15 million and $50 million. I have already mentioned schedule 2, and I will leave that until the Schedule 3 deals with extending the mainresidence capital gains tax exemption to deal with events-as was noted in the explanatory memorandum and the minister's speechwhere there is a compulsory acquisition of part of the adjacent land or structure of a main residence. This is where there is an involuntary event, to ensure that that existing exemption applies. Schedule 4, as I outlined, deals with changes to the rules surrounding deductions in relation to benefits for terminal medical conditions. In doing so, it allows for costs associated with providing terminal medical condition benefits to become tax deductible. Schedule 5 allows non-profit subentities to access the goods and services tax concessions available to the parent entity, including the higher registration turnover threshold available to non-profit bodies. As I understand it, this essentially legislates what the Commissioner of Taxation's interpretation has effectively been and gives some certainty to it. I cannot ever allow any amendment relating to the goods and services tax to pass by-and I do this in every debate-without at least mentioning the fact that those opposite, who so vigorously opposed the goods and services tax, with every tax laws amendment bill inevitably find themselves protecting its operation and its base. I like to point that out every time we debate a schedule relating to the GST. Schedule 6 of the bill provides that it will not be mandatory for the tax commissioner to apply a payment, credit or running balance account surplus against a tax debt that is a business activity statement amount unless that amount is due and payable. The history behind this recommendation and indeed the earlier one, I am told, is that they were made by the Board of Taxation in its review of the legal framework relating to the administraend. tion and operation of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act. I return to schedule 2, which I indicated at the start is the one schedule on which the coalition do want to receive further information. This schedule makes amendments to the capital protected borrowings provisions. The coalition, and shadow Assistant Treasurer Senator Cormann in particular, are concerned about these provisions because the changes to the benchmark interest rate for those capital protected borrowings have a history in terms of government announcements and industry reaction, and all of the indications are that there should be further work in this area. We know that if the government can effect a tax increase in any way, as the shadow Treasurer knows, they will surely do soMr Hockey-Like rats up a drainpipe!",112
224,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"sometimes brazenly, as we have seen in the last week, and many times secretly. Whichever way, they are always thinking of a tax increase. the government made its original announcement. Industry was not consulted about the change. The government did make an amendment or a change to that. Industry still believes that the outcome itself will severely disadvantage that sector. We are told the government will have gained revenue of $170 million over the forward estimates, but that includes, I am advised, a cost of $28 million for a change to its original announcement way back in 2008, on budget night. At this time, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee is examining schedule 2 of the bill, and the coalition will not take a final decision until that Senate committee has reported. But, as I said, we will not be opposing the bill in this House. Debate interrupted. NA",114

226,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to pay tribute to one of the greats of the club movement in New South Wales, Barry Alliston, who for 10 years served as the president of my beloved North Sydney Leagues Club. Barry passed away unexpectedly in December last year and I recognise in this place, the House of Representatives, his contribution to our community. For those of us raised on the North Shore of Sydney, the North Sydney Leagues Club is a mighty institution. Its association with the great North Sydney Bears meant that, in days gone by, it was the sporting home for many Bears enthusiasts who would return there after a game at North Sydney OvalSo perhaps too often-to drown their sorrows. It remains a great club and is both a centre for and supporter of our community. Its membership is measured in the tens of thousands. To serve as its president for a decade is both an honour and a considerable responsibility. In Barry Alliston's case his term as president followed 10 years as a director, so he spent some 20 years on the club's boardsomething, I might say, that is not uncommon in the great club movement of Australia. Barry was very much a local boy. He grew up in Artarmon and attended Artarmon Public School and the old Crows Nest Technical High. He married a girl from Croatia and raised his own daughter in the area. Being a fanatical Bears supporter was one of Barry's great passions and his service to the club was a manifestation of that. Like so many of us, he was passionate about a team that had something of a patchy performance over the years. Loyalty was what was important and you stuck with the Bears no matter what their fate. I know that Barry would have loved to have seen the return of the Bears to the NRL in 2013, even in their new Central Coast incarnation. As president of the club, Barry oversaw its transformation to meet the changing needs of its members and patrons. We all know that many clubs have struggled in recent years but Norths remains a successful and popular venture. That it has adapted so well is a testament to Barry's leadership. On a personal note, Barry was a person whom I greatly admired. He was born and bred a Labor man and I am not sure that I ever received his vote. In fact, one day I member catching him handing out how-tovotes for the Labor Party at Chatswood West Public School. Nonetheless, I would describe him as a good friend and someone who never hesitated to help me in my work as a federal member of parliament. He was certainly prepared to put aside his own political views in the interests of the club and the community. He similarly provided considerable support and encouragement to two of my state colleagues, Gladys Berejiklian and Jillian Skinner, and I am sure that they would want to be associated with these remarks. They are of course in the middle of a general election in New South Wales. Barry will be missed by all those associated with the club. He will be very hard to replace. To the Norths board and members; to his partner, Judy, who was obviously devastated at the loss of Barry; and ter, Diana, I extend my sincere sympathy. I also extend the sympathy of the nation. The club movement in my state has produced some giants and Barry Alliston was surely one of them. I offer a further condolence to all of those members of the Norths club who managed to attend the funeral for Barry and recognised Barry's considerable service to our great local community. Miskin, Dr Sarah",114
227,Mr GRIFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Bruce) (9.34 pm)Tonight I want to recognise and celebrate the contribution to this parliament, to Australian academic life and to journalism of Sarah Miskin, a former member of the Parliamentary Library staff, who recently died of breast cancer. Sarah was born on 18 November 1965 in Rangiora, New Zealand, a small town north of Christchurch. She was the second child of six to Beverley and William Sands. The Sands family were a loving family environment, but their life was rocked when William re- was killed in a forestry accident in April 1981, leaving Beverley to raise the six children. Sarah left home in January of 1982 and at 16 became the youngest person to be admitted to, and complete, the Wellington Polytechnic journalism course. This high achievement set the pattern for the rest of her life, as Sarah was a high achiever to the end, never satisfied until she knew what was over the next horizon. She returned to Christchurch in 1983 and began work as a journalist for the Press, the biggest daily newspaper in the South Island. In 1986 she married Ben Miskin, a man she first met on the journalism course, who was to be with her until the end. While they had no children of their own, in 1994 they became the guardians of Briony Sands, Sarah's little sister, and helped raise and to his daughguide her through life. Not completely satisfied with her journalism career, academia called. This led to a degree, followed by honours and then her master's at the University of Canterbury, all the while working nights at the Press and helping raise her sister. The achievements kept coming. A Fulbright journalism exchange in 1994 saw her working in the United States. In 1995 there was a Reuters Fellowship to study at Oxford. Then, in 1997, Ben and Sarah arrived in Canberra. Full-time study at the Australian National University led to a doctorate in 2004 for her thesis, entitled The OECD: ideas, institutions and social justice. Sarah was a major contributor to the corporate life of the political science program and to postgraduate matters, as vice-president of their association, representing them on faculty boards and committees and editing their journal. As her husband, Ben, has wryly commented, ‘Anything to avoid full-time study.' Sarah continued to be involved with academia and was book review editor for the Australian Journal of Political Science, a role that benefited greatly from her capacity for good judgment. Whilst completing her doctorate, Sarah also worked part time as a subeditor at the Canberra Times, where her outstanding skills for writing and editing were invaluable. But, most importantly from the point of view of this place, in 2002 she joined the staff of the Parliamentary Library, from where she made a particularly distinguished contribution to the parliament. As those familiar with the work of the Library will understand, Sarah's day-today responsibilities included responding to all manner of research inquiries-anything from whether Prime Minister Gorton opened the Woy Woy swimming pool in the 1960s to more detailed political science analysis in areas as varied as political philosophy, adverachieve tising, opinion polling and campaign techniques. Sarah developed a particular expertise in the field of funding and disclosure, which was much sought after and appreciated by the Library's clients. Sarah approached all such inquiries with diligence, independence, wisdom, intelligence and, most importantly, enormous enthusiasm. I know on the many occasions I harassed her for assistance she always went out of her way to help. I always valued her opinion and her willingness to assist. Beyond all the unattributed assistance to MPs, Sarah was responsible for producing 16 highly acclaimed research papers in her own right, particularly in the area of political finance, which are widely referred to in the academic literature. Sarah was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2008. After surgery and a gruelling round of chemotherapy, she returned to work in 2009. In perhaps the last professional accolade she received, Sarah was awarded a place in the prestigious Congressional Fellowship Program and left for Washington later that year. However, in January last year the cancer returned in multiple locations. As a result, she returned to Canberra for further treatment. The effects of this treatment meant that she could no longer continue with the Parliamentary Library, and she and Ben moved to Melbourne in August to focus on her treatment and to be nearer to her sister, Briony. By last November, it was clear that the cancer was not responding and Sarah decided to cease all further treatment. She enjoyed her final months in the company of her close family and died peacefully, with Ben by her bedside, on the morning of 19 February. Sarah developed a wide circle of friends, both personal and professional, in the worlds of academia, politics and journalism, both here and overseas. Her determination to ever greater heights was established at a very young age and never waned. She had great ambition and potential for further achievement, cut short by a cruel and untimely death. Our thoughts and condolences are with Sarah's family, particularly her husband, Ben; her sister, Briony; her brother-in-law, Jonny; and her friends and colleagues here in the parliament, at the ANU, in Manchester and Washington. She will be sorely missed. MediHearts Outreach Program Flynn Electorate: Carbon Pricing Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (9.39 pm)-I am speaking this evening to commend to the House the MediHearts Outreach Program that is being promoted by Brisbane based cardiologist Dr Rolf Gomes. The MediHearts Outreach Program aims to revolutionise the delivery of cardiac services across regional Australia, starting with a pilot program in Queensland. Over the past six months the program has gained significant momentum, including support from within the medical fraternity and private enterprise. The program is currently under review by the federal government as part of the Health and Hospitals Fund regional priority round, and I ask that this proposal receive favourable consideration. Cardiac disease remains the biggest contributor to the death rate and mortality for middle-aged and older Australians, including women. Even though significant advances have been made in cardiovascular health, non-urban and Indigenous Australians still endure poorer cardiac health outcomes compared to urban Australians, largely due to inequalities in the availability and delivery cardiac services. At its core, the MediHearts Outreach Program represents a state-of-the-art, custom designed vehicle which will visit regional towns, providing a consulting cardiologist and a full suite of non-invasive testing locally. Rural and remote health in Australia, especially the health of Indigenous Australians, should be among the top priorities of our healthcare system. I congratulate Dr Rolf Gomes on this program and I recommend it to every member of this parliament. I would also like to take this opportunity to talk about the effects of a carbon tax on my electorate of Flynn and particularly on the city of Gladstone. With two alumina refineries, Australia's biggest aluminium smelter, a cement works, a coal fired power station and up to four LNG plants that are new investments worth a total of about $45 billion and are ready to start or have already started this year, Gladstone becomes the ‘carbon capital' of Australia and the area potentially most affected by a price on carbon. When this is combined with the increased costs associated with the resource tax, Flynn is wearing a large cumulative cost. If a price on carbon is introduced ahead of the rest of the world it will damage the international competitiveness of these vital export industries which deliver thousands of jobs in Central Queensland. Mr Ripoll-You agree with it as long as the rest of the world does it first! Mr O'DOWD-Yes, that is okay. We will know the difference when there is no money coming out of those areas. Before introducing a price on carbon which affects these industries, the government should prove that it will not affect their competitiveness and it will not harm jobs. The burden of proof should rest with the government that is introducing the scheme, not with the industries of that are vital to the seat of Flynn. Live Below the Line Campaign",115
228,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about a campaign that I will be taking part in. Hopefully, in the five minutes that it takes me to give this speech, I will be able to convince my parliamentary colleagues here in the chamber today-like the member for Maribyrnong, the member for Oxley, the member for Parramatta, the member for Blair and maybe even you, Mr SPEAKER - to participate with me. I will be taking part in a fantastic campaign called Live Below the Line, which is a joint initiative of the Oaktree Foundation and the Global Poverty Project. Live Below the Line aims to raise awareness of extreme poverty around the globe by challenging all Australians to spend only $2 per day for five consecutive days on their food. At the same time, participants raise money for international aid projects and help to spread the word about the impact of extreme poverty and what all of us together can do to help. This year's campaign officially runs from 16 to 20 May, but participants can take part at any time of the year by signing up to the Live Below the Line website at: www.livebelowtheline.com. More than one-quarter of the world's population live on less than $2 a day, which means that more than 1.4 billion people around the world are classified as living in extreme poverty. ‘Poverty' means more than just being poor. It means not having access to the basic things in life that we in this chamber and in Australia take for granted, such as food, shelter, safe drinking water, sanitation, education and medical services. It means that 17,000 children starve to death around the world every single day. In the five minutes it takes me to speak on this issue, 60 children-60-will have died from starvation. This level of suffering and hardship is difficult for us in Australia to comprehend. We all know that Australia is second only to Norway on the United Nation's Human Development Index, which means we are right up at the very top. Our standard of living, education and per capita income is among the best in the world. An Australian earning $50,000 per year is in the top one per cent of the richest people in the world. Whichever way you look at it, it is extremely hard to deny that we are a prosperous and fortunate nation with enormous capacity to give, and we do give. The Australian government has increased foreign aid spending to record levels since being elected in 2007. Nonetheless, it is easy to lose sight of global picture. As we go about our daily lives, we can forget that even very small amounts of money can help smash the poverty cycle for whole families, communities or villages in some Third World countries. The deprivation the participants experience during the campaign will be nowhere near the deprivation experienced by people in Third World countries. We will only be doing it for one week and there will be light at the end of the tunnel; for a lot of these people there is absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel. By experiencing it first hand for a few days, I hope I will gain a better understanding of what it feels like to be trapped in grinding poverty, right at the bottom of, or outside, the economic ladder that we take for granted. Like many Australians taking part this year, I have made the commitment to take on this challenge with a degree of trepidation. But each time. I think about it I remind myself that my deprivation will hardly be the same as that of people living in real and extreme poverty every single day of their lives, knowing that their future will not change. I might have only $2 per day to spend on food, but, for the 1.4 billion people we are doing this for, $2 is their total spend for the day, including for shelter, clothing, medicine, and education. Unlike them, I will also have a roof over my head, I will have water that I can safely drink from the tap at any time. I wish and I will have access to a doctor if I get sick. These are all the things that we take for granted every day, but for one-quarter of the world's population they do not even come into the picture. (Time expired) Fuel Prices",117
229,Mr TEHAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak on an issue about achieving prosperity through competition, about ensuring that we have competitive enterprise in the Australia. Last week I presented the Main Committee a petition of 6,409 signatures from chief petitioner Bill Brown and the residents of Colac and district. The Colac and district community want to draw to the attention of the House that the price of petrol in Colac appears to be set by the two major food retailers and there is no effective competition between them. I commend Bill Brown and his team for their efforts in gathering support for this petition and I call on the government to ensure that the ACCC investigates this matter. If Australia, and especially its regional and rural communities, is to prosper, we have to make sure that there is proper competition in all sectors of the Australian economy. In the petition the Colac and district residents ask the House to take ‘positive action to provide the residents of Colac and district with ‘a fair pricing structure to ensure that the fuel they are getting is not overpriced. They would like the ACCC to investigate to see if there is unfair competition, if there is duopoly practice, and, if there is, to make some decisions which will prevent this occurring in the future. This petition of 6,409 signatures is no small thing, and I hope that this government will give it the attention and consideration it deserves. Colac and district has 13,000 to 15,000 people, so the fact that they got 6,409 signatures means that the residents are very worried about what is taking place. If they do not think that there is fair competition then we are beholden to investigate whether or not their concerns are real. The residents of this community are already struggling with electricity hikes, interest rate hikes and the increased cost of living under this Labor government. Sadly, they are likely to get hit again with the introduction of a carbon taxlet us call it what it is, a carbon tax. They cannot afford to have the two major food retailers in an uncompetitive environment, if that is what is operating, putting up the cost of their petrol. This issue is broader than one just of petrol. If we are seeing an increase in anticompetitive behaviour in the marketplace we need to act. One of the issues we have in the dairy sector at the moment is that one of the big supermarkets is using milk as a loss leader. If the supermarket wears milk as a loss leader and wears that to its profit, that fine. But if it does not and it is looking to vertically integrate so that it can control the whole food chain when it comes to milk and introducing dairy products then, potentially, we have an issue. If there is not fair competition within the marketplace, ultimately consumers will be the losers and we have to ensure that this does not happen. This is particularly important for our communities in regional and rural Australia. There is not the population to ensure that we get competition occurring naturally, so we have to ensure that when big players get involved they do not use the power of the market to intervene in a way which discriminates against the consumer. As the residents of Colac and district are telling the government through this petition, they are not happy if there is anticompetitive behaviour taking place and they want it fixed. I hope the government will get the ACCC to intervene in this matter. I hope it will look at it because competition is vital to the Australian economy and to our future. The government needs to intervene to make sure that we have proper competition in Colac. (Time expired) Cattle Grazing in National Parks",118
230,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak on what I see is a disturbing and fundamental attack on our national parks. One of the very early actions of the newly elected Liberal Victorian government was to allow graziers to take their cattle back into the state's Alpine National Park. When I first heard that I found it quite hard to believe. I went to the Victorian government's website and, sure enough, there it is. Down the side, under the Department of Sustainability and Environment's website, we have: Cultural Heritage Marine National Parks What's New is Cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park. It is presented as a scientific trial to investipoints gate the impact of the cattle on reducing fire. I have heard of scientific whaling-and now we have scientific grazing. It reminds me of the Vapors' song of the eighties: ‘I think they're turning Japanese, I think they're turning Japanese, I really think so.' On the next page of the website, they go further. It is a six-year scientific research trial that will help them meet their responsibilities to: … ensure that appropriate and sufficient measures are taken to protect each national park and state park from injury by fire. I would think that they also have an obligation to protect the national parks from injury by cattle. You do not need a six-year scientific research project to figure out how to do that-you actually get the cattle out. It is very simple. Because we are talking about fire-that is a serious matter; at least the Victorian government is talking about it-we do need to have a look at whether there is any reality to this notion. I will give three reasons why this might be a political smokescreen and not really about fire. Firstly, of the 10 recommendations from the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission about the need for research, cattle grazing was not one of them. Secondly, there is already significant research done on the impact of alpine grazing on fire reduction. It was done mainly after the 2003 fires swept across Victoria's Alpine National Park and was published in a peerreviewed journal: Some 100 kilometres of transects across grazed and ungrazed areas of the Bogong High Plains were measured for fire occurrence and … for fire severity. There is a comprehensive explanation of the research done on the Victorian National Parks Association's website. It says: There were 108km of transect lines, 419 survey points and 4050 twig measurements, with sample equally distributed across grazed and ungrazed country. It was found that grazing did not significantly lower the severity of fire measured by the diameter of the burnt twigs. In fact, the research comprehensively proved that there was no statistical evidence that grazing reduced the impacts of fire. Thirdly, when Premier Bracks made his decision in 2005 to remove cattle from the alpine parks, finally, he announced at the same time that grazing would be preserved in the high country state forests of Victoria. So there was grazing in the state forests and not in the Alpine National Parks. That had been the case since 2002. Grazing was temporarily suspended, then, to allow the national parks to recover from the fire. If it is necessary to undertake scientific research, there are already nearly nine years of comparisons available and it would be equally possibly to carry out that research in the high country state forests where grazing has been taking place for the last nine years and prior to that. While there is significant evidence that grazing does not reduce the likelihood of fire, there is also significant evidence that grazing has a significant negative impact on the alpine environment. In fact, there are over 60 years of scientific research to prove that they trample the stream banks, springs and soaks and they damage and destroy, in particular, the fragile alpine moss beds. If members of this House have not been to the highlands to see the sphagnum moss swamps, it really is worth doing. You can see them at Namadgi, very close to here, you can see them in the south-west forest and, of course, you can see them at Kosciusko, before you get to Victoria. They are well and truly worth seeing. There is overwhelming evidence that cattle in our national parks do serious damage. I cannot believe we are even having this conversation in 2011. This is an argument that I thought was won a long time ago. I really thought we had won this one. Our national parks belong to all of us, to all Australians, and it is about time we got these cattle out. South Australian Floods",119
231,Mr RAMSEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I spoke last week in this place on the flood levy. During that speech I recognised the great calamity the floods had caused in Victoria and Queensland. While I mentioned at the time some local damage from flooding in South Australia. I did not detail it, and I wish to do so tonight. Both December and February brought storms to the lower north and mid-north regions of the state. As I said, they were on a lesser scale than the floods which Victoria and Queensland faced. It is worth noting-it helps in understanding South Australia-that it is the most centralised state in the Commonwealth and, as a result, has a more sparse rural and regional population and a number of small councils. In fact, I have between 24 and 32 local government areas in my electorate, depending on how you define a local government area. But, big or small, the effect is the same if councils have unpredictable emergency costs which they could not possibly have allowed for in their budgets. I have been supplied with information from affected councilsestimates of the damage-which graphically illustrates the job at hand. Councils have fairly inflexible budgets. In fact, the only way they can raise extra revenue is by raising hikes. The rest of their revenue comes through fixed grants. The Flinders Ranges Council is centred on the Quorn and Hawker townships in the midFlinders Ranges. It is a very small council. They have had damages of $563,000 and this represents 43.5 per cent of their rate revenue of $1.3 million. The Regional Council of Goyder, which encompasses the towns of Hallett, historic Burra and Eudunda, is a small-to-medium council with total rate revenue of $3.7 million. They have had more than $10 million worth of damage or 265 per cent of annual rates. The Northern Areas Council, which is centred around Jamestown, Gladstone, Laura and Spalding and is adjacent to the southern Flinders Ranges, is a small-to-medium council. It has revenue of $3.7 million and has suffered damage of $320,000-a much smaller, but significant, nine per cent of rate revenue. The District Council of OrrorooCarrieton on the northern side of the Northern Areas Council and adjacent to the Flinders Ranges is the smallest council in the state. They have had damages of $950,000 or 154 per cent of their estimated rate revenue. The District Council of Peterborough, which is centred on the Barrier Highway, was built as the national crossroads for the steam-train network. It has a rating base of $1.05 million and they have had damages of $2 million or 190 per cent of that base. The Clare and Gilbert Valleys Council is not in my electorate. It is immediately to the south in the member for Wakefield's electorate. It is a bigger council with revenue of $9 million, but had $15 million worth of damage or 165 per cent of rates. While, as I said, the damage to these councils was smaller than the damage done to councils in the Queensland and Victorian areas, it was still significant. The roads have gutters down the middle, the verges are washed away and the towns have suffered flooding. In the town of Stockport, just to the south of my electorate in the Clare and Gilbert Valleys, 20 homes were destroyed in scenes reminiscent of the Queensland floods. They received household support but the damage to infrastructure that the council now has to deal with is significant. This begs the question: when is a disaster a disaster? To the individual councils, what, in dollar terms, would be an inconvenience for one can be disaster for another. In my speech on the floods I highlighted the fact that through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, Queensland, before the latest floods had received $310 million in the last 10 years; the most populous state, New South Wales had received $194 million; South Australia had received just $17 million; Western Australia, $27 million; and Victoria, including what has been the most horrific national disaster ever and the most expensive up until this year-the 2009 bushfires-had received $323 million. In closing, I raise these figures because I think there is a question of equity here. We know we are going to have a Senate inquiry into the national relief arrangements and the prospect of insurance for states. I think there also needs to be a re-examination of what these trigger levels are for separate states council areas. (Time expired) Manthey, Mr Frank",121
232,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT,"I meet a lot of interesting and innovative people in Ipswich and today I would like to speak about one outstanding and inspirational individual, Mr Frank Manthey. To give a bit of background, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, recently widowed Frank worked out west as a roo shooter for the Queensland department of environment. One night, over a beer, he met a zoologist with National Parks, Peter MCRae, who talked to Frank about his last decade's work searching for the elusive bilby. Frank agreed to go with Peter one night to try to catch a glimpse of the bilby. From that first sighting, Frank knew he had to do whatever he could to save the species from extinction. Listed as ‘endangered' in Queensland and as ‘threatened' nationally, the bilby was in serious trouble. Feral cats and farming activity were responsible for their plight so Frank and Peter, now known as the ‘bilby brothers', had a mission. Their mission was to create a bilby sanctuary in Currawinya National Park. This meant fencing off a 25 square kilometre area with an electrified predator-proof fence at an estimated cost of $300,000. This sum looked impossible, especially when they were both public servants and had to convince their bosses that their ambitious plan was both possible and necessary. Now, many people may not know Frank but he is one of Australia's silent heroes. I can tell you, Frank is to threatened species in Australia what Peter Cundall is to gardening. He is an extraordinary individual. The idea of raising $300,000 would stump most of us, but not Frank. He and Peter set out to raise the money all by themselves. They used everything from bilby information nights to selland ing bilby T-shirts, and, incredibly, the money was raised. I say ‘incredibly' but it becomes less of a surprise when you get to know how Frank operates. Frank and Peter featured on Australian Story and 60 Minutes. A documentary known as The Bilby Brothers has also been made about their extraordinary contribution towards bilby conservation. In 2002, Frank received the Australian Geographic conservation award. In June 2005, after three years of lobbying, Frank travelled to this very place to try to convince the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, to establish a national bilby day. It will come as no surprise to listeners that the minister agreed and the second Sunday of each September is now known as National Bilby Day. Frank does not get any credit for the work he has done. In fact, he is one of those rare individuals who are selfless in their work and commitment. I will share a summary of a touching letter that I read on the Save the Bilby website. It is from Steve and Merrin Curnow, whose son, Luke Curnow, tragically died from a brain tumour. The letter outlined Luke's passion for bilbies. It said: In 2010, on the anniversary of Luke's passing, Frank Manthey, co-founder of the Save the Bilby Fund, came to visit Luke's school, Eagle Junction State School. As a tribute to Luke, and to remember our beautiful little boy who loved bilbies, Frank brought Paul the Bilby to show the children and to share his story about his important work to save this national treasure. On that day the children, parents and school raised over $2,500 for the Save the Bilby Fund. This money will be used to further support the activities of the fund, to protect and promote the plight of one of our much loved, unique and endangered native animals. Luke would have loved the thought that he was able to make a difference and to help prevent the extinction of this precious Australian animal. In a further tribute to Luke a new baby bilby, born recently at the breeding program at Dreamworld, has been named Luke. This is an amazing honour to his family and friends and it is a lasting legacy for Luke. There are many similar stories on the Save the Bilby website and I encourage people to have a look. Between April and October last year, 4,771 people attended 198 bilby shows. There are now bilbies in shelters at Featherdale Wildlife Park, Taronga Park Zoo and Western Plains Zoo in New South Wales and at Dreamworld in Queensland. In fact, there is a very impressive display at Queen's Park in Ipswich, which the Young Queenslander of the Year, Jessica Watson, recently visited to meet a newly born bilby who is now her namesake. With the Easter period almost upon us, it is timely to remind everyone to bypass the bunnies and support the Save the Bilby Fund by purchasing a Darrell Lea Easter bilbyand I want to assure the House that I am not receiving any campaign contributions from Darrell Lea. Bilbies used to inhabit 80 per cent of the Australian landscape, but they now inhabit only some small pockets in a few states. I believe that if Frank Manthey and Peter MCCrae had not met over a beer in a pub all those years ago, the bilby would no longer exist. We have gone a long way towards saving the bilby. I want to commend to the House Frank's enormous contribution to native animal conservation and the bilby in particular. Bennelong Electorate: Supported Accommodation for People Living with a Disability",122
233,Mr ALEXANDER,ADJOURNMENT,"Given yesterday's release of the Productivity Commission's preliminary report into the National Disability Insurance Scheme, it is appropriate that further attention is focused on meeting the individual needs and supported accommodation requirements of people living with a disability. Bennelong is the home of a large number of disability service organisations and providers of supported accommodation facilities. I have the privilege of representing and interacting with many constituents who are working tirelessly in this important area. These organisations include the Royal Rehabilitation Centre Sydney; Macquarie Hospital; Crowle Homes, which has recently merged with the Achieve Foundation; the Ryde office of the Cerebral Palsy Alliance; the Shepherd Centre; and many smaller, volunteer-run community organisations. I would like to draw particular attention to Ryde Area Supported Accommodation for Intellectually Disabled, or RASAID. This determined group was formed six years ago by 19 local families who were struggling to secure accommodation and support for their 20 adult sons and daughters with intellectual disabilities. All of them required a high level of care, and some required it around the clock. Like many other parents of children with a disability, the families of RASAID live their lives on a rollercoaster of emotion and fatigue. Most of them are aged 50 or above, with their most senior member still a full-time carer at 87 years of age. The families of RASAID have supported each other for decades. Their adult children have grown up together attending school, day programs, work placements and social groups together. With more than 600 years of combined carers experience these parents are best positioned to advocate for the individual care and accommodation needs of their dependent children. They understand that there is no one-size-fits-all care or accommodation model. Significant funds are required at both the federal and state level. Hopefully the consultation surrounding the National Disability Insurance Scheme will provide guidance and options for future generations. My great concern is their urgent accommodation and housing needs. Despite the drain on their time, members of RASAID have attended over 60 meetings with state and federal MPs and departmental representatives in an effort to find a solution. I committed to continue working with my state and federal colleagues, RASAID and other disability service organisations and advocates to determine and pursue all available options to ensure we find suitable and acceptable solutions. My federal colleague and shadow disability minister, Senator Mitch Fifield, has visited Bennelong and met with the families of RASAID and will continue to advocate for their needs. The New South Wales shadow disability services minister, Andrew Constance, and the state MP for Ryde, Victor Dominello, are campaigning for changes in this area, and I hope that the 26 March election brings this squarely onto the government's agenda. We need to find a way to have the system fit those needing our support through specialist accommodation and not have a system where those with an intellectual or physical disability are required to conform to a bureaucratic standard. We must measure our support systems against international best practice and recognise that a choice of how, where and with whom a person lives should be a right that is afforded to all people. I strongly applaud the tireless efforts of the parents of RASAID and all the carers and those involved in disability services in Bennelong, and I pledge my ongoing support. Brisbane 2 Ipswich Challenge",123
234,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"As is rarely seen in these debates and in this House, I bring good news that is not of a political nature. Tonight I want to inform the House of a wonderful community event that brings together the young, the old, the fit, the not so fit and, most importantly, families from all walks of life. This year in my community we will be celebrating the 10th year of the Brisbane 2 Ipswich Challenge bike ride. This event had its first incarnation in have 2001 as the Links in the Chain Centenary of Federation Ride. It then became known as the Mall to Mall Ride and today is known as the Brisbane 2 Ipswich Challenge. It is not a race-in fact, it is not a long ride either-but it is lots of fun and an opportunity for young people, old people and people from all walks of life to just get out and enjoy cycling amongst the cycling fraternity and those who are not of that particular fraternity. For a lot of people it is an opportunity to reconnect with what is a fabulous pastime that has many benefits. There is many a keen cyclist in this place. We know of some of them but not everyone knows all of them. There are quite a few. Of course, I am one of those and over many years I have done my little bit here to encourage people to stay active and fit and to take up cycling as a non-impact form of having a bit of fun as well as staying fit along the way. The health benefits of cycling, of course, are clear and are well documented. It can increase fitness, improve muscle tone and strength, help prevent diseases such as heart disease and diabetes and is a great way to manage weight. Socially, of course, it is great fun and very enjoyable. It is a great way to spend time with friends and family and to discover new places. It is also an environmentally friendly way to get around. Apart from that, the only way to have a really decent cup of coffee is in the early morning, even before the sun is up. There is a whole subculture of people that exist out there that do this-way before the sun gets up. They are often your doctors, some professionals, some tradies-a whole range of people. It is really a great way to spend some time and you can do it before work, which is even better. One of the great benefits of doing the job that we do as members of parliament is that it does grant you the ability to do some things outside of the normal scope of politics. One of the things I enjoy more than anything else is my capacity to organise the community to raise money for good causes. I find that today it gives me greater pleasure than just about anything else I do. I devote some amount of my time to doing that in the community-to really to strive to make a difference in people's lives not only politically but from a community perspective. One of the ways I do that I do it in a number of ways-is to organise this bike ride. It is something that I take great pleasure in doing, although it generates a large amount of work in my office every year. Doing all this with just a few people is hard work. Every year we say, ‘Why do we do this?' and, ‘Will we ever do it again?' But this year will be the 10th year that we have done it. There are two people I especially want to mention-only two, although there are hundreds. The first is Peter Rea, from Peter Rea Design. This is the bloke that actually put me on to his idea many, many years ago. Very simply the story: I went to him and said: “Look, I want to do something in my community. I want to raise money for charity. I want to do something that I can leave behind, something beyond any politics that I do.' We had a good talk and he basically said ‘What do you like doing?' ‘I like to ride my bike.' He said: ‘There you go. That is what it's going to be. It's going to be a bike ride from Brisbane to Ipswich.' And there it was born-a simple way to do things over a light lunch. The other person I want to thank greatly is a guy called Nev Byers, a big fellow with a huge girth and a heart that is even bigger. He is the guy that gave me my first opportunity to make this a reality by donating some money to the event. All the money he gave went to charity. The way I have always run this ride is that we try to cover costs through sponsors, make sure there are no further costs beyond that and then give all the money that we raise to charity. The ride over the years has seen numbers anywhere from the very first ride of 40 people, which I thought was pretty spectacular at the time, all the way up to 1,000 people. So it has been a huge success and we have lots of great partners and people that help us. I would like to think it has become a bit of an iconic event in the regioncertainly plenty of people tell me that it is. This year we have moved it to a slightly later time. It is going to be on Sunday 22 May, because of the Queensland flooding, and we want to keep it as part of the Ipswich Festival. As I said, people from all walks of life and riding abilities come along. It is a race; it is about having fun and about participating. The most important thing is that we have raised over $150,000 in that time through a small event organised of the smell of an oily rag. The proceeds go to great beneficiaries such as the Heart Foundation and the Ipswich Hospital Foundation. (Time expired) Forde Electorate: Attack on Animals at Loganlea State High School",124
235,Mr VAN MANEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Forde) (10.19 pm)The Forde electorate is home to a great many state and private schools which contribute greatly to our community. As the federal member, I am concerned with the welfare of students, teachers and premises. Recently there have been acts of vandalism carried out on some of our schools, the worse of which was an attack on animals at one of our state schools. I was shocked to hear of the recent brutal attack on the poultry compound and horticulture department at Loganlea High School. Loganlea State High School is renowned for its innovative specialist programs, including EMC2 Mathematics for Engineers; targeted literacy and numeracy enhancement programs affiliated with Griffith University; Dance Performance; Sport Development Access; and Knowledge House, an Indigenous education support program. And, as the only metropolitan Gateway School of Agribusiness, its students have preferred enrolment opportunities with the University of Queensland Gatton campus. In the early hours of Monday, 7 February the perpetrators entered the compound and ransacked the area, torturing and murdering some of the animals within. These animals had been lovingly cared for by the students. This was a disturbing and violent act that left a number of tame farm animals wounded, missing and deceased. The violent acts were not carried out on approximately 15 tame farm animals housed there. The offenders beat and tortured the animals with a steel rake and metal pole. There were 14 animals missing as a result of the attack. I was very saddened to hear of the students being exposed to such cruelty. In an area of the electorate which is one of the less fortunate it was even more disturbing. Chicken and duck eggs were destroyed, a female turkey was decapitated and the school dog ‘Snowy' and two pigs, one of which was heavily pregnant, were brutally bashed. Although the school did a wonderful job getting it reopened a week later, many of the community programs that were run from the farm will be not begin again until the animals have recovered. The area is also actively used by those from outside of school-child care centres, nursing homes, the local hospital and some of the special schools. I commend the school and the principal, Belinda Leavers, for continuing to function as best they can. I would also like to thank PETA for lending a hand to educate local schools on the correct treatment of animals and for distributing emergency humane education materials. The work that PETA does in the community is invaluable, as it teaches young people the importance of treating all living creatures with respect and care. It is integral that we as a community band together to show that this is not an acceptable act and educate our young people as early as possible. This was a disgusting act of cruelty which one cannot even comprehend, and my sympathies and support go out to Principal Belinda Leavers and the Loganlea State High School community. I have strongly urged anyone with information on the attack to contact Crime Stoppers. This act has greatly impacted the local community, with many residents outraged at the attack. The local newspapers are currently rife with community members writing into voice their disgust. These events bring to the fore the caring and supportive community that I represent, and that is indeed an honour. They have banded together to help the school through this difficult time. It is my hope that those responsible for the attack will be found to prevent them from escalating their acts of violence. I would like to help in any way possible and, as I noted earlier, I urge anyone with information to come forth to the local police or Crime Stoppers. Petition: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria",126
236,Mr SHORTEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (10.23 am)-I present a petition relating to Australians who live with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, or PNH disease, which is a rare and potentially fatal disease of the blood. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Australian Citizens, who are friends, family or supporters of Australian sufferaround ers of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) disease, a rare and potentially fatal disease of the blood draws to the attention of the House the need to publicly fund out of the Federal Government, the only currently available treatment for PNH sufferers, namely Soliris® (Eculizumab) as a matter of urgency. We therefore ask the House to introduce and pass any legislation or to take any administrative action available to the House that will enable sufferers of PNH disease to urgently receive breakthrough life saving treatment for this very rare and debilitating disease. from 1,701 citizens Petition received.",127
237,Mr SHORTEN,ADJOURNMENT,"This petition has been considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions and has been certified as in accordance with the standing orders. The petition draws the attention of the House to the need to publicly fund the only available medication for PNH sufferers, the drug Soliris, as a matter of urgency. PNH can cause the onset of many varied health conditions, including disabling fatigue, poor physical function, fatal blood clots, chronic kidney disease, amnesia, stroke, heart failure and vital organ damage. The PNH Support Association of Australia has advised me that it kills one in three sufferers within five years of diagnosis if it is left untreated. The drug Soliris suppresses these symptoms and offers PNH patients a normal life span. Studies show that Soliris immediately and sustainably reduces the destruction of red blood cells in almost 100 per cent of patients living with PNH. Noting all of this, I am particularly pleased to recognise that, since this petition was initiated, the Gillard government, on 9 December 2010, approved funding for Soliris on Australia's Life Saving Drugs Program. This will make a huge difference to 100 of our fellow citizens' lives annually-plus, of course, the many more Australians who are family and friends of people who are living with PNH. In a letter I have received from Linda Charlton, the President of the PNH Support Association of Australia, she has written: On behalf of the PNH Support Association of Australia and all those affected by PNH, I would like to thank you for your show of support during our campaign for Government-subsidised PNH treatment. She goes on to write: This decision (to approve funding) has put an end to a great deal of anxiety and frustration felt by the PNH community, which-without access to effective PNH treatment-faced further deterioration of health, reduced quality of life and, mately, death. I acknowledge the role played by the supporters of this petition-and in particular my hard working and very capable electorate officer, Annette Hibberd, and her great friend Grace Gallucci, who lives with PNH-in bringing this issue to the attention of the government and the parliament. I firmly believe it remains an integral part of our democracy-an organic, street-wise and, indeed, long standing practice of accountability-that we present petitions like this one in this place. The fact that this locally initiated petition pre-empted a recent government decision on Soliris is, in fact, real testament to the grassroots wisdom of Australian people. People who live with debilitating medical conditions like PNH or who live with a disability often have enlightening and profoundly important and empowering stories and evidence to give the legislators and decision makers, as do their families and carers-a fact on evidence in the recent Productivity Commission draft report about a National Disability Insurance Scheme. We should always listen to people who lack power. It is not just our duty but a key source of advice on how this parliament and this country can conduct themselves. I think it is the quiet, modest pursuit of change through the parliament-the moderating institution in Australian life through democratic meansthat means that I can recognise and admire all of the efforts of the people who signed this petition as I table it in our national parliament.

Mr Entsch to move-That this House: (1) notes the severe flooding effects taking place in the outer islands of the Torres Strait and the dire conditions the Torres Strait Islander people find themselves in each year; (2) recognises that: (a) the Torres Strait Islander people deserve the same rights as the people in flooded South-East Queensland; (b) discrimination should not exist in one particular area of the nation; (c) the Torres Strait Islander people have been experiencing flood devastation for the past four years with no help from Government; and (d) sea wall infrastructure at six low-lying islands is inadequate and in urgent need of repair; and (3) in light of the evidence of continued flooding on the outer islands due to king tidal surges, calls on the Government to commit to restore and rebuild the damaged sea walls on the outer islands of the Torres Strait to protect the island communities from further devastation. Mr Laurie Ferguson to move: That this House: (1) recognises that 24 March is World Tuberculosis Day, in observance of a disease that still claims the lives of 1.7 million people every year, and which: (a) is currently the leading killer of people living with HIV and the third leading killer of women; (b) has the highest growth in the South East Asian region, which accounted for the largest number of new Tuberculosis cases in 2008; and (c) could be dramatically reduced by improved detection and diagnosis; (2) recognises that the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) currently provides more than two thirds of the global funding to combat Tuberculosis, and that: (a) Australia could supplement its recent pledge to the Global Fund to ensure that the resources for Tuberculosis as well as AIDS and Malaria are sufficient to achieve the goal of significantly reducing the number of people suffering from these diseases; and (b) action by Australia to supplement its pledge would influence other donor countries to increase their pledges; (3) acknowledges that the widespread adoption of the new Xpert diagnostic tool, which cuts the time for diagnosis from several weeks to two hours, would lead to significant improvements in the detection and treatment of Tuberculosis; and (4) requests the Government facilitate the adoption of Xpert in South East Asia.

Mr John Cobb to move: That this House: (1) notes with concern the impact on the Dairy Industry of the Coles milk pricing strategy, and that: (a) dairy farmers around the country are today seriously questioning their future, having suffered through one of the worse decades in memory including droughts, floods, price cuts and the rising cost of inputs such as energy and feed; (b) unsustainable retail milk prices will, over time, compel processors to renegotiate contracts with dairy farmers and the prospect that these contracts will be below the cost of production may force many to leave the industry; (c) for many dairy farmers, the fact that supermarkets are now selling milk cheaper than many varieties of bottled water will be the straw that finally breaks the camel's back; and (d) the risk of other potential impacts include: (i) decreased competition as name brands are forced from the shelves; and (ii) the possible loss of fresh milk supplies to some parts of the country as local fresh milk industries become unviable; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) ask the ACCC to immediately undertake an investigation into the big supermarkets and milk wholesalers after recent price cuts to ensure they do not have too much market power and are not anti-competitive in their behaviour; and (b) support the new Senate inquiry into the ongoing milk price war between the country's major supermarket chains.
