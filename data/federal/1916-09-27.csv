6,Mr YATES,MILITARY SERVICE,"I call the attention of the Prime Minister to the following letter, which was published in Adelaide in the Register, the Advertiser, and the Herald, while he was there, and I ask him if he will allow language similar to that used by the writer to be employed in any anticonscription publication that may be issued:Well, they are a white-livered crowd, and if they kick up any fuss I amfinishedwith them. Just fancy, as the majority of unionists are away with the Force, and unable to have a voice in the matter, the white-livered skunks are hanging back are making out that they are the union, whereas all good unionists have, enlisted, or should do so.",5
7,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"What has been read purports to be an extract from a letter written by a South Australian soldier in France, wherein reference is made to the colour of the livers of certain gentlemen, and I am asked whether similar references may be made by persons who are opposed to compulsory military service. My reply is "" Certainly."" Reference to the colour of no man's liver is barred. I bave yet to learn, however, that those who are attacked have any righ t to complain.

12,Dr MALONEY,MILITARY SERVICE,"I desire to make a personal explanation in regard to the remarks which have fallen from the lips of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman must know that the report referred to was an abbreviated one, only a few inches in length. I wish the Prime Minister to know that I never made any statement that could be taken to mean that he had been bribed with money. If he could get the repotter's notes, be would find that there was not one single word uttered I need withdraw, or would withdraw. As to bribing the right honourable gentleman with money, I never made such a statement. APPEAL TO GERMANS .",6
13,Mr KELLY,MILITARY SERVICE,"I ask the Prime M i nister whether the prohibition against the publication of matter in German extends to the reproduction of such an appeal as T hold in my hand, made in German for German support, by one Herr W . P. Finlayson.",6
14,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"I recognise and appreciate the effort of the artist who bas adorned this production, but the meaning of the letterpress is to me as that of a sealed book. I have the word of the honourable member for Wentworth for believing that the language employed is German, and therefore I shall have it translated, and read the translation to the House tomorrow. PRI CE OF MININGEXPLOSIVES .",6
15,Mr CHARLTON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Is the Prime M in ister aware that it is alleged that a combination regulates the supply and price of mining explosives, and that, in consequence, prices have materially increased during recent years?

Will the Prime Minister make a statement as to what provision there is in the Electoral Act for the punishment of those who disturb public referendum meetings, and prevent freeCommonwealth dom of speech ?",6
21,Mr HUGHES,DISTURBANCES AT PUBLI C,"I gather that this is one of these gentle encouragements speech that are now becoming quite prevalent. A remedy is found in a tion of the Electoral Act which provides that any person so offending may be ejected by the chairman, and is liable to honourable member. a penalty of £ 5 . That remedy, I apprehend, is at the disposal of the chairman of every meeting in every place throughout Australia. I hope that we have this campaign conducted in a manner that will not be a reproach to reasonable men. Let us approach it in a fitting spirit. This is the most vital question that has ever been submitted to a Democracy enjoying the privileges of free citizenship. The answer to the to question is that the remedy for such conthe duct is found in section 49 of the Elecacting toral Act, and is available to every chairthem man.

53,Mr BRENNAN,COMPULSORY SERVIC E,H as the Prime M i nister decided to issue a pamphlet setting the reasons pro and con in connection with the forthcoming referendum ?,9
54,Mr HUGHES,COMPULSORY SERVIC E,"I hardly see any necessity for issuing a pamphlet. There are two reasons why that course caunot be taken. One reason is that supplied by the electoral officer, who, when approached by me on the matter, said it would be quite impossible for the pamphlet to be printed and reach the electors in time. Six weeks from the date the arguments are received is the minimum time required to get distributed a pamphlet to the electors of the Commonwealth. Another reason is that only one side has any arguments, and that side is not the one on which the honourable member, stands.

The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank has complete control over the administration of the Bank's affairs. 3.

59,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"The answers to the questions are as follow: 1. I have not seen the article referred nor do I know to what it .alludes, but believe that the failure to send reinforcements may probably have involved disaster. I not know that the statement necessarily involves reinforcements from the Commonwealth; it means reinforcements from any part of 2. Answered by No. 1. 3.

SOLICITOR-GENERAL BILL . Motion (by Mr HUGHES) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for Act relating to the Solicitor-General. Bill presented by Mr HUGHES, and read a first and second time. In Committee: Clause 1 (Short title).",11
73,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.47] The Bill has been introduced to lighten the formal work of the Attorney-General by enabling the Solicitor-General to do certain things that now only the Minister at the head of the Department can do. It permits the Secretary to the Department of the Attorney-General to sign, as Solicitor-General, a number of documents which can now be signed only by the Attorney-General. In the States such work is done by the Solicitor-General, and not by the Attorney-General. The Solicitor General will have no authority to sign auything, or to do anything, unless it has been specially delegated to him by the Attorney-General. He cannot delegate such authority to any one else. mere formal work of the Attorney General is too heavy, and there is no reason for burdening a Minister with it. Every one who has held this office knows the position of affairs, and knows, too, that the work of the Department is increasing. The Department has at present to deal with a number of matters-the regulation of the trade in metals, wheat, and many other commodities-whic h in normal times do not come within its sphere. The Minister will declare the policy of the Government in every case, and the Solicitor-General will give effect to it . Thus Ministerial discretion will remain, and Ministerial responsibility will not be lessened. The Government will be as much responsible for every act done by the Solicitor-General as if it had been done by the Attorney General, but important business will not be delayed because the Attorney-General cannot be got to sign his name to some formal paper.",12
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Parramatta) [8.52] - We are in the anomalous position of having to discuss a Bill of which we have not a copy, and about which we know only what has been told to us in the explanation of the Attorney-General. The right honourable gentleman says that he proposes .to give to our Solicitor-General an powers that are exercised by the SolicitorsGeneral of the States; but my recollection is that the Solicitors-General of the States are Cabinet Ministers.",12
75,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"In New South Wales, until recently, and in Tasmania, Western Australia, and New Zealand, the Solicitor General is an official, and not a member ot Parliament.",12
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I do n6t object to what is proposed; but the Attorney General might have given us a sketch of. the duties which are to devolve on the Solicitor-General. This is a time of war, and the delegation of war powers to an official is not a light matter.",12
77,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,I shall still be responsible.,12
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Yes , nominally.",12
79,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Actually . Mr ' JOSEPH COOK - I am afraid that it may be thought sufficient to exThe plain to the House, should anything be done which ought not to have been done, that it had been done by the Solicitor General, and that the Attorney-General knew nothing of it.",12
80,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,That explanation is always open to any Minister. At present the permanent head of the Crown Law Department himself settles half the matters that come before it. I am willing to limit the operation of the Bill to the period of the war.,12
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"That is what I should prefer. I think that, more often than not, in New South Wales the Solicitor-General is a member of the Cabinet. Mr David Hall, when he left this Parliament, was taken into the New South Wales Government as Solicitor-General. Whether that is the case generally in the rest of the States I do not know.",12
82,Mr WATT,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,In most of the States the Solicitor-General is a political Minister.,12
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"It is no light thing, it seems to me, to delegate important judicial functions to an official who has no direct responsibility to this Parliament. While, of course, a Solicitor General will have to be appointed at some time or other in connection with the political functions of this House and Parliament, I do think that, unless the Prime Minister sees some urgency, it is a matter that might well be left over until we can consider it away from the intrusion of the war, and all the troubles arising therefrom.",12
84,Mr MATHEWS,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"We require more expedition in the business in that Department, and if this Bill will help it is a good thing.",13
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Anythin g that will help to promote expedition in any of the Departments is doubtless a good thing, but in a Law Department it is not so much expedition as the doing of the right thing that is necessary. However, we are in the dark; we know nothing about the Bill, or what is contemplated, beyond the assurance of the Prime Minister and Attorney-General that he proposes to allocate no duties of an important character to the Solicitor-General, but to leave to him only those details which may safely be left in connection with the various matters mentioned.",13
86,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I do not think that you ought to desire, or have, any more light on the matter. What I say is that the work of the Department is such that it is impossible for me to do it and also to attend to the business of the Prime Minister's Department. I therefore require somebody to do those formal things which do not require, and should not require, the attention of the Minister.",13
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,The right honable gentleman is now putting the matter on a personal ground.,13
88,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Ho t at all.,13
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"He tells us now that he is unable to perform the work of his two offices as it ought to be performed. But, surely, the remedy for that is to altogether divest himself of one of the offices. As to the Prime Ministership, I apprehend that he is not likely to relinquish that. I do not know what law members the Prime Minister has in his party.",13
90,Mr MATHEWS,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"The member for Batman! "" Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Oh , yes; there matter just now? are lots of possibilities; and relief may come in many ways. I certainly agree with the right honourable gentleman that, if he has to perform the functions of Prime Minister of Australia as I think they ought to be performed, he ought not to hold any other office.",13
91,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I quite agree with that, of course.",13
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"That is my judgment, after having filled the office myself. I know that the Prime Minister has quite enough to do in looking after the rest of the Departments in, shall I say, a supervisory way, as a kind of referee, without having to administer a difficult and delicate Department himself. I suggest that, instead of delegating duties as proposed, the Prime Minister should, if possible, relieve himself of one of these great Departments. This would be better than delegating the duties to a non-political official. Is the Prime Minister acting as Minister of Trade and Customs also?",13
93,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Well , I do not know. I am considering my qualifications for the post, but I have great hesitation in recommending to His Excellency the Governor General a person so unfit for the post as myself. Possibly a night's sleep may give me enough courage to do so!",13
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Since we have not the Bill, it seems to me that all we can do at the present time is to trust the Prime Minister. I hope we are doing right; but, personally, I do not very much appreciate the proposal to delegate important functions, especially in these war days, to any person, no matter how qualified or eminent he may be, who has not some direct responsibilities to this House.",13
95,Mr HUGHES,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I am not going to press the matter further. If the Committee does not like to adopt the measure, I shall withdraw it. I have put it forward, but if there is going to be any talk about it, I shall withdraw it.",13
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"This is a Parliament, I hope, and it is not for the right honourable gentleman to say what he is going to do with the measure. Once a measure is before the House it belongs to the House.",13

98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Apparentl y not, according to ""the dictum of the Prime Minister. I shall not oppose the Bill , but we might at least have had copies of it before us, so that it could receive the consideration its importance undoubtedly deserves.",13
99,Mr GROOM,LANDTAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Darling Downs) [4.2] A great deal can be said in favour of the Attorney-General's request for the delegation he is asking. Section 64 of the Constitution providesThe Governor General may appoint officers to administer such. Departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor General in Council may establish. Such officers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor General. They shall be members of the Federal Executive Council, iind shall be the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth. The section further provides for a M in ister of State being a member of either House of the Parliament. That refers to responsible Ministers who are in this House, and there must be some Minister of State who has charge of the Law Department of the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General is the executive councillor responsible for the administration of his Department, and any attempt by any Bill to delegate to the Solicitor General political responsibilities in connection with the Department would be i m possible. The Attorney-General has assured us, however, that he is not asking for the delegation of any of his political responsibilities. The Bill is to permit the delegation of statutory duties only. What he is asking, I take it , is simply the delegation of ordinary administrative duties, such as the filing of bills in prosecutions, matters connected with patents and trade marks, and other ordinary duties. There is no intention, I assume, to take away from this House its control over any responsible Minister.",14

108,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Swan) [5.20]. - I do not intend to enter into a discussion of or to criticise the statement which the Treasurer has laid before us. I have listened to the honourable gentleman with attention, but, of course, I am not at the present moment in a position to deal with the facts and figures submitted. I rose with the object of making some special observations on a subject which I consider of - importance. I have to leave for Western Australia tomorrow, and therefore I take this the only opportunity of saying the few words I wish to say*. What I desire should, I think, be said at the earliest possible moment after the debate that has already taken place on the means necessary to be taken to finance the present war. I wish specially to deal with what I consider very unfounded statements - statement s which might be characterized by a much stronger term, and which, in any case, may be described as venemous-that have been made by several honourable members and by Labour unionists all over Australia, to the effect that those who are reputed to be fair l y well off have not contributed as they should to the expense of the war; in fact, that those people have failed in their duty during this crisis. I feel it to be m y duty, in the interest of truth and justice, to refute that statement, and to prove that those disparaging assertions, made not only in this House, but throughout Australia, are without foundation, and that those who make them must be either ignorant of what has been going on, or have some ulterior and improper motive in making them. I am of opinion-and I think that the statement of the Treasurer, when investigated, will bear me out-that by careful and wise administration this Commonwealth can do its duty to the Empire, and maintain its solvency in this great crisis without any anarchical, revolutionary, or devious methods of finance. I am glad to think - thoug h I have not had an opportunity of sufficiently looking into the matter-that the Government thrown aside, and treated with contempt, the anarchical, revolutionary, and devious methods proposed. All that is necessary at the present time to enable us to do our duty to ourselves and the Empire is that we should be devoted to duty, determined, and strong of purpose, and see to it that there is capable and careful administration. Assuming those conditions, I see no difficulty that we cannot overcome in carrying the war to a successful termination. I was very much pained the other day at the remarks which the honourable member for Hunter thought fit to address to the House. A f t e r several years' knowledge of that gentleman, I had come to the conclusion that he was level-headed, careful, and fair-minded; and, therefore, to say I was the more pained-in fact, shockedto hear the opinions he then expressed. His suggestions were pure and unadulterated confiscation, and it is time that his spurious ideas should be repudiated and refuted.",29

110,Sir JOHNFORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I should say his proposals are quite anarchical. The honourable member said, and I shall only quote a few words in order to show to what I am referringI am of opinion that, at a time like this, all. income in excess of necessary living expenditure should go into the public exchequer for financing the war. Every man and woman should have sufficient to keep the wolf from the door, but over and above what is necessary to provide each household with the necessaries of life all private income should be paid to the Government during the progress of the war.",29

114,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I shall come to that spurious cry in a moment, for it is a spurious cry, and the honourable member must know it .

119,Mr CHARLTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Hear , hear!",30
120,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Agai n I ask why the honourable member did not say so?,30
121,Mr CHARLTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I have said so.,30
122,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Then what the honourable member means is that those - who have hitherto been paying, and who ;are paying now, shall continue to provide all that is necessary?",30
123,Mr CHARLTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,What I said was that I wished to conscript wealth.,30
124,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"What the honourable member meant, and what he -.should have said, was that those who are paying now will have to continue to pay until the end, and to pay a great deal more than they already have. I cannot understand what is the cause of the honourable member's anxiety in this matter, unless it is that some of his friends, or those whom he represents, or in whom he is interested, are paying too much. Does he realise what he is proposing ? Does he mean that the bond-holders of the States and of the Commonwealth and all public contractors should not be paid, that all civil servants of every grade are to be paid a uniform minimum wage of, say, £ 3 per week, and that employers should dispense with all their employees, domestic or industrial ? If all employees are to be dispensed with in that way, how are they to be kept? I suppose that the honourable member would set up a large Boup kitchen for the purpose of supplying their daily needs. I am sorry that the honourable member has fastened himself to such a scheme. based on confiscation and repudiation, and would bring ruin to our credit. In fact, it is so foolish that it is not worth even considering - Furthermore, there is not the slightest necessity for such heroic and anarchical methods. It is difficult to understand how the honourable member came to give us the benefit of his ideas as to what should be dono. He must know that the war so. expenditure is being financed by the very people whom he wishes to completely ruin . His surprising question, "" What sacrifice is wealth going to make to meet the requirements of the nation?"" might b© very pertinent if it were not entirely opposed to facts. The plain answer to it is the fact that the war taxation already levied and being levied is financing the war. In the financial year 1915-16, the Commonwealth derived fro m war income tax £3,934,000, war probate duties £626,000, increased land tax for war purposes £200,000, and increased Customs and Excise duties levied for war purposes £2,000,000; or a total of £6,760,000. That sum is sufficient to pay interest at 5 per cent. on £135,000,000; whereas from such figures as I have been able to gather the war expenditure during the year 1915-16 was about £41,000,000, and the interest and sinking f u n d paid was £2,000,000. If the taxation that was specially voted for war revenue, namely, income tax and probate duties, which realized £4,560,000, was set aside for war purposes, the provision to the end of the year was very satisfactory. Ample provision has been thus far made to finance our war loans and war expenditure by the special taxation already authorized. If more money is required for the current financial year it must be obtained. The Treasurer has just placed befor© us a scheme by which he seeks to obtain all he will need for this year for the purpose of financing the war. In my opinion, the expenditure on ordinary services during a time of war should not be greater than what it was prior to the war. We already had a very large expenditure in 1913-14, and if we had determined not to spend more during the war than we spent on the ordinary services in that year we would have been acting as a prudent and wise people. In our private affairs, in time of diffiI t is a scheme culty, we would take care to l i m it our expenditure to an amount which would not be more than what it was before our difficulties arose. I am not sure that the Government have done this. If the Government allows the ordinary expenditure to increase during a period of war, difficulty, and danger, it will be monstrous and reckless procedure on their part. No words are strong enough to condemn such action. Surely during this terrible war we should not be called upon to spend more than we formerly spent on ordinary necessities. When the honourable member for Hunter, as also other honourable members opposite, complain of what others are doing, it is not an unfair retort to ask what those whom he thinks he specially represents are doing, and why he should attack those whom he does not pretend even to represent without telling us what those whom he does represent have done, or propose to do. Fortunately the masses of the people have not felt the burden of the war unduly; they have not paid anything directly towards the war expenditure. I ask the honourable member to refute that statement. him point out where the masses of the pe&ple have been unduly burdened, or where they have contributed anything material directly towards the war expenditure. Those who have borne the burden of the war expenditure are not very numerous, and they have not complained. Complaint comes from those who have paid nothing directly.",30
125,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,The masses are not complaining.,31
126,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Certain persons who claim to represent the views of the masses in this House and outside it would have us believe that they are complaining. If a man complains, surely he should tell us how he is suffering. I ask honourable members to tell me how the masses of the people are suffering, and how much they are paying towards the war expenditure. Is it fair or generous to flog a willing horse? and ask, "" What sacrifice is wealth going to make to meet the requirements of the nation?"" when I have shown that those persons are paying special taxation to the extent of £4,560,000 on income tax and probate duties which were imposed for the purposes of the war. living in a country where fairness prevails? When one does well or tries to do well he is usually given some credit, but the persons who are bearing this heavy burden are given no credit for what they have done and are doing. On the other hand, they are asked, "" What are you going to do?"" I may tell honourable members what they intend to do. They intend to obey the law and to do their best in the direction of financing the large expenditure that is now proceeding. If the honourable member for Hunter had his way he would kill the goose that lays the golden egg. While I rejoice that the masses have not suffered during the war, I regret that during these years of difficulty and danger there has been so much industrial unrest. From the last publication issued by Mr Knibbs, I find that during two years of war there have been 695 industrial disputes, and a loss of wages amounting to about £900,000. Those who choose to strike and thereby lose money cannot be in any great difficulty; otherwise they would not do it . I am glad that the insane ideas some honourable members have in regard to finance did not find favour with the Le t Treasurer last year.",31
127,Mr SHARPE,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Then why worry about them?,31
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Because I wish to impress upon honourable members how unreasonable and ungenerous their sentiments are.,31
129,Mr BRENNAN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,The Treasurer is veryuneasy while the right honourable gentleman applauds him.,31
130,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"He is not of my side of politics, but I am generous enough to give him fair play. The Treasurer said, on the 9 th May, in dealing with these visionary proposalsA compulsory non-interest-bearing loan, to be subscribed by those who possess wealth is advocated by some writers and speakers, who appear to be unacquainted with the market value of governmental and other securities. A forced loan, without interest, means confiscation. . . . . . A forced loan, without interest, would mean the confiscation of at least £45 out of every £100 so raised. This young and resourceful nation will be in desperate need if ever it finds it necessary to resort to compulsory loans, without interest, to pay for its share in the expenses of the war. A more just appreciation of the realities of life would show that the man who invests £500 A r e we in a Government loan . . . . is just as much entitled to a return for his money as the man who prefers investing £500 in house property. An appreciation of these simple facts will prevent much confusion of thought and the spreading of foolish notions. That is a proper and reasonable statement. Every one will agree that in this new and undeveloped country the lighter the burdens that are placed on the people, by taxation or otherwise, the better. If you take money out of the pockets of those who have it , you lessen the power of those persons to use i i for beneficial purposes. Tht more capital there is available f o i production and the development of the primary and manufacturing industries the better for all, and especially for the industrial workers and the masses of the people, of whom honourable members opposite seem to regard themselves as the sole representatives. I should like to say, iii conclusion, that, in my opinion, the way to finance this war is to continue the plan that has so far been adopted-that is, to raise the money required by loan, and to provide by taxation sufficient to pay interest and sinking fund on our borrowings. I should say that 1 per cent, is a quite sufficient sinking fund for a country like this. No devious methods are either necessary or justifiable. I can only hope that we shall hear no more statements in this chamber that those who have, or are supposed to have, wealth are not contributing to the cost of this war. In my opinion, they are the only ones who are contributing directly to the cost of the war. Who has to pay the income tax of £4,000,000?",31

136,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I never intended to.,32
137,Mr CHARLTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The right honourable gentleman also stated that he hoped that in future I will be a little more generous than I have been to the class of people whom he represents. Let me inform him that my proposals, if adopted, would not only be more generous to the poorer people, but, at a time like this, generous also to the persons for whom the right honourable gentleman claims to speak. In this, the greatest crisis in the history of the nation, when we are saying that every able-bodied man should be prepared to go to the front, and, if necessary, that he should be compelled to go, it is fair, having regard to the great additional cost to be incurred, that all people should realise that they have a burden to shoulder. We have no right to take up the attitude that, whilst one man should risk his life-tha n which nothing is more sacred-the right honourable member and I should remain at home and not pay all we possibly can towards the national cost of prosecuting the war to a finish. At a time like this, when the utmost effort is expected to be put forth by everybody, nothing is fairer than that those who <b. ave money should do their part by paying into the national exchequer as much as to they possibly can spare for the purpose of financing our part in the war.",32

The right for honourable gentleman contends that the people who have wealth are paying the cost of this war, but will he seriously assert that the income tax is not in many instances transferred by the richer clasB the poorer people? Will he contend that house rents have not been raised to extent, so that in many cases the property-owner is receiving more in additional rent than he is paying in the income tax? If that is Happening who really pays the income tax ?",32

146,Mr BRUCE SMITH,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,You are nonsense.,33
147,Mr CHARLTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I am stating absolute facts. The right honourable member for Swan would have us believe that the masses of the people are not paying this additional taxation. I answer him, in connection with this latest endeavour on the part of the Government to meet the financial situation, that unless the Government are very careful and introduce machinery to prevent traders from in creasing their prices, the new taxation will be passed on to the shoulders of the people. I hope the Government will take steps to see that prices are not increased in that way, and then the right honourable gentleman may be able to claim that his friends are paying the taxation.",33
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,What about proposal you made last week?,33
149,Mr CHARLTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"My proposal was that all income, over and above an amount that could be termed sufficient for a fair living for each individual should be paid into the Treasury for the purpose of financing the war. Without having the assistance of the Treasury officials, I informed honourable members on that occasion that the war expenditure during 1916-17 would probably run to over £74,000.000, and I find that the Treasurer now submits an official estimate of £73,670,616. The cost of the war is in creasing by leaps and bounds every year, and how are we to meet it if we do not get the money from some source? 1913-14 the expenditure of the Commonwealth was £25,412,231 ; in 1914-15, £40,269.702; in 1915-16, £91,052,632; and for the year 1916-17, £127,836,291. If the war continues for any length of time our expenditure will be still greater. We have to face the position. What I propose, and what I would carry into 1 effect if I could, even though I might be considered an anarchist and a fool, is that the Government should take all in come over and above £400 a year. There are households which could be kept comfortably on, perhaps, £200 a year; but when the breadwinner has to do a great deal of travelling, his personal expenses are possibly as great as would be sufficient to keep an ordinary family. Every case, however, would be met were an expenditure of £400 allowed. It is admitted that the country needs for the prosecution of the war the "" l as t shilling,"" about which we have heard so much talk. talking That being so, it is surely not too much to ask every person to pay to the State all that he earns above £400 a year.",33
150,Mr CARR,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,We do not need so much.,33
151,Mr CHARLTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The expenditure of the Commonwealth is growing so rapidly that the Government will need all that it can get, and more. I have given serious consideration to this matter for some weeks past, and believe that I am discharging my public duty in putting forward the suggestion that I have made. In no other way can you prevent those whom the country is trying to tax directly from passing on their taxation by increasing the cost of living to the poorer members of the community. No man who was running a business would increase the cost of the commodities that he was selling the if he knew that in no case could he retain more than £400 a year out of his profits.",33
152,Mr CARR,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Many would shut up shop under such an arrangement.,33
153,Mr CHARLTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The requirements of the public must be supplied. If my friend were in business he would feel himself compelled to keep going to prevent a competitor from taking trade from him which he could not win back again after the war. My proposal does not commend itself to the right honourable member for Swan; but it seems to me wise, instead of piling up a huge indebtedness, under which the country will hardly be able to stagger, to try to finance the war as we go on. My proposal would do that, In and would, at the same time, allow every family to be maintained in decent comfort .",33
154,Mr CARR,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,The honourable member proposes that we should pay for the war all at once.,33
155,Mr CHARLTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"No , we cannot do that. If all income above £400 a year were taken by the State, it would not pay for the war, though it would enable us to keep down our indebtedness. Moreover, every one on whom direct taxation was imposed would have to pay taxation; would not be able to pass it on. At the present time, however, persons in business are passing on to the general community, the Government? by increasing prices, more than the taxation which they are compelled to pay. wish to prevent that. If the people compelled to carry the whole load, you must expect trouble and dissatisfaction. We have heard about the increases in wages, but it is well-known that, whereas a man at one time could support on £120 a year, he requires £200 a year to do the same thing now, prices having increased so much. The righ t honourable [ 6 . i l ] member for Swan attacked my proposal, but he suggested nothing in place of it We know, of course, that he is prepared to continue borrowing, but if we have continue to borrow at the rate £100,000,000 a year, the load of indebtedness will become more than Australia bear. No one will say that there should be any increasing of bank accounts at present time, though, as a matter of fact, many persons are now making and saving vernment just yet. money. Some men should not be comthese pelled to risk their lives at the f r o while others make money during the war. give statutory effect to them. It cannot be contended that the poor man has as much to protect as the rich man has. All should be willing to protect mature consideration later. their hearths and their homes, but the wealthy and propertied have more to prothat tect than the poor have, and, at a time like this, should be prepared to pay cost of the protection which they enjoy.",33

I hope that measures will taken to prevent those whom the right honourable member for Swan says he presents from passing their taxation the poorer members of the community, who now pay the bulk of the taxation. The right honourable member said that poor were not taxed directly. that they are taxed both .directly and indirectly. The income exempt from taxation is only £156 a year, with an lowance of £ 1 3 for each child, so that many a working man is taxed directly, in addition to having an immense amount of indirect taxation to pay. desire is to prevent the increasing of prices, and the incentive to the increase of prices is removed if you enact that income above a certain amount shall go> he into the coffers of the State.",34

Therefore, more money cannot be needed by the GoThe discussion of proposals might very well be postn t poned until there is an opportunity to My suggestion is that, having been given an airing, they might well be left over for more In reply to the honourable member for Hunter, I say the people of this country are prepared to stand up to whatever obligations the may be fairly imposed on them by the war. I do not think that, as a whole, memthe proposals of the Treasurer will be cavilled at, though differences of opinion make many matters of detail deTaken by and large, the be burden to be laid on the people is one which I think they will bear without a regreat deal of murmuring. Without comon to mitting myself in regard to every detail - for some of them require very serious consideration- I believe, the speaking generally, the people of this I contend country will recognise that they have to meet these obligations, and will do so in the spirit which has prompted them all althrough the war. They are prepared, I believe, to make whatever sacrifice is necessary to see this business through to the bitter end, if need be. If it cornea My great to finding "" the last man and the last shilling,"" which my honourable friend talks so much about, I believe they will do it all rather than see our great heritage here taken possession of by Germany, for the purpose of German exploitation. However, it is not the time to talk about these extreme measures; we are not driven to them yet. When we have the Treasurer prefacing his statement by an intimation to the country that he is already in funds to the extent of £17,000,000, I think my honourable friend will see that all his heroic, Spartan-like proposals are just a little previous. Does my honourable friend propose that everybody should pool all the wealth they have got, when it is not needed for the purposes of the war? He must recollect that, of the wealth of Australia, there is very little at the present time out of productive use; and to do what he suggests would be to withdraw the working capital and put it in the hands of the Treasury, and so dislocate, disturb, and destroy the very enterprises of the country which form, in the last resort, our staying power in this war. My honourable friend's proposal, if it were carried out, would not tend to the efficient conduct of the war, for it would remove the very props which are underneath the whole burden of the war, and which are necessary to its successf u l prosecution. It would be far better to drop this academic kind of thought, and stand up to the burdens as detailed to us-to meet the requirements of the moment from day to day, and as the obligations of the war make necessary. I believe that, when these burdens are proved to be necessary, the people will bear them without complaint. has been the spirit ' of the Empire all through this war; and I do not believe that the burden-bearers Australia are one whit behind, in patriotism, and even in generosity, those in every portion of the Empire and in every other portion of the theatre of war. There are one or two items that might very well be called in question. regret to see that, with all the titanic war obligations towering up, the Treasurer is still increasing expenditure on the ordinary civil administration of the country. The great item of new works ought to be sifted to the bottom. I do not believe that, in a time of war like this, while we are putting £7,000,000 of extra taxation on the people, we ought, at the same time, to increase the expenditure on new works from £2,800,000 to £4,394,000.",34
162,Mr WEST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,It is all necessary work.,35
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I have no doubt we could spend another £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, and still declare that it was for necessary works. I simply say that if , in war time, we go round looking for chances to spend money, we have not yet got into the spirit of the war. Rather should we be going round seeing what we can postpone until after the war is over. We have noright to spend millions on anything that can be done without while the war lasts. I come, therefore, to my point that this staggering increase in the item of new works requires more explanation than that furnished by the Treasurer.",35
164,Mr HIGGS,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Hav e you lost sight of the fact that the Naval and Militar y Departments account for £1,140,000 of the increase ?",35
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I should very much like to see the details, even of that expenditure. Because it relates to the Defence Department on its ordinary normal side, I think it requires sifting as much as any other expenditure. I am not talking of war expenditure, for that cannot be cavilled at so long as we are getting a £ 1 worth for every £ 1 . But it is in regard to expenditure on the ordinary administration of the Defence Department that I say care and vigilance are needed to insure that the money is not wasted there any more than in any other Department. I frankly confess that I should like to see a committee of the House, composed of the best financial That brains, set to work on the problem of finding where this money is going, and how much of the expenditure can be done in without until the war is over. That kind of thing is being done everywhere else; this is the only place, so far as I know, where the Government of the day' feel themselves competent to undertake to supervise ;every ramification and every detail of these huge expenditures. I Mr Fenton - The Borden Government, in Canada, are doing the same thing.",35
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The honourable member will find that in Canada there are several committees at work investigating the finances, item by item, and detail by detail; and something of the kind is badly needed here. Our expenditure is piling up every year with tremendous additions. I am only contending that in war time any increase should be justified by the most competent and caref u l scrutiny that can be applied. We require money for the war, and, therefore, we are under an obligation to the taxpayers to save all we legitimately can on the ordinary and normal administration of the Departments. It is for that reason I think that the increase in works expenditure from £2,800,000 to £4,394,000 ought to be sifted to the bottom.",35
167,Mr WEST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,It is all Defence ture. What items does the right honourable member object to i,36
168,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"We cannot settle the matter quite like that on the floor of the House. I cannot help feeling that there is room for very serious inquiry into many items of the detailed expenditure. The proposals of the Government mean a burden which I believe the taxpayers of the country will bear without any serious cavil. As to the details, I suppose these will be open to investigation and closer scrutiny in the light of the experience gained during the few weeks ahead of us. As to any cavilling or grumbling there may be about the additional burdens, it is our duty to tax the community in these stressful days fairly and justly, even if severely.",36
169,Mr BHUCE SMITH,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Some honourable members opposite are angry because the burden is not greater-that is the diffisurely culty there!,36
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I think honorover, able members opposite will admit that the proposals are a pretty stiff dose. far as a preliminary glance shows, new taxes amount to about £8,000,000, which is a stiff dip into the pockets of the people of Australia. have said already, the bulk of the moneys here are already engaged in the productive enterprises of the country. There are no huge reservoirs of wealth a vested kind such as there are in many the older and richer countries in the world. Our capital here is all working capital, which, for the most part, is pressed the productive enterprises of the country. Therefore, a proposal to pool this, nilly, and pour it into some huge Government reservoir, there to remain is required for the purpose of the war, is the very thing to avoid in a young and developing country like this. There is one other point on which I should like to say a word, and - that is in regard to the sugar industry of Queensland. Events have come to a crisis up there.",36

174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"And I do not think you should. Between the State expendi- Government and the Federal Government a very serious blow has been struck at the sugar industry of Queensland by the award of that young Judge who was sent to investigate the whole matter and set the new industrial order there. We may not criticise a Judge's conduct here, though I believe it has been laid down by Mr Justice Higgins himself that we may discuss the character of his awards. And it is the character of this award that needs discussing, and very seriously discussing, with a view to seeing what is to be done with the men who find themselves rendered helpless thereby. The price of the product is fixed arbitrarily by one Government, while the industrial conditions are arbitrarily fixed by another Government. This kind of thing cannot go on, for between the upper and nether millstone these growers are in imminent danger of being ground "" down and out."" If ever there was a time when we ought to be trying to conserve the industries of Australia, it is in a time of war, when our population is being steadily depleted. Morethese are our vulnerable points, our Achilles' heel, and we ought to So do all that is necessary to succour and the support the men who, in a tropical climate, are doing their best to establish industries and supply a much-needed As I population to that part of the country. But if the grower has to have his price fixed by one Government and his outgoing fixed by another, while he is allowed no of say at all, it seems to me that we will of have got to the point of leaving him with only the responsibility of his business, while the control from beginning to end is into in the hands of others.",36

181,Mr CARR,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,There should be a quorum present - [Quorum formed.'],37
182,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"As regards the Wartime Profits Taxation Bill , I would i m press on the Treasurer the necessity of exempting the gold-mining industry. I make that request in the interests of the people of Australia generally, and not of those concerned in the industry itself. No extra price is being paid for gold on account of the war, nor can the war bring any extra profit to the industry. On the other hand, the expenditure incurred in winning the gold has been greatly increased by war conditions, including the rise in the price of all commodities required, and the cost of labour has also gone up. It would be most unwise to do anything that might retard the industry at a time when it is essential to produce all the gold possible to provide us with the sinews of war. would be inequitable to put upon gold mining a tax similar to that on other in dustries. The Great Boulder Mine, in Western Australia, has been paying enormous dividends for the last twenty years, although latterly these have had a tendency to reduce, but it is still making i m mense profits. Under the provisions of the Bill , it would not pay a single penny by way of a war-profits tax, but a company which had been struggling for years, and paid its first dividend in 1915-16would have to hand over 50 per cent, of its profits for that year to the Crown, and this year would have to hand over the whole of them. An y provision of that sort means a serious stoppage in the goldmining industry.",37
183,Mr MATHEWS,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I do not think goldThe mining profits would be regarded as war profits.,37
184,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Thes e would be in cluded under the Bill which has been circulated, even though the industry is Governactually suffering owing to the war. Prospectors, of whom there are numbers in Western Australia, may earn nothing for five or six years, but if one of them strikes which a good patch, bringing him in , say, £1,50 0 to £2,000, half of that amount, if gained in 1915-16, must go to the Crown, or if in this year, the lot. The same thing applies to tributers in Victoria. These arguments do not apply to any other class of mining, for the price of lead, copper, molybdenite, and other metals has been very much increased owing to the war. The Bill , if passed in its present form, will stop a large amount of developmental work, and prevent people putting money into the gold-mining industry, although we want developmental work now more than ever, not only to produce gold, but to provide labour for our men when they come back. The Treasurer, I know, has been interviewed, and has gone well into this question, and I hope he will not do anything to retard this big Australian in dustry. I would also ask him seriously to consider whether he should go so far in his war-profits taxation as outlined in his proposals submitted to us this afternoon. If he takes, as he suggests, the whole of the profits in 1916-17, with the exception of 7 or 8 per cent, on the capital employed, he will destroy all i ncentive to profit-making. A company which last year made £50,000 would say this year, "" It is useless to try to push our It business to make increased profits, because they will all be absorbed by the Government."" As these proposals will have far-reaching results upon all our industries, I earnestly recommend the Treasurer to appoint a Committee to take evidence on the subject. I do not wish in any sense to put obstacles in the way of him receiving the necessary revenue, but I am sure his desire is to get his revenue while doing the least harm he can to the industries of Australia. His proposals as outlined, if applied in their present form, will destroy that incentive to industry and to make profits which should be the guiding principle of any business firm, and he wil l probably make less revenue than he would if he continued in 1916-17 to take only that proportion of the profits which he proposes to take .for 1915-16. W it h the proposed tax on amusements I think every member is in accord, but the Treasurer would be wise if he ear-marked the resulting revenue for repatriation purposes. I know he has a special proposal for that purpose, but we have heard even up to the present time a great number of complaints about the way in which returned soldiers are being treated, and we want to help them all we can. I am sure the Treasurer desires this also, and I would therefore earnestly suggest that \ \ per cent, on the capital value of the whole of the capital of Australia, giving £10,000,000, will not be sufficient, and strongly recommend that the tax on amusements should be ear-marked for the same purpose. The control of the repatriation funds should be put into the hands of business people. Keep the politician out of it altogether. plenty of work to do here. surer does as I suggest, he will find the money far better administered, and everybody concerned treated more fairly. There will be no political influence if the Treasurer gets some sound business men to control the expenditure of the f u n d for the benefit of the men who come back from the front.",37

186,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"They are mostly people who are giving their services for nothing, which they cannot reasonably be expected to do. If we desire a f u n d of £10,000,000 to be expended in the in terests of our soldiers when they ret u r n , we should place it in the hands of good, sound, solid business people, who are paid for the work, and will devote their whole time to it . The strictures passed by the right honourable member for Swan this afternoon in regard to extravagance were in every sense justified. There is undoubtedly a necessity for economy in the administration of public affairs. am sure the Treasurer is full y impressed with the necessity for care in bringing forward his taxation measures. He knows perfectly well that when we take money from the people by taxation we l i m it the power of the people to employ labour. If we tax them heavily, we tend seriously to reduce employment and destroy industry. It is therefore wise in bringing forward taxation proposals to take the utmost care that we do not ask for more than the people can afford to give. I do not think the proposals brought forward to-night have gone too far, but one cannot help noting a very grave increase in expenditure, not only in administrationan increase which is not at all justifiedbut also in proposed new works. Not one of the new works, involving a colossal expenditure, embodied in the Government proposals will mean an extra 6d. in pro duction. We have to depend on our primary industries for our wealth. We have only to look at Knibbs to see the him some sources from which the wealth of Australia comes.

Honourable members should not forget that at the present time there are 250,000 of our workmen who are either in our military camps or at the front , and that our in dustries can well absorb the labour that is left here, without the Government assisting to make it difficult to procure labour. Surely it is not necessary for the Government to push on with works such as I have enumerated when 250,000 of our men are absent. What will it matter if some of these naval bases are delayed for t a couple of years ? We shall want money later on, and we shall want to provide our returned soldiers with work. I feel certain that our boys at the front will advertise Australia so well that they will bring a large number of immigrants back with them. They are sure to cause a big influx I of immigrants to the Commonwealth. If we have the money then, that will be the time when we should proceed with works such as I have outlined. I would have liked, however, to see a special effort made to start undertakings which ultimately will prove not only self-sustaining, but which will add to the settlement of a large number of persons on the land. The Treasurer knowB full well that when our .soldiers return to this country, the States will need.to go in for building railways. It will be idle to put a man on the if there is not a railway within about miles of him to take his produce to ket. Consequently, it is essential that should make every effort to save money now.",38

192,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Does the honourable member realise that Western Australia occupies a third of the whole of this conall tinent, and that there is room there for the year. millions of people f That State is urgently in need of development, and a great deal of that development will have to be done by the State. The Government of Western ment by statistics. Australia must undertake works with a view to the settlement of .the people on the land. What chance would that State have of being adequately represented this Parliament! It would be entitled only five members.",39
193,Mr SHARPE,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,What is its population,39
194,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I have already pointed out its are* and potentialities.,39
195,Mr YATES,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,The honourable member always considered acres and billy-goats in preference to human beings.,39
196,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,The honourable memthe ber himself would be sorry to leave the future development of South Australia the hands of the Commonwealth Govern the ment.,39
197,Mr YATES,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"No fear. I am a ""Onificationist. Do not worry.",39
198,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Then I am sorry South Australia has many more repreparties sentatives like the honourable member. would find out what are the evils attenhas dant upon Unification when the developdent ment of the State from which be hails was vested in the bands of a few officials at Canberra.,39
199,Mr YATES,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,It cannot be worse than the Legislative Councils of the States.,39
200,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I do not see why the Government wish, to absorb labour at the present time.. There is no need for it . land We cannot forget, as was pointed out by 10 the right honourable member for Swan, marthat during the last few quarters there we has been an alarming increase in the number of industrial disputes throughout Australia. What is the reason for that? Look at the statistics relating to these disturbhave ances in New South Wales. Mr HANNAN,-If a man goes home to his dinner and forgets to return to his work it is registered as an industrial dis",39
201,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,During the first quarter of the present year over £260.000 was lost in wages. Was that the result of men going home to their dinners and neglecting to return to their employment ? Week after week our newspapers are ful l is of reports concerning industrial disputes.,39
202,Mr HANNAN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,As great a loss of wages is involved in the declaration of one unnecessary public holiday as is involved in our industrial disturbances throughout,39
203,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I would like the honourable member to justify that state,39
204,Mr HAWKAN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,It is a fact.,39
205,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The unfortunate feature is that these disputes extend even into businesses that are controlled by the to Federal Government. Despite the keen desire of Ministers to placate their own ? supporters, we find industrial disputes occurring day after day in Government enterprises. The loss thus occasioned is not represented by the loss - of wages, but by the national loss which accrues. I put all these troubles down to the existence of Arbitration.Court. I do not know of any country in the world where greater in animosity exists between the worker and capitalist than exists in Australia. I - do not know who is to blame for this.. It . seems to me that it is entirely due to the if work of the Arbitration Court When resort to that tribunal, they go He there to fight. Each side knows that it to put its best case before the Presiof the Court. Take the position of the sugar industry today. I am sure that nobody feels it more keenly than does the Treasurer. He knows that millions of pounds have been invested in that industry. He knows that thousands of men have embarked' their all in it. Yet we find that it is now threatened with col-: lapse, and that chaos prevails.",39
206,Mr YATES,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"""Why is that?",40
207,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Le t the honourable member read the award of the Acting Judge of the Arbitration Court, and he will know.",40
208,Mr YATES,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,The growers have gone on strike.,40
209,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"And I would go on strike in similar circumstances. there is. a great difference between the sugar-grower who goes on strike and the workman who goes on strike. The latter not'only refuses to work himself,, but generally declines to allow any other person to work in his stead. So far as the sugargrower is concerned, he has simply to suspend operations. He cannot employ other people -. He has to lose the whole of his production for the year, or pay the wageswhich the - Court has awarded. But I wish, more particularly, to make a few observations in regard to the Small Arms Factory.; ' In this connection I directed the attention of honourable members the. other evening to certain facts within my own knowledge. I did not like having-to do so, but I had previously made representations on .the matter which were without effect. I read in the Argus today that it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the erection-of an arsenal, and that journal gavethe names of those who are to be intrusted with the expenditure upon this work. Now I pointed out some time ago that the construction of an arsenal will cost anything from £2,250,000 to £2,500,000. If we are going to expend this money, we ought to see that full value is obtained for it. Now, although I object to State Socialism, I think that if there is one avenue of manufacture which the Governmentought to control, it is that of the manufacture of munitions. But when we enter' upon this undertaking the nation should get a fair deal. The other night I pointed out that in 1914, 360 rifles from our Small Arms Factory were sent to ""Western Australia, out of which number more than 100 were unfit to be supplied to the troops. Yet those weapons had been sent out of the factory after having been tested, and examined. Since, then I have heard of - several other consignments that were equally bad. I have already related my own experience when I found that the forearms of some' of these rifles snapped like rotten carrots, that the bolts were so badly fitted* that the weapons were absolutely unsafe for men to use Mr W. EIXIOT JOHNSON - Hav e any of these rifles been used by our men at the front?",40
210,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Some were sent there. And although the Minister for DeRut fence told the people of Bendigo the other day that we were not only supplying our own troops with, rifles, but those of other Dominions also, the statement is not a fact. I also pointed out the other evening that, whereas it was originally estimated that these rifles would cost £3 9s. Id. eacb, so far as I could gather from the last report of the Auditor-General, which was issued only about three weeks ago, they are costing about £15 each.",40
211,Mr LAIRD SMITH,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Was that the Auditor-General's report for 1915?,40
212,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Yes ; but it dealt, with the factory report for 1914. I have asked the Minister to allow the 1915 report to be published at once. I was anxious to induce the Department to send inspectors to inspect the rifles before these were sent away from the factory. About half-a-dozen, inspectors were sent up there, with the result that hundreds of. rifles ready to be sent out were condemned. They were taken to pieces, and faults were found in - every rifle that was examined. The report I have statesThere is a state of chaoswhich is almost beyond imagination. Thousands of component parts have been scrapped. Many hundreds of rifles that were ready to be sent out have been stripped and all found to be defective, with the result that the men employed to assemble the rifles are now engaged in trying to save the best of them. The present condition of affairs is. most deplorable, and demands immediate attention and reform.",40
213,Mr HANNAN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Is it not a fact that the rifles are fx) undergo certain alterations! .,40
214,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"No ; the rifles are being sent, out for use in Australia. According to a rough calculation I made, they cost about £15 a piece, but God knows what they will cost' now.",40
215,Mr BAMFORD,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"From , what is the honourable member quoting ?",40
216,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Fro m a report I havereceived; and I speak, also, from my personal knowledge - There should be an . inquiry into this condition of affairs. It is a. serious matter when we are asked to spend.an enormous sum of money upon an arsenal. A large quantity of machinery for the factory was ordered subsequent tq the declaration of war at a higher price than it could have been secured for earlier. Only a few parts of that machinery have been placed in position. For the want of shafting, the majority of it still remains to be placed in position. The Minister for Defence knows this to be the condition of affairs, and he is asking us to accept the advice of Colonel Owen, as a military expert. I do not wish to detract from Colonel Owen's reputation - in any way, but we cannot look upon him as an expert in regard to the manufacture of munitions. I do not suppose that be was ever in a munitions factory in his l if e until he went to India to make inquiries in connection with the establishment of an arsenal there. We bave had a Small Arms Factory in existence for some years now, and, as the result of bad management, which has been hidden by the M in ister for Defence, it is reduced to a state of chaos.",40
217,Mr LAIKD SMITH,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,The member will admit that Colonel Owen had excellent men with ' him.,41
218,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I admit that Mr MCKay is a first class engineer. no wish to reflect upon him ; b ut he is not a specialist in work of this sort. Again, it must be' remembered that the arsenal could not be completed within the next three or four years, and cannot be of slightest value to us so far as this war concerned. We shall be able later on purchase the most up-to-date machinery at from half to two-thirds of the price He saysof machinery today. Revolutions are daily taking place in the methods adopted onIfthe in the manufacture of war munitions, if we delay in this matter we shall be able later to purchase for our arsenal the best machinery that can be produced, and to secure the most expert advice for its conwork trol and management. What we now is some one who can successfully of manage the Small Arms Factory at L it h gow. One cannot say too much in praise of the workmen at Lithgow. went there they were working only one shift, but the men said they were pared to work two shifts of twelve hours, and every t h i r d Sunday in the month. The men are willing to work, and are good workmen, but it is the management of the factory that bas failed. It is in such .state of chaos today that an exhaustive examination would show that it should be closed down immediately, or such alterations should be made as would enable it to produce an effective weapon. That is the sort of thing that is eoir\p on under Government control. Honourable members opposite tell us how necessary it is that there should be Government control, not only of this, but also of other industries, the State control of which is not nearly so important. I should like to quote one or two references from the report of the Public Accounts Committee concerning the results of another attempt on the part of the Government to carry on work of this sort. I refer to the Cockatoo. Island Dock, and I quote the following from the report of the Committee, signed by members of this HouseThe estimated complete cost of the Brisbane, as supplied by the Navy Office, is £610,000. This does not include any proportionate charges for interest, depreciation, or supervision. The Sydney, built in Groat Britain, on the Clyde, cost £385,000, and the Melbourne, constructed at Birkenhead, cost £405,000.",41
219,Mr HANNAN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The .honourable member honourable is no doubt aware that labourers emp l o y e d for 4s. 6d. and 6s. per day on the Clyde get 10s. here, and tradesmen em. ployed on the Clyde at 6s. and 7s. per day I bave get 13s. here.",41
220,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"What I should like the honourable member for Fawkner to do is to read the Teport published by Mr . K in g Salter, the manager.of the Cockatoo the Island Dockyards, who points out that is the present administration is the cause to of the loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds annually to the Commonwealth. they would only allow me to employ men piece-work system, I could get men to and come from the Old Country. They will not come here now, because they can earn more at piece-work in the Old Country than they could earn here at day work, and the cost of living is less. If they could be employed on piecethey could earn between £7 and £8 a need week here. I could save hundreds of thousands pounds, and get vessels out in a reasonable time, and we should not be losing the effective life of those vessels as we are doing today. When we Mr Laird SMITH - Is it not a fact that such workmen are not 'allowed to leave preGreat Britain at the present time?",41
221,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I am speaking of a time before the war. This work was started before the war. The Brisbane was to be a completed in 1914. She is not completed yet; and God knows when she will be.,41
222,Mr HANNAN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,How many 'hours do they work along the Clyde to make the wages referred to by the honourable member under the piece-work system),42
223,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I have a report issued by Mr Lloyd George, in which he refers to the number of hours that are worked on the Clyde, and, as a rule, they are very few indeed.",42
224,Mr LAIKD SMITH,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Unde r war conditions?,42
225,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I repeat that I am not speaking of war conditions, but of a time before the war, and at Cockatoo Island thoseconditions bave been - continued up to the present time. majority of the Committee presenting the report from which I have quoted was composed of honourable members of the other side. Here is a reference made to the cost of other vesselsAs another comparison between the cost of work at Cockatoo and elsewhere, the case of the sister launches Gresswell and Jenner was cited to the Committee. The former vessel was built at Cockatoo, the latter by Messrs. Robinson Bros., of Melbourne. The cost of the Oresavxll is given as £12,800, which, again, does not include proportionate charges for interest, depreciation, and supervision, Buch as have to be added by private firms. The Jenner was contracted for at £5,000. We understand that the firm concerned lost about £1,000 on this undertaking. Adding this to the contract price of the Jenner, we find-'that, in the case of the Oresswell, certain alterations were carried out, costing about £500. There was a further addition to the cost through the vessel having to bear an unusual amount of holiday charges. Also that considerable delay was caused by nondelivery of materials. Making due allowance for these, it would - appear that the launch built at Cockatoo cost about double the price of a similar vessel, admitted to be a satisfactory job, constructed at a private yard.",42
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"What is the answer - to that? - Mr GREGORY - There can be only .one answer, and that is that the Govern. ment have dismally failed in the adminis-' tration of these works. This House should have reports showing every detail connected with the operations in these Government factories, so that the public may be in a position to decide whether they are being carried on successfully or not.",42
227,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,What about the awards the men at Cockatoo Island are working under?,42
228,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"It w i ll give honourable members some idea of the way in which tilings are done at Cockatoo Island when they learn what the general manager had to say about the awards in operation there. He said"" Here I am,"" working under fifty-one awards, and new ones keep cropping up every day. How on earth can a man run an establishment of this sort and meet the contending forces of fifty-one different awards?"" Several unions cover one industry. There are two painters' unions. There are three carpenters' unions. The labourers have many unions, and many awards and conflicting awards. It is absolutely impossible to try to run this island on economio lines, when you have so many conflicting rates of pay and overtime, and all that The - sort of thing, and different rates for night shift. One of the greatest difficulties here is the multiplicity of labourers' unions, necessitating the employment of a much larger number of men than is necessary. One union .allows its members to handle steel and iron, another union only allows its men to handle wood. If I require a labourer to do general carting about the yard, I must have a man of one union to cart the steel and iron, and a member of another union to cart wood. , . . All the painters and dockers insist that they shall cart all wood about, and the iron workers' assistants insist that they shall cart all sf$el and iron about. I have to pay the assistants to one grade 9s.,. though the award rate is only 8s.; I have to pay the shipwrights' assistant, who is a painter and docker, 10s. per day. We should have a uniform rate for labourers, and a man who is a labourer should do ordinary labourers' work. Where we require assistance for a mechanical man, we should get men accustomed to the trade, and get uniformity that way. That is the essence of economy in work of this sort; but as for general carting about, lifting gear, and carting about bars and plates; I have to have two or three unions to do this work. Another instance is that the labourers assisting iron workers are not allowed, according to the painters and dockers, to clear up the work behind them. I must bring in a man of another union to do that. He goes on to sayOnly the other day I had the secretary of a union here who insisted that I must employ builders' labourers on a work that had nothing to do with building, that is, a coffer-dam. Their award is aFederal award, providing for fortyfour hours a week, and if I employed those labourers for forty-eight hours that the other men work, I should have to pay them overtime rates. I - could multiply these matters ad. infinitum. I had a fight the other day between certain trades over a temporary gantry. The joiners and shipwrights had a battle royal oyer it as to whether it was joiners' or shipwrights' work. I managed to fix them up. These questions of demarcation lead to endless deputations. In the last few months I have kept a clerk practically half his time employed in taking down shorthand notes of deputations on questions of demarcation and other grievances. - Mr JENSEN - We have shorthand writers here taking down our grievances.",42
229,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The Minister for the Navy visits Cockatoo Island to settle matters in dispute, hut he takes care that the public shall not know what his decision is in its entirety. Some time ago I asked the Minister for Home Affairs to lay on the table the requests made to him by workers at Canberra. The carpenters asked 18s. per day. These are people suffering on account of the war, and for whom we have been asked to provide work, and they ask for 18s. per day, and if the carpenter has to go 20 feet above the ground he asks for 2s. per day extra.",43
230,Mr JENSEN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Was that granted ?,43
231,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I do not think so; but I wish to know what is being done.,43
232,Mr HANNAN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The carpenter is quite right in asking for the money, if he thinks he can get it .",43
233,Mr MATHEWS,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Contractor s try to make all the profit they can.,43
234,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"It may be quite right to say that these men are justified in asking for such wages, if they think they can get them; b ut we do not want politicians dependent upon these men for their votes to be able to use public money in order to placate them. Le t us consider the proposal of the Treasurer. We find that £5,100,000 has already been voted for the transcontinental railway, and he wants £1,600,000 more.",43
235,Mr LAIRD SMITH,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Shal l we stop the construction of the line?,43
236,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"If that railway had been constructed under contract, it would have cost something like £4,500,000, and its construction would have been of completed before now. see the interests of the Commonwealth protected, and I should like this railway in time to be able to pay interest on construction and working expenses. I object to politicians using their positions by tralia spending public money to placate people. Mr . LAIRD SMITH - D i with your Government in regard to the Teesdale Smith contracts?",43
237,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I have had as much not experience of public works as any other member of this House, with the exception, perhaps, of the right honourable member for Swan,' because for nine years I was a Minister of the Crown in Western Australia, where, in regard to the public works, we were not tied to the contract system on the one hand or to the day-labour system on the other. We would call for tenders, and also ask the Engineer-in-Chief, as head of the Department, for an estimate of a particular work. If we found that a contractor was well within or close up to that estimate, we had that work done by contract, but if \se thought that the contractors were putting their heads together to fleece the Government, we did the work by day labour. We carried out a lot of work in that way, and we got it well done, too. request",43
238,Mr JENSEN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"You admit that you had to adopt day labour because contractors were trying to "" get at "" the Government?",43
239,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Yes ; but in regard to Commonwealth works the Government are pledged to the day-labour system altogether, and that, I think, is not at all a desirable state of affairs. I admit that the manufacture of munitions should be under the control of the Government, and I was only pointing out what an a w f ul mess has been made in regard to the Small Arms Eactory. P r i o r to the establishment of that factory, all the particulars were submitted to Parliament, and there was a guarantee that with the plant then to be installed-it has since been in creased-15 2 unskilled and two skilled workmen, working eight hours a day, would be able to turn out 15,000 rifles a year. I have already shown that the output was very small indeed.",43
240,Mr HANNAN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Would you not get the same difference in the cost of production rifles here as compared with the cost of I wish to rifles in America, and the cost of boots here and boots in America?",43
241,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I cannot say; but I know the estimated cost of a rifle in Auswas £3 9s. I d . , based on wages of 8s. these per day of eight hours.",43
242,Mr THOMSON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,And working under d that happen Australian conditions.,43
243,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Yes , under Australian conditions absolutely. But I would complain about the cost of the rifles if they were f it to be handed to our troops. I do object, and I think every member in this House should object, if rifles manufactured in Australia are not as perfect as possible.",43
244,Mr HANNAN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,The official report from Gallipoli was to the effect that the Australian rifle compared more than favourably with rifles from any other part of the world.,44
245,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I did not see that report, and I do not believe that anything of the sort was said, because I know perfectly well that hundreds of rifles turned out by the Lithgow Factory have been sent to the armoury, and that at the present time inspectors, appointed by the fence Department, are condemning the rifles in hundreds. What is the use of trying to evade these facts? An inquiry should be held at once into this matter.",44
246,Mr YATES,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,What is wrong? Are the workmen clumsy?,44
247,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,No ; I think the fault lies in the administration.,44
248,Mr YATES,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,B y the Minister?,44
249,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Probably by the man in charge; but the Minister should not attempt to hide these things.,44
250,Mr YATES,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,An Arbitration Court should be able to deal with him.,44
251,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"An Arbitration Court! It would require more than that. What we want is a man of courage to effectively control the factory. I would not care if we paid him £1,500 a year so long as he could train the others, and sure first-class workmanship. That is what we want, and nothing more. think I have said quite enough to show that an inquiry is necessary before the Government go ahead with the expenditure in connection with the arsenal. Moreover, it is essential that this inquiry should be made as speedily as possible. I want now to say something concerning the system of controlling the notation of companies. This is in the hands of the Treasurer, but Parliament never intended that a matter of this sort should be placed under his control. I can quite understand that the Treasurer should be in a position to prevent money going out of Australia, or being utilized for some pose which, in his opinion, would be inimical to the best interests of the nation; but I think that the Treasurer is making a very great mistake in the embargo with regard to mining adventures. He is acting, I understand, on the advice of a gentleman who occupies an honorary position.",44
252,Mr GROOM,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Are you referring to a man outside the Public Service?,44
253,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I am referring to Mr Higgins, who has been brought into advise the Minister with regard to these particular matters.",44
254,Mr GROOM,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,In an honorary capacity?,44
255,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Yes . An officer in his position should be paid by the Government, and be under the control of the Minister.",44
256,Mr HIGGS,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Mr Higgins' service in that capacity is part of the service which De- he is rendering in connection with the war.,44
257,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Is he paid by theAttorney-General's Department?,44
258,Mr HIGGS,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"No , I believe not.",44
259,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Then he is an hon orary officer?,44
260,Mr HIGGS,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I believe you are quite right.,44
261,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Well , there is something wrong with the system. I understand from Mr Higgins that he has been working twenty hours a day, doing an enormous amount of work for the Government, and to my mind some of it requires very close investigation.",44
262,Mr HIGGS,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,What does the honourable member mean by that statement? May we take it that it has a sinister meaning ?,44
263,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"No , I did not mean in- in any sinister sense. I am speaking with regard to the qualifications of the gentleI man mentioned to deal with the several matters that he is advising upon. With regard to the export of molybdenite, I pointed out that when the war began the British Government had urgently wanted this metal of which Australia was producing about two-thirds of the world's out> put. We had been sending it out of Australia for many years, and the average grade was about 80 per cent. As a rule we could not produce a higher grade ore, and prior to the war the metal produced here was purchased by America, Germany, France, Great Britain, and other nations. When the war started the British Government wanted it very badly, pur- and advised that they were prepared to pay 105s. per unit for 90 per cent, grade. For some years several people in Australia had specialized in the molybdenite business, and had contracts with the Mother Country; but when control of the export trade was vested in the Government, the responsible Minister handed over the whole business of exporting molybdenite, wolfram, and the associated alloy metals to Dalgety and Company, who were also paid an extraordinary commission for handling it . The Attorney General's Department bungled the business in the first place, because-as they did not understand the matter-the y would not allow any molybdenite to be sent out of Australia unless it was 90 per cent, grade. The British Government were prepared to accept 80 per cent, grade, but would make a reduction on the price offered for 90 per cent, grade. Large quantities of molybdenite were ready to be sent from Australia just at the time when Great Britain wanted it , perhaps, more than anything else, and this official bungling, in my opinion, was criminal. Prior to the war the cost of sending molybdenite to London was about £ 6 per ton, but when the Government handed the business over to Dalgety and Company, they allowed £ 5 5 16s. 8d. per ton for freight, and gave them the sole right to trade in that metal during the currency of the war. It was only after representations were made by the Imperial Government that a certain person in Sydney, a man who had interested himself very greatly in this trade, was allowed to complete the contracts which he had entered into prior to the war. Now, with regard to the flotation of mining companies, the Treasurer, acting on the advice of this honorary official, might refuse half-a-dozen out of ten propositions, with the result that the four which might be approved of would bear the hall-mark of the Department. In such circumstances, I can quite understand that the clever gentlemen behind such propositions would take advantage of the position, and would say to the public, "" We have taken this proposition to the Department, they have examined every phase of it to see whether it is fair or not; they turned down in numerable other proposals, but have agreed to this, so you can come into it with every confidence."" This is a big responsibility for the Government to take. It is quite possible that the Treasurer will do an in j u r y to the mining industry i allows this thing to continue. I do not say that every proposal should be placed before the public, but I think I have said enough to indicate the danger of the present position so far as the development of mining is concerned. During the nine years that I was Minister for Mines in Western Australia, we were informed many times that unscrupulous people had come forward with proposals to deceive investors, and we were asked if we could take action to control them, but we were always confronted with the difficulty that, before doing anything in that direction, the various propositions ought to be examined. If we sent an inspector today, a reef may assay 4 oz. in the face, but tomorrow fail to show values. The difficulty is to prove f r a u d . The danger I see in regard to the Government proposals to control the flotation of mining companies is that the hall-mark of the Department might be placed upon certain propositions. The Minister should allow mining propositions to follow their ordinary course unless he finds that more money is being utilized on such expenditure than is advisable in the interests of the Commonwealth. I urge on the Government the necessity for making public as speedily as possible their proposals for the coming season's wheat pool. Many strictures have been passed on me because I expressed the opinion a few nights ago that the wheat pool would probably prove detrimental to the farmers' interests. In a few weeks another big harvest will be added to the 30,000,000 bags of wheat that are now on hand in the pool, and one cannot help looking forward with misgivings to its future possibilities. I - trust that the Government will make public their proposals in regard to this matter as speedily as possible, so that the producers may know what their position will be. Mr - FENTON (Maribyrnong) [8.46] We could almost dub the honourable member for Dampier the Jeremiah from the West. He has been telling a dismal tale for an hour past. His wail in regard to the arsenal, about which he is so often talking, reminds me of the men who a few years ago endeavoured to prevent Australia from establishing her own N a v y ; made all sorts of prophecies about it , and raised all sorts of opposition to Australia doing all she possibly could for herself. Some honourable members find it quite f he easy to say that what is attempted to be done in Australia is always a huge failure, and what is done for Australia in other parts of the world is always a success.",44
264,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I said nothing of the sort.,45
265,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,That was th© effect of the honourable member's remarks. No one knows better than he that there is nothing more necessary in Australia today than the establishment of an arsenal as soon as it can possibly be done. The honourable member spoke as if all the machinery required for the arsenal was to be purchased tomorrow. He knows full well that that is not the intention. He has heard sworn testimony that there will be a time when Australia can enter the field and purchase the machinery it requires from those who are now using it in the manufacture of munitions.,46
266,Mr ATKINSON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Does not the able member think that there should first be a thorough inquiry by experts ?,46
267,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,There has been an in quiry by experts.,46
268,Mr GREGORY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Would the honourable member build the arsenal before he knew what machinery was to be placed in it ?,46
269,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"No , but I would make all the preliminary tions. The honourable member been wailing about the new impositions on the taxpayers for the purpose of carrying on the war. One of the first essentials in the establishment of an arsenal is money. I am glad that the Minister for Defence is taking this matter in hand in a hearty fashion, and that he is accepting the advice tendered to him by the committee of experts that visited India and examined similar establishments there.",46
270,Mr ATKINSON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Is the honourable member satisfied that it is proposed to be b u in a suitable place ?,46
271,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Yes . One of the most eminent engineers in Australia; Mr . MCKay, of Walkers Limited, who was one of the experts who visited India, gave evidence before the Public Works Committee, and said, "" There is no better site in Australia than the Tuggeranong site at Canberra."" One of the reasons for the opposition of the honourable member for Dampier to the establishment of an arsenal there is that it will mean creating a city where the workmen will dwell under the most model conditions. Honourable members opposite do not like this idea. We shall establish a workmen's city, with a population of about 20,000.",46
272,Mr KELLY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"If the Government propose to do these things at Tuggeranong, why have they not done them already at Lithgow ?",46
273,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I am glad to see that a sum of money has been placed on the Works Estimates ' for the purpose of carrying on a vigorous policy in regard to the establishment of an arsenal. Australia is a long way behind in such matters, and any impeding of the object that th© Minister has in view in this regard would be criminal.",46
274,Mr ATKINSON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,No one will impede the establishment of an arsenal if it is started properly.,46
275,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Before putting on such a judicial air, and casting an opinion on a question that he has not studied, the honor- honourable member should view the sit© and hear, the evidence in regard to its suitability for the purpose for which it has been recommended.",46
276,Mr SAMPSON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Will the honourable member allow me to ask him a question?,46
277,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The honourable member, as a member of the Public Works Committee, which was almost unaniprepara- mous in its decision that Tuggerahas nong is one of the best sites for an arsenal, has already had ample opportunity of putting questions and of hearing satisfactory replies to them: Apart from my connection with the Public Works Committee, I propose to do all that I can to assist in the establishment ot an arsenal in Australia. Steel rolling works are essential to ship-building and the manufacture of guns. An arsenal will help very materially in the work of maintaining our mercantile fleet. If the Australia stood in need of repairs to one of i lt her plates, there would be no place in the Commonwealth where a new plate could be rolled out.",46
278,Mr KELLY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Surely the honourable member does not propose to roll plates for the Australia at Tuggeranong?,46
279,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I am surprised that two young, vigorous Australians on the Opposition benches are opposed to Australians doing Australia's work with Australian workmen.",46
280,Mr ATKINSON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,That statement is quite incorrect.,46
281,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"An arsenal is absolutely essential for Australia's progress and defence. That is why I am so much in earnest in my hope that the Ministry will have no hesitation in going on with this work. When the facts are before honourable members. I believe that they will not hesitate in swinging behind the Ministry in this matter. We ought to b© further ahead than we are. We do not know what troubles lie before us, and material, dependence on overseas for our requiresible. ments is a most foolish policy. Australia has already had a splendid example of what can be done in regard to the manuraw facture of certain articles required in fare. As the result of our foresight establishing a factory of our own in order to make ourselves absolutely independent of importations of cordite, the Commonraw wealth Cordite Factory has supplied nou only the cartridges for our own Expedicularly tionary Forces, but also the requirements of other parts of the British Empire i this respect. Experts say that our cordite in Australia. is absolutely better than that turned out in Great Britain. When the Victorian State Government first determined to arsenal ? manufacture locomotives, because the work was new to the engineers, it took a long time to turn out tirade, one or two, and those cost a great deal more than the engines turned day. People put it down to the "" Government stroke,"" and raised a cry about the Government making that which previously had been purchased oversea; but time went on, and the workshops at NewGovernment port were better equipped, and manned, and officered, they began to produce locomotives superior to, and cheaper than, those turned out at Philadelphia. honourable members would obtain from the Engineer-in-Chief of the Victorian Railways the prices of engines manufacmany tured at Newport Workshops and compare them with the prices of engines manufache tured in England and America, they gow. would find that at Newport Australian workmen are doing splendid work. Cerprietary tainly there were difficulties at the coma mencement of engine construction there, just as there were in connection with commencement of ship-building in Australian dockyards. We were bound have trouble with the first war ship built in Australia, but when the initial difficulties have been overcome, and workmen are well trained and officered, we shall be able to do work of a quality equal to that of any other part of the tories. world. The Government have set a splendid example. Australia, with its coast line of 8,000 miles, must become a maritime country, and we should endeavour to build in the Commonwealth all the ships we require for both our Navy and the cantile marine. I believe that every true Australian is desirous that this country, which is so marvellously blessed with raw shall be as self-contained as posI f there is a country in the world that ought to be self-contained it is Australia. Can we continue for ever sending material in large quantities to other warparts of the world to be made up and then in imported back for Australians themselves to use? Surely it is time we were out of that wood, and converted our own material into the finished article. It is essentially Australia's duty, and partithis Parliament's duty, to try to have work, such as the manufacture of n munitions and the building of ships, done",46
282,Mr KELLY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Why assume that any one is opposed to the establishment of an,47
283,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I cannot for ever sit down and listen quietly to a general the effect of which is that the Australian workman and the Australian out toarticle are no good.,47
284,Mr KELLY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Nonsense .,47
285,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"When the honourable member for Dampier was speaking, the as burden of his argument was that under control, and in Government factories nothing good could be done.",47
286,Mr FLEMING,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,:-He said the workmen If are doing their work very well.,47
287,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"So they are, but the honourable member for Dampier said things about Australian workmen which were of a different tenor from what had to say about the workmen pf L it h One could not regard Mr Delprat, the general manager of the Broken Hill ProCompany, as a labourite,but when question was put to him with regard to the intelligence and general adaptability the of the Australian workman, he said '' There is no better workman in the world to than the Australian."" Then if we have to be in Australia the best workmen in the world, why are we always despising the our products of those workmen? They are turning out products superior in workmanship to the output of American facThe honourable member for Dampier made a complaint in regard to some of the rifles. A few of us have had the privilege of firing out of an Australian-made rifle. I do not claim to be a judge of a rifle, but merI have heard it said by men who rank among the most expert riflemen in Australia that some of the best weapons they have handled have been made at Lithgow. A reference to the Hansard reports of the Canadian Parliament will show that the same kind of discussion has taken place in the Dominion in regard to the Ross rifle. The Canadian troops were armed with that rifle and sent to the front, and complaint was continually made that something was wrong with it . Investigations proved the complaints to be of a trumpery character, and it was shown that the condemnation should have been of the ammunition used rather than of the rifle. I believe that we have overcome the initial difficulties in connection with the manufacture of rifles in Australia, and I trust that the Government will extend their manufacturing operations to many other articles. In order to emphasize the high qualifications of Australian workmen I would remind honourable members that from 600 to 1,000 Australians are working in some of the chief factories engaged in the production of munitions of war in Great Britain, and those who are complaining about the Australian artisans would receive a valuable education if they could go to the Old Country and see what these men are doing there. I am told on the best authority that the Australian workmen who went to the establishments of Vickers and Sons, and other firms, are able to turn out in seven hours work which takes other operatives eleven hours to do.  men.",47
288,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"No . Some of them went to England on their own responsibility and paid their own passages, and they are today displaying in British factories that fine spirit and quality which characterizes the Australian workman. I rose this evening mainly for the purpose of answering the continual opposition, to the establishment of an arsenal in. Australia. I hope there will be no more of these protests, but that we shall unite and have the arsenal speedily established on one of the best sites in Australia There is much work that an arsenal can do. I am not speaking only of what can be done from a defence point of view. Let honourable members think of the work that can be done for ordinary industries The Customs and Lighthouse Department will have big requirements to be catered for. Services will be required for Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, Papua, and, I believe, other places as well, and vessels will be needed to handle the island trade. Therefore, for peaceful operations alone it is essential that we should have a factory such as I have outlined. Above all, I maintain that one of the first branches of the arsenal to be established must be the steel works, to do all the work that is so necessary in connection with ship building and other industries.",48
289,Mr KELLY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Such works are already established at Newcastle.,48
290,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,The honourable member must know that at Newcastle the Broken Hill Proprietary Company is practically undertaking nothing more than the manufacture of steel rails.,48
291,Mr KELLY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,That is not all it proposes to do.,48
292,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The company may propose to extend its works. It is a thousand pities that we did not have those works established years ago, instead of continuing to send money overseas for thousands of miles of rails. I wish to prevent Australia getting into a state of sleepiness and sloth that will prevent us proceeding with the establishment of these works, even in war time. In Great Britain committees of various kinds have been formed for the purpose of assisting industries already established, and encouraging the establishment of others. We ought to have in Australia committees carrying out investigations of that kind. As far back as October, 1914, when Mr Fisher was Prime Minister, I made a suggestion, on the motion for adjournment, that a committee should be appointed to investigate the possibility of establishing new industries in the Commonwealth. I knew then that we should be cut off from many countries that previously supplied us with various commodities; but if Australia will take advantage of this cutting-off and establish industries of its own, the war will not prove as great a curse as it otherwise will be. We ouglft to do what Great Britain and Canada are doing, and whatthat little country in the East is doing, to capture the trade which the Huns once enjoyed. If we cannot do it now by means of a Tariff, we ought to adopt every other means open to us to found new industries in the Commonwealth. We could do in Australia with probably four or five steel works. For two or three years, or probably longer, after the termination of the war, we shall hardly be able to get a pound of steel from the other side of the world. There are hundreds of cities and towns in Europe to be rebuilt, and in their reconstruction steel will play a very important part. If Australia is not equipped to supply its own requirements in that regard, we shall be obliged to remain in the background for many years. It will be criminal neglect on our part if we do not do everything possible to have steel works established here. In regard to the financial statement, I understand that several of the principal items mentioned by the Treasurer will form the subject of separate Bills to be dealt with later. When those Bills come forward we shall have an opportunity of discussing the principles involved.",48
293,Mr YATES,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Are you not going to say something now ? Do you not know your party wants wealth to be conscripted ?,49
294,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"When the proposals come forward separately, if they are not suitable I shall make my views known.",49
295,Mr YATES,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,But generally speaking!,49
296,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Generally speaking, there are items in the Treasurer's proposals with which I do not agree. In many cases the proposals do not go far enough. I believe we could have raised money in ways other than those suggested. I have thought all along that the war afforded an excellent opportunity to revert to twopenny postage in Australia. I could not see any reason for reducing the letter rate from 2d. to I d . at a time when the postal expenditure so largely exceeded the revenue, though I am aware that every Postmaster-General whose term of office preceded the change was in favour of it . Certainly we should go back to the old rate now.  revenue by doing so?",49
297,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"No . revenue for the financial year, which ended the 30th June last, was over £2,500,000, and I believe that, had the postage on letters that year been 2d. instead of I d . , the Treasury would have received from £500,000 to £1,000,000 more. The honourable member must recollect that many more letters have been written and posted in recent years. The merchants of Australia use the post-office very largely, and, as I pointed out at the time, the various business enterprises of the [324] country were given a very substantial bonus when the letter rate was reduced by one-half.",49
298,Mr WEST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The loss occasioned by the introduction of penny postage was £400,000.",49
299,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,It must be remembered that the postal revenue of Australia today is much greater than it was when penny postage was introduced.,49
300,Mr KELLY,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Is not that partly due to the institution of penny postage ?,49
301,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"No . The business of Australia has increased, and I hope will continue to do so, and I think that the postal revenue would increase if the letter rate were again made 2d. We may need this increased revenue later, and I think that it should have been provided for almost at the beginning of the war. The right honourable member for Swan said this afternoon that a few persons in Australia were being called upon to meet the expenditure of the war, and that, so far as the masses of the people were concerned, they contributed very little, either directly or indirectly. The right honourable gentleman must know that the masses of the people, year in and yea! out, provide Customs and Excise revenue which, from the beginning, has formed a considerable part of the whole revenue of the Commonwealth.",49
302,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Yes ; but that revenue is used to meet ordinary expenditure.,49
303,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"It is estimated that the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth will amount this year to about £16,750,000.",49
304,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I was referring to last year.,49
305,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Las t year it was a little more; close upon £17,000,000.",49
306,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Onl y £2,000,000 of that was used to meet war expenditure. The postage Mr Fenton - The Treasurer has stated that something like £3,000,000 of revenue has been used to meet war expenditure. I am combating the right honourable member's assertion that the great masses of the people do not contribute much to the revenue of the country.",49
307,Mr SAMPSON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,The right honourable member meant the war expenditure.,49
308,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"There would be a sad shortage if it were not for the revenue from the Customs and Excise duties, which are paid by the masses of the people.",49
309,Sir JOHN FORREST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I am quite aware of that.,50
310,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I am glad to hear the admission. The right honourable member should give the people credit for the millions of pounds that they contribute yearly to the revenue. Personally, I should like to see Australia self-contained, and employment given to her people by the establishment of industries of all kinds. To bring about such a condition, I would impose an absolutely prohibitory Tariff. ",50
311,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"A Free Trade idea that! Are they crucified in other Protectionist countries? In my opinion, the proper way for Australia to meet the extraordinary circumstances of the present time is to look after herself. I should like to see anti-dumping legislation in troduced, so that no goods could come here unless they had been manufactured subject to certain conditions. Unfortunately, we are not establishing industries as we should do. The Prime Minister has appointed a Scientific Investigation Committee, some of whose work is probably very valuable, but. to my mind, we are not taking advantage of the brains that we have in Australia, as we should do, to establish new industries. I should like to see something done immediately. The war has made it necessary to i m pose very heavy taxation, and the burden is likely to become so intolerable that the people will ask before long why is Australia the prey of so many taxing agencies. Is it worthwhile maintaining so many State Parliaments?  most heavily taxed country in the world.",50
312,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Yes ; and, in proportion to population, it supports more members of Parliament than any other country. Sensible people will be saying soon that it is time that some of these Parliaments were abolished.",50
313,Mr WEST,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,It is a wonder that we have lived so long.,50
314,Mr FENTON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"The people are being roused, and will soon make their protest vocal, and effective at the ballot box. The question that will be put to every parliamentary candidate-Commonwealth and State-wil l be: "" A r e you favourable to the continuance of so many Parliaments in a country that has a population of only 5,000,000?"" We shall have to put the Constitutions of both the Commonwealth and the States into the melting pot, out of which, I hope, will come a powerful National Parliament, with, possibly, provincial assemblies to manage the domestic affairs of the States. The time has arrived when expenditure must be curtailed. Honourable members opposite complain that not enough work is given for the pay received, but I do not hear any of them asking why it is that each State has a separate Agent-General and a separate representative of the K in g. When Federation was established, it was said that the State Parliaments must decrease to such an extent that the moneys thus saved would pay all the expenses of the Federation. Has that been so? On the contrary, the expenditure has gone up by leaps and bounds, and it is time the people looked into the matter, as I hope and trust they will . This would be one way of saving considerable sums of money, and avoiding much taxation. When the items come before us, I shall discuss them on their merits. There are some to which I can give my hearty approval, but there are others which I shall do my best to get amended, if not rejected for the substitution of others. I hope that the Government will not be spineless or limp in regard to the establishment of an arsenai. In my opinion, they have been too hesitating and halting in the past. They have sufficient information now to justify them in making a start; and there must be much preliminary work before it is necessary to obtain a piece of machinery. is the When the war is over, the Government will be able to purchase the latest machinery for the purpose of turning out material, not only for the defence of Australia, but for the manufacture of articles necessary to many industries that they have established.",50
315,Mr CORSER,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Wide Bay) [9.28] - I regret that the honourable member for Maribyrnong should consider it necessary to suggest that honourable members on this side have objection to the labourers of the Commonwealth. I have not heard any honourable member on this side for one moment suggest that the labourers in Queensland, or in Australia generally, are not quite equal to the labourers in any other part of the world. My own opinion is that the men here are quite Competent to do well anything they undertake, if they only have the opportunity. In my own electorate some 250 locomotives have been turned out; and wherever these locomotives go-to South Australia, Victoria or elsewhere-the y are pronounced to be the best on the roads. I quite agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong that there are many things that ought to be done to help our industries, and provide more lucrative work here. The honourable member happened to mention that the development in the steel industry is not what it ought to be. In my opinion, the reason for that is that there is not sufficient protection on the manufacture of steel to enable the industry to be carried on successfully. Walkers Limited, of Maryborough, established large steel works for the purpose of turning out steel plant, but they were not able to use those works to their fullest capacity within about 50 per cent. If we had a little more protection we should have a large steel manufacturing industry in this country. As to locomotives, we now manufacture everything here with the exception of the tires, which, on account of the low protection it is found better to import. I feel sure that honourable members on both sides are alive to the fact that, if industries are established with sufficient protection, we can produce everything that can be produced elsewhere. Look, for example, at the enormous amount of wool there is in Queensland and Australia generally. Does it seem fair that this wool should have to be sent away, with freight paid, to be manufactured abroad, and brought back, at the cost of further freight and other charges, when the cloth and other material could be turned out here as well as in any country in the world? I only hope that the day is not far distant when we shall have well-equipped factories for the purpose of converting a large portion of our wool into the manufactured article. I have to compliment the Treasurer on at last giving us some information regarding the sugar in dustry, for the question is a burning one at the present time. I should like the honourable gentleman to bear in mind that every month we are losing about one-fourth of the whole output of the season. Up to the present time, the delay caused by the closing down which followed on the Dickson award, means a loss of one-third of the crop. That loss will affect not only the people of Queensland, but the [324]-- 2 people of the rest of Australia and the Treasurer. We have been told distinctly by the Treasurer that the Government price entails a loss of £ 2 per ton on the foreign sugar imported, after taking credit for the profit made on the Queensland sugar. If the industry is killed, or even if the sugar is not manufactured this seasonand if it is, it will haye to be by the 31st December-the Treasurer will find-that, instead of having to import sugar at a loss of £ 2 per ton, he will have to face a loss of nearly £ 5 . That will be a serious matter; and I appeal to the Treasurer and the House to take the question into serious consideration. The vast majority of the men affected are indust r i a l workers, who, with land obtained on'terms, have started growing in a small way; and they are now facing absolute ruin on account of the award. The effect of the imposition of the in creased wages is so great that it is impossible for the industry to live and thrive. When the last MACNaughton award was made, about two years ago, it was considered that it would be difficult for the growers, unless they had normal seasons, to make money out of the industry; but when it is remembered that the new award means an increase of practically. 50 per cent, in wages over the rate fixed then, the effect upon the sugar industry can be seen. Young fellows of eighteen and over are to be paid £5 2s. per week for work that the Judge holds can be well done by young fellows of. that age. The Judge calculated that about for ty men engaged i u the industry came from Tasmania, for t y from Sydney, and twenty from Brisbane. He put down £12 Is. as the cost of a man going"" from Tasmania to Cairns and back to Brisbane. He allowed twenty-one days' travelling and lost time at 13s.'per day, equalling £13 13s. He, deducted twenty-one days' food prodded on board steamer at 2s. 6d. per day, or £2 12s. 6d., leaving £23 Is. 6d., which is to be a tax upon the industry without the industry receiving a sixpence in return for it . Jle altered the previous award by abolishing the retention money, the effect of which will be that men may work t ill within a fortnight of the termination of the cut, and then leave without completing the harvest to take on some longer job, at great loss to the owner. He regarded the high cost of living as a reason for awarding higher wages to the men, but did not take it .into consideration when fixing the amount which the employer could charge for food provided by him. He ordered that if nine or more men wished it , the employer must provide food, and could deduct for it only 19s. per week. No less than seventy articles of diet are specified in the schedule for the men. It is clear that he did not take into consideration the fact that the higher cost of livin g would f all on the employer, because, if the schedule is to be supplied as set down, it cannot be done under 30s. a week per man. Consequently, another l is . must be added to the £5 2s. per week. It is such an extraordinary award that I am not at all surprised at the numerous telegrams I have received from various parts of Queensland telling me that they have shut down, and that there is no prospect of opening again, unless substantial relief is given. The additional cost to the producer is about £7 per ton. He is paid £18 a ton now for raw sugar. Only yesterday I received the following telegram from the Sugar Growers Union at Mackay:About one-third estimated total output of sugar now unable t'o be harvested owing cessation operations for past four weeks. Growers determined stand firm to bitter end, unless satisfactory . settlement sugar crisis secured, livery day now means ruinous loss to Commonwealth and community generally, owing sugar crops deteriorating. I am also informed that the executive committee are quite agreeable to have the matter referred to the Inter-State Commission.",50
316,Mr SAMPSON,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,What will be the loss in production?,52

I have been connected with the sugar industry since the first cane was grown in Australia, and have watched it minutely ever since. When I was in the Queensland Parliament, we calculated, after careful investigation, that when we passed the estimates for the Bobinda and Johnstone River mills those two additional mills would supply Australia with every pound of sugar that would be required in normal seasons. There are millions of acres of land in Queensland just as good as that already under cane, but it is of no use producing a ton more sugar than can be sold within the Commonwealth, because there would be a loss of £ 7 a ton in competing with cane grown in Java at a cost in wages per man of 4d. or 4£d. a day, as against 15s. 6d. a day in Southern Queensland and 17s. a day in Northern Queensland under the Dickson award.",52
322,Mr TUDOR,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"That was not the point the honourable member was making. He said they would lose £5,000,000, and I asked if none of that cane could stand over.",52
323,Mr CORSER,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Ver y little, because, owing to the drought preventing the cane being sufficiently large to cut last year, a great deal of it stood over u n t i l this year. If it stands over for another season the cane will deteriorate to such an extent that in some cases it will be absolutely worthless.",52
324,Mr TUDOR,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I put that. ' Mr CORSER - The Treasurer has remarked that during the war it will be again necessary to import foreign sugar to make up for the deficiency in our Australian production, and that war prices for foreign sugars may be so high that a loss of even more than £ 2 per ton may have to be met out of the profits. Now, the less sugar produced in Queensland the more will have to be imported, and the more that has to be imported the greater will be the loss on the sugar production of Australia. I contend that the loss already is a severe one, because, owing to the war, the Treasurer will have to find some hundreds of thousands of pounds more than he otherwise would. The Government have been asked to in .vite the Inter-State Commission to in quire into and report upon the industry, and they are willing to do so provided the agreement that was entered into between the Commonwealth, the Queensland Government, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Millaquin Sugar Refining Company be not subjected to review. I am glad that the Treasurer has again taken up this matter, and I hope that he will at once refer it to the t r i - .position will be worse. bunal in question. A delay of another month will mean that at least one-fourth more of this year's crop cannot be cut this season. I appeal to the Treasurer, without the loss of a single day, under the War Precautions Act , to suspend the Dickson award. If he does that, within a few hours .of the notification going forth, the sugar industry will be in full swing again and the 19,000 men engaged in it will be saved from r u in .",52
325,Mr SHARPS,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Is there not another way of overcoming the difficulty ?,53
326,Mr CORSER,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"There is no other way. The Treasurer has stated that the Government are not in favour of increasing the price of sugar to the consumer. We have asked that the profit that has been made on the sugar produced in Queensland shall go to the producer instead of being utilized to defray the cost of importing "" black "" sugars fro m overseas. The honourable gentleman has clearly pointed out that that money is required to minimize the cost of importations from abroad, and to enable the Commonwealth to sell at 3$d. per l b . . There is, therefore, no other means of overcoming this difficulty than that of suspending the Dickson award. I have never been an advocate of cutting down wages when an industry is well able to pay them. But the sugar industry is not able bo pay the rates fixed under that award. I am certain, too, that there are many other in dustries in the Commonwealth which could not carry a wages bill of £ 5 2s. per man per week of forty-eight hours. At a time like the present, it behoves us to find as much employment as possible for our people, and to help the families who have sent"" their boys to fight for the Empire, instead of imposing upon them a burden that is too grevious bo be borne. The Government should be sympathetic towards the sugar-growers of Queensland, and should say to them that, in all the circumstances, the Dickson award cannot stand, and must be repealed. must not forget that there are in the community quite a large number of business men, who have to support the sugar-growers practically for twelve months, and whose only chance of getting their accounts settled is when the harvest time comes round. Last year there was very little more than a thir d of the normal harvest; and this year the Thus, business men, as well as cane-growers, are threatened with ruination. If people are not able to secure interest upon their investments, it is scarcely necessary to point out that they will be called upon to pay less income tax than they otherwise would, and the Treasury will consequently suffer.' To-day there is between £11,000,000 and £12,000,000 invested in the sugar industry. ' There are 19,000 men directly interested in it , and many more thousands who are indirectly interested in it . I hope that the Treasurer will be able to tell us that we can save this industry from r u in , and succour the men in it who are suffering so keenly at present. In Bundaberg one firm alone-that of Young's-ha s turned out 200 draught horses because it will not cultivate its fields for next year's crop. The members of that firm say that if the Dickson award is to stand, the sugar industry is of no further use to them, and the sooner they utilize their land in some other way the better. We all know, too, that the possession of such an industry in the northern portion of Queensland has hitherto been regarded as a splendid thing from the stand-point of defence. In that portion of the Commonwealth we have tens of millions of acres of the best land in the world-lan d which will produce magnificent tropical products-and if this industry is to be closed down that area will become a menace instead of a benefit to Australia. If for no other reason, the sugar industry ought not to be permitted to crumble. I am sure that the Treasurer is sympathetically inclined towards those who are engaged in it .",53
327,Mr MASSYGREENE,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I am afraid that he does not care.,53
328,Mr CORSER,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I hope that that is not so. I trust that he will take immediate steps towards relieving the great disabilities under which they suffer. If nothing out of the way had happened to the industry this year, We Queensland would have produced from 170,000 to 180,000 tons of sugar. If that production is stopped, and the Treasurer has to find the balance of sugar for us, and has to pay £ 4 or £ 5 at least per ton beyond what would enable him to sell at 3^d., the problem will be a very serious one for him to solve. I do not blame the men for asking for an amended award. Far from it . But I am convinced that they never asked for or expected to get what they did get. The Judge gave them"" more than they asked for. As a result, he has driven out of the industry the men whom he sought to assist. „",53
329,Mr BRENNAN,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I always knew there was a lot of exaggeration about the extravagant claims of the workmen. I must tell them that they should be more just to themselves in future ,54
330,Mr CORSER,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"In every community there are men who are not as just as they ought to be. The honourable member's criticism is not fair, because there are many growers in Queensland who have paid good wages to their men from the first, and have never had an appeal against the wages they have paid. Before these awards came into existence many of them were paying higher wages than they are paying now. I personally know of in stances of the kind. I should like honourable members to bear in mind that when a man starts work in the morning at canecutting, should a heavy storm come on and prevent him from continuing his labour, he receives 15s. 6d. per day in the southern parts of Queensland, although he may have done nothing, and 17s. per day in the north. If he works overtime in order to keep the mill going, he must get time and a half,, and if it is necessary that he should work on a Sunday he must get double time. One would not object if our competitors in other parts of the world were producing sugar under similar conditions, but we are up against the use of black labour in every other part of the world in which cane sugar is produced. Honourable members must see how difficult it is for us to grow cane sugar under these conditions in .competition with those growing it with coloured labour. No one would object to the wages we are asked to pay if the in dustry could afford them, but as it cannot afford them, I say it is far better in the interests of every one concerned that fair wages should be paid than that men engaged in the industry should be thrown out of employment. There is now a sorry sight to be seen in Bundaberg in my electorate. Hundreds of men are out of employment, and are receiving assistance for themselves and their families from the Queensland Government. The same condition of affairs exists all the way up the coast. The men thrown out of employment in the sugar industry have appealed to the Minister for Railways in Queensland to start railway works; but he is unable to do so, for the simple reason that there is no money available for the purpose. The very people whom the Judge, in making the award, sought to assist, are being cruelled in the same way as are the growers of the cane. The Prime Minister, when in London, tried to do something for the sugar industry. He tried to induce the Imperial authorities to take supplies of sugar from portions of the Empire growing cane sugar, instead of importing, as has been done in the past, beet-sugar, on which very heavy bounties are paid, from Germany and other countries. Before the present trouble came upon them, the sugar-growers of Queensland took fresh heart, when they heard of the efforts made by the Prime Minister in the Old Country, and looked forward to an extension of the industry in Northern Queensland. It was felt that, by that extension, numbers of white people might be settled upon the large areas of rich soil which are now, because they are .unoccupied, a menace to the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, the award to which I have referred forbids the hope of any extension of the kind. It has been said that Unification would be of some assistance to us, but let me say that only a Victorian could argue in that way. In the young States of Queensland and Western Australia the people have done a great deal to forward their development and settlement. In Queensland, with its huge territory of 425,000,000 acres, the people have constructed 1,100 miles more of railways than have been constructed in , any other State of the Commonwealth.",54
331,Mr SHARPE,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"That is not correct. Mr - CORSER - If the honourable member looks up his ABC , I think he will find it is so.",54
332,Mr TUDOR,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,I think the honourable member will find that the ABC takes the year 1915 for Queensland and 1914 for the other States.,54
333,Mr CORSER,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"I point out that up to the time. I left the Queensland Parliament we were spending over £2,000,000 a year in railway construction, and had been doing that for years. It was intended to carry that work on, and a large number of lines of railway are only partially completed, so that in future the comparison, instead of being to our detriment, will b-> to our advantage. Now, if Unification were adopted, Queensland would be handing her railways and her land over to the f e d e r al authorities. Victoria, on the other hand, has had the benefit of the sale of her d o w n lands, and with the proceeds of such sales bas constructed railways and other public works. In Queensland wo have 400,000,000 acres of unalienated Crown lands. That is an asset, and we do not wish to share it with any other State; we want to be allowed to proceed with our development along the lines best suited to our own country. We in Queensland, know how to manage our own affairs, and we know, also, that very little sympathy is felt in many other parts of the Commonwealth towards Queensland and Western Australia. If the people of the other States were to travel more, and thus realise the difficulties under which people in the northern State are working, they would better appreciate the efforts that are being made there to settle large numbers of people on fertile land under conditions that will enable them to live happily and contentedly. Unification is a principle that we in Queensland will ' f i g h t to the bitter .end,- because when Federation was consummated there was a guarantee that Unification would not follow.",54
334,Mr TUDOR,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,Would you lead a revolution against it?,55
335,Mr CORSER,T HE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE STATEMENT SHOWS,"Some honourable members have been revolting so much against their leaders of late that apparently they think everybody else who expresses an opinion against any proposal must also be thinking of revolution. I will conclude by an earnest appeal to the Prime Minister to giveus an assurance that the crisis in Queensland will soon be over, and that men may go on trying to earn a .living for themselves during these war times. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.",55
