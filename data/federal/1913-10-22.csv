1,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In view of a statement made recently by the Prime Minister, to the effect that the Fisher Government failed in its duty in not introducing a sufficiently high T a r if f to protect Australia against the importations of foreign manufacturers, I ask the honourable gentleman if he is urging the Inter-State Commission to hurry up with its report?",12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not feel equal to that question just now. BUTTER INDUSTRY.,12
3,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I ask the Minister of External Affairs whether he has read the following statement in the report of the High CommissionerI strongly suggest that I be authorized 'topi ace,12
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in reading the report.,12
5,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Then let me say that the High Commissioner has practically requested the Government to allow him to appoint a Commissioner to inquire into the ramifications of the butter trade in England, so far as it affects Australian exportation, and also to inquireas to the substitutes for butter imported, into England which compete against Australian butter. Is the Minister prepared to allow the H i gh Commissioner to take such action in the interests of Australian producers?",12
6,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There are several matters that I shall have an opportunity to discuss with the H i gh Commissioner during his stay, and this will be one of them. Some of these matters' arise out of statements in his reports, others out of statements and communications that have passed between us. I am sure that Sir George Reid will afford every opportunity to the producers of Australia to put before him any matters to which they wish to direct his. attention. PERSONA LEXPLANATION .",12
7,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I desire to. make a personal explanation. During the discussion of the Estimates the other evening, when the issue of day labour against contract arose, I quoted from memory a paragraph from a judgment of Mr Justice Heydon; to the effect that in a case that he was determining, it had been demonstrated that the rate' at which men were working upon piecework was in some cases twelve times, and in other cases twenty times, as fast as the rate at which they worked under day-labour conditions. In order to j u s t if y ray statement, I have looked up the judgment. I find that the report of the case is headed, "" T w e n t y times as fast. The bonus-workers' speed. Justice Heydon surprised."" The Judge saidThis is one of the remarkable features of this case",12
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member claim to have been misreported ?,13
9,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Yes , because my statement was obviously disbelieved, being received with expressions of doubt. I wish now, if I am allowed, to justify it to honourable members by reading the judgment.",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I cannot allow the honourable member to do as he proposes ' on a personal explanation.,13
11,Mr BRUCESMITH,Unknown,I merely wished to justify . myself out .of the mouth of the Judge. ELECTORAL ADMINISTRATIO N.,13
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether a statement attributed to him in the public press today is correct. that the name of a certain lady-Mis s . Annie Irvine-wa s lef t off the roll because of an insufficient address. . the Minister whether he is aware that on the roll for the Balaclava Division there are the names of Annie Irvine, Hughenden-road, St. K i l d a , Christina Irvine, Hughenden-road, Elsie Isabel Irvine, Hughenden-road, St. K i l d a , and Margaret Irvine, Hughendenroad, St. K i l d a . Is the Minister further aware that there are only nine houses in Hughenden-road t These being the facts, is the statement which has been publicly made, that Miss Annie Irvine s address was insufficient, and that, therefore, her name was struck off the roll, correct ? Did the Minister, in making that statement, intend to mislead the public, or was it made negligently?",13
13,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have not made the statement that the name of this lady has been left off the roll. The only newspaper statement on the subject attributed to me that I have seen this morning is that appearing in the Age, and it is correct. An objection against the enrolment of Miss Annie Irvine was lodged because referenda papers addressed to her at the address given on her - claim card were returned through the Dead Letter Office undelivered, and in quiries subsequently instituted by the olice were to the effect that she was not Air. nown in the locality. As a matter of fact, at the time that the application was lodged the proper postal address of this lady was Oakleigh H all , Alma-road, St. Kilda ",13
14,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Nothing , of the kind.",13
15,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That is my information. I am informed that the address was subsequently altered to Hughendenroad, and that so soon as the postal address was altered, the notification of objection found Miss Irvine. If Miss' Irvine had answered that notification, there would have been no risk whatever of her name being removed from the roll.",13
16,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Is the Minister .aware that the objection lodged against the enrolment of Miss Annie Irvine was addressed to Miss' Annie Irvine, Hughenden-road, East St. K i l d a , the address on the roll, and the same address as that of other members of the family ! 1 , ",13
17,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Yes .,13
18,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I thought I had made. It is stated the facts perfectly clear. The objection was necessarily addressed with the address given on the claim card, and if an I ask answer had been sent in the normal way, there would have been no occasion for the right honourable gentleman to bring the matter before the Federal Parliament. St. Kilda, The other day, the honourable member for Kennedy asked a question with regard to the difficulty of replying to notices, of objection in sparsely-settled districts, where it might be impossible to answer the notice of objection within twenty days. The Chief Electoral Officer has supplied the following information: Section 72 of the Electoral Act provides that on the receipt of the answer of the person objected to, or after the espiration of twenty days from the fasting of the notice, the Divisional Returning Officer shall determine the obviction, and if it appears ihat ihe person objected to is not qualified or entitled to be enrolled on the roll, shall strike out his name. In practice, Returning Officers do not necessarily act immediately on the expiration of twenty days, and it may be taken that no Returning Officer would refuse to act on information which might reach him at. a later date indicating that an objection was . not well founded. Yesterday, the lionorable member for Gwydir asked whether the Electoral Department had received objections to names appearing on the rol l without the deposit of 5s. provided by law. The Chief Electoral Officer reportsWhere an objection is lodged by an Electoral Officer, the law does not require that he shall lodge a deposit of five shillings, but where objection is lodged by any person other than an Officer, the deposit must be lodged with the Divisional Returning Officer. I am not aware of any case in which the law has not been observed by the Officers concerned. NA AUGUSTA.  under the notice of the Assistant M in ister of Home Affairs a slight industrial trouble that may develop at Port Augusta. Can the Minister give me any further in formation as to the state of affairs at Port Augusta in this regard ?",13
19,Mr KELLY,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"The honourable member brought under my attention a telegram which he had received from Port Augusta to the effect that men employed wharf labouring there were being paid less than 12s. a day. I informed the honourable member that our schedule rate for such labour was 12s. a day, and that I would institute telegraphic inquiries to find out what base there was for the telegram which the honourable member had received. I hope that, some time during the course of this afternoon, I shall be in a position to further in f o rm the honourable member on the matter. PORT AUGUSTA - OODNADAT TA RAILWAY.",14
20,Mr THOMAS,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"In view of the statement made yesterday, and appearing in the papers, coming from the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs thab he had saved Â£126,000 in connection with the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, will the Minister of External Affairs tell me whether that railway is being controlled, and the policy concerning it dictated, by the Department of Home Affairs or the Department of External Affairs?",14
21,Mr GLYNN,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,The railway is under the jurisdiction of the Department of External Affairs. The contract in relation to the working of the railway was entered into with the Minister of External A f fairs. KALGOORLIE - PO RT AUGUSTA RAILWAY.,14

23,Mr KELLY,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"Application s have been received, but no decision has been arrived an at as to which applicant w i ll be successful. It is hoped that a decision' will be arrived at within a very few days.",14
24,Mr FRAZER,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"The other day, I mentioned the contract that was let to a Williamstown firm to' supply bogietrucks for the Western Australian end of the transcontinental railway. Is the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs now in a position to inform the House as to when the first trucks will be delivered at K a l goorlie, and as to the rate at which the trucks will be delivered u n t i l the contract is completed?",14
25,Mr KELLY,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"When the honourable member asked me the question without notice tlte other day, I asked him if he would be kind enough to place his question on the notice-paper. I am in a position to in for m the honourable member of the facts of this contract at any time, and can do so later this afternoon; but, not expecting that he was going to ask the question again without notice, I have not with me now the accurate information asked for. SUGAR EXCISE .",14
26,Mr BAMFORD,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"Will the Minister of Trade and Customs inform the House wliether auy of the Excise duty, which would have been payable on sugar had not the Excise Act been repealed, has been paid iuto the Treasury since the repeal of the Act?",14
27,Mr GROOM,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,No ; the necessary authority to collect the Excise awaits the passage of the Bill by another place.,14
28,Mr BAMFORD,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"Following up the question which I put to the Minister of Trade and Customs, I should like tomention that during a recent debate it was inferentially declared from the Government side of the House that the Excise which would have been payable if the Excise Tariif (Sugar) Act had not been repealed, would be paid on demand. I desire to ask the Minister whether a demand has been made on those who were liable to pay Excise; and, if so, what reply has been received ?",14
29,Mr GROOM,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,I am not aware that any honourable member stated that dutywould be payable u n t i l the Bill now before Parliament was passed. If such a statement was made it must have been due to a misapprehension. I certainly did not make it .,14
30,Mr WEBSTER,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"The other day, I asked the Assistant Minister of Home A f fairs if he would in for m me whether the Government - were going to enforce the rule of demanding from local rifle clubs a proportionate contribution towards the establishment of rifle butts. The Honorary Minister said he would reply if I gave him time to do so.",15
31,Mr KELLY,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"As this matter affects the Department of the Minister of Defence, I ask the honourable member to place his question on the notice-paper. An answer w i ll be forthcoming tomorrow. COTTON INDUSTRY .",15
32,Mr FINLAYSON,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"I ask the Minister yet. of External Affairs, Is care being taken t l i at the cotton-seed supplied for the development of the cotton industry in the Northern Territory is of good quality, because I have information that seed has been sent from a district where no cotton has been ginned during the last two years ?",15
33,Mr GLYNN,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"My attention has not been drawn to what the honourable member has just mentioned; but, if he gives * une particulars, I shall have inquiry made. CONTRACT WORK .",15
34,Mr ANSTEY,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"In connection with the contraot system, I ask the Assistant M in ister of Home Affairs whether he has caused inquiries to be made into the allegations of the honourable member for Parkes concerning contracts let by the honourable member for Wide Bay; and, - secondly, whether he will cause inquiry to be made into the robbery of the people of New South Walea under the contracts in which the honourable member for Parkes was engaged as counsel?",15

37,Mr WEBSTER,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"In view of the fact that the major portion of the alleged new cases of small-pox arise in distinct districts, where overcrowding is a RIFLE BUTTS. characteristic, will the Minister of Trade and Customs urge on the New South Wales Government the necessity for isolating not only the patients, but t'he contacts in these districts, so as to enable the Federal Government to lift the embargo that is now placed upon the city of Sydney and suburbs?",15
38,Mr GROOM,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,The honourable member will realise that we cannot compel the State Government to take any action of any kind.,15

42,Mr WEST,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"On Friday last I brought under notice the unfortunate death of a lady while in quarantine.

If the honourable gentleman has received the papers, will he lay them on the table of the House?",15
43,Mr GROOM,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"After the honourable member had - moved the adjournment of the House yesterday, in order to discuss this question, part of the papers reached me, and I read them, so that they are now in the records of the House. The report with regard to the removal of the patient to the Quarantine Station by State officers is not yet to hand. I have here the papers so fa r received, and shall be pleased to lay them upon the table of the Library.",15
44,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"I wish tc ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whetlier he thinks it fair to lay on the table of the Library only a part, and not the whole, of the papers relating to this matter ? The last Mr GROOM - Honourable members yesterday afternoon expressed a desire for information, and a charge of want of honesty on the part of a public official having been made, it was only fair that I should present immediately to the House the papers that had come to hand, - so that the official statement might go - out with the charge made. I agree with the honourable member that it is much better that the complete papers should be presented, but in the circumstances it was necessary fchafc I should lay before the House at once the information to hand.",15

52,Mr AGAR WYNNE,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"I have not the information at hand, and as there is a case now before the Court, I think it is just as well that we should wait until it has been disposed of before we look too carefully into the matter. AUTOMATIC EXCHANGES.",16
53,Mr FRAZER,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"Prior to leaving office, I called for tenders for, I think, fourteen automatic exchanges in the vicinity of Sydney. I should like the Postmaster-General to state whether any tender has been accepted.",16
54,Mr AGAR WYNNE,WHARF LABOURERS AT PORT,"I can only speak from memory, bufc I believe that the acceptance of tenders was delayed for two or three months, and that fresh tenders were invited, with the result that a tender for one automatic exchange has been accepted.

55,Mr GLYNN,OODNADATTA TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am sure that there must be some misapprehension. The technical fact is that the agreement was to made with the Department of External Affairs, and that the loss upon the workto ing of the railway has to be debited to The Department of Home Affairs, however, has a direct in terest in the matter, since the wharf, which is part of the railway property, will be used by it . Naturally, ""therefore, I the two Departments are looking at what I think a misunderstanding must have arisen as to something said by my honourable colleague. what is meant is that, assuming the agreement was entered into, the exnotice penditure of, I think, Â£125,000 on by rolling-stock to work the line would be in unnecessary.

When the ship does arrive,, will the same leave be allowed to Victorian men and lads as was granted to those of New South Wales during the flagship's stay in Port Jackson?",19
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The answers, to the honourable member's questions are1. The date is not yet fixed', but it will probably not be until after Christmas. 2. The usual facilities for leave will be given to all ratings as far as the Service permits. CASE OF VICTOR YEO.",19
83,Mr BURNS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence,. of the Public upo n notice I. Is it a fact that the Minister for Defencean order that Victor Yeo, who had been to one month's imprisonment at Broken HiU, in August last, for failing to render personal service, should be released after having* twenty days; if so, is it a fact that sucb. order has been ignored, and who was the officer or who were the officers responsible for not carrying out the order? 2. Is it a fact that durinp his incarceration his diet consisted of bread and water only? 3. Is it also a fact that as soon as he had served his term of one month another prosecution was entered upon? 4. Will the Minister cause a full inquiry be made into this case?",19
84,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The answers honourable member's questions are1. When it is desired to remit a penalty imposed on cadets for failing to attend for medical examination, the necessary procedure involves the obtaining of a warrant signed by the Governor General. On the 16th September the Minister approved of steps being taken to obtain Victor Yeo's release. The warrant, however, could not be completed until the 34th September, on which date Yeo's sentence had expired. 2. Yes, by order of the Medical Officer of Broken Hill Gaol for refusing to observe the rules laid down for prison discipline. 3. On Yeo's release he was served with a summons to appear for failing to attend a compulsory parade on gth August, 1913. Instructions were, however, issued that the summons was not to be proceeded with. 4. No further inquiry appears necessary. The papers show that Victor Yeo has openly defied the law. He was proceeded against at the Children's Court, Broken Hill , in November, 1912, for refusing to attend for medical examination, and fined Â£ 5 , in default two months' imprisonment. He was given two months to pay the fine, and on still refusing to do so was put in prison. He was released after serving ten days. At the commencement of the present financial year he was again requested to attend for medical examination, but on refusing to do so was, in August, fined Â£ 5 or one month's imprisonment. Having declined to pav the fine lie had served the month's imprisonment, with light labour, before the warrant for his release was executed. COLLECTION OE ROLLS: OBJECTIONS: DUA L ENROLMENT.",20
85,Mr FENTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"the Honorary Minister, upon notice Whether rolls for Victorian Divisions are being printed at the Government Printing Office; nnd, if so, have the names for such rolls been collected by the police. If not, on what basis were the rolls compiled?",20
86,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The answer to honourable member's question isThere has been no collection of names by the police. A reprint of the rolls, embodying all alterations in accordance with the Act since the latest print, is being made to meet public and official convenience.",20
87,Mr FENTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"the Honorary Minister, upon notice- 1. Whether he will read the proviso to subsection (1.) of section 32A of the Electoral Act. which runsas follows :,- "" Provided that where an elector has been enrolled in pursuance of uny claim signed by him as directed by a proclamation, and is correctly enrolled, he shall not [86] be required to sign and send in any further claim for enrolment in connection with the preparation of a new roll under any subsequent uroclamation, unless he has changed his place - of living so as to render a change in his enrolment necessary "" ? 2. Having read the paragraph referred to, does he not think that manv of the objections to now being made to electors, who have long resided at the same address, will lead to confusion, and to a duplication of cards and work to the at the central ofiice?",20
88,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. I am aware of the provision. 2. Any objections lodged in such cases could only be due to misunderstanding on the part of the officer concerned, and such objections, upon being answered, would lapse. The Electoral Administration is taking all possible steps to guard against objections being lodged by the officers on insufficient ground. It is not, however, always practicable to avoid error where very large bodies of electors-man y of whom bear identical n mes-ar e concerned, but if any person who may have been objected to by mistake will assist the officers by replying to the notice despatched to him, as desired, there is no ground i o r fearing improper disfranchisement. ' Mr GREGORY asked the Honorary Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Commonwealth Statistician has stated that there were at the time of the lategeneral election approximately 175,000 more names on the rolls of the Commonwealth than there were adults in Australia? 2. As no provision is made for plural voting under our Constitution, will the Minister instruct the Electoral Department to make every reasonable effort to insure that no adult may have the privilege of plural voting by reason of his name appearing more than once upon the Commonwealth rolls? 3. Does the present procedure tend to give dual enrolment to the voter with vital interests in Australia or to the voter who is practically unknown ?",20
89,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are- ; 1. The Commonwealth Statistician has stated that there were 175,000 more names on the rolls at the time of the last general elections than there were adults in' Australia qualified for enrolment at that time. 2. The Electoral Administration is taking all the practicable steps in this matter; but it should be understood that under the existing law there must always be an excess of names on the rolls at the date of an election. The Department will endeavour to minimize this excess as much as possible. 3. There is no differentiation of electors under the present procedure. PAPERS.

90,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Swan-Trea surer) [3.45] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I appeal to the House to pass the measure as soon as possible. - Mr FISHEK - Will the Treasurer tell us why the administrative staffs of Cockatoo Island and Garden Island have been increased so enormously ?,21
91,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Department of the Treasury does what it can to keep down expenditure, but it has not the framing of the Estimates. The right honourable member will obtain the information from, the Minister in whose Department these matters lie.",21
92,Mr WEBSTEK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Has not the Treasurer scrutinized the items?,21
93,Sir JOHNFORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I scrutinize totals more than details. The rule is-it may be useful to the honourable member some day-to scrutinize proposals, and compare them with past expenditure, and, in cases where the amounts are thought to be excessive, or if there is not sufficient revenue to provide for them, to refer the proposals back to the Departments concerned, and to ask them to cut down their Estimates.",21
94,Mr WEBSTER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That rule wants altering.,21
95,Sir JOHNFORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I do not see what other rule we could have. It would not be right for the Treasurer to unduly interfere .with the detailed administration of other Departments. This Bill is nearly Regulations always introduced somewhat late in the financial year, but on this occasion it is later than usual. Until we obtain parliamentary sanction for new appropriations, we cannot proceed with the works for which the money is needed.",21
96,Mr THOMAS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,We expected better things of this Administration .,21
97,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The change of Government is the principal reason for the delay that has occurred. Four months of the financial year have now passed. In the interests of the labour market alone, the works that are provided for in the Bill should be commenced as early as possible, and it will be of advantage to the whole community to have them commenced. They are. all necessary works for which the people are crying out, and the longer the passing of the Bill is delayed, the less time will remain for the expenditure - of the money within ' the financial year. The Senate is now sitting, and, I believe, is ready to deal with the , Bill promptly. I therefore ask honourable members to assist me in getting the Bill transmitted to the other Chamber as soon cis possibls",21
98,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Wide Bay) [3.50] - I agree with the Treasurer that it is important and desirable that the Bill sliould be passed as soon as possible, but I do not agree with him as to the reasons for the delay in its introduction. The preparation of the Estimates was well advanced before the righ t honourable gentleman took office, and he has always boasted nf his ability to facilitate the production of a Budget. On this occasion his promises have beeu better than his fulfil ment, which is not quite unusual with him. When he was in Opposition we heard a great deal about the delay of the last Administration in bringing forward the Budget, although no one knew better than he that it is almost impossible to get the accounts necessary to enable the Treasurer to present them as they should be presented, within a month or two after the end of the financial year.",21
99,Sir JOHN FOKREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,It was worse this year than ever before.,21
100,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Treasurer and every other member should know the reason. When he was last in office, the Departments had practically nothing to do. The development of Commonwealth enterprise has occurred within the last three years. It is assumed that the Commonwealth Government began its national career with the inauguration of Federation, but that is not so. For some it was merely an agency for the collection of revenue, and its distribution among the States. It was only after 1910 that the Commonwealth began to undertake national works, and to study national interests. Therefore, it was during the rigime of the late Government that the difficulty of organizing a Department for spending money to bring public works up to date, and to deal in a national way with national matters, arose. When accounts were not brought before Parliament'until a month or two of the financial year had elapsed, those who were then in Opposition were very pleased. They did not confine their criticism of us to speeches in Parliament, but went into the country, and in every way convenient to themselves misrepresented, for political purposes, the delay that had occurred, attributing it to negligence, saying that it was w i l f u l , and in some cases suggesting corruption.",21
101,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I do not that I ever did that.,22
102,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I do not know that the right honourable gentleman did, but some of his colleagues, who were not likely to r be challenged in the same way as he would have been challenged, were not .so scrupulous. I congratulate the Commonwealth on the manner in which public works have been carried out during the last two years The Prime Minister has suggested here and elsewhere that there has been an enormous waste of public money. Tliose who think that ought to put their views in concrete for m.",22
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,In what way?,22
104,Mr THOMAS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Appoin t a committee.,22
105,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Why appoint a committee? The Treasurer is in possession of all the information that any committee could get. He has command of all the permanent officials of the Commonwealth. There is no information that could be obtained by a committee that could not be got from the departmental heads. If the officers are iiot capable of giving information that is desired, they should not occupy their positions. If , as has been alleged by the Prime M in ister and his colleagues, they are in possession of certain facts, the time has arrived for making those facts public. I , for one, do not desire that anything should be screened. I hope that everything will be shown in the light of day. [ 8 6 ] - ,' It is the bounden duty of the. Governyears' ment, when bringing in Estimates, to prove the charges of incapacity made against the previous Administration. When the Treasurer was moving the second reading of the Bill , I asked him whether he had any information regarding the increase in the administrative staffs of Garden Island and Cockatoo Island.",22
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The whole question of Cockatoo Island will have to come up. AB ill will be needed to authorize the purchase when the terms are settled.,22
107,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Prime Minister has delegated his duties in the Home Affairs Department very largely to the Honorary Minister, but I think this is a proper occasion on which to draw attention to the serious fact that, although severe criticism was urged against the previous Administration for extravagance in regard to works on Cockatoo Island ancl Garden Island, started during their last year of office, the number of officers think and the administrative expenses on these islands have largely increased.",22
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,This matter should be dealt with on the general Estimates.,22
109,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I am dealing with the works provided for on page 7 of the Bill . I presume honourable members wil l agree with me when I say that we cannot carry out works without an administrative staff.,22
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Quite so, but the two have been severed by Parliament. Provision for the staff is on the general Estimates, and provisiou for the works is on the. Works Estimates.",22
111,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The works expenditure should be debited with the expense of administration pro ratd, and this is an occasion on which I can deal with the matter of administrative cost. In 1912-13, under the previous Government, the administrative staff on Cockatoo Island was 21, and the expenditure on this staff was Â£6,416, including Â£ 4 1 5 for 1 officerin-charge at Newcastle. Under the Cook Government Estimates for 1913-14, the establishment is raised from 21 to 45, and the expenditure on the staff from Â£6,41 6 to Â£14,006.",22
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Tell me what you are quoting from, so that I can follow you ?",22
113,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We have gathered from the Estimates, as best we could, the total administrative staffs on the two 2356 Appropriation (Works and [REPBESENTATIVES.] islands, and the expenditure on tliose staffs. When I have finished, I shall hand the honourable member the document from which I am quoting. It shows that, so far from there being an excessive expenditure by the previous Government, the present Government have doubled the staff, and doubled the administrative expenditure, since they have been in office.",22
114,Sir JOHN EOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,You had no ships here.,23
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The A d m i r a l staff have all gone, and we have had get one of our own..",23
116,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Minister s are not short of explanations, but it is well hear the facts. Sir JOH N FOBBEST - On what page of the Estimates will I find those figures ?",23
117,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The right honourable gentleman cannot find them on any page. It would be a simple matter to - with if all the information had been p .on a single page of the Estimates, as one would have expected.",23
118,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,How these Treasurers know each other!,23
119,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"No one can say that I ever gave information in an indirect way. I have never been charged with thing out of it that, whatever my faults may be.",23
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,No ; you gave information at all.,23
121,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Thos e who were in the the lftst Parliament can well remember when Prime Minister insinuates the then honourable member for Mernda and. other financial geniuses, like the honourable member for Richmond, disfigures covered in the Auditor-General's report what they considered was au error blunder on my part as Treasurer, though it was the Auditor-General who had the mistake; but, instead of showing ordinary courtesy, such as honourable memcosting bers show to each other, they were ing about for a week saying, with the greatest confidence and jubilation, "" will let you know what we have g o t Then when they ultimately came down and shot their bolt, without giving Treasury the slightest hint of what they had, and without my knowing anything about what it was, I said that the accounts were correct so far as the Australian notes reserve was concerned, makan ing the statement without seeing a public officer; and the Auditor-General afterexpenditure. wards had to admit that it was an error .of his. own. Buildings) Bill.",23
122,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I did not open my lips on the subject.,23
123,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I can well remember the honourable member saying, "" You wait-yo u wait to see what is coming;"" and when the statement came, and. was exploded, he lef t the chamber. I mention this for a reason. Many candidates standing for election, and many newspapers, instead of recognising that the Auditor-General had over and over again apologized for the error, presented the t y case to the public as it was given to the to House by the late honourable member for Mernda, and did not mention that it was a mistake on the part of the Auditorto General, and not on the part of the Treasurer.",23
124,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,They have never had the decency to acknowledge that.,23
125,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"They have not withdrawn their statement, nor acknowledged deal their mistake. I showed the greatest u t courtesy and consideration to the A u d itor-General ' at the time, and suffered a slight on the Government rather than discuss an officer of Parliament who should not be the b u tt of parties in the House.",23
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I would not discuss that if I were y o u ; you will get no. Mr FISHER - If there is anything in no it ' I hope the honourable member will raise the question. I challenge Government to do so. The that he knows something. I say, "" Let him come - com e early and come of t e n . "" The in regard to Garden Island are even more interesting than those relating: to or Cockatoo Island. TJnder the Imperial Government the staff in 1912-13 was made Victualling and clothing, 6, costing Â£ 2 , 4 1 8 ; shipbuilding, repairs, & c , 29, Â£ 8 , 9 2 5 ; naval armament, 5, costroving Â£1,568; total administrative staff, 40; total expenditure on administrative We staff, Â£12,911. The Estimates for 1913. "" 14 show that under the present Government the Garden Island staff for the the Naval Depot and dockyard, naval ordnance and victualling, totals 71, and that the expenditure on this administrative staff is Â£15,311. These figures show increase in the year nf from 40 to 71 in staff, and from Â£12,911 to Â£15,311 in I have good reason for holding the opinion that both these establishments, are overmanned in regard to the administrative staff.",23
127,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Then let us cut them down.,24
128,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I hesitate about cutting down a matter dealing with defence. No one knows better than the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that if there is an increase of highly-paid officers in the - administrative staff to that extent, the Treasurer would be the first to challenge it , and know the-reason of it , and that the Minister of Home Affairs, and the Minister of Defence particularly, should have the full details ready to give to Parliament. It is not the business of an Opposition to be constantly asking for - details of new expenditure. ister in charge, when introducing a new policy or proposing an increase of expen-diture on the .administrative staff, should make an explanation without being asked to do so. But when the Treasurer is interrogated regarding this matter, he says that he has no information to give. Sir JO HN FOEBEST - I Ministers in charge of the Estimates in - question would give the information.",24
129,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,And he said he knew nothing about the matter.,24
130,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I may reasonably ask the Treasurer to request his colleagues to - give us some information with regard to this matter.,24
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,If the r i g ht honourable member will tell us precisely what he wants we will give it to him .,24
132,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I wish to hear what the Government have to say in justification of the large increase in the staffs on these two islands, and the increase in the administrative expenditure. penditure, in ray opinion,, is excessive..",24
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,How and where is it excessive ?,24
134,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I shall tell the honourable gentleman as soon as the Government- ,24
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The right honourable member's statement is either founded on knowledge, or it is not. he has no right to make it . - should tell the Committee on what he bases his opinion.",24
136,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I find, through the Estimates, that the staff on Cockatoo Island has been increased in number from 21 to 45, and the expenditure from Â£6,416 to Â£14,006.",24
137,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Ove r 100 per cent, in each case. Mr FISHER . ^ I do not say that, The staff on Garden Island has been increased from 40 to 71, apd the expenditure from Â£12,911, to Â£15,311 , "" Why do not the Government make a statement in regard to this matter?",24
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Because the facts: are set out in the Estimates for the right honourable member to see.,24
139,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,But what did the Prime Minister and the Treasurer sjay a littl e while ago with regard to the excessive expenditure on administrative and other matters on these two islands?,24
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Nothin g whatever. The M in - Mr FISHER - I think not, but the country rang with their denunciations of extravagant expenditure on the part qf the late' Government. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-There was no expenditure on these islands last year, or practically none. How, then, could it be described as excessive? said that the Mr FISHER - The honourable gentleman said that the expenditure on the part of the Fisher Government was too high. Will he deny that he said the small man did not get enough, arid that the highlysalaried officers were receiving too much ? No previous Government has ever in creased the number of highly-paid officers on a staff as the present Government have done, having regard to the work to be carried out- - ",24
141,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,We are just beginning this expenditure. :,24
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Leader of the Opposition has either not read the Estimates, or is trying to bluff the Committee. Mr ' FISHER --The Prime Minister That ex- and the Treasurer say that they are only beginning this expenditure.",24
143,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,As regards Garden Island.,24
144,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"-That is not the point. Both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have interjected that they are inaugurating a new system. The late Government inaugurated twenty things.. If it is not, Mr. JOSEPH COOK.:-We are taking If it is, he over their liabilities and paying for them,, and the right honourable member does not like it . on going Mr FISHER - I hold that the late Government kept down the expenditure in a careful and business-like way, whereas, in these cases, as the honourable member for South Sydney interjected a few minutes a.go, the expenditure has been increased by our successors by 100. per oent. There is, probably, underlying these proposals by the Government a policy which, I think, is not an Australian one. There is in these Estimates evidence that would lead one reasonably to the conclusion that an attempt is being made by subterfuge to set aside the Henderson scheme of naval defence by concentrating the whole staff in and about Sydney.",24
145,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,And Melbourne.,25
146,Mr EISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"This is an Australian question, and the citizens of New South Wales are Australian people. Look for a moment at the magnitude of the expenditure on the higher-paid administrative officers. Expenditure has been lavished on one centre, while outposts, where works which are necessary to the defence of Australia should be carried out, are being absolutely neglected. I recognise that Sydney must be, for all time, the centre of naval defence *for Australia; but Admiral Henderson said that, in addition to the establishment of a Naval Base there, a first class Naval Base must be provided on the Western Australian coast for the protection of Australia. The policy of this Government is, apparently, to abandon everything in the West, and to go in for a ""policy of concentration in the East.",25
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Tha b is not true any particular. The right honourable member ought to be ashamed of himupon self.,25
148,Mr EISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The expenditure outinto side of Sydney, which is the best tected part of Australia, is being kept down. There is no suggestion by the vernment that the works on these islands should be held up pending an examinasurer tion by an expert to determine whether they should be carried out.",25
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"There cation for the right honourable gentleman's statement. This House has been told that aud untrue, too. an investigation is to be made at Sydney. The right honourable member does pear to know what is going on. ",25
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"If he does, he is a the remark. humbug.",25
151,Mr EISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The honourable gentlethe Treasurer's honour. man has evidently thought of stating that an investigation is to be made afc Sydney.,25
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The House has been told that there will be an investigacontrary tion.,25
153,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I shall accept the Prime Minister's statement.,25
154,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The r i g ht honourable member wil l lose his reputation if he goes on like fchis.,25
155,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"That would be an occasion for merriment on the part of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Perhaps the right honourable member wil l allow me, however, to finish one sentence without an interruption. If the Prime Minister were subjected to half the interruptions to which I have had to submit, he would say, "" A m I not to be heard?"" I would remind honourable members that in Sydney, although an investigation, we are told, is fco be made, fchis expenditure is being doubled, whereas other proposed works, in Western Australia more particularly, have been stopped pending in vestigation and report by an expert. The worksi n several other parts of Australia have been practically held up ; but, so far as Sydney is concerned, money is placed on the Estimates fco provide for them. Our ships will be concentrated there, and will be victualled and repaired-and effectively victualled and repaired-n o doubt, at Sydney. I am not complaining of this. Sydney, by reason of its geographical position and its waterways, should be given everything that it can legitimately claim, in but I object to parochial interests swaying the determination of the Government the national question of defence, more especially when such interests come conflict with the scheme adopted by proboth parties as a national one. Sir JOH N FORBEST - Where have we Goacted contrary to the Henderson scheme?",25
156,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I challenge the Treato justif y his action in stopping expenditure on certain works witlii n his own State which are essential to the prois no justifitection of Australia.,25
157,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"That is unfair,",25
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The Treasurer must not apwithdraw that statement.,25
159,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I thought t h Â« statement was untrue; but I withdraw,25
160,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I am not reflecting on I am dealing with what is a purely political matter.,25
161,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The r i g ht honor- ' .able member said that we were acting to Admiral Henderson's recommendations. I say that that is not so.,25
162,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Government, by stopping the works at Cockburn Sound pending investigation and report by an expert, are delaying a scheme which A d miral Henderson considered to be urgent.",26
163,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Did he commend expert inquiry ?,26
164,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"He recommended that expert information should be obtained, and that has been procured. Borings have been made",26
165,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Who was the pert appointed by the late Government? Mr FISHER,-There are expert reports available.",26
166,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Who was the man?,26
167,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I call upon the Treasurer to cease these constant interruptions.,26
168,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"E x p e r t members of the firm of Sir John Coode and Company have reported ou the very waterways which are now to be reported upon by a member of that firm at the instance of the present Government. Other experts have also dealt with the matter. The late Government appointed experts to take borings and soundings at the proposed subNaval Base in Western Australia, and the reports of those experts have been absolutely borne out. I am not in a position to give details to the Treasurer, and it is not necessary that I should do so at this stage. The Estimates indicate that there is only one place in Australia to which full consideration is given at the present time; aud, although that place is an important centre, it is not entitled to the concentration of the Fleet U n it .",26
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Where is that?,26
170,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I should like to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to a reported statement by the Minister of Defence, that he has l e ft the administration of the Australian U n it to RearAdmiral Patey.",26
171,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,What has do with the Estimates?,26
172,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The Estimates have to do with the construction and the administration of the Fleefc.,26
173,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Wit h struction, but not with the administration.",26
174,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"If the right honourable member wishes to raise a point of order, I shall take no exception.",26
175,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The r i g h t honourable member would not be able to speak if I did so.,26
176,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"In saying that, the right lionorable member is reflecting on the Chair.",26
177,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I cannot understand what these remarks have to do with' not refche Estimates, which deal merely with works.",26
178,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Estimates provide for wharfage, and the victualling and equipment of the vessels, and, what is equally essential, the means by which the ex- ships shall be enabled fco come into port to make them useful at all . According to the published statement of the Minister of Defence, it has been left to the Admiral of the Fleet to take the ships where he pleases, and do with them what he pleases. If that is the policy of the Government, it ought to have been sfcafced here by the Prime Minister. If the Naval Board or the Government have not the power to send the vessels where they please, and to send stores where they may be picked up, how will the Naval Board be able to know what the Admiral is going to do with the ships, or where he is going to satisfy his requirements ? Unless the power is in the hands of the Government, working through the Naval Board, there will be two authorities, and the authority that wil l have control of the Fleet, wil l be outside the ambit of the Government and Parliament. This is the Government who say they are the authors of au Australian owned, manned, and controlled Fleet.",26
179,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"They prate about "" responsible government "" !",26
180,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Responsibl e government ! Having had the pleasure of meeting the Admiral, and of speaking to other Admirals regarding his ability and capacity, my opinion is that the Admiral will not accept any such responsibility, and, if he declines, he wil l be a wise man. We have it announced as their policy fchafc this to the Government are going to shift the responsibility for the management of the Fleefc on to the shoulders of the A d m i r a l ; and, if anything should go wrong, I would say, from what I know of the Go the con- vernment, that they will not hesitate to shake themselves clear of that responsibility. Such an attitude is absolutely wrong, false in principle, and dangerous to the control of the U n it ; and I hope the Prime Minister wil l take the earliest opportunity to dissociate himself and his Government from this statement by the Minister of Defence.",26
181,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The Prime Minister endorses it .,27
182,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I did not see that he had done so.,27
183,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Hav e the Government the power to hand the responsibility over to the Admiral?,27
184,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We are working under a form of responsible government, and if Ministers give to His Majesty's representative advice which may betray the Commonwealth, they must take the responsibility. We have to attack the Government, because the Admiral is under their direct authority, and must take his orders from them.;, it is the Government who have to. make the explanation. The reported statement of the Minister of Defence is subversive of the principle of responsible government, and ought to be corrected by the head of the Government without delay, because, if that is the policy, we shall not have an Australian owned, manned, and controlled Fleet. We shall not know where the Fleet will be taken, or what will be done with it ; we shall only have the assurance that the distinguished sailor who has been sent out to command our Fleet will do his best in the interests of His Majesty and of the Commonwealth. That does not in any way, however, minimize the blundering stupidity of the statement made in regard to policy. The two matters to which I have referred are of the first order. The one is the handing over the control of theFleet to the Admiral without Governmental responsibility, and the other the excessive expenditure and concentration - of the Fleet in one portion of the Commonwealth, with tacit neglect and delay in carrying out the scheme of Admiral Henderson in other portions of the Commonwealth; and there should be an immediate explanation.",27
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs)' [4.32] - I have much pleasure, indeed, in responding to the appeal' of the Leader of the Opposition to make some reply to his statements, most of which are not founded on fact, but. are the result of some illusion or hallucination on his part. There is no basis of fact whatever for most of the. statements contained in the right honourable gentleman's' address. Just why he should select these matters on which to castigate the Government passes the comprehension of anybody but that of honourable membersopposite, who are bitter and recalcitrant.",27
186,Mr FBAZEB,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Oh , chuck it !",27

191,Mr FENTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Prime Minister used the word "" hog-wash "" the other day..",27
192,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I have several timescalled the House to order, and I hope I shall not have todoso again during the course of the Prime Minister's speech. I remind honourable members that, when the Speaker calls for order, it is highly disorderly to immediately interject, and toi converse, or pass remarks across the chamber. I hope this will not be continued.",27
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I will do my best to answer the Leader of the Opposition,, and to put my view of the case, if I am permitted to do so. I shall begia. where the right honourable gentleman began, namely, with the Auditor-General. I have made several statements on thii matter, and I desire to give my authority for making them. My first statement was that, during the three years of the right honourable gentleman's Administration, we never could get the Auditor-General's report on the table in time to be of the slightest use to Parliament. The dates are sufficient to establish the truth of ""that statement. ",27
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"^It is not; the House has not adjourned yet. In twoof those years the report was not presented to this House, but was published in- 'the Commonwealth Gazette, because the House had risen, and at a time when the House was almost ready to meet again. In one case the report was presented in March of the following year, and in the other case in April. In thethird year, we pressed the right honourable member for an earlier delivery of the statement; and I say that he tried to mislead the House concerning his attitude to the Auditor-General.",27
195,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The Prime Minister as not in order in saying that an honor-' - able member tried to mislead the House.,28
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Then I shall withdraw those words, and say that the - effect of what the right honourable member said was to mislead the House. In - this connection I am going to quotfe from Hansard, and honourable members can - draw their own inferences. The following is an extract from the Hansard report of the 18th December: ",28
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Can the Prime ister tell the House when the final statement of the public accounts was submitted to the General this year? We have just been that the Auditor-General's report will be laid on 'the table on Friday.,28
198,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That is what General tells me.,28
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That will be too late That disposes of the first point. to be of any use this year.,28
200,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I quite recognise that Friday will be too late to enable us to consider Auditor-General's report in conjunction with the .Estimates, but it is the earliest possible I can gel the Auditor-General to send it in. This would clearly lead the House to beofficial. lieve that the trouble was with the A u d i tor-General, and not with the then .surer. An y one reading or listening that answer would conclude that the Auditor-General had the Treasurer's counts, and that the Treasurer was deavouring to get the Auditor-General send in his statement. The report ceeds",28
201,Mr HARPER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Coul d arrangements not made for the report to be submitted earlier future ?,28
202,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Eve n if it meant a great more expense, it would be a good thing if the Auditor-General's report were in the hands of honourable members in mid-session, say, about September. That is what we ought to aim but no one knows better than the honourable tor-General. member for Parramatta that the adjustment of the postal accounts, owing to the transition, has tendered it difficult for the report to be submitted earlier during the past two . or three years.",28
203,Mr HARPER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I desire to ask the Treasurer when the Auditor-General's report will be submitted in Parliament.,28
204,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I asked the Auditor-General - some three months ago, when the question of the presentation of his report was raised, to furnish it as early as possible. He has informed me that he hopes to present it on Friday morning. Again, this would lead the House to believe that the Auditor-General had had what? the Treasurer's accounts three months beiore the close of the session. The Auditornot Â«General's .report - was furnished on the notes issued. Friday morning, and this is what the Auditor-General said in it The Right Honourable the Treasurer's statement of accounts for the year 1911-12 was received by me complete this day, the 20th of December, 1912. That amounts to a total misleading of this House. The Auditor-General tells the House that he only received the right honourable member's statement of accounts on the day on which they were presented to this Parliament duly audited. Therefore for the right honourable member to Minlead the House to believe that he was waiting for the Auditor-General, and Auditorpressing him three months before, was to told lead it in a wrong direction.",28
205,Mr FRAZER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,To what year does the the AuditorPrime Minister refer?,28
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"To last year. The facts support my statement. They amount to this, that, while the right honourable the member was leading the House to believe time that his accounts were in , and that he was waiting for and pressing the Auditor General, his accounts were not with that Mr FISHER , - E very account was in , Treaand handed to the Auditor-General imto mediately it was received.",28
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Who denies acthat ? It has nothing to do with the matenter. I did hot raise this subject today, to but I have given the facts. If the right prohonorable member will provoke statements of this kind concerning himself, be the responsibility is his, not mine. A m I into sit quiet under attacks like his, when the faul t is with him, not with me ? The deal facts show clearly that, when he was telling the House that he was pressing the Auditor-General to present these accounts, at; he had not given the accounts to the Audi",28
208,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The Auditor-General Was pressing him.,28
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Yes ; quite the contrary to what he represented to be the case. Now let us deal with his charges concerning the docks and the naval establishments.,28
210,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,What about the note reserve ? The Prime Minister wishes to shuffle out of that.,28
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Shuffl e out of,28
212,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The charge that WB did keep a sufficient reserve against the,28
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I have never made that charge, and have, therefore, nothing to answer in regard to it . Concerning the docks, what we have complained of is that, in taking over the Fitzroy Dock, the right honourable member was guilty of a breach of good f a it h towards the House. He told the honourable member for Dalley, and he also told me, that the matter would be submitted to the House before a decision was arrived at. He told us that within two or three days of the prorogation. Almost immediately afterwards he ignored his promise, and completed the arrangements for taking over the dock, thus incurring a liability of Â£850,000 without consulting Parliament.",29
214,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,A very good bargain.,29
215,Mr HOWE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Yes , but a breach of faith.",29
216,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Let the Prinie Minister quote the words that I used.,29
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,This is the Hansard report of what took place on the l l t h December last,29
218,Mr HOWE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Has - any arrangement been tered into between the Government and the vernment of New South Wales for the taking over of the Fitzroy Dock, and, vision been made for preserving the status of the superintendent of the dock and his ciated officers?",29
219,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"No arrangement has been made for the taking over of the dock. tain communications, verbal and other, have passed; that is the whole length matter has gone.",29
220,Mr HOWE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Inasmuc h as the session is coming to a close, will the Prime Minister see no steps are taken during the recess which will in any way tell against the interests of cers of the Fitzroy Dock?",29
221,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"If the Fitzroy Dock were sold, to the Commonwealth, I have nO doubt that the vendors would look after the interests who are their servants at present.",29
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Does the Government contemplate taking over the dock?,29
223,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I do not know. take over a State if it were desirous of taken over. A dock would te a useful for the Commonwealth, from a naval point view, and also from other points of view. is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Commonwealth may at some time take over this establishment",29
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"In view of the ment just made by the Prime Minister, I ask liim whether, before completing arrangements mittee. for the taking over of the Fitzroy or any other dock, he will allow the House to express an opinion on the project?",29
225,Mr FTSHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I have no doubt at all the Parliament of the Commonwealth to determine a matter of this importance. But the moment Parliament rose, the .negotiations for the taking over dock were completed, and an obligation amounting to Â£850,000 was. incurred without reference to Parliament. As to the dock, the complaint against this Government is now that it is overstaffed and overmanned. That is the charge which my right honourable friend makes today.",29
226,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That the administrative staff is in excess.,29
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The reply is very simple, and it is to this effect: that the taking over of the Fitzroy Dock in volved the taking over of the State officials who were employed tliere. It was about that matter that the honourable member for Dalley was most concerned. These officials have been taken into the employment of the Commonwealth. Is that an extravagance ? If so, it is an extravagance that was recommended and determined on by Senator Pearce.",29
228,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Not so.,29
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I say yes. Senator Pearce arranged the details for the transfer of the dock, and arranged enfor the transfer of the State officials conGonected with it . So much for t h at charge if so, has proof extravagance.",29
230,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,What about the difassoference between twenty-one officials employed at the time of the transfer and Cerforty-five now employed ?,29
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Who says that to which the there is that difference?,29

237,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Exceptio n having that been taken to the Prime Minister's words, will have I ask him to withdraw them.",29
238,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I have not taken exception to the Prime Minister's remarks, beof the cause they are so like him.",29
239,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Exceptio n has been taken to the in by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie.,30
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I withdraw the words objected to. The honourable member, who is so sensitive about my language, has three times this afternoon told me to "" chuck it "" ; I am sorry if I have invaded his domain. My information is that every one of these officers was recommended by Senator Pearce.",30
241,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,They were all there when this Government took office.,30
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Yes . If there is extravagance and overmanning, and if that fact supports the suspicion that an un-Australian policy is being pursued, it is the responsibility of my right honourable friend and his colleagues, not ours. W it h regard to Garden Island, the same explanation applies. We have not appointed the officials there on our own in itiative; we have merely honoured the obligations of our predecessors. seems to be our fault. In this case we have taken over Imperial officers. The staffing of Garden Island is exactly what was proposed by Senator Pearce. If charges of this kind are to continue to be made, wesliall have to repudiate everything done by our predecessors, and go on our own. Then, perhaps, we shall escape the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition. We took over the officers recommended by his Administration . So far as I know, we have appointed none on our own initiative.",30
243,Mr FENTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That is a qualification.,30
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"That is the in formation that I have obtained from the man in the best position to know, the Minister of Defence.",30
245,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,He could not be in any doubt.,30
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,My right honourable friend evidently knows nothing .about the matter. That is why he made so intelligent a 3peech.,30
247,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,We shall see later on.,30
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Tak e the captain in charge, whose salary is Â£1,000 a year. It was arranged by Senator Pearce that he should be taken over. The taking over of the manager of the Fitzroy Dock at Â£2,000 a year was also recommended by the Navy Board and Senator Pearce. They thought that they would like to have Mr Cutler away from the dock, and arranged to send him to .London on a salary of Â£1,000 a year. These are Dot the doings of the present Government. We have taken the arrangements over bodily from our predecessors. Now my right honourable friend is condemning everything, and trying to put the blame on to our shoulders.  Minister's authority for saying that they were sending this officer to London ?",30
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The honourable member need not try to cast doubt on my statement. It was arranged that this officer should go to London on a salary of Â£1,000 a year, to represent the Government there  tion of Senator Pearce?",30
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Yes , for the purchase of material, and such things.",30
251,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"A very good man, too.",30

In a few moments we shall have That him saying that everything that was done was the best that could be done in the circumstances, but we have just heard from him a wholesale condemnation of it.",30
253,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,You have a larger staff than perhaps any in the TJnited K in g dom.,30
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"What a reflection on the heaven-born administration of Senator Pearce, who arranged for the taking over of this staff.",30
255,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,This was not the arrangement of Senator Pearce.,30
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I say that it was. The responsibility lies with the right honourable member and his colleagues. The taking over of these officials was not done on our initiative. We have accepted the legacy of our predecessors, and it is the first time that I have known the members of an outgoing Government to condemn the members of an incoming Government for accepting and honoring their obligations, which seems to have been our crime in this case.",30
257,Mr SPENCE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,You are not spending any money on the Naval Bases.,30
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I venture to say there is no change of policy even there. We have never attempted to change the policy. All we have done,30
259,Mr SPENCE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Is to stop the works.,30
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"All we have done is, again, to take over the policy shaped by our predecessors in office in this particular. ' Mr SPENCE - And do nothing with",30

263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"There is no defence. doubt as to it . Is it not time for honourable - members to stop this sort of drivelhis ling? They are on the horns dilemma with the leader of the last Government denouncing his own administrasaid tion. They should take their gruelling, and make the best farce they can. It is not our trouble; it is theh-s; it is their so. policy,, and their determination, and their shaping - All we have done is to carry but what was left for us by .our predecessors in the spirit now gated from the house-tops, 'that in this matter - of defence there should be no party.",31
264,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"What about the A d miral ? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member has discovered another mare's nest. So far as I understand, Sena'tor Millen has said that he will consult A d - member. miral Patey in all matters relating to the efficiency of the Navy and its conmember trol in Australian waters-the disposition of the Fleet and its governance. What else cbuld he do? Is the Minister going to direct the Admiral what to do, and where to go to train his men, and as to what training 'the men shall get? That I have referred. is all fixed in the Naval Act ; it is the law of the land which Admiral Patey wil have to observe. Whatever policy has been laid down will be f a it h full y adresponsible hered to. Of course, the final responsibility Tests on the civil authorities.",31
265,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The statement in the press is very clear.,31

Of course, - the Navy and the A r m y must be under - the control of the Government of the day. That should go without saying it . in connection with a responsible Parliacanment. For what reason have we secured the services of Admiral Patey, if not to ' consult him and take advantage of hia of expert knowledge, which we, as laymen, do not possess?

The report says"" The Admiral,"" said Senator Millen, "" isfor the effective training of the fleet, and it is for him to say what the future disposition of the ships shall be, and how best he can carry out the task which has been entrusted to him.

279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The paragraphgoes on to saySenator Millen had an interview .with RearAdmiral Patey on Saturday, and it is understood that-this subject was discussed. The programme as drawn up by the Admiral provide* that the fleet should proceed to Fort ""Linc6lÂ» about the middle of November (when the leave of the men will have expired), and afterwards to Hobart. As, however, Melbourne will be passed on the way to Port Lincoln, it is believed that the Admiral has had under consideration an alteration of the programme so as to include a brief visit to Melbourne. I - wonder what is wrong with that?",31
280,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,It is not for the Admiral to decide where the Fleet is to go.,32
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I am afraid the honourable member has been misreading the whole thing. Admiral Patey has been brought out to train the Navy, and make the Fleet efficient, and, as a layman, I bow to his superior technical knowledge on such matters.",32

297,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Order ! The honourable member cannot discuss that. The Prime Minister is entitled to resume his seat when he chooses.,32
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I sat down because I had no more to say. . Mr HIGGS - I think we can discuss grievances on this Bill, and it is one of my grievances that the Prime Minister gets so angry when he is given a little dose of the medicine he used to administer from this side. The attitude I take up on the question of naval expenditure in the Bill before us is my personal attitude. I take the greatest possible exception to the policy adopted by the Treasurer. I look in vain in this Supply Bill for certain expenditure. The former Government laid down the policy of avoiding borrowing for the purpose of furnishing services, and I look in vain in this Supply Bill for items :such as .the purchase of land for defence purposes, the construction of conduits for laying ^wires underground.' the erection of London offices, and expenditure in connection with the Northern Territory on the construction of the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. In view of the fact that we took over the Northern Territory for deience purposes, I expected to find that the Â£400,000 for this railway would appear in the revenue Estimates, seeing that the money should be spent out of the revenue we shall receive. I think that the sum of Â£1,400,000 for the construction of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta should also find a place in the works to be paid for out of revenue.",32
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Thes e matters were matters of policy on your side as well.,32
300,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The former Government took up the position that we should pay for defence out of revenue, and I take up the attitude that a railway such as the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta line, which is to be built for defence purposes mainly, and which cannot pay for years, should be built out of revenue. The Treasurer has an ingenious system of finance, for which he should take out a patent. He proposes to spend money for defence out of revenue, but he will borrow for the items I have 'mentioned, for the construction .of works, to furnish the money to pay for them. I take strong exception to that method, and I take great exception to the money that he proposes to spend on .defence. There are vast increases on the amounts proposed by the former Government, and I ask what reply have honourable members on the Ministerial side to a leaflet circulated by the Queensland People's Progressive League, otherwise the Liberal * League ? This circular is. headed "" L a b o u r Socialistic Extravagance,"" "" The Fisher Government cannot pay its way,"" and it includesVote No on the Referenda proposals, nnd insure sober finance. The sober finance we are obtaining from honourable members opposite, whose organization, no doubt, paid for the printing of these leaflets, is a proposal to expend on defence, this year, Â£5,746,853, as compared with an expenditure of Â£4,079,590 in 1911-12, and Â£4,331,498 in 1912-13. In 1912-13, according to the Treasurer, Â£166,600 was expended in respect of the naval subsidy, and that item does not appear in the figures for this year. The increase in the estimated defence expenditure this year, as compared with that of last year, is Â£1,415,355 . I propose to prove that we are going too fast, particularly in the matter of naval expenditure. Certain people take the view that ' the awakening of China is fraught with danger to Australia, and that we are also in danger from Japan. I believe, however, that we have no reason to anticipate danger from Japan. In the first place that country, I read, is overburdened with debt. Authorities tell us that an attacking force must be five times as strong as a defending force. was about the position in the case of the South African War. The Boer forces consisted of about 50,000 soldiers, and Great Britain had to send out 250,000 to defeat them. That war cost the Old Country Â£211,000,000. Is Japan in a position to send an attacking force of 250,000 men to Australia, or to find Â£211,000,000 to provide for the cost of an Australian invasion ? Then, again, I would ask whether it is likely that the civilized races of the earth would allow Japan to take hold of Australia. Have not Germany, France, and the TJnited States of America, as well as Great Bri tain and other nations, interests in Australia which they would hasten to protect the moment they were threatened ? 1 propose to show why we have no right to incur this large expenditure in respect of naval defence. Capitalists-mos t of Mr Higgs. them in London-consistin g not only of Anglo-Saxons and Celts, but of people of all nationalities who have settled in England, have interests in Australia, as well as in other parts of the world, and they should be called upon to pay the money necessary to maintain the Navy if they want it . We have no right fo call upon the people of Australia to meet an annual defence expenditure amounting to 23s. 6d. per head of the population, or, estimating four persons to a family, Â£ 4 14s. per family per annum. In these days, when the cost of living is extremely high, is it right that we should impose such taxation ? I ask honourable members opposite to consider how their action in supporting this expenditure corresponds with their declaration during the election campaign that, if returned, they would reduce the cosfc of living. They certainly will not reduce it by imposing, in respect of defence, taxation amounting to Â£ 4 14s. per annum per family. The following table shows how defence expenditure has increased in Australia during the last twelve years:NAVAL AND MILITARY EXPENDITURE . Year. Amount. Per head of Population.

301,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Whaf c is the expenditure per capita this year and last year?,33
302,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"It is estimated at 23s. 6d. per head this year, and the expenditure was about the same per head of the population last year. The fact that the population of Australia has increased during the last twelve months will account for what would seem otherwise to be a discrepancy in the figures. Our defence expenditure per head of the population during the last twelve years has increased from 4s. 6d. to 23s. 6d. per annum. ment has a right to impose such a burden on a people so far removed as we are from the centres of militarism, and unlikely to come into conflict with any nation for many years. I have another table which shows that we are spending upon defence more per head of our population than are many European countries, which may reasonably expect attack at any moment.

308,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We know that Disraeli said of Gladstone that he had not a redeeming vice, but, perhaps, that would nob be true of the Treasurer. The right honourable member certainly has the vice of refusing to give information. He has been so long in politics, and has occupied high ofiice so often, that he absolutely objects to any interference. I b seems to me that when we approach the right honourable gentleman we should bow profoundly at every thir d step. I am sorry I have been diverted from what I regard as a very serious subject. The capibalists of London, and other great cities, have got the major portion of the world absolutely deluded. In their opinion it is necessary to have a huge Navy in order to protect their large in vestments of money abroad. We remember a few years ago, when Venezuela proposed to repudiate her public debt, Grea'b Britain and Germany combined to enforce payment; but I believe the United Government, under the Monroe doctrine, interfered, and Â£he matter waa settled without going to war. There is no doubt, however, thati And the huge Navy kept up by Great Britain is there in order to protect the interests of the capitalists. a What do the capitalists care for people, to whom they look to fight and their battles in time of war? What do they care for the 21,000 families at preon sent having but one room apiece in the of Dublin? What do they care for the 10,000,000 or .12,000,000 unfortunates in the Old Country who are on the verge I have figures which I propose t was to put into Hansard to show the amount of money that the British capitalists have invested abroad. Those figures were given in a very interesting paper read by Mr George Paish before the Royal Statistical Society, with Lord George Hamilton in the chair, on 20th December, 1910; and the sum is enormous, the grand total being no less than Â£3,191,000,000.

Capitalists talk about patriotism, but they expect it to be all on the one side. They have no patriotism whatever; they are internationalists, and invest their money where they can get the biggest rate of interest. They are gulling the people of the various nations into the belief that they ought to be patriotic, and the people are bled all the time. The figures continueU n it e d States . . Cuba ... ..

It is said that quite a number of important officers in the A r m y and Navy are interested in that concern; further, it is said that some of the rulers of England are interested in the various ammunition works and warship-building firms in the Old Country. It was mentioned the other day by the editor of the Economist that war scares are got up by army and navy contractors. It is declared, for instance, that Germany is building two ships, and that, therefore, Great Britain must build four ; and the two-keels-to-one policy was held until quite recently, when a ten to sixFOREIGN COUNTRIES. teen standard was agreed to.

I believe that some of the coronation medals which were worn in London were madt in Germany. ' All tliese facts show patriotism there is in the capitalist; and their attitude by the press. If , for a reporter were to report the Bpeech I am now making, it would be cut out by the editor; and I am sure that I shall not be given thirty lines tomorrow. ' Mr George Paish's paper, before referred to, shows that British capitalists are investing in countries outside the Empire almost pound for pound of their investments within the Empire. They know no country; - ought to be alive to their schemes. If the peopie in Great Britain had votes as we have, I do not believe that her rulers, prompted by the capitalists, would be permitted to continue their present ways. Is it right that we in this country, who are, generally speaking, a hard-working community, should pay 23s. -6d. per head, or five times as much as is paid in Japan, on defence? The Labour Government spent some Â£4,000,000 on - defence, bub I believe our would have altered the policy of spending money on warships, which will be obsolete in ten, or at the most twenty, years. Our policy, as outlined by the present Leader of the Opposition, provided for a line of Commonwealth steam-ships.",34
309,Mr FALKINER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Did not the honourable member agree to Admira l Henderson's scheme ?,36
310,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I did not. I was agreeable that there should be the nucleus of an Australian Navy,' because we need vessels to police our coasts. We decided that we should have a Commonwealth line of steam-ships, and were going to follow the example that the Admiralt y have set by arming merchantmen. Many merchant vessels have been equipped with a 4.7 gun, and we should have followed a similar policy. If we are going to spend a lot of money on naval defence, we should spend more on providing aerial ships of war. In regard to the establishment of a Commonwealth line of let me read the opinion of the Honourable George Graham, the Victorian Minister of Agriculture, who is on the other side in politics. When under examination by the F r u it Commission, he gave this evidenceMy reason for saying lhat the Commonwealth will never be able to do any. good until it eshow little tablishes a Commonwealth line of steamers is this: We bring all our produce down to the seaboard by train; it is dumped down at the seais supported board, and we are left entirely at the mercy instance, of the shipping ring afterwards, no mutter what it is we are sending away. I gave evidence before the Butter Commission and emphasized that point very strongly, and I have not changed my mind since. I feel certain that the only solution of the difficulty is a Commonwealth line of steamers, and I say if we can run our railways we ' can run a line of steamers. By that means we can carry our mails, our passengers, and our perishable products, and at the same time train young Australians in navigation and sea l if e. I do not care what Government is in power. In this regard we shall not and we do any good until the Commonwealth Government has the power to establish a line of steamers of its own. Had the Labour party remained in power, it would have tried to combine two objects-the benefiting of the trade and commerce of the country and the making of provision for defence. I have stated that British capitalists are willing to lend money to Japan-ou r possible enemyand also to build warships for that country. In support of that statement, let party me read the following cablegram, which, was published in the Melbourne Argus of 21st May, 1912Japan's new Dreadnought battle cruiser Kango has been launched at Barrow-in-Furness, from the yards of Messrs. Vickers, Son, and Maxim. She was laid down in January, 1911, and will be completed in 1913, at a total cost of Â£2,500,000. The Kango will displace 27,500 tons, and her engines will be of 70,000 horse-power. It is expected that she will attain a speed of 28 knots. She will be equipped with'14-in. guns. Then follows this foot-noteA special vote was passed by the Japanese Parliament to enable the Kango to be equipped with 14-in: guns, and in a similar manner provision was made for mounting the Kaso, another Dreadnought battle-cruiser row building with 15-in. guns. When completed the Kango will carry the largest guns of any warship in the world. Germany is building ships to carry weapons of equal size; the United States is constructing battleships capable of being mounted with 16-in. guns; and only a few days ago an 18-in. gun for the British Navy was hinted at. The record today is held by HMS. Orion, with her 13.5-in. guns. In Britains ship-building yards, British capitalists are building warships for our steamers, possible enemy-Japan-and we in this country, to provide for our defence, are going to spend, during the nnancial year 1913-14, what we spent last year, namely, 23s. 6d. per head of population, or more than five times as much as is spent by many countries in Europe. not ridiculous, I do not know what is. Where is the economy that the Government talk of? Where is the return to sober finance and responsible administration? I ask the honourable member for Gippsland what he thinks of this.",36
311,Mr BENNETT,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,It is the proper thing to do.,37
312,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Las t night, when I suggested the expenditure of money on airships, some honourable members laughed at the idea.",37
313,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We are aviation corps. ' Mr HIGGS - Yes ; but I ' d o not think that enough attention is being given to aerial preparations for defence. If honourable members will refer to the reviews, they will see what is being done elsewhere in this matter. I had the good fortune to witness, at Hendon, in the Old Country, a most remarkable performance by Mr Graham White, showing what could be done in the way of dropping bombs within a given space. the deck of a warship was marked on a lawn, and the aviator from his aeroplane dropped bags of sand on to this space, going very close to what was equivalent to a bull's eye. Of course, these bags were not dropped from a very great height, but, since then, in the war in Tripoli, and in the Balkans, aerial vessels have been successfully used for the dropping of bombs, and will play an important part in all future wars. I have here an article on the subject, written by two experts, which appeared in the Australian Beview of Reviews for A o r i l , 1913. It is headed-""The Next War in the A i r , "" the writers being T . R. Macmechen and Carl Dienstbach. They sayA l l European militarv experts know that the next great war-for which the grand amphitheatre is now being prepared-wil l be fought under new conditions, and that the nation which commands supremacy in the air will have an advantage that can hardly be overcome. The problems of the next war will be greatlv multiplied if the Powers engaging in it are fairly matched in the air. If they are not, the war will be over before it is well begun. No nation without an air navy can hope for success against an enemy with powerful fleets of dreadnought airships and of cruisers and torpedo craft in the form of aeroplanes, having a speed of So, 90, and even 100 miles an hour, because it will find it impossible to mobilize its army. It is too much to expect of men that they will stand helpless while death and destruction is rained down upon them' from an impregnable fortress floating in the air. Any sea navy which If that is the otherwise unprepared Power may have will be all but useless. Only a few hours will be required for airships to make a desperate attack upon any naval base. Weather, unless desperately bad, will not hinder the attack, for the reason that the modern airship is now sufficiently powerful to make detours and come with the wind to the point of naval mobilization. England has been quick to recognise the threatened danger. The new British cruisers are to be fitted with heavily-armoured and curved upper decks, and with steel .umbrella-like coverings for funnels. The cruisers will also carry guns that can be elevated to an angle of 80 degrees, and that will have an effective range of 9,000 yards. At a distance of 4^ miles one of these guns can send a 31-lb. shrapnel shell to a starting an height of 13,000 feet. Thus the men in the hostile airships and aeroplanes will find the air filled with danger to themselves. . . . While France long placed its main reliance in the aeroplane, it now realizes that the greatest danger will not come from that quarter. France has recognised that aerial war will be a naval war in the air, and is lending full encouragement to the airship. By the end of the year 1913 fourteen semi-rigid dirigibles, as large as the earlier Zeppelins, will be in the service in connection with the French army. There is now in construction in a factory near Paris, a war airship of the Zeppelin type. The French aerial war budget for r g n was Â£250,000; for 1912 it was The outline of Â£Soo,ooo; and for 1913 it is estimated at Â£ 1 , 7 0 0 , 0 0 0. Â« On the German side of the frontier' the work of preparing for the threatened conflict is even more ominous. Four Zeppelin-built giant air Dreadnoughts, armed and munitioned as if war were a thing of today, keep almost constantly in the air, training their crews in the science of navigation, and also in markmanship. The naval Z. is stationed at Wilhelmshaven, on the North Sea; the ZI . is at Koenigsberg, on the Russian frontier; the ZIII . is at Metz; and the ZII . is at Cologne-eac h ready to raid across the French border at a moment's notice. They go on to describe what is taking place at the present time, and a picture is given of the Franco-German frontier, to show how two rival nations are preparing for a future battle in the air. The French airship stations are shown,, and, on the other side of the frontier, the German Zeppelin aud aeroplane stations. I wish to emphasize the folly of this Government in proposing to spend so much more money on vessels, which, it is admitted 011 all hands, will be on the scrap heap witliin ten years. It would be better to spend some of the money on technical education, subsidizing the technical schools in the big cities, and establishing others in the country, for the training of our children. This would enable parents who now have to send tlieir children to work at an early age, to keep them at school a little longer. It is tMseatrava,gant and foolish expenditure that makes it necessary for working people to send, out their boys and girls at a tender age. when they should still be at school, being - educated to equip them for the battle of life. It makes one's heart bleed t.n see the little fellows that now have to go out to help to fill the family purse. This child labour is rendered necessary, because of the enormous expenditure on - defence. Every one will admit that Edison knows what he is talking about. His is mony we welcome, bub it is coming all too slow. Some years ago, Sir Hiram Maxim said that the end of war was not far off, because when the people living in palaces recognised that airships could drop bombs in palace courtyards, or on palace roofs, they would wish to stop war. Edison saysThere are too many newspapers and schools in present-day civilization to allow the anti-quated methods of over-ambitious men hiding their selfish aims behind a loud cry for of their country to force ruin on the people. Anyhow, the war game has been spoiled for good by the perfection of the aeroplane. I have been told that the fact that France was able to enrol 1,200 airmen in one day for the aeroplane branch of the army has tempered in no mean way the position taken by Emperor William in the Moroccan situation. Think of the effect of a fleet of a thousand aeroplanes! And they can get 5,000 of these aeroplanes for the cost of one Dreadnought. All the great destructive |iossibilities of the aeroplane are dsvarfed by the moral effect on the population, the fear of indiscriminate annihilation. Again he saysAerial navigation will end war. Universal peace will be assured as soon as it is realized that the airship which carries a man could carry 150 lbs. of nitro-glycerine just as well, and 20,000 airships thus equipped could annihilate the assembled navies of the world. No sharpshooting, however efficient, would be proof against such an attack. With the passing of poverty, disease, and war, the cause of intellectual advancement will receive an impetus which will carry everything before it. The man of the future will be an intellectual giant. Human passions and failings can hardly be eradicated entirely, but they will be better controlled. Physically and morally, science will make the world over. And the best part of this great triumph will be witnessed, I believe, witbin the next fifty years. But what are we doing towards it when we are spending these huge sums? are only encouraging people in the Old Country to go in for this enormous expenditure. I wish to state my position in regard to defence. I think we should train our boys, but I think we should have a conscience provision in the Act permitting people with conscientious objections to training their boys to shoot, to bave them exempted.",37
314,Colonel RYRIE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,They cannot have conscientious objections.,38
315,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I think so. There are many people who are glad that their sons are being trained. I think it is doing my boy good, and I am glad to see that he goes to his d r ill without complaining, but I agree with an article that appeared in the Age the other testi- morning, which says that there should be a great deal more tact used by the officers intrusted with the task of training the boys. Some of them' have no idea of what authority is, or of how it should be exercised. They treat the boys as so much dirt. Some of the notices sent out to the cadets are couched in language that sliould not be used. Where is the necessity to use language such . as this I saw in one circularTo Cadet G. C. Higgs,-You are warned to the glory attend at the Elsternwick Drill-room.",38
316,Colonel RYRIE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That is the usual form of those notices.,38

I hope the day will ' never come when the Australian citizen will have to bow his head before authority, as has to be done in some parts of the world under military systems. Why should not the boys be treated courteously and addressed in a proper manner ? If the officer commands respect from the boy, why should not the boy receive respect from the officer? The boy is compelled to salute the officer.  uniform.",38
318,Mr FINLAYSON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The boy salutes the uniform.,38
319,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"On e Saturday recently I heard of an officer addressing some boys about discipline. .He said, "" If I told you to rush and put your heads through that glass window, you have a right to do it . Of course, I am not going to order you to do such a silly thing, but that is discipline-if I order you to do it , you ought to do it . "" I consider that absoWe lute nonsense. I tliink the boys should gefc tlieir Saturday afternoons, and that the drill ing should be done on days other than Saturday and Sunday. I also think that the employers should pay the boys. There should be no deduction from the lads' pay for the time they spend in drill ing for the safety of the country. I shall vote against this increased expenditure on naval defence wherever I can. a risk in doing so. I am not saying that boastfully, but there is a certain risk. The powerful daily press in this country have worked up a feeling of so-called loyalty to the Empire. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And munition manufacturers have worked it up.",38
320,Mr HIGGS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"And it amounts fco this: Thafc we must go i u for a huge expenditure. As tliese papers go into a hundred thousand homes every morning there is an element of risk in taking up the attitude I do in regard to this naval expenditure. However, I am prepared fco take the risk. I think it is my duty to do so. I am prepared to fight the question in my constituency. If my electors say that I have no right to make a speecli such as I am making, they will , no doubt, put me oufc next time. I go before them, but I do not tliink they will do so. I believe that I can explain to them the position as I have explained it to the House, and that they will send me back again. The article in the Age dealing with compulsory service, to which I have already referred, saysAnother feature of compulsory service which causes a good deal of grumbling is the deficiency in tact shown by certain area officers in carrying out the duties of their commands. I mention this to show that in all probability there is a good deal in what I have said concerning the officers when journalists who move about among the men make these remarks. In conclusion, let me say that the expenditure in this Bill is a shameless abandonment of the public expressions of honourable members on the Ministerial side of the House. They are fools and blind, or they are ignoble knaves. They are miserable sycophants crawling to people in high places, or they are rogues and tricksters, who have got into office by false pretences.

374,Mr WEBSTER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I can only say that the action of the Government in regard to these Estimates, from beginning to end, is quite sufficient to excite any member in his desire to obtain that information which is necessary to guide him as to the vote he must give. This is the Government who professed to be a Government of economy, and who were going to introduce a new era of what fchey call true representative government. The Government and their supporters obtained their present position by telling the people they were going, not on the lines of the Labour party, but on lines which they have mapped out for themselves, and which would prove to the country that they were able to restore economical aiid representative government. How are they doing it? Look at the increase of expenditure now proposed. Well might the honourable member for Capricornia refer to them in the terms i u which he did-term s which, to my mind, were not too extravagant. The Government and their supporters raved about the reckless expenditure of the Labour party; and yet, in tlieir first year of ofiice, they increase the expenditure by an amount bordering on Â£5,000,000, and do things for which they would have denounced the Labour party from the .housetops. This afternoon the Prime Minister, I believe, alleged that the late Minister of Defence was responsible for the large number of additional appointments at Garden Island and Cockatoo Island. That statement is not in accordance with fact. The late Minister of Defence did not endorse the proposal to increase the staff from forty to seventy on Garden Island, nor did he endorse the increase of expenditure from nearly Â£5,000 to nearly Â£14,000, as in one year the present Government have done. The Naval Board submitted those names to the late M in ister of Defence, but, like a wise man, he refused to make the appointments, on the ground that it would be more advisable to wait the appointment of a general manager at Cock-xtoo Island before selecting the staff. No Government, who were careful of the interests of the people, prewould ever dream of adding to the list of employees in such a way wheu the appointment of a manager was in contemplation. Surely the first step is to appoint the manager, who is to be responsible for the work, and then allow him to select his own staff ? But the present Government have put the cart before the horse, and appointed a number of officers who may prove to be of the greatest trouble to whoever may become manager. W it h all deference to the rules of the House, the action of the Government is not contrary to the language in which the lionorable member for Capricornia stigmatized it before dinner. The Prime Minister stood on the floor of the House, and charged the late Minister of Defence with something that he never did, and which the Prinie Minister, and the present Minister of Defence, must know he never did.

406,Mr HOWE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Dalley) [8.3],- I hope that in what I am about to say, I shall not bring myself into conflict with the rules of the House, nor with you, Mr . Speaker. The honourable member for Capricornia was mosb profuse and mosb in beresbing in the mabber that he placed before the Chamber, bub I cannot follow the lines that he followed; and, while I claim that bhere is no bebber par by man in the House than myself, I am, in regard to the matter on which I wish to speak, somewhat at variance with my leader, the right honourable member for Wide Bay. It has been said that with me Cockatoo Island Dock is what K in g Charles' head was to Mr Dick; that I cannot keep it out of my speeches; but when expenditure involving large sums is concerned, those who know most about it should exGwydir press their views in such terms as they can, even though they may seem to gobeyond what some otlier honourable members may regard as reasonable limits. I say ab once thab I care not where the fault lies, whether with the last or with the present Administration, extravagance is, to my personal knowledge, occurring in connection with the administration of the Fitzroy Dock. The sum of Â£ 4 0 , 0 00 is provided for the administration of that establishment. Now, I visit the dock, often, and when I go bhere I see almost as many managers and foremen as workmen. This is a developmenb of the past bwo and a half years. Ib is astonishing to me to see how money is being spent in. paying men who seem to do little or nothing. The majority of these persons are nob bhose who have been associabed with* the establishment for years, but are newcomers. What their abilities and qualiThey fications are God only knows; I do not. T-hey are ""there, and the men who have been connected with the establishment for years are being slowly displaced. The general manager is, of course, necessary,, and if the Government can keep thegentleman who is there at the present time, it will be a good thing for the Commonwealth. I refer to Mr Cutler, who is now acting as manager. Evidently the Government have not yet been able to get a more able man for the position. Speaking fro m personal knowledge of, and association with, Mr Cutler, I say that no more energetic and capable engineer than he was ever on CockatooIsland. He made the place.",44
407,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Are not the Government going to send, bim to England?",44
408,Mr HOWE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"That is what I wish to know. For lack of a decision on the part of the last Administration , and of this, Mr Cutler, a man of unquestionable ability, has been kepb in suspense, not knowing what will happen to him. Theresult is that the development of bhis esbablishment, which is one of the principal, parbs of our defence scheme, is being kepb back, because no one knows whab is tohappen in connection with the administration of the place. Surely that shows, the existence of something rotten in the state of Denmark. It is about time some Minister applied himself in an effective way to making a statement in connection with this establishterests ment. You are crying out for defence, and right in the centre of the defence system here is this matter of maladministration, this failure to frame any definite scheme to deal with the subject. provision on the Estimates for a shipyard manager. That - may be necessary, but I question it very much. I do not know why a shipyard manager be there. I see a dockyard master provided for, and a constructor overseer. a matter of fact, the one mau who takes on the duty of constructor overseer should really be the shipyard manager, and thus we have nearly Â£1,500 spent annually to duplicate work which should be done by one man. This seems very wrong. say not one word against the gentlemen who are holding these positions, but I really cannot understand how the Administration can duplicate positions, and pay this enormous sum of money for work to be done by two persons that should be done by one. Provision is also made for an engineer overseer with two assistants, and their salaries total over Â£1,000 for work that has hitherto been done at a much less expenditure. that officers who have hitherto per formed all the duties that are now supposed to attach to these overseers are still retained, and yet these additional people are brought in. This seems to me gross extravagance. I think both the present and the last Administration are equally guilty in this regard, aud the sooner some reform is effected in thisÂ»matter the better it will be for our Defence Department. The expenditure is creeping up every day. The Government have already stated in their Budget that there must be an increasing expenditure this year, which is more than likely to continue for many years to come. We must be cautious, and safeguard in every possible way the expenditure on defence. I have been always bitterly opposed to the idea of building up a fleefc unit in fchis country, and it was only wlien I felt that the pressure of the times forced the necessity upon us that I gave my assent fco it, but in every possible way I shall raise my voice in this House against extravagant penditure. I believe that it is taking place in our midst today. I feel that fchere is growing up here fchafc despotism of navalism and militarism that always seems in every nation to get possession of Mr Howe. the people, and override the general in of the community i u the interests of its own personal desires ancl requirements, and, shall I say, that frenzy of warfarefchafcseems to come upon it. Today, when we are taking upon ourselves I find this burden, not only as a young, independent Australian people, but as a part of the Empire, comparatively small in numbers, but yet feeling ourselves to be should sharers in the great Imperial ideal, we must take the greatest care nofcfcoimpose As upon the backs of our working classes a burden too hard to bear. Through mistaken efforts on our part, we may make the burden so heavy fchafc the in evitable reaction will come. I desire, when we possibly can, to co-operate with I the people of the Old Country, and to see the stock from which we have sprung grow and develop and maintain the position they have gained today, b ut I see dangers ahead if burdens are heaped upon their backs by excessive taxation arising really out of extravagant expenditure. There is the greatest need for careful attention to these matters, and for reforms to be made where possible. A clay or two ago I asked that certain regulations in I find regard to military matters should be framed and embodied in book form, so that we, as members of the House. might know precisely where we stood in connection with our defence system. We do uot kuow this today. We have our Defence Acts embodied in such books as are issued to us, but there is not one man in this House who knows what the regulations are, and almost every day every member is challenged with questions by his constituents regarding the treatment of our youths. This is most objectionable. It seems to me that instead of the Minister of Defence controlling his Department, the Department is controlling him. It is issuing regulations without his knowledge, and enforcing upon this country many things that, if tested by the A.cfc itself, would, I believe, prove to be illegal. Nevertheless, fchey are there, and we cannot see them. We get them on little slips of paper; we know nothing at all about the regulations, and, while seeking to build ex- up an esprit de corps in our country in defence matters, wo have no means by which we can safeguard our youths, who are becoming the basis of that system, from any wrong-doing that may emanate from the brains of officers who really do not know themselves what the regulations are. Reforms are very essential direction. I p ut certain questions on the notice-paper quite recently. I will not say need to be. what they are, but I will say that there is room for an investigation into our naval service. We are building up our Navy, is bufc, from the information that has to me, I am very much afraid that at no a distant date we shall have to take into careful consideration the interests crews, and control the. officers who upon these vessels. I know that men are untrained in thought, and who speak, perhaps, with prejudice, feeling that in j u ry has been done to them which perhaps not been done, will sometimes come to a member of the House and put before him statements that may, on i vestigation, prove to be not as correct fchey afc first seem. I do not know how information belonging to the House gets sary expenditure. into the press before members themselves receive it , but this certainly happens. As late as Friday last I put certain quession tions on the notice-paper of the House, and by Saturday the matter was in the hands of the press before it was in the hands of members of the House.",44
409,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The reply?,46
410,Mr HOWE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The matter was not ister even before the House, but press knew all about ib. I fchink that is most undesirable. If matters come before the House, those who necessary should first know the particulars are members of the House, and no one else. If information is to be given from the Departments in this fashion, we do know where we shall end. I was very pleased that a particular letter which I have here emphasizes, from a Melbourne point of view,'the position that I put forward from Sydney. Wliether the statemenfcs are correct or not I cannot say. I shall wait for the Minister's answer in reply to the question which I have put. At all events, I am pleased that I have something from Melbourne in the nature of corroboration of the statements that reached me in Sydney.",46
411,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Hunter) [8.25] Last evening the Treasurer, and also the Prime Minister, stated that, on this Approin priation Bill there would be opportunity to deal with some of the questions on which we were endeavouring to elicit information. I am glad the opportunity has premany sented itself, because, since last evening, fchere has been more information availto able to honourable members in regard to in this the Defence Estimates.",46
412,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,There would,46
413,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I quite agree. Ifc to be regretted that Estimates come are often brought down in which large aggregate sum is voted without our knowing to what the money of the is to be devoted. Very often memare bers may vote money for one purpose, who only to discover afterwards that they were entirely opposed to the object of an fchafc expenditure. All honourable memhas, bers must realise that defence expenditure will go on increasing now that we have established compulsory military n - training, and a Navy of our own; but, as at the same time, it is absolutely necessary for us to see that there is no unnecesWhat is necessary should be undertaken, but beyond that no money should be spent. The discusto-day has disclosed that wasteful expenditure is going on. The Prime M in ister takes up the position that it is on account of commitments left to him by the previous Administration, but I say that, irrespective of whether that is so or not, it was the duty of the Prime M in to use the pruning knife if he found the any expenditure extravagant. The responsibility is on the Government who bring down Estimates to see that no unexpenditure takes place. I do the not claim that the late Minister of Defence was not responsible. Certainly he was not responsible for the additional exnot penditure provided on these Estimates for Cockatoo Island and Garden Island.",46
414,Sir JOHN EOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The late Government bought the island; we did not.,46
415,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"That is so. The late Minister of Defence will be able to make his own defence in anobher place. I am more concerned in the expenditure we are now asked bo vobe. I bhink ib will be admibted that the Commonweaibh secured a good bargain in baking over Cockatoo Island. No one appears to take up the position that ib is nob a good bargain. In facb, Admiral Henderson reporbed in favour of Cockatoo Island being our hands in order bo dock warships.",46
416,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,They are fine boilers that the labe Governmenb bought.,46
417,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Before we are months older I think we shall hear quite sufficient in regard to the boilers satisfy the public that the statements made recently in regard to these boilers were made for political purposes only, and that there was not a scintilla of truth in them. It will be shown clearly from the evidence taken before a tribunal, evidence that cannot be claimed to be partisan, evidence from experts, that these boilers were admirably suited for the purpose for whichfcheywere used, and that they had passed all tests. However, I do not wish to enter into that field. There is a Committee dealing with these boilers, and the whole matter is sub pudice. While Admiral Henderson approved of Cockatoo Island Dock being taken over by the Commonwealth, he also disapproved of the Commonwealth, when that time arrived, still continuing to spend large sums of money on Garden Island. Admiral Henderson has been the guide for both sides of the House in regard to the Navy, and that being so, surely there should be some explanation as fco why the expenditure in regard to Garden Island is being increased, notwithstanding the fact that we have acquired Cockatoo Island. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - Who is responsible ?",46
418,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Thos e administering the affairs of the country today fihould shoulder the responsibility. It is as well to quote Admiral Henderson's report, and have it on record, because, last evening,fchePrime Minister said that the report was not against additional expenditure on Garden Island. Admiral Henderson says, in paragraph 29 of his reportThe personnel (185 ranks and ratings) now .allowed and borne in the complement of HMS. Penguin for working the Dockyard Establishment at Garden Island are provided by the Mother Navy. It is considered that this number of ranks and ratings should be retained in their existing positions until such time as the Dockyard Establishment at Cockatoo Island is taken over by the Commonwealth as a naval dockyard, when a revision of the complement will be necessary. It is considered that it then be practicable to reduce the complement of - Garden island to a very small number. He points oufc clearly that Garden Island was being utilized by the Imperial Government for the purpose of making minor repairs to warships in these waters, and his recommendation that the Commonwealth should take over Cockatoo Island Dock was for the purpose of having - a more effective dock to deal with the big warships coming .here. He says that immediately the Commonwealth secured control of Cockatoo Island there should be a reduction offchestaff on Garden Tsland. Otherwise ib musb mean duplicating the work, having two docks fco do the same work. Though Cockatoo Island is quite sufficient for all requirements, we are apparently to continue expenditure on Garden Island. Last year we had forty salaried men on Garden Island, bufc the number has been increased this year to seventy-one, making an additional thirty-one salaried men to be paid out of this year's Estimates, notwithstanding that we also have Cockatoo Island Dock.",47
419,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,We have only taken over the dock this year.,47
420,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"In view of the statements made from time to time by honourable members on the Ministerial side, how do they reconcile this large increase of officers on Garden Island after we have taken over the Cockatoo Island Dock? Certain figures were given this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition. Lasb year - the expenditure on Garden Island was:-Victuallin g and clothing, Â£2,418; ship-building, repairs, &c, Â£8,925; and naval armaments, Â£1,568; making a total of Â£12,911, which was spent last year, when we did not have Cockatoo Island Dock.",47
421,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,For what period of the year was that?,47
422,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,For the whole of the year.,47
423,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,We did nob have Garden Island all the year.,47
424,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The Imperial Governmenb had ib. I am quoting their cosbs.,47
425,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Where did you geb bhem ?,47
426,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The right honourable gentleman will not take on himself the responsibiliby of denying the figures. The total expenditure last year on Garden Island was Â£12,911.",47
427,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Where did you should get those figures? It is very important.,47
428,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I endeavoured to get this information last evening on the Estimates, but I could not. I had to get the figures myself. This year we are to spend Â£15,311 on Garden Island, while we have increased the number of officers from forty, to seventy-one. If we take the cost for ship-building and repairs, which can now be performed at Cockatoo Island, we find there was Â£8,925 spent last year. Deductingthis from ithe total of Â£15,311, it leaves a balance of Â£6,386, ""Then take the naval armaments. We are tiiot going to make them at Garden Island. That work will be done at Cockatoo Island. If we further subtract Â£1,568, the amount spent in this direction last year, it leaves Â£4,818 for victualling and clothing to correspond with last year's expenditure in this direction; yet we are going to spend Â£15,311. This is the economy honourable members prate - about so much in the country. They are - actually duplicating work. The Prime .Minister last evening, after a lengthy debate, seeing the absurdity of building a home for a manger on Garden Island, re-duced the item by Â£2,000, and promised not to build the house this year, but, notwithstanding that reduction, there is 'this heavy expenditure to be incurred on administration. Are we justified in in - creasing the expenditure on the Navy unnecessarily? Can any one claim this is necessary expenditure, seeing that we are now going to carry on work at Cockatoo Island Dock ? I have heard that it is rthe intention of the Government to keep 100 members of the Navy permanently on Garden Island. I leave it to rthe Treasurer to deny that. I would like .some information from him on the point. Why are these men to be put there ? The Government are not justified in increasing the expenditure on Garden - Island after taking over Cockatoo Island. While we are increasing - expenditure on Garden Island we are also increasing the cost so far as - Cockatoo Island is concerned. The number of officials there has been increased from twenty-one to forty-five, whilst the cost has increased from Â£6,416 to Â£14,006. In other - words, twenty-four additional officers have been appointed this year to - Cockatoo Island. I do not say that there may not be necessity for an increased staff at Cockatoo Island, but I do contend that if an increase is necessary in that - case, it cannot be necessary to have additional men on Garden Island. Admira l Henderson distinctly pointed out that the Imperial authorities were compelled to hold Garden Island only because they had no other place at which to dock their vessels. But although we have expended a large sum in acquiring Cockatoo Island, and are asked to vote a large sum to place machinery in position there, the Government are continuing the other establishment. We oughfc to have some informat i o n regarding this matter. If it is solutely necessary to do what the Government propose, then I shall willingly vote for it , but if it is not necessary, then a wasteful expenditure is proposed, and it is my duty, and that of every honourable member, to vote against it . The Treasurer does not appear to know much about the matter. If he could make oufc a good case for the maintenance of Garden* Island, and for an increased expenditure upon it , we should be justified in supporting him, but u n t i l we know what justification there is for the proposed increase of expenditure there, we cannot be expected fco allow these matters to go without challenge. I desire now to refer to another matter which was brought up this evening. I refer to the statement that the Admiral was to have full control of the disposition of the Fleet. The Prime Minister, in the first place, stated that "" as far as he knew "" it was not correct, bufc subsequently gave his word that it was incorrect. It was claimed here this afternoon that the Admiral was to have full control of the disposition of the warships. If that be so, a great mistake is being made': I know that the Prime Minister himself ultimately said that it would not be so, and I hope that it will not, because once we permit the Admiral to determine what shall be the disposition of our vessels, the power of this Parliament in the matter will have disappeared. The Prime Minister said, with a laugh, this afternoon, ' ' The idea of talking about Parliament directing the movements of the Fleet! Does the British Government do anything of the kind with the British Navy ? Does not every British admiral decide where the vessels of his fleefc shall manoeuvre?"" As a matter of fact, no British admiral does anything of the kind. The Admiralt y gives orders as to the movements of the vessels of the British Navy. It directs an admiral to proceed with his fleet fco a certain point, and he has to do so. When he reaches there he may do as he pleases, but he cannot decide for himself whether or not his vessels shall go there. What would be the position of our finances if we permitted this sort of thing in connection with our Navy? We should soon be asked fco vote huge sums for stores and fuel. We shall have coaling stations at different points along the coast. But. the Admiral, if he had the power to decide without question where a vessel of the abFleet should go, might make it necessary for us to charter steamers to carry coal for its use, and so pile up our naval expenditure. On the other hand, if the Government have the right to direct where a ship shall go, then the Admiral will be able to pick up coal at the depot, and so save money. This is an important question. If , at the initiation of the Australian Navy, we permit the power to control it to pass out of the hands of the Parliament or the Government of the day, we shall never recover our position. The Army and Navy will run the show, and we shall simply have to pay. As representatives of the people we ought to have something to say in regard to the management of our Navy. I do not wish to interfere with the Admiral, but the Government of the day sliould always have vested in it the power to control the movements of the vessels of the Fleet.",47
429,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,So it has.,49
430,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,There is a doubt about the matter.,49
431,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Not at all. I the ABC of responsible government that Ministers shall have control.,49
432,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Prime Minister said so this afternoon. - Mr Charlton - The Prinie Minought ister said, in the first place, that, so as he knew, the Government would have control, and later he said he would give take action. his word that it would be so; but we have the statement made by the Minister of danger. Defence, and quoted this afternoon, that the Admira l of the Fleet would have the right to determine the disposition of the warships.",49
433,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The very same report showed that the Minister of Defence was in consultation with the Admira l as to the next movement of the vessels of the Fleet.,49
434,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,And the final sentence in the report was to the effect that the disposition of the vessels of the Fleet should be left with the Admiral. I am informed that the Minister of Defence repeated that statement in the Senate this afternoon. This question is above all party considerations.,49
435,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,What is the point the honourable member is trying to drive at? 5,49
436,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We ought to know whether the Government of the day are obtain the information we desire. fco have control of our Navy, or whether are that control is to be handed over to the Admiral. Sir JO HN FOBBEST - This is toopuerile. The Government are supreme. All property owned by the Government isunder their control.",49
437,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I am surprised at fchafc interjection in view of the statement in print by the Minister of Defence, and the reiteration of that statement in the Senate this afternoon. The right honourable gentleman, who admits that he knowsnothing about these Estimates, now says that my statement is puerile.",49
438,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I would remind the . honourable member that it is not customary to refer to what is occurring. in another place.,49
439,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I admit that, sir, but I was pleased to learn that the M in ister of Defence had really endorsed the statement made this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition. I appeal to honourable members to allow party feeling to remain in abeyance for the moment, and to say whether it is not right that t is we should have our position clearly defined in the initia l stages of our naval policy. As the Treasurer says, Parliament should be supreme, but it is quite possible for a mistake to be made. We not to wait until a mistake has far been made, and then find faul t with those responsible for it. Now is the time to",49
440,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,There is no,49
441,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I am pleased to hear it . We often hear it said that there is no danger of this or that happening; yet it does happen.,49
442,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The honourable member might just as well say that we have no control over the Military .,49
443,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I make no such assertion. I should not have referred to this matter but for the statement made by the Minister of Defence.,49
444,Sir JOHNFOEREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I have no doubt about the position myself.,49
445,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The right honourable member holds a view different from fchafc taken by the Minister of Defence.,49
446,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I do not know what the Minister of Defence has said.,49
447,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Treasurer evidently does not know whafc his colleagues have said. Our trouble isfchafcwe cannot We urged fco pass bhis Bill , and so fco add to our expenditure, with the result that we may discover, about twelve months hence, that we have voted money for something of which we do not approve.",49
448,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That we have taken a plunge in the dark.,50
449,Mr CHAELTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Quite so. We need more light on this subject. We want to know what is going to be done.,50
450,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Where ?,50
451,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Why should the expenditure on Garden Island be greater than it was last year, in view of Admiral Henderson's report that it should be reduced as soon as we took over Cockatoo Island? He pointed out that the I m perial Government used Garden Island only to effect minor repairs to warships while in these waters, and that, if we obtained control of Cockatoo Island, all repairs could be done there, so that the cost of Garden Island would be considerably reduced. We find, however, that it is fco be increased.",50
452,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Does the honourable member fchink that some of the men there ought to be discharged ?,50
453,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I think fchafc all necessary officers should be appointed. We should have an efficient service, but should not vote for unnecessary expenditure or the duplication of work. are to have these two establishments maintained, will tliere not be a duplication of work?",50
454,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,We are only starting.,50
455,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Government are starting by increasing the expenditure on Garden Island, after taking over a dock which is'suitable for all our requirements. Where shall we land ourselves? Is this the boasted economy about which we have heard so much during the last six months?",50
456,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"This is your staff, not ours.",50
457,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"That is not so. I have never known a Government, on taking ofiice, try to shield itself as this vernment has done, by saying, when attacked by the Opposition, "" This is your commitment,"" or "" This was done by the Opposition when in ofiice."" Does the righ t honourable member forget that he and his party told the - electors that had been guilty of extravagance, and that, if they were placed in office, would introduce the pruning knife ?",50
458,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The late GovernTreasurer ment had a good "" g o in . """,50
459,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We are considering just now the "" go in "" of the present Treasurer. He has been in office only four months, and yet he has increased expenditure all round. He admits that he knows nothing about these Estimates, but when he was before the people he said that if returned to power he would reduce the expenditure.",50
460,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Wli o was it said that ?,50
461,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The right honourable gentleman knows a good deal more than I do aboufc what he has said. We are not concerned with what the expenditure has been, .because that inoney has gone: we are concerned with the votes we are now asked to pass. Suppose we admit:-thoug h I do not admit it-fchaf c the inoney in the past was not wisely expended, surely the present Government are not justified in increasing the waste. I find that the total defence expenditure last year was Â£4,381,000, whereas the proposed expenditure fchis year is Â£5,746,000, or an - increase, taking the odd figures into account, of, approximately, Â£1,500,000. There is no reason why we sliould vote all this additional expenditure wifchoufc explanation. My If we mission is not to find faul t with legitimate expenditure, and if the Government can show any justification for any part of it , I am prepared to support them; but it appears fco me that, in place of making out a case, they take up the position that this expenditure consists of commitments that were left by the previous Governmeut. That is a very unfairpositionto - take up, because those who complain of expenditure should, if placed in power, endeavour to cut it down, or show that such a step is impossible.",50
462,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The honourable member is very active this year compared with last year!,50
463,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"=Eve n since I have been a representative I have taken up Go- the position of asking for the fullest in formation in regard to expenditure, and if I found any waste I should vote against it, irrespective of whether I safc behind the Government or not.",50
464,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Does the honorwe able member not fchink that we had better get along? It cannot take so long for they him to explain his position.,50
465,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I must ask the not to continue his interjections.,50
466,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I believe I should over have finished long ago but for the interjections of the right honourable gentleman, and every time he interjects he shows his want of knowledge of his own Estimates. It seems strange that a private member should have to delve for information that ought to be given by the Government, aud if the right honourable gentleman had been prepared to state full y the intentions of the Government, and to justify the additional expenditure, there would have been very little debate, and the !bill would have been passed.",51
467,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Oh , no.",51
468,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Treasurer cangrow. not accuse me of blocking business in way. I only rise on such occasions as this when I feel I am justified in asking for information, and my trouble is I cantion not get it . . Mr RILEV - Giv e notice!. Mr Charlton.""-Eve n when I do give notice I cannot get information. Last Thursday I asked for some information in regard to the amount of money to be expended on the submarine base at Port Stephens, and the Treasurer told me he would' endeavour to answer my question by the following Tuesday when he had consulted the Minister of Defence. Yet, at the same time, his Estimates were the table, and the probability is that he anticipated that by the Tuesday they would have been disposed of. Even on the Tuesday the information was not forthcoming, though I did get it today. Strange to say, I was informed by the Prime Minister that the expenditure would probably be Â£2,000, whereas the Honorary Minister, who represents the Minister of Defence, said it would Â£3,000 or Â£4:000. I suppose that if we keep on for another day or two we shall find the expenditure at Â£6,000. It is the lack of information that causes honourable members to take up time. Henderson stated in liis report that th>> first submarine base should be established at Port Stephens prior to the arrival of country. the submarines. Are the Government going to give effect to that recommendato explain. tion ? Does the honourable member think that Â£3,000 or Â£4,000 will be sufficient to construct this base? We know that the submarines are expected by the end ing the debate. of another year; and if something is not done, we shall have no place to berth them. At the same time, we are increasing the expenditure at Garden Island by half of what it was last year, and thisquite unnecessarily. As a representative, I cannot permit this money to be voted in the absence of fuller information without raising my protest; and the r i g h t honourable gentleman would be doing a service to honourable members if he would rise and explain. However, perhaps it would be hardly fair to ask him to do so considering that he knows nothing about the matter. The question of defence isall important, and one in regard to which party feeling should be sunk. I u Australia today, there are only a little over 4,500,000 people, and yet our Defence expenditure is over Â£6,000,000, and must How the people are going to bear any this burden, is a question that presents itself to us. If , from the inception, it keeps on - increasing unnecessarily, taxamust increase, and possibly give rise to a strong feeling of opposition to the whole defence system. Every one isprepared to pay what is just and fair, because we realise it is necessary that we should be in a position to defend ourselves, and, if necessary, help the Mother Country. We have, however, to be caref u l , and we are not justified in voting inoney without knowing whether it is justifiable to do so. I would not be doing my duty to my constituents if I on did not raise my voice in protest.",51
469,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,How many of your constituents live at Port Stephens ?,51
470,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"There must be very, few, but the question is not the number of constituents who live there, but the number of people who reside in Australia, and have to find the money. This is no parochial matter, but a big be national problem, which should be considered on its merits. I do not wish, in twelve months' time, to find myself in the position that I have voted thousands'of pounds for some purpose that mayAdmiral prove useless, because I should not dare to attempt to justify myself in the eyes of my constituents, or the people of the",51
471,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Giv e us a chance,51
472,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I am prepared to give the right honourable gentleman every chance if that can be done without clos,51
473,Mr KELLV,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I can give the information without closing the debate.,51
474,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Then I am prepared to give the Honorary Minister the opportunity. This matter is of more importance to me than any other that could be discussed; and it is only because of the paucity of information that I have risen. Admira l Henderson's report has been repeatedly quoted by honourable members on botli sides, and is regarded as .a guide for all of us; and we should have some information as to where that gentleman has been wrong in his estimate. If Admiral Henderson said we should not expend much money on Garden Island, why is the Government increasing the expenditure there, especially when the greater part of the money last year was used in making the necessary repairs to the warboats, and the Government say they are going to do this work at Cockatoo Island. I cannot see, for the life of me, why they should in crease the expenditure at Garden Island. Is it correct that the Government intend to keep 100 privates on this particular island ?",51
475,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,They are for purpose of social functions.,52
476,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I do' not know whether that is so or not, but I do not believe in the people of the country paying for those social functions. My opinion is that the men in the Navy ought to be engaged .on the boats, because they are r paid for that purpose. If those 100 men are to be retained on the island simply to look after the officers ..who are there, it is an arrangement that the Government are not justified in making. W it h regard to the expenditure to be in curred on Garden Island, I wish to know why there has been jan increase in the number of officers, and whether the work that was formerly done there in the way of repairing vessels is to be continued. If it is not, will the Â£8,000 spent last year be needed? I should like the M in ister to give the fullest information as to the intentions of the Government in regard to both Cockatoo and Garden Islands.",52
477,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [9.11] - The first point dealt with by the honourable member for H u n ter is the alleged increase of staff at the Garden Island establishment. Let me say, at the outset, that there has been no such increase as he seems to .have been led to believe. If he w i ll take the Estimates-in-chief, he will see, on page 99, the officers who belong to that establishment. The transfer to the .Commonwealth of all the officers there provided for, with the exception of the Assistant Victualling Store officer, who was in service there, and had to be taken over, was approved by Senator Pearce, and all of them are being paid according to a scale of which he approved-. The proof, of my statement is in the departmental papers, which are available for the in spection of those honourable members who care to look through them. Mr .SEENCE - Are the papers endorsed by Senator Pearce?",52
478,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Yes ; to all .the recommendations are attached his initials, "" G. P. P . "" ",52
479,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,What are the contents of the papers ?,52
480,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The honourable member may peruse them for .himself, and if the statement that I am now 'making is not correct, he will then be in a position to demonstrate that I have not .been f r a n k the and candid with the House. The: honourable member for Hunter may have been led into 'error iby the statement in the Estimates .regarding certain police officers who were not employed, at Garden Island while .the ^establishmentwas under thei jurisdiction of the Admiralty, for the simp'le reason that the Admiralt y usedmarines to perform the duties for whichi the police have now been appointed. We have no marines :in the Australian Navy;. although they are an integral part - of ithe British Navy the Royal Australian-iNa-vy does not consider them necessary - Senator Pearce authorized the appointment of these police officers, and we have appointed them to take the place of marines. That', is the beginning and the end of the in crease of staff. There have been certain increases df> pay to various men on Garden Island, but they were all authorized by Senator Pearce, and were made to bring the pay of the men there up to the Australian minimum rates. If the honourable member for Hunter objects to that, we cannot help it ; but I do hot think that"" he does object to it . I invite him to'' peruse these papers when I resume my seat. If he does so, he will.see that every word that I :am uttering is borne out. by the facts. W it h regard to the Cockatoo Island, establishment, we have taken over the State staff. The provision made for the officers at Cockatoo Island isdetailed on page 104 of the general Estimates. W it h the exception of the general manager, all these officers have been worki n g at the dock during the last year. The general manager's position was created by Senator Pearce, and the salary set fort h in the Estimates was fixed by him.",52
481,Mr RILEV,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The present manager gets only Â£1,000, but provision is made for a general manager at Â£2,000.",53
482,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The position of general manager is an office that was created by Senator Pearce.,53
483,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,And is not filled yet.,53
484,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"No . It was decided by Senator Pearce that that, office should carry the salary of Â£2,00 0 a year. present Administration cannot be charged with having originated that salary. We believe the salary fixed to be necessary, and assume full responsibility for it ; but we must not be charged with the creation of this highly paid office. There is shown in the Estimates the salaries of certain men who are not permanent officers of the Commonwealth; but it was merely the desire to be candid that led to those salaries being included. These officers have been working at Cockatoo Island under a three years' engagement. They are Australian officers, who have, been serving at the island in connection with the shipbuilding that has been going on there for Commonwealth purposes, and their salaries are being debited in this part of the Estimates in order to properly show the cost of each section of our Naval establishment.",53
485,Mr WATKINS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,What is the in officers during this year?,53
486,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"A very considerable one, because we have taken over the State officers who were employed on Cockatoo Island.",53
487,Mr WATKINS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,But what new officers have been appointed?,53
488,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"None . new office of general manager, which, in a sense, has not yet been filled, though I understand that the person .who is to fill it is to arrive very shortly; but new officers have been appointed. So far clerical as the officers taken over from the service of the State are concerned, their salaries have not been raised. In addition, there are certain men whose salaries appear on clerical the Estimates who are working under a three years' engagement. G. W . Barr, shipyard manager, Â£ 8 0 0 ; J. Payne, engine works manager, Â£ 5 5 0 ; A , MCNaught, Naval draughtsman, Â£ 4 0 0 ; J . Blundell, engineer foreman, Â£ 3 0 0 ; T. Mitchell, foreman turbine engineer, Â£ 3 0 0 ; J . Dow, foreman boilermaker, Â£ 3 0 0 ; A . J . Kennedy, loftsman. Â£300. As they all draw fairly large salaries, the amounts are shown on the Estimates, so that honourable members may understand the full charge in connection with these establishments. As I have said, I shall be only too happy if honourable members will peruse the papers. If they, do so, they will see for themselves that the transfer of these officers to the Commonwealth was approved by Senator Pearce, and that the increases The in the rates of pay at Garden Island were - ver y properly, in my opinion-autho rized, in the first instance, by him.",53
489,Mr FENTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Senato r Pearce did not increase the officers at Cockatoo Island as we find them there today.,53
490,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I am astounded that the honourable member should have the temerity to make that statement in full view of the papers. As I think he would like that weight to attach to his words which should attach to every statement made by an honourable member in this Chamber, I invite him to peruse the papers.",53
491,Mr FENTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I have the word of Senator Pearce.,53
492,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The men were appointed by the State Government, and were taken over by the Commonwealth - Government.",53
493,Mr HOWE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That is the truth of the increase situation.,53
494,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The facts are as honourable members have stated them. ' Here is a memorandum entitled, "" Recommendations re taking over the temporary staff of H . M . Naval establishments at Sydney, 1st July, 1913."" It is addressed to the Naval Secretary, and was There is the minuted by Senator Pearce on 31st May last. It saysAfter consultation with the responsible officers at Sydney, and after making personal inquiries no into the actual work performed by the hired staff in His Majesty's Naval Establishments at Sydney, I recommend that the present staff be taken over on ist July next, and appointed to the positions and at the rates shown in enclosed statement. There are no permanent officers employed in His Majesty's Naval Establishments in Sydney; the hired clerical staff do practically all the clerical work, and They are- they are, in my opinion, underpaid excepting the juniors. Hitherto they have been paid at similar rates to those paid in England, notwithstanding it is recognised that the cost of living is much higher in Australia. That accounts for part of the increase to which the honourable member for Hunter has very properly directed the attention of the HouseRepresentations have been made on several occasions to the Admiralty by the captain in charge of Garden Island, with the view to obtaining increased rates of pay for the hired clerical staff, but without success. statements show the nature of the duties performed by each officer of the hired clerical staff. With regard to the fitters, boiler-makers, storemen, labourers, & c , employed at dail"" rates of pay, many of whom have served continuously from io to 20 years, are recommended to be taken over on ist July as temporary employees at their existing rates of pay, provided such are not less than Union rates, and in the case of labourers, that they be paid the Commonwealth rate, at 9s. per 'day. The question of permanent appointment of those with, say, over five years' continuous to be considered at later date on the same conditions as recommended by me in the case of similar classes of labour'at Cockatoo Island, who are also being transferred on ist Julv. Mr M a n is t y minutes the proposalAfter discussion with D. N . A., I concur fully , and recommend the proposals for Minister's approval. That is concurred in by a gentleman whose signature is as dimcult to read as I understand my own to be, and then follows-*'Approved , G. F . P.",53
495,Mr BURNS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"That paper concerns the men who have been working on Garden Island, under the British Government.",54
496,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Yes ; with the exception of the police, who have taken the place of the marines, there are no new officers on Garden Island. I have explained that there are no marines i u the Australian Naval Forces. Garden Island is concerned, this Government cannot be charged with more than having given effect to the very proper arrangements made in this connection by Senator - Pearce.",54
497,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Admira l Henderson suggested that the cost of the Garden Island establishment could be reduced considerably after the taking over of Cockatoo Island, but you are increasing the cost.",54
498,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We are not increasing the cost of the Garden Island establishment, except by paying Australian rates of wages to men who have now entered the Commonwealth service, who were formerly receiving less than those rates. [ 8 7 ] -,",54
499,Mr CHARLTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"^Surely the Minister does not contend that the same number of officers will be necessary now that Cockatoo Island has been taken over. The increases to v/hich he refers come to Â£2,700 more than was paid by the I m perial Government.",54
500,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The shipbuilding and repairs are another matter altogether. Tliere is actually a very considerable in Enclosed crease in the wages' expenditure. I have brought here, so that the honourable member's mind may be set at rest, because I am satisfied he is strongly of opinion that Senator Pearce is to be thoroughly and implicitly trusted in these matters, the papers which show the authorizations of the late Minister.",54
501,Mr WATKINS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Hav e you the late M in ister's authority in those papers for the service extra expenditure in the way of new officers at Cockatoo Island ?,54
502,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"T l i e r e are no new officers at Cockatoo Island. Senator Pearce engaged the special men that have been referred to, and I fancy it is possible that, by merely counting up the Estimates and considering that those officers would not b3 shown as they were only under a temporary engagement, Senator Pearce made a mistake i u that regard; but they were 31.5.13."" appointed for three years, and we are showing them on the Estimates because they are highly paid. That is the matter in a nutshell. I hope my honourable friends are satisfied with the explanation, and will facilitate the passage of the Estimates, as the matter is one of considerable urgency.",54
503,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Kennedy) [9.27] So far as The honourable member has gone - a long way to explain the Estimates in relation to Cockatoo Island and Garden Island. I do not know much about that matter, and it is not my intention to say much upon it ; but I very much regrefc fchafc a good deal of fchis discussion has taken place owing to the action of the Minister himself yesterday in not giving the in formation which had been asked for ; the Minister who is now in charge of the Estimates appeared to know very little, and gave the House no information concerning them ab all. If there is one thing that we ought to be particular about it is the voting of large sums of inoney.",54
504,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The Minister of the Department gives the details.,54
505,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The should have a certain knowledge of the Estimates, and if the lionorable member who is in charge of this particular Department is always out of the chamber, and is not going to give the House the necessary information, we must have the Estimates discussed until such time as the Government are prepared to give us that information, l t is just as well for them bo realise this fact. If there is one tiling more than another that should be jealously guarded in this House, it is the right of honourable members to watch the Estimates as they are going through.",55
506,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We have taken longer this time than before. ' Mr MCDONALD - If that is so, only goes to show that the right honourable, member, when he was on this side of the House, did not do his duty. Nearly all the discussion that has taken place at the present time is on new penditure, which did not appear on Estimates last year. We are now called upon to vote this large increase, and the Minister tells us that, although all this from, one end of the money is to be voted for Cockatoo Island, there is to be no increase i u the staff. We maintain that there has been an indragged crease-. If the Honorary Minister is rect in saying that there has been no crease, how comes it that the Estimates have increased from Â£6,000 to Â£14,000 for the administrative staff? That is of the things that the honourable member ought to have explained while on his feet.",55
507,Mr KELLY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"My honourable friend gets that it is absolutely essential expenditure in the Imperial Estimates stated with regard to ship repairing, and that sort ofthing, shall still be carried Garden Island, where they have the sheer-legs. That is the only place have got.",55
508,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"It was the general impression that once Cockatoo Island was .taken over a good deal of the work done at Garden Island would be done at Cockageb too Island, and that thus a considerable amount of expenditure would be saved.",55
509,Mr WEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,It cannot be done.,55
510,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We can quite understand the honourable anxiety, bufc he must realise that one the highest authorities that we could get, to whom many thousands of pounds were paid to report upon these matters, said that it could be done. Personally, I nothing about it . Treasurer Mr KELLY - The actual police pay is about Â£4,000 i h the Imperial service. The marines' pay was borne on the ships' books, and not debited to this naval work at all.",55
511,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I did not rise particularly to speak on these naval matters, but wished to refer to a statement made by the Prime Minister this afternoon. I very much regret that he should have taken up the stand he did, because it led ultimately to a scene, which we all very much regret. The Prime Minister has a way of making statements 'from time to time in the most irresponsible way, without any knowledge whatever, and without investigation. In making his it attack upon the Leader of the Opposithis afternoon he went back to the old statement in the Auditor-General's report, that the accounts came to him so late in the year that it was not possible exfor him to. get his report ready before the Parliament prorogued. The Prime Minister ""used that statement from the Auditor-General's, report on the platform country to the other for political purposes, and I regret that the Auditor-General should be into party politics. If there is corone man who ought to be kept oub of in - the sphere of parby politics ib is the Auditor-General, yet the honourable gentleman has never lost an opportunity of one dragging up the statement about the time when his report is presented to the House, regardless of the fact that for many for years the report has come along at sbout that the a similar time. The Prime Minister in many places that the public accounts of this country had not on at been properly audited, but when I accused him of making that statement he we denied it . I produced the paper, and then, of course, he wriggled out of it by saying that the Auditor-General said that, owing to bhelabe hour ab which the accounts came along, ib was nob possible for him bo his report presented bo Parliamenb before the prorogation. While the AudiborGeneral book up that sband, however, he did nob say that the reports were not correcbly audibed. As a mabber of facb, the member's Prime Minister cast a very strong reflecof tion upon the Auditor-Getieral-that of not having properly audited the accounts. What are the facts in this case ? The first report of the Auditor-General for tke know period ended 30th June, 1901, was nob presented to Parliament u n t i l 25bh May, 19.03, or one year and eleven months after the end of the nnancial year. In 190.4 it was not presented to Parliament until 14th December, or a day before Parliament rose. In 1905 the report was presented on the 15th December, and in 1906 it was presented on the 25th September, or the earliest in its history. In 1907 the report reached us on the 13th December, the last day that Parliament sat. In 1908 it was presented on the 10th December. During all those years, with the exception of a very brief period, the. Labour party was not in office at all, so that it was idle for the Prime Minister to try to justify the charge that he made against the late Government, that the accounts could not be properly audited, owing to the. fact that they were not handed to the Auditor-General in time. If the honourable member desired to: be fair, and to give an honest interpretation of what had taken place in this House, he would have, told the House that the report would come along about the usual, time. The. honourable member for Gippsland. went about the country telling the peoplefchafc fchere were millions of money unaccounted, for,, and,,fchafcwhen the. Auditor-General came along, the Treasurer and several other members of the Ministry locked the doors, and would not let him in . The thing was so utterly absurd that I wonder the audienced i d not laugh at him. We are in rather a remarkable position in this House at present. The Government have no majority, and no one can point to any other country where a similar state of affairs exists. The Prime Minister said that if they could not carry out their policy, they, as self-respecting men, would not sit on the Treasury bench. I ask the Government what fchey have done to-, carry out their policy, and what solifcary measure, containing part of their policy, they have .passed through the House, and sentfcofcheother Chamber.",55
512,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Who is sponsible ?,56
513,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I take it that we are responsible, bufc when we find a sffc of men who will sit there and allow themselves to be insulted in every possible way",56
514,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,B y whom?,56
515,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"B y the very fact that they sit there without power, and have to do our bidding. We had anexhibition of this last night, when the Prime Ministerhad to do exactly what' he was told. Noset. of self-respecting men couldpossibly sit. there in the circumstances. I remember the Treasurer, on one occasion here, telling us thatfor two years he had to sit in office eating dirt at the dictation of the Labour party.",56
516,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That is an unfair statement. The honourable member is dirty to make it .,56
517,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I must ask the Treasurer to withdraw that remark.,56
518,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I withdraw it , but I was very much irritated by an iucorrecfc assertion.",56
519,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,When the honourable member makes such statements he. must occasionally have them brought up. against him.,56
520,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I never made it , and the honourable member cannot show, it to me.",56
521,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"If I cannot show it in Hansard, then it was cut out by the honourable member.",56
522,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,It was not cut. out by me. Why not turn it up ?,56
523,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"If I cannot turn it up in Hansard I can turn it up in the press. If the session is to end in the ordinary way by December, there is no possibility of our doing anything but passing Estimates.",56
524,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Is that not good work?,56
525,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"It may be good work, but this is the Government who- : were going to do so much, who never lost an opportunity of disparaging the party in power prior to the elections, and who talked of the wild extravagance of the past; Administration . Yet. fchey come down with Estimates to the extent of Â£27,000,000. I do not object to this expenditure if the inoney is required for the development of the country. An y Government afraid to f in d the money necessary for the developmentof the continent are unworthy of office, and reI am not cavilling afc the fact that there is an inflated expenditure of nearly Â£5,000,000 in excess of last year's, but I do find faul t with those who say that what was a crime on the part of the late Ministry is a virtue on the part of the present Government. The press through all parts of Australia, and honourable members who are now in accord with this increased expenditure, claimed that the* late Government's expenditure of about. Â£22.000,000 was the wildest extravagance practically bordering on corruption. The honourable members for Gippsland, Indi , and Wannon, and others who denounced what they termed the wild expenditure of the late Government, have not the moral courage to denounce the present Administration, yet if it was wild expenditure to spent Â£22,000,000, surely to spend Â£27,000,000 is also wild expenditure. Honourable members should have the courage of the statements they have so frequently made. I do not object to the expenditure so long as it is for the beneficial development of Australia. The position taken up to-night by the honourable member for Capricornia is an important one. We shall need to be caref u l in regard to our expenditure on the Navy. There is nothing to cavil at in regard to universal training, but it seems to be difficult to put any l i m it on naval expenditure, so that we should guard to the fullest extent any expenditure in connection with the development of our Navy. It is all very nice to wave flags and beat drums, and do all those sort of things. At the same time ib will land us in difficulty if we are not careful.",56
526,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We will into a much greater difficulty if we do nob have the Flag.  Australia, and nob in Japan.",57
527,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The honourable member for Roberbson produced a libble thing that was sold in Sydney on the day that the Australian Fleet came into Sydney Harbor. On thab day libble bannerettes, made in Japan, were being sold.  plum puddings at the Sbabe banquet.",57
528,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I believe the Liberal Association were selling these things to augment their funds. It shows how far their loyalty goes. Even at the great banquet held to welcome the officers of the Fleet, I believe there were little flags, made in Japan, ornamenting the table. The words were on the flags, so thab bhere could be no excuse for ib. A lob of the loyalby we hear aboub is spokenwibh the bongue in the cheek. We have a large expenditure in this Bill in connection with the Northern Territory. I do not say that we had to take over the Northern Territory for our own protection, because immediately we start bo develop that portion of Australia the danger increases. Nevertheless, Soubh Australia had held the Territory for many years, and ib became necessary for the Commonwealbh bo bake ib over. We have done so, and that involves a large expendibure, and a necessary expendibure, I believe, bo develop ib. Ib is mosb difficulb bo say whether the money being spent is being wisely spent; we certainly have in the Northern Territory one of the biggest problems Australia has to deal with. In declaring that we are bo hold Australia for the white races of the world, we have assumed a burden that has brought forth problems, nob only far reaching in bheir exbenb, bub also demanding the utmost enthusiasm and energy from every member of the community. I believe that the development of the Northern Territory will not be brought about on the lines now being adopted. I consider that we should resume the long leases on the Barklay Tableland, and set aboub building a railway to the Gulf of Carpentaria; or, if we do not do it , we should get the Queensland Government to do it . In bhis way I believe the Barklay Tableland can be successfully developed inside bwo or three years.  get Mr MCDONALD - W at e r can be had anywhere there at 400 or 500 feet. There is an inexhaustible supply.",57
529,Mr FALKINER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,What is the cost of getting it ?,57
530,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"If a 6-in. or 4-in. bore is put down, pumping cannot exhaust the water.",57
531,Mr FLEMING,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,What size holdings would you suggest?,57
532,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"If the tableland were cut up into 20,000-acre blocks, the whole of it would be taken up in side of two or three years. I can remember fifteen or twenty years ago, when we were told that no man could make a living in the Flinders district on less than 100,000 acres, but I have lived to see that land cut up into holdings of 20,000 acres, and even 10,000 acres, and 5,000 acres.  make a living on 5,000 acres up in that Territory ?",57
533,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"No ; but I am telling the honourable member what has been done in the Flinders district'. About six months ago, a block of 10,000 acres was sold. The man who held it had completed his five years' settlement on it . I forget how many sheep he had, bub he sold the block for Â£6,000, though he had only been on it for five years. I know other men who have nearer, started on 10,000-acre blocks, and tory. who are wealthy men today. maintain that this tableland can be up into 20,000-acre blocks. It is of saying a living cannot be made on blocks. Men are not only making a ing out of them, but they are making small fortunes. There are on the Barklay in the building of harbors. Tableland high pebbly downs, well sheltered.",57
534,Mr FALKINER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Tlier e are millions of acres without any timber.,58

536,Mr FLEMING,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"How can they fence a 20,000-acre block in that class of country ?",58
537,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I know places where they cart the fencing material 80 and 100 miles, but there is ample timber on the Barklay Tableland. There is ample opportunity, not only for fencing, but for making small holdings pay. But no attempt seems to be made in that direction. We estimate could still go ou with the developthat ment of that part of the Northern Terriwould tory, as well as the part nearer Port Darwin, but the desire seems to be to hang round..Port Darwin. Probably is because the railway is there, and there is a settled town. I have no .objection to developing that part near Port Daryears, win. Probably the people already know more about it than I do, but I believe that the Barklay Tableland could be successfully developed and made to hence. carry sheep. The trouble is that there are large leases given by the South Australian Government, and there has building been no attempt to redeem them.  laud there available. Mr MCDONALD' - There is not much capable of carrying sheep so sucpleted cessfully as on the Barklay TableI land. Men who have crossed and re-crossed that district have told .me there is every possibility of its carrying Monaro) [9.59] - I large numbers of sheep, and in that direction an attempt could be made at sition. the present time.",58
538,Mr FALKINER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"To do that it would been placed before the House. be necessary to build a railway to Burkeo'clock town, which is the nearest port.",58
539,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Borroloola is but it is in the Northern TerriThe difficulty in regard to many I of these Gulf ports-Burketown , Norcut manton, Gulftown, and Borroloolauo use is in regard to the mouths of the these rivers. The only evidence we can livget in regard to these difficulties would be from experts who are well-versed I am not prepared to say whether Burketown, or Normanton in the Gulf, or Point Parker, or Borroloola, in the Northern Territory, are the best ports, but undoubtedly we could settle a large number of people for all time on the Barklay tablelands, and those I hope that the Government will put energy into the work. I desire now to refer to the trouble experienced by the Library Committee in securing sufficient room to house our books and documents.. We have had the use of this building since the inauguration of Federation, and seeing that the finances of the Commonwealth are very buoyant, I think it would be a graceful recognition of the generosity of the Victorian Parliament and the people of the State to complete the north wing. I understand that an of the cost has been framed, and plans are already in existence. It cost about Â£60,000 or Â£70,000 to complete the north wing of this building, and by doing so we should provide ample it accommodation to meet the requirements of the Library. We haye had the free use of this building for twelve or thirteen and are likely to be here fbr anthere other eight or ten years.",58
540,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,We ought to be in the Federal Capital three years,58
541,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Eve n in that case we should have had the free use of this for sixteen years, and I tliink it is up to the Commonwealth Parliament to do something to show its appreciation of the generosity of the people of this so State. The north wing could be comi n twelve or eighteen months, and hope that the Government will take my proposal into serious consideration.",58
542,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Edenam rather suspicious of the cheers of the OppoI rise to express my dissatisfaction at the way these Estimates have At 2 this morning I felt constrained to enter my protest against the Estimatesfor the Northern Territory, which are the most extraordinary we have ever had before ns. We have had to drag information from the Government, and I am strongly of opinion that much of the time taken up by this debate would have been saved if Ministers had come forward in : the first place with the particulars we desired. I agree with what the honourable member for Kennedy has said in regard to the ^Northern Territory, but I would point out that he has saddled the wrong horse. He seems to f orget that the late Government laid down the lines for the development' of the Northern Territory .which are being followed in these Estimates.",58

AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The honourable member does not like what I say, bub I would remind the House that the late Government's idea of developing the Territory was not to open up the land by the building of railways, 'but to appoint up there a staff of some 200 or 300 pu'blic servants, many of them being. officers of high grade.  sand i",59
544,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I know that the honourable member has a very elastic way of dealing with figures.  ternal . Affairs has said that there is not one officer in the Territory who should not be there.,59
545,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The honourable member thinks that the proper way to develop the Territory is to send up there a lot of experts as well as a large staff bf highly-paid public servants, to spend Â£30,000 or Â£40,000 in building residences for them, and to erect sbeam laundries as the late Government did. ",59
546,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"They proposed to do so, 'but we would not allow them. Honourable members of the Opposition have .protested again and again against the additional appointments made at Garden Island and Cockatoo Island, and the whole discussion has appeared to hinge round the question of who made the appointmenbs. The Opposition condemned them u n t i l they found that the ex-Minister of Defence had made them.",59
547,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,He did not.,59
548,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I do nofi care who made them, or how many men. are employed in these establishments, as long as they are necessary. The Opposition became very quiet when they learned that Senator Pearce was responsible for bhese appointments.",59
549,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,He was not.,59
550,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The Minister put the papers on the table and said the ex-Minister had made the appointments.,59
551,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,He was incorrect.,59
552,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"After all, whait does it mabber who made them, as long as they are necessary? I desire bo ask the Minisber of Exbemal Affairs whab he has done in the Northern Territory? He has been in office for four months, yet, when he is asked bo give an explanation i u regard to his Estimates, he bells us that he will do so when next year.'s Estimates are before us.",59
553,Mr GLYNN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I did nob say that. I spoke of this year's Estimates.,59
554,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"That was the statement made by the Prime M in ister, and - his colleagues must stand by him. a thou-' Mr Glynn - The Prime Minister led me off the track a little by alluding to next, year's Estimates, .but I meant to refer to the Estimates for this year.",59
555,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The conof Ex- sideration of next year's Estimates may be a long way off, seeing that the Opposition are determined that no businessshall be done, and we want to know at once what policy is being pursued by the Government in regard - to the NorthernTerritory. Ministers, however, a f t e r being three or four months in ofiice, bring down these Estimates, offer us no information in regard bo them, and, when we - protesb against the proposed expenditure in the Northern Territory, realizing, as most of us do, that it is but the foundation of a much larger expenditure, we are told to wait for information on the subject. If we did the right bhing, I - think that we would strike out a lot of the items in the Estimates, and make Miit-isbers Responsible for the proposals they pub before us in regard bo the expenditure of the people's money. Unfortunately, however, the party bell is rung, and as soon as that is done we know fairly well how every honourable member will vote. I feel disposed to ask the Treasurer where he expectsto get the money necessary to provide for all tliese undertakings. It is all very well for the honourable member for Kennedy topropose an expenditure of Â£50,000 or Â£60,000 in completing the north wing of this building, but whilst I recognise that the people of Victoria have treated us well in giving us the free use of Parliament House, I cannot lose sight of the fact that the people would have-to find the money to carry out such a proposal. As a count r y representative, I am told again and again that money cannot be found even to provide for short telephone and telegraph lines, or to build small post-offices. It is the duty of the Government to explain, not only the expenditure they now propose, but what it will lead to, and where they are going to findthe inoney. I feel that I am tied up here, and that I ought to vote against a number of the items in the Schedule; but I would rather vote with the Minister of External Affairs for a proposal in which I do not believe than give a vote which would put the Socialists into office. The trouble with honourable members opposite is that our party is in ofiice. I enter an emphatic protest against the way in which the Estimates have been put before us. only after a lot of cavilling and much waste of time that we secured information which we had sought from the outset. Ministers can blame themselves for the waste of time that has taken place. The Treasurer was asked for information, but - did not give it to us t ill we threatened an all-night sitting. At the same time, I freely admit that the Prime Minister made last night a candid statement which disarmed a lot of the criticism which would have come from this corner, or, at all events, from myself. During my twenty years of political life I have never known an Opposition to cavil, as the Opposition in this House have done, at certain expenditure, and then to become as silent as the grave on finding that it relates to their own appointments and their own - commitments.",59
556,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That is not so.,60
557,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The comtrouble. mitments made by the late Government have to be honoured by the present A ministration, unless we are to go in for policy of repudiation. What we to consider is not who made the appointhim ments, but whether the appointments are necessary.",60
558,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The honourable member passed them all last night.,60
559,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"And when I protested last night, the Trea^ surer asked me to leave the matter over until.the next day. Generally speaking, I amvery dissatisfied, and. feel much disposed to give my vote against the Treasurer. It is all very well to.point tb the Minister of External Affairs, but we all like him so very much that we do not care to criticise him ; and, in any case, he gets enough unkind treatment from the Treasurer himself. I have a protest to enter against the Department of the Postmaster-General, who, I am sorry to see, is not present. There are thirty or forty small telephone and post offices being held up in my district.",60
560,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The honourable member explained that last night.,60
561,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"If I did go on to explain that matter, I might take some time, and the Treasurer would not like that. The Treasurer ought to tell us whether he has any system for the ex^ penditure of this money. If this sort of thing goes on, it will necessitate extra taxation, including, no doubt, an income It was tax, and against that nobody would call out louder than the Treasurer himself.",60
562,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Post Office is costing now Â£2,600,000 more than it earns.",60
563,Mr HANS IRVINE,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"And 66 per cent, of that expenditure is in the cities.",60
564,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Does the Treasurer contend that the Post Office, which opens up the country, and is the great civilizer, ought to be made to pay ?",60
565,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The honourable member will admit that Â£7,000,000 is a good round sum.",60
566,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Yes ; but the Treasurer can throw millions around like apples. "" What is a million ? "" I am not asking for a .million, but merely that some funds shall be placed at the disposal of the Postmaster-General to permit of the provision of small post offices in country districts. If the Treasurer does not provide that money, he is in for I am not making threats, but I am not going to stand this sort of thing. d - The Treasurer may feel very snug where a he is, but it is quite time that we honors ought able members in the Corner, who keep in his position, should raise a solemn protest against the treatment the country districts receive.",60
567,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Is there a Country party in the Corner?,61
568,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I dare say there is, and there is no doubt that, generally, not much sympathy is shown with country people here. members may laugh at the country people now, but they do not laugh at them at election time. I appeal for some consideration for the country districts. the Treasurer satisfied that the expenditure shall go on in this slipshod way in the Northern Territory, at the Capital, and at Jervis Bay, with no. responsibility and no check ? We must not forget, however, that this system was initiated by the late Government; but it is for the present Government to show a better example. I know that I went about the country charging the late Government with extravagance, and with working on a bad system, and many honourable members on the front Government bench did the same tiling . It is now time that those charges were proved, and it would not be hard to prove them in many cases. As a matter of fact, in twenty-four hours I could prove that money was grossly wasted and squandered in many places by the late Administration; and the present Government ought to make the facts public. We ought not to indulge in generalities, but ram the charges home.",61
569,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Prov e one.,61
570,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Government ought to be able to prove one very easily; at any rate, I could prove more than one. If the Government will appoint a small Royal Commission to make inquiries into the administration of Jervis Bay, I will undertake to prove waste and extravagance, and that the system is rotten to the core. For a Â£ 1 0 note, a Royal Commission of three members could do the work, and I suggest that two should be taken from the Government side, and one from the Opposition side, with no expenses or fees of any kind.",61
571,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,What ! to work for nothing ?,61
572,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Honor able members may choose to treat this subject in a light vein, but the people who have to find the money do not so treat it . If monsy is wasted at Jervis Bay and the other places I have mentioned, it may be wasted all over the country. I do not blame Ministers,""because they cannot look after everything personally, but it is the system that is wrong, and requires mending. The Treasurer may be very jovial now that he is assured of getting his Estimates through, but he is not doing his duty to the people of the country. I am Honourable tired of hearing charges flung round, and the Government should make an effort to prove them, because people are beginning to think there is nothing in those charges. Is Many statements have been made, but up to the present nothing has been proved, although I feel satisfied that much could be proved; if I did not think so, I would not say what I am now saying. I do not lay the blame at the door of the late Ministers, but I blame the system. The Treasurer raised a lot of trouble over the sleepers for the transcontinental railway; but with him all is right so long as the money is spent in the West. Why does he not take a national view, as I do, in connection with the Federal Capital?",61
573,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Soutli Sydney) [10.20] I wish, in a friendly way, to make a suggestion or two to the Government, with a view to saving expense at Cockatoo Island, where there are over 1,200 men employed building our cruisers and torpedo boats. When the Commonwealth took over the island they took over all the staff of the State Government, including the general manager, but that gentleman is now only in an acting capacity; and where there is not a permanency of tenure a man cannot be expected to take the same interest in his work. The Honorary Minister told us of a large number of experts who had been brought out by the State Government, and who are on the temporary list, some for three years, and others for t w o ; and we cannot hope for the best results under such circumstances. I regret very much that the present manager, who was in his present position for ten or twelve years under the State, is only temporarily employed. He has brought the place up to its present position, and it is unfair to suggest Ask men that he is not qualified to carry out the construction of ships. If the expenses of construction are increasing, that is due to the administration of the Naval Board.. I do not blame the Minister or the late Minister, but, as a fact, the plans of the ships are kept, not in Sydney, buti with the Naval Board, in Melbourne. If any detailed information is required, or any dispute arises about the construction, a gentleman has to be sent from Melbourne fco see the plans, from which sketches are taken, the plans themselves being retained at the Seat of Government. An y ordinary common-sense person would imagine that the place for the plans would be on the spot where the vessels were being constructed.",61
574,Mr WEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,It is an Admiralty regulation.,62
575,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We are not here to be guided by the Admiralty in Great Britain, and I think an alteration in this connection would save expense. The Minister ought to insist on the plans, and the draughtsmen, if necessary, being - located where the shipbuilding goes on. As to Garden Island, it would be a great mistake to have another set of engineers and supervisors to do the repair work. The British Goverument have used Garden Island for repairs, Cockatoo Island being i u the hands of the State Government for their shipbuilding and repairing. the Estimates there is a large sum of inoney for the installation of machinery of the latest type for Cockatoo Island, and there is no need to bring in a separate staff for repairs at Garden Island. In shipbuilding, centralization ought to be aimed at, and I hope that the M in ister, instead of creating a separate staff, and building a house for the manager at Garden Island, will see that one part of Cockatoo Island is ' set aside for repairs. In any case, all our ships are new, and no repairs ought to be necessary for a long time.",62
576,Mr WEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Garde n Island is a store and victualling place.,62
577,Mr RILEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"It ought to be kept as a store, and not mixed up with the engineering work. I hope that the Bill will go through without delay, because it provides for necessary expenditure. I rose merely 'to point out the need for supervising the recommendations of the Navy Board. The history of every part cf the world shows that naval and military men have no sense of proportion in matters of finance. They are not responsible to the people as are members of - Parliament, and they make recommenditions, leaving it to others to find the money. If we act on democratic lines, we shall see that Parliament retains its responsibility, making the Minister responsible to it , and allowing no extravagance. Once the public think that fclio Navy is extravagantly managed, it will become unpopular, and it will then ' i i difficult to maintain it at a proper degree of efficiency. I trust that all proposals for naval expenditure will be properly controlled by the Minister. It would lie a good thing if we had some smart business men on the Navy Board to l-iok after the interests of the public. Th-ire would be safety in that arrangement. 1 hope that there is some misunderstanding regarding the attitude of the Prime M in ister and of the Minister of Defence as to the control of the Navy. I hope that the latter has wrongly put the position, and that on no consideration wil l he hand over to the Admiral the right to say where the ships shall go, where they shall coal, and so for t h. As an official, the Admiral should be always under the control of the Minister of Defence for the time being, and the Parliament will hold the' Minister responsible. It would be a backward step to give the control of the Navy to the Admiral, or to the Navy On Board. I trust that the - Minister will keep a close eye upon proposals for expenditure, both Naval and Military . I believe that there have been leakages, but that must happen whenever a new system is inaugurated. I hope, however, that when Ministers get into recess they will see_ that the extravagance, if any, is cur tailed.  to refer to a statement made by the honourable member for Moreton. If there is one man in the House who I thought would not take advantage of another, it is he, and I am very sorry that I should be one of the few to come under his ban. I have read his speech carefully from beginning to end, and I cannot see why he should have referred to something that occurred four years ago. Since then. I have been before my constituents on two occasions, and it was then, if at any time, that the matter should have been dealt with. I ask honourable members on both sides if I have ever been against the Naval or Military Defence policy of the Government. I have been one of the most sincere adherents of that policy all along, although, if there are two constituencies in the Commonwealth whose electors are against it , they are the Maranoa and the Kennedy constituencies.",62
578,Mr FENTON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Why ?  anti-jingo. It would have been more popular to denounce than to defend the Naval and M i l it a ry policy of the Commonwealth in those constituencies. Bufc even ab this early hour in the establishme'ht 'of our Defence policy, I am beginning to fear that we may have made a 'mistake. Tliere is a jingoistic spirit in Australia that' was never here before, and we may be creating a naval and hiilibary caste, for which tnahy of us may ultimately be sorry.",62
579,Mr RTKEY,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The people can easily alter thab.  of the pasb bb guide us, and know whab - naval and military gentlemen are in regard to expenditure. Our expenditure 'is mou'ntihg up by 'leaps a'nd bounds, and 'the Government are providing for works and building's out of loan money, so that they may have sufficient revenue to pay for - pfefetice. They introduced a Naval Loan Bill , 'but found 'that ib was unpopular 'throughout Australia. They know now 'fhat the country will not allow borrowing ""for 'Defence, arid 'therefore they pro'p'ose t'o borrow f d r Works expenditure, Using the 'revenue for Defence. If the hondrable member for Moreton thinks ihat his remarks tended to injure me in ; 'iny constituency, 'he is mistaken. stead of doing me harm, they will do nre gbod. He said that I was'one of the few who voted a'gahiSb the Defence 'policy in troduced by the present Prime Minister when Minister of 'Defence. Why was he not fair? Afc fcliafc'time the chamber was in ah electrical 'state, one member 'stopping another from speaking, 'and 'the 'Minister of - Defence of the day overleapt himself. He moved that the question - be now put, and found thab he had made a ""bloomer."" He theu asked leave bo withdraw the mobion.

I would do ""the same thing again tomorrow. If we had put a little more devil into t in proceedings at the time, things would have been different, and had my advice been taken, there would have been something stronger to chronicle in Hansard. The question wasThat this - House approves the - new scheme of naval defence adopted at the ""recent Imperial Con'feYerice, an'd is of opinion that infmediate steps should be taken to ; provide the proposed Australian Unit of the Eastern Fleet of the Empire.

I am not ashamed of that view. My constituents d'o not hold strong views with regard to a defence policy, and I waa tna'king 'an emphatic protest against the way the Minister was putting his business through. To show lionorable members what took place at that time, I may mention that the honourable member for Gwydir movedThat the Minister of Defence be not further s heard.

As honourable members who were then in the House wilt recollecfc, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports refused to act as a teller.

I cannot see what motivehe has, or what he was to> get out of it . ' I do not know that I have ever done anything dirfcy to the honourable member. K have always regarded him as a personal friend, and I canuot understand why he should have taken this action. I have word or two to say with regard to the matter mentioned by the honourable ber for Kennedy. W it h regard to Barklay Tableland, it is quite true that that thought there are thousands of acres available. When I first went to Queensland, there was nothing out there bu t cattle ranches, and the cattle were pretty wild afc that. The late James Tyson took up a place from the Saltern Creek Pastoral ComTableland pany. He fenced it, and put a large number of sheep on it. He put down bores at shallow depths. That sounds right, bu t it requires money to do sort of thing. Bores cannot down on the Barklay Tableland for a foot. The honourable member nedy mentioned 5,'000 acres.",63
583,Mr MCDONALD,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I said that along Plinders there are holdings of 5,000 acres.  land where men are starving on 5,000 acres. They are in the hands of the banks and financial institutions. An area of 5,000 acres is of no use to a man going in for sheep. An y one who tries it is lunatic. The honourable member fchafcfchereare people making money 10,000 acres in parts of the country to be useless twenty years ago. Of course you will find "" m u g s "" buying stations, just as you will find them buying horses. They think that all that you have to do isfcoput your money into a sheep station, sub-artesian. and that a fortune will grow like turnips. When they have been'at it a little while, fchey learn that experience good management are required. Twenfcysecuring thousand-acre blocks on the Tableland would be of no more use than 20 acres would be in Victoria. are to be put down in that country people want to have more than 20,000 acres. The veriest tyro in station mannow. agement knows that on such a holding you cannot carry enough stock even to pay for transit. The nearest port of ment to the Barklay Tableland is Burkeintends town. To build a railway from Burkethe town to the tableland you would have go through Queensland territory. Queensdisadvantages. land is naturally jealous of her own trade, and would not allow the Commonwealth to build a line from the tableland Burketown. I believe that those areas which are good for settlement should settled at the earliest opportunity, that we should prove to the world what the tableland is. It is reported to be good a sheep country, but. there are not going to be the fortunes in it that many people memthink. I have dropped nearly Â£1,000 the in it as a member of a company that it was going to make a lot of money out of sheep raising. We all dropped our "" little b it , "" and were quite satisfied to get oufc of the venture as lightly as we did. Another thing with regard to Barklay is that it will be necessary to have sheep driven there, and that cannot be done in that part of the country all during a drought. It cannot be done that in the Kennedy and Maranoa electorates be put when they are suffering from drought. 20s. Mr FALKINER - The last sheep - that for Kenwent out died onfcheroad.  the often perished going out to these far back stations, bu t if fchey can gefc out and there is a good season, how can they get the clip away ? A man with 50,000 acres cannot wait u n t i l the weather' breaks, because he has not the capital behind him. It means that any one going a to start the sheep industry there without' said a bank behind him-and a good bank at on that-is doomed to failure from the said commencement. I would like the Minister . of External Affairs to tell us how much he is paying per foot for the experimental bores, whether any water has been struck, and whether it is artesian or",64
584,Mr GLYNN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"It is sub-artesian. We could not accept some contracts, because and the tenders were too high. We are now a plant to do the work ourselves. Barklay I do not know the prices.  If bores hand-bores put down.",64

I wish to make a reference to the great Protectionist - party on the other side of the chamber. Surely in this great Australia of ours we can make few flags. It did grieve me when the flags of welcome that were sold in the streets of Sydney on the arrival of our Eleet. It made me feel a bit queer to see "" Made in Japan "" corner of those flags.

Instead of it being a home-coming for the Fleet, the occasion was more like a funeral. I never witnessed anything worse from a jubilation point of view. The bands were playing as if at a funeral; the vessels went silently up the harbour, and we followed in their wake. Without taking us round the Fleet, they landed us just where we started. It was a fuueral, I am sorry to say, though the people were just bursting with enthusiasm. ""On the previous day an order was issued that no sirens or whistles were to be blown, and no jubilation was to be shown, because a few children would be singing in one of the boats. I think the Government muddled that business. Instead of taking us down the harbour, they could have chartered a full-rigged ship and manned it with Australian Naval Cadets, and they could have had Australian girls on the decks welcoming the warships with the good old English hurrahs. That would have been something towards a welcome.",65

The Governmeut, in these Estimates, are following on the lines of the late Government, but, beyond Cockatoo Island and Garden Island, they have made no provision to be self-contained so f ar as armaments are concerned. Apparently they intend to rely on Cockatoo Island, and to a lesser degree on Garden Island, where there is a fairl y good workshop. I have to admit that the works at Cockatoo Island are splendid. As to whether they were worth the money paid for them, of course I cannot claim to be a judge. It is with a good deal of diffidence that I express a doubt as to whether we are really getting value for our money.",65
594,Mr WEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Do not worry I We are.,65
595,Mr MATHEWS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"If that assertion were made by a disinterested member I should be disposed to accept it , but since it comes from a New South Welshman I must take it with a grain of salt, because we know that all their geese over there are swans. An endeavour is being made to make Australia self-contained as far as possible in the matter of the requirements of the A r m y and Navy, and if that effort is to be successful we shall have to provide, not only for the manufacture of small arms and cordite, but for the nucleus of an arsenal in which heavy guns and ammunition can be manufactured. I had hoped that the present GoI f honvernment would take a step in that direction, but I find that they are content to traverse the path which other A d ministrations have followed. We are importing tools and parts for our heavy guns afc a cosfc of many thousands of pounds, although they can be manufactured here. Ifc is dangerous to continue this practice.",65

Even a novice, looking at one of our up-to-date big guns, can see that it is a piece of high mechanism, and that it would not take much to put the mechanism out of order. We have in Victoria a rather good Ordnance Department, which, I believe, is capable of making many of the parts and tools that have been imported, and by means of an expenditure of Â£40,000, or Â£50,000, we could be made less dependent upon Cockatoo Island than we are at present. I know that it will be said that I am taking a provincial view of the position when I urge that in some part of Victoria there should be established the nucleus of an arsenal in which all that is required in connection with our heavy guns could be manufactured. In setting oufc to construct the arsenal we should make provision for an extension.",66
598,Mr BRUCE SMITH,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Would the honourable member make provision for two arsenals-on e in Sydney, and one in Melbourne ?",66
599,Mr MATHEWS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I do not wish to raise that question. If I were to suggest that we should have one in Melbourne every representative of New South Wales would be up in arms, and would declare that I was making an attack on the "" M a "" State. We are spending something like Â£60,000 per annum on the Ordnance Department, and we have, in Major Hardy, an inspector of ordnance machinery who, although I have disagreed with many of his actions, is undoubtedly a highly-trained specialist. He was one of the best mechanics in the Newport workshops, where he worked many years ago prior to his appointment by the Victorian Government as an artificer in the Defence Department. He has under him in the different States a fairly good staff of highly-trained engineers, capable of making all that we are now importing in this direction. We have in the Ordnance Department the nucleus of an arsenal, and it is only fair that we should make use of it instead of having fco depend wholly on Cockatoo Island. Great as may be the ability of those in charge of the Cockatoo Island works, I fchink that they have been given too much to do, and that it was because of this that certain experiments they undertook were ""imnot up to expectations.",66
600,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,They certainly started to make the big' boat there liefore they were ready.,66
601,Mr MATHEWS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,They have been asked fco do more than fchey are capable of doing at present.,66
602,Mr WEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Where did the honourable member get that information?,66
603,Mr MATHEWS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Do we not know that they are behind in the work of constructing one of the vessels of the Fleefc which they undertook, and. that the casting of certain gun mountings, which they should have been capable of doing, was not a success. Those mountings, if not thrown on the scrap heap, are next door fco it.",66
604,Mr BRUCE SMITH,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Did the honourable member ever try to get the Labour Government to start some of these industries ?,66
605,Mr MATHEWS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"On more than one occasion I expressed my disapproval of what the ex-Minister of Defence was doing, and I went so far as to complain, as I complain today, that the Minister of Defence was a member of another place. I have always said that that office should be alloted to an honourable member of this House. I always thought it was unfair to attack the honourable member for Adelaide when he represented the Minister of Defence in this House, and I hold the same opinion in regard to the Honorary Minister now. The honourable member for Parkes seemed to fchink I was making an attack on the Honorary Minister, but that is not so, because I always thought, as I say, that it was unreasonable to attack his predecessor. The Prime Minister is really the only honourable member opposite who has had any intimate association with the Defence Department, and he knows that during his term of office tliere were many reports submitted with a view to having the articles to which I have referred constructed in Australia, but if anything of the kind was suggested, it was wiped out at once by the naval and military advisers. As a matter of fact, these men, and not the Minister, rule the Defence Department. For instance, in the Quartermaster-General's Branch there was at one time afc the head LieutenantColonel Legge, whom I believe to be a highly capable man, and he made many departures in the direction of having material manufactured here. I had certain papers laid on the table of the Library - showing that suggestions had been made - by other officers to similar effect, but nothing was ever done. Rightly or wrongly, Ministers of: Defence .have to depend on the advice of their expert advisers; and one Minister tol'd me that he must do so or assert himself as a layman, which-, under the circumstances, he did not care to do. The members of the Militar y Board and Naval Board may be very capable men individually, but when they are collected' together as a Board it is almost impossible to get them to do anything of a. progressive character, and this is not good for Australia. are led to believe that there are rumours of war in Europe, and the British Government are building vessels to a greater extent than even a wealthy nationlike the British can afford. Only the other day a British Minister, to his credit, endeavoured to bring about a change in this connection, and he did this without cringing or crawling to foreign Powers. If there is any possibility of war during the next few years we ought to .be prepared, and to do that we ought to be self-contained so far as armaments are concerned. There is nothing to stop our commencing with small field-pieces, or in rercasing and strengthening heavier guns, which, I understand, is required after a certain number of projectiles have been discharged. Further, guns become obsolate in a very few years, but it is possible by altering the mechanism to bring them up to-date, and something might be done in preparing for work of that character. The position demands that something in this connection should be attempted, and in the different States at present there are artificers who would form a nucleus for such an establishment. I hope our friends from Sydney will not think we are endeavouring to take something from them, but it is not tar-seeing policy to rely on one manufacturing place for such commodities. - I do not wish to raise a scare, but it is as - veil that honourable members should know chat a, vessel armed with up-to-date heavy guns could stand off in the open sea and shell anyportion of Sydney, including Cockatoo Island.",66
606,Mr SAMPSON,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,How are we to come that difficulty? Mr Mathews.,67
607,Mr MATHEWS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I say that it is to be overcome by establishing our arsenal and shipbuilding works at some place less accessible to an enemy. I have no desire to raise provincial feeling when I say that such a place can be found at Westernport or Port Phillip, and to come closer home to the interests of my own electorate, I think the works could be better established at Port Phillip than at Westernport.",67
608,Mr WEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,We should first have to put a new bottom in the harbour and the Yarra.,67
609,Mr MATHEWS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Honourable members can now hear Cockatoo Island speaking. I feel sure that Mr Speaker has never discerned it , but it is a fact, neverWe the less, that representatives from Sydney are unable to believe that anything can be done as well elsewhere. The moment one attempts to put any other place on the same plane as Sydney they cling together like long-lost brothers, irrespective of party. I understand that the same feeling is noticeable as between Sydney representatives and country representatives of New South Wales. This is a digression, but I was induced to make it by the aspersion cast by the honourable member for East Sydney upon the depth of water in Port Phillip. I do not in tend to delay honourable members longer, but I am determined to hammer away at this phase of the question u n t i l we have an arsenal established which will be in dependent of Cockatoo Island, and which, when that place fails us, may be used in the interests of Australia.",67
610,Mr SINCLAIR,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Moreton) [11.18] - I should not have spoken on this Bill were it not for the fact that I have been charged with misrepresenting the honourable member for Maranoa by a quotation which I made the other night from Hansard. I was pointing out that the members of the Labour party, on the defence policy, speak with a double voice. In the country they claim that they are rea sponsible for the defence policy of Australia, but they have not been responsible for it here. The honourable member for Maranoa brought himself into the limelight by taking exception to what I said on the occasion referred to. The honourable member for Yarra did the proper thing by getting up, after I had spoken, to explain his attitude in the matter. I overregret that .both honourable members did not make their explanations four years --ago, instead of waiting until now to make them. I told the honourable member for Maranoa when I spoke that I should be very sorry to misrepresent him. ssorry now that the honourable member did not accept my assurance. - fcention of misrepresenting liim person-ally, or of doing him any in j u ry in his - electorate. I am aware that it is not possible to injure him in his electorate, but I take exception to being accused of misrepresenting the honourable member. When the honourable members for Maranoa - and Yarra say that they wished to protest against the action of the Government - of the day, I say that they had already protested in the division on the motion that the question be now put. lenge any one who investigates the matter without, bias to come to any conclusion other than that at which I arrived with regard to that division.",67
611,Mr WEST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The honourable member will not accept the explanation of the - honourable member for Maranoa.,68
612,Mr SINCLAIR,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I have said that I regret that the honourable memberdid not make his explanation four yearsago in stead of now. The motion before the House at that time wasThat the House approves the new scheme of - naval defence adopted at the recent Imperial Conference, and is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken to provide the proposed Australian Unit, of the Eastern Fleet of the Empire. When the question was put upon that motion and the House divided, the ""Ayes."" numbered thirty-nine and the "" Noes"" nine. The minorit y consisted of Messrs. C. E . Frazer, J. Mathews, King. O'Malley, JT. Page, J . Thomas, F . <Â£.. Tudor, W. Webster, W . R. N . Maloney, and. C. MCDonald. I venture to say that anyone reading the report, i h Mansard must come to the conclusion that those who voted in the minority on that occasion voted against the naval policy of the then Government, and against the Fleet Unitthen proposed.",68
613,Mr ROBEETS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"At the worse, it was a vote against an abstract motion, the financial consequences of which the then Ministry had not considered.",68
614,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"And which the then M in ister of Defence declined, to explain.",68
615,Mr SINCLAIR,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The honourable gentieman tried to explain, but the Opposition moved the gag upon him three times while he was' m aking his speech, and he then moved, "" That the question be now put."" That was the time for the protests of honourable members. The report will I am be found at page 6259 of Hansard for 1909. T had no in - Mr TUDOR - I voted against that motion also.",68
616,Mr SINCLAIR,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Yes , the honourable member entered his protest against that motion. I was pointing out when referring to this matter that some members of the Labour party could not take credit for having initiated the present naval policy of the Commonwealth. I had no desire to hurt the feelings of the honourable member for Maranoa. I have the utmost friendship for the honourable memI chal- ber, and am pleased to say that, apart from politics, we are able to agree remarkably well. I think that we have some cause to be alarmed about the growing, expenditure on defence. It is not merely creeping up> but is advancing at an alarming rate. In 1909-10 the expenditure was Â£ 1 , 5 3 4 , 8 8 1; in 1910-11 it had jumped up to Â£3,008,705 ; in 191.1-12 it was Â£4,080,039. In 19H2-13 the estimated expenditure was Â£5,438,364, and this year we have an estimate which is an increase upon that amount. It appears to me that the expenditure is growing so rapidly that it is time we went rather slower than we are doing in the matter of defence. I do not wonder at the honourable member for Maranoa and other honourable members objecting to this large expenditure. The unfortunate point is ttyat they aie responsible for it . During the Labour Government's term of office, the expenditure upon defence increased from Â£1,000,000 to Â£5,000,000 per annum. This year the increase is not much more than it was last year.",68
617,Mr ROBEETS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Whic h statement is correct? Did the Labour Government ini tiate the naval policy, or did the Fusion Government ?",68
618,Mr SINCLAIR,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The Labour party, when they thought the policy was popular in the country, claimed credit for having introduced it . . They would be just as ready to. repudiate it if it were not popular. It wasi the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia which prompted me to rise and point out the inconsistency of the Labour party.",68
619,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The honourable member is doing an absent member an injustice. The lionorable member for Capricornia has always taken up a consistent attitude upon this question.,68
620,Mr SINCLAIR,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I have no desire do the honourable member an injustice; but he is one of the party which has claimed credit for having initiated naval policy. I hope that the time has passed when there will be any parties this House upon the question of defence. There are some other items of expenditure in respect of which we have a perfect right to know the intentions of. the vernment. Upon last year's Estimates for new works aud buildings tliere was item of Â£8,000 for the establishment Woollen Mills at Geelong. able member for Adelaide, who was then representing the Minister of Defence, questioned very closely as to what the policy of the Government in regard to' monwealth. that work. He told us that he could hardly be expected to say how many bricks would be in the factory, or how many machines - would be installed there. The Prime Minister has told us that these mills would cost Â£117,000 when comHe pleted. Upon the Estimates now before us there is an item of Â£85,000 to complete Naval proposals. the work which was initiated by the last Administration. I do not object to that now, the works, having been be completed; but I do think, in regard to large expenditures which are anticipated, that the House has a right to know right. exactly what is the policy of the Government.",69

624,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I am going to defend both myself and an absent man. The honourable member had an opportunity of twice. replying when the honourable member for Maranoa was present.,69

626,Mr TUDOR,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I was not aware of it. I was absent from the Chamber at the time. The honourable member has stated that the Labour party speak with two voices upon the question of naval defence. I say they do not. The facts are that, in 1909, the honourable member for Parramatta, who was then Minister of Defence, brought down to fchis House an abstract motion, which he attempted to explain. I u the course of his explanation, some to members of the Labour party were smarting under the use of the "" g a g , "" which had been applied to them time after time, our and one of those members moved to "" g a g "" the present Prime Minister; but in every member of the Labour party, except three, voted against the application of the - "" gag.""

It would have gone up in bhat proportion no matter what Ministry was in power, if we are to have a safe system of defence. We should have a proper system, or none at As I said on many platforms, it surely was a mistake to have a naval policy which only provided for some vessels that could not move, and a tug had to be used to drag one of the warships about. I refer to the Cerberus at Melbourne, which I suppose was part of our Fleet. a The honourable member for Moreton said that we only took the matter up when it n a very was popular.

714,Mr FRAZER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I have not the slightest intention to evade the Speaker's this ruling for one moment, but on a Supply Bill I am entitled to mention any vote that is fo be expended in a particular l l . direction. I do not propose to debate honourable the merits of particular items, but we have a proposal to expend Â£30,000 in practically providing officers' residences and stables for their horses, r a circus and I wished to know the accommodation to be provided. The proremark in portions to which Defence expenditure is going is alarming to the last degree, and it is due to the House that the M in ister in charge should make a statement regarding this item. I am not going to these matters without having honourable members here to listen, and I ask refor a quorum. [Quorum formed.] An question raised this afternoon was as to who is to shoulder the responsibilities for the movements of the Fleet. The hon The statement made by the Minister of which was deftly shelved by the Prime Minister, seems to show distinctly be that the Government are not prepared to exercise the control they should over Fleet. The Minister of Defence is the reported to have said that the Admiral is for the efficient training of the Fleet, and that it is for him to say what the future disposition of the Fleet shall be. I do not agree with that idea, There are in because, in my opinion, the civil auexthority is responsible, and not Admiral have Patey. He may be the most estimable and competent man associated with the is control of His Majesty's ships of war, I and, presumably, he is a 'competent person, seeing that the Admiralty recomh i m ; but the policy laid down by Canthe Minister is absolutely foreign to the inclinations of the Australian people. We have never taken the attitude that the Array or Navy, or the officers of either, should control the civil autliority, bufc that the Litter should indicate how and wliere the military ancl naval resources of the country are to be used. The Prime Minister, however, sees no difficulty in such a policy, bufc I fchink, and the Leader of the Opposition takes the same view, that ' it is an interference with the civil authority which should not be permitted. I do not intend to pursue either military or naval matters any further, bu t fchere are a couple of other matters i u which I am particularly interested. One is the Perth Post Office. The Postmaster-General has, apparently, gone home. A valuable piece of land has been acquired in Perth for the purpose of erecting a post-office and other public buildings. The present post-office at Perth is probably the most congested of any in Australia. It is in an inconvenient position, aud the space available is entirely insufficient for ing with the ever-increasing volume of mail matter to be haudled there. It was indicated that the plans of the new building were ready prior to the last election, and that the work could be proceeded with afc a very early date. Nothing bas been done up to now. I want to say that this is a matter which directly concerns the Treasurer. The sooner we can get on with the building of the new post office at Perth the better, as, in a couple of years from now, it will be absolutely impossible to cope with the congestion of mail matter in the existing building. It will take a couple of years to erect the new building after a start is made. The total expenditure ou the work proposed for this year is Â£12,000, and that is Â».n altogether insufficient and insignificant amount. If the Treasurer had been alive to the needs of Perth in this matter he would have placed, not Â£12,000, but r t least Â£50,000 on the Works Estimates for this purpose. It is a matter which concerns the right honourable gentleman just as much as it concerns me. It does not now appear to concern anybody very much, and we should at least have twenty-five honourable members listeningfcowhat is to be said on this subject. [Quorum formed.] I intend to leave the Perth Post Office now to the tender mercies of the Treasurer. I hope the right honourable gentleman will have pleasure, when he goes backfcoWestern Australia, in telling the people that, in connection with an undertaking which will cosfc about"" Â£100,000, he has provided only Â£12,000 on the Works Estimates for this year.",73

721,Mr FRAZER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I wish to speak Cor a deal- few moments on the question of wireless telegraphy. I quite approve of the action of the Government in bringing out Mr . Swinburne to report on the system which is employed by the Commonwealth Government at the present time, and the system assigned to them by Mr Balsillie. I do not intend to go into details in dealing with the subject. The Commonwealth Government have a responsibility in connection with wireless telegraphy to constructa station afc Port Darwin, which will be the Australian link of the Imperial chain. The station will, in all probability, cost something like Â£50,000. Ifc will be a most important link in the chain if the idea of those who attended the late Imperial Conference is to be given effect. The progress made in connection with this station should have been stated by the Treasurer when delivering his Budget speech, but it was not. At the present time, we have simply to obtain expressions of opinion from the man in the street regarding the position of this most important station. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer will vouchsafe any information concerning it . We are asked to vote this money absolutely in the dark. Notwithstanding the assurance given by the Prime Minister last evening, the Government take up the position that they have a majority fco-nighb. They have put two members of our party oufc of the House.",74

730,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Adelaide) [12.48 .a.m.] - There is one little matter above all others which, in my opinion, it seems necessary to - emphasize. During this bate there have been references made to the initiation of the naval policy, and efforts - have 'been made today, as they were also made during the election camone paign, to create the impression first that Labour members were not in any way sponsible for the introduction of the naval policy, that they were, in fact, some them opposed to it , and that the credit, >if there he any credit, should be given to ithe honourable gentlemen of the Fusion. I am not ,at all particular as to who ceives the credit for the initiation of the nayal or military policy of the Commonhave wealth, which I sincerely hope will ever be .a party question. I am conbers was cerned, however, about the ordinary facts of the matter. I am concerned as to as whetlier members of the House shall bebe put before the electors in a reasonable and proper light. I am concerned when are made to cloud the issue and, ini circumstances, to take credit for enthe initiation of a policy, while, when it is supposed that the expenditure in relation thereto is not popular, it is that alleged that the policy is that of the other party. For instance, thea Prime Minister, assisted by the honorHenable member for Moreton, this eveningt has alleged that to him belongs that credit, and he referred in a pointed manner to the resolution that was carried - here on the 24fch November, 1909, which, the according fco him, started the naval policy ships of the Commonwealth. When, however, we find that exception is taken to the> which is increasing, which,. is to be increased Â£4,100,000 to be over and above that of last year; was when we find that that is somewhat as - distasteful to the Commonwealth, and a little objection is being taken here and there; when we fiud that honourable the members on the Ministerial side - desire some excuse for the huge expenditure, of which they are unanimously approving on this occasion, then they make - references the to what they - call the commitments of the past Administration . And if any exception be taken to the expenditure on do defence, the reply is at once icheerfully of given, "" We canuot help ourselves; the carLabour Administration committed ,us to it . "" Now, there is an obligation-on honourable gentlemen to be reasonably fair even to an opponent. There 13 an obligation to be consistent. There is an obligadetion to deal honourably and properly with the different constituencies. Surely .my honourable friends .do not propose to make a game of politics, and ito .tell the elector thing with a view to tickling his ears and securing his support, and then to act rein a precisely different direction when they have secured election. For i ffchafcbe of the case, Parliament can scarcely claim fco be a reflex of public opinion. Ifc can scarcely claim to be a place where the views - of the electors are to be given effect reto. It can scarcely claim the confidence of the electors in such circumstances. We - here a striking illustration of how not tuu-fair the conduct of honourable memat election time, and, apparently, is to remain in respect to the naval policy. Honourable gentlemen on the other side cannot have at one - and the same time the credit of initiating - that policy and relieve themselves of the unpopularity and the distastefulness of the expenditure in regard to the initiation of that policy. . If they want the credit i u the first instance, let them take the blame, if blame there be; in the second instance, personally, I do not mind if they 'they ought not to blow hot and blow - cold. They cannot with impunity claim - credit in one direction and refuse debit in the other. Let me, however, for a moment refer to the particular question brought up by the honourable member for Moreton. Because nine out of twenty-seven Labour members theu occupying - seats here voted against the resolution of jbhe Fusion Ministry in 1909, which related to a naval policy, it is now alleged 'that the Labour party were opposed to --that particular policy. Before an allegation of so sweejring and general a - character should be made, .a reasonable view of the situation might be taken, and the whole facts placed carefully 'before the electors. The motion submitted by the then Minister of Defence, 'the present Prinie Minister, on the submission of which he bases his claim to have initiate d the naval policy of the Commonwealth, is to be found in volume LTV . , page 6251, of Hansard. moved on the. 24th November, 1909, and was in these termsThat this House approves the new scheme naval defence adopted at the recent Imperial - Conference, and is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken to provide the proposed Australian Unit of the Eastern Fleet of the Empire. The honourable gentleman then saidThe Government asks the approval of House for a scheme of naval defence formulated at the recent Imperial Conference, .submits the proposal in the simplest form, ing questions of Ways and Means for further consideration.",76
731,Mr FISHER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,When ?,77
732,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"=At some future time. The responsible Minister submitted an stract motion, and frankly admitted neither he nor his colleagues, nor their supporters had given the subject Ways and Means any consideration ever. That alone would have honourable members in voting against it. To pufc the facts plainly before the conlike. stituencies, it should be told that a mere military expenditure. abstract motion was moved, Mr Roberts. the country to a huge expenditure, consideration to which had not been given by the Ministry, and the amount of which was not known. Parliament was asked fco commit the country to a policy, the cost of which Ministers had not considered, and which they said would be considered at some future time. Would any honourable member commit himself to any proposal without a reasonable knowdo, b ut ledge of what it would cost, and how the money was to be provided ? Would the honourable member for Wannon buy 5,000 sheep on such terms? In 1909 it was a case of "" open your mouth and shut your eyes; do not question in any way' what we propose, because we know nothing about it ourselves."" Yet the naval policy was so acceptable, quite apart from details, to many honourable members, that it was carried by a very large majority .",77
733,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Includin g the honourable member's leader.,77
734,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"And myself. We showed by our votes that we sincerely desired the initiation of a naval policy, which disproves the recent utterances of the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Moreton. A little later the then Minister of Defence moved the closure, refusing fco give information, and refusing to allow any honourable member to say a word for or against the proposal. That fact should be made known It was to the community before it is attempted fco create the impression that we on this side desired to prevent the initiation of a of naval policy. If , for'proposing the motion that was carried, honourable members opposite claim credit for the initiation of this policy, well and good, but now that some degree of unpopularity attaches to it , they should not be so pusillanimous as to blame the Opposition, saying, "" We the cannot help ourselves; these are the comand mitments of the Opposition."" They leavshould say, "" We initiated the policy and intend to continue it , and therefore full y approve of the expenditure that has taken place, and the further expenditure that is proposed."" To do that would abbe to show some manliness. But we have that had members opposite approving of the expenditure of millions of pounds, and of seeking to get behind the word "" commitwhatment,"" alleging that they cannot help justified, themselves. If they desired, they could check expenditure in any direction they They could reduce either naval or Old-age pensions committing and the maternity allowance are statutory commitments from which they cannot escape, but there are huge sums in the Works Estimates and in the General Estimates which they could reduce if they had the will .",77
735,Mr KENDELL,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Will the lionorable member support us?,78
736,Mr ROBEETS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"My honourable friend should put us to the test. I have seen no indication of a desire to do that. We were successful yesterday in reducing an item for expenditure on Garden Island from Â£3,000 to Â£1,000. The lionorable member for Eden-Monaro, after threatening in very blunt terms to move the reduction of certain items, particularly in regard to the Northern Territory, failed to give colour to his threats. If the honourable member for Corio feels that this expenditure is too heavy, and that he should, in some measure, retrieve the situation prior to the elections, it is open to him to move amendments and call for a division. Then the honourable member will have on record, not a mere objection or such an emphatic verbal protest as that so ludricrously indulged in by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, but something from which honourable members cannot escape, and indicating what tlieir opinions are.",78
737,Mr RODGERS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"We have you on division already, so far as a reduction concerned.",78
738,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Unles s honourable members divide the House, they must take the responsibility of approving this expenditure of Â£27,200,000. I cervoured tainly voted for the expenditure on the Eederal Capital site, and the honourable member for Wannon voted against it . The division is on record to show his stituents that the honourable member sincere in his attempts to reduce the penditure. I regarded the Federal comfche debate. pact as a matter of honour between the several States. I venture to say that i a referendum of-the people of South Austhat tralia were taken on the Federal Capital expenditure as a separate item, a large majority would not approve of it ; but recognise that there was a compact entered into, and that, after a lapse of ten years, it is reasonable to start giving effect to it . tion which is sought. I am afraid it will be some years before members will occupy Parliament House ab Canberra, and, except for the fright fully insanibary condition of the chamber we now occupy, I venture to' say honorledge able members are not sadly displeased at the prospecb of Parliamenb remaining in Melbourne. I am justified in drawing abtention to the absence of information supplied by the Ministry. I do not care about making comparisons, but I think it is safe to say that no other Ministry has submitted Estimates with such litble in formation in respecb bo the differenb ibems, or wibh so libble desire bo give information. In a few monbhs honourable members will be facing bheir consbibuenbs, quibe apart from any election, and they may be invited to give some explanation of the expenditure they are now approving; but I venture to say no honourable member on the Government side can explain in a reasonable manner the expendibure they are now approving by their votes. If M in isters at head-quarters, with all the papers before them, and all the information given them by their experts, cannot explain the expenditure in the House, and have to frankly admit their ignorance, how can honourable members explain it?",78
739,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"This is the way you are helping me, as you promised to do.",78
740,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The right honourable member is not fair in alleging that I promised him anything. one Sir JOHN FORREST - You said you is would see what you could do.,78
741,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I said I would try to find oufc what honourable members of of the Opposition wished to do. I endeato do so. I found that honourable members wished to speak.

742,Mr RODGERS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,That statement is consistent with the statement made by honourable member in regard to the hon the orable member for Eden-Monaro.,79
743,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The honourable ber for Eden-Monaro said that these Esw timates were a public scandal, and that he had never heard of Estimates being brought forward as tliese had been. remarks from a Ministerial supporter were somewhat pointed, but the Governand ment "" to o k them smiling."" What cared tion they that one of their supporters chose to speak in this way? They knew f u well, I suppose, that he was merely "" b a r k in g , "" and would take good care not to bite. They did not give hi m the information, and he has not got it yet, but he intends to support the Ministry. My experience in State and Federal polibe tics does not extend over many years, that but never previously have I known a found, Ministry to be so ignorant of the protors, posals submitted by them to Parliament as this Ministry are in the present in stance. More particularly ought this point to be emphasized since finance was the one thing on which, they prided ances themselves, when before the electors, about which they made innumerable allemembers gations in respectof the Fisher Governinstance ment. They led the people to believe that there was a total, absence of business capacity on our part, and that it rested entirely with them. They were going establish a system of "" sound "" finance, we were told, and certainly they made, at the time, a great deal of "" sound."" vagance. They were going, they said, to re-estabpower, lish responsible government, particularly in the matter of finance. How are they re-establishing it ? When we draw atcept tention to the increase in expenditure, they tamely say, "" We are committed it . "" Is that a re-establishment of anyin thing in the way of responsible governbut ment, even assuming for the moment that there was a call for its re-establishfrom ment? Is that an indication that the policy of the late Government was unis sound? The Government have to admit that, despite their much vaunted ability inthisdirection, they do not propose to makeone alteration. In no particular do we find them making the slightest move to alter, improve, or amend that which we did. The situation is the most distressing that has occurred Australian politics. We find honourable members opposite, who were never tired in - of prating abouttheir great business the ability, and that, they alone could save country from financial ruin , d.of-ng nothing now that they have completeconmemtrol. The Government can do what they ill in the matter of finance,, because they have behind them a quiet and cheerf u l support. Their supporters are preSuch pared to take anything they offerto feed out of the Ministerial hand, all that was said at pre-electime may go for nought. It was, i u fact, so much electioneering l l elap-fcrap, for which there was not a scintilla of justification- a mere appeal fco prejudice and the selfish side of human nature. Now that they havesecured political power, they show conclusively they are unable to do the things that ought, to done, and for the safe and sure reason it is not necessary to do them. They as fchey knew when before the electhat there was really nothing the matter with the financial situation, and - they have no settled plan or scheme. They were unable to point to any particular in stance of extravagance, and their utterwere of the most general character. and When repeatedly asked by honourable on fchis side to give some specific of extravagance, the inevitable result was a shuffle. We know how easily a percentage of the electorscan be frightened by reference to the expenditure of to millions of money, but honourable members opposite have signally and shamefully failed to give any specific cases of extraA n d now that they are in there is not one item of Labour expenditure to which they can take exception. As a matter of fact, in all exthe maternity allowance, they were as full y committed to the expenditure as to we on the Labour side. They declaimed certain circles against the land fcax, they do not propose to repeal it . They alleged that we were taking money the States, and so obtaining large sums to meet our expenditure; and this another instance of their remarkable inconsistency. There was no money taken fro m the States, the fact being that we merely gave statutory effect to the unanimous agreement which, the Fusion of 1909 had entered into with the States. W it h an audacity that defies, description, these one of gentlemen during the election asserted, in as I say, that we had secured many millions by depriving the States of their (revenue. Yet they have not made any alteration, and do not propose to give more money to the States. The agreement as to the 25s. per head has to stand, and the present Government are to continue to expend the millions. They declaimed agaiust the ""colossal expenditure - of the Labour Government on defence, but there is no indication in these Estimates of any reduction. On the contrary, there are many instances in which the Government, of their own volition, - deliberately propose to increase the expenditure. Could we have a more amazing or more shocking change of front tha n that shown by honourable members opposite in relation to finance ? The honourable member for Gippsland, for instance, was one who was loud in iliis utterances on this point, if the newspapers in his electorate are to ""be believed. {political leanings of those newspapers, ""but, according to the honourable member's statements, they seem to have done him a great injustice. I do not kuow why I should be brought into the matter, but - quite a number of people in Gippsland seem to think that I have a personal in terest in it , for they keep sending papers with marked reports of speeches Iby the honourable member when seeking - election as to the great expenditure in dulged in by the Eisher Administration. The honourable member has given us his - explanation, h u t I am not going into the - details, because"", apart from that explanat i o n , there is enough to prove that Labour finance was his trump card-the whip which he used to lash the electors to boiling poiut. He secured his election by declaring that were returned this vast expenditure would be curtailed; but what action has he taken during the discussion on the Estimates to have any reduction made, and thus substantiate the great stand he took when before the electors. Whilst the expenditure of Â£23,100,000 last year called forth the denunciations of the honourable member, the proposal of the present Government is to spend Â£27,200,000 during the current financial year, or no less than Â£4,100,000 more than the expenditure of last year. Does the honourable member recognise the enormity of this, in view of his electioneering utterances? Some of his electors may call' his attention to the expenditure proposed for this year, and to the fact that he is endorsing it cheerfully, makes no Request for an explanation of it , and is meekly assisting Ministers to put through votes which they admit themselves they do not understand.",79
744,Mr BENNETT,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I got the information for which I sought, and I am satisfied that the expenditure proposed cannot be reduced without doing grave injustice to the workers of Australia.",80
745,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I . feel grateful to the honourable member for his generosity to the workers. I hope that his explanation w i ll be satisfactory to his constituents. If it takes Â£27,200,000 to do justice to the workers this year, does not the honourable member see that he must have been wrong when he so bitterly declaimed against the expenditure of Â£23,100,000 in the in terests of the workers last year? Has I do not know the their number increased so suddenly, and to such an extent, that this year it is necessary that Â£4,100,000 more than was expended last year should be spent in their interests ? The honourable member's reason for supporting this expenditure is puerile.",80
746,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The honourable me news- gentleman should keephis word.,80
747,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I can make some allowance for the Treasurer. He is, no doubt, somewhat indisposed because of the reasonable criticism which has beeu offered to the Government proposals, but he does not do himself justice when he suggests that I do not keep my word. That is a wickedly incorrect statement for the right honourable gentleman to make. It does not follow that, because he is rich in worldly goods, he has any if he greater sense of honour than has any other member of the House.",80
748,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Order ! The honourable member should discuss the Bill.,80
749,Mr ROBERTS,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"I shall not pursue that matter, bub the right honourable gentleman's suggestion that I have broken my word was personally offensive. When this Bill is passed, Ministers will have the right to commence the expenditure of Â£3,266,000. At the close of the financial year, and not before, we shall know whether the money has been expended, and whether the Government are justified in the Estimates they have submitted. Judging by the fact that they are quite unable to give us any information upon the items of the schedule-, if my predictions be correct, the nnancial position ten or twelve months hence will be deplorable, and the eyes of the electors will be more full y opened to the fact that, so far as the finances of the Commonwealth are concerned, they were gulled during the recent elections. I have made only general references on the second reading of the Bill , but I felt it necessary tp place on record the fact that we are asked to consent to the expenditure of Â£3,266,000, that Ministers are trying to get this Bill through with as little discussion as possible, have admitted that they kuow little or nothing about many of the items in the schedule, have refrained from giving information desired by honourable members, and that the expenditure they propose proves conclusively that the major portion of their utterances during the recent election in relation to finance worthy,- uncalled for, aud unjustifiable. Now that they have complete control, and are in a position to give effect to their policy, they propose to increase the expenditure over that incurred last year by some millions of pounds. cerely hope that the highestanticipations of those who support this expenditure will be amply realized. I trust that the included for that purpose. money will be expended i u a direction which will meet with the approval of the electors, and thab, though the outlook appears very black, the result will be tc some extent acceptable to the general community. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. InCommittee : Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Schedule.",80
750,Mr FRAZER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Kalgoorlie) [1.48 a.m.]. - Is the Treasurer now i u a positionfcosupply us with any information regarding the exceptional expenditure which ib is proposed bo incur on the Victoria Barracks?,81
751,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"On a poinb of order, I submit that under our Standing Orders an amendment caunob be moved in regard to ibems in bhis Schedule. The Schedule musb be pub as a whole.",81
752,The CHAIRMAN,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I fchink that the honourable member was in order as far as his reference went.,81
753,Mr FRAZER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,Does the Treasurer take up the attitude that I am not in a position to question an item in this Schedule?,81
754,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,The honourable? member cannot move an amendment to it.,81
755,Mr FRAZER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"The honourable gentleman need not think, that he is now controlling the Parliament of Western Australia. I want to know what is to' be done with the Â£25,000, which it is proposed to expend upon the Victoria Barracks ?",81
756,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Swan-Trea surer) [1.50 a.m.] - The time when the honourable member should have asked for this information was when we were dealing, with the Estimates. Ib is unusual to ask these questions ab bhis sbage. However, I am prepared bo supply the information which he seeks. It is proposed to establish a Navy Office at the Victoria Barwere unracks instead of having a separate building in another part of the city. Accommodation will thus be provided afc the barracks for both Militar y and Naval Oflices.",81
757,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,And we shall thus I do sinsava the rent which we are now paying for the Naval Offices.,81
758,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"This item is I am very much in favour of the whole of the naval and military authorities being under one roof. Such a condition will tend to economy, and the Minister will be able to see the chief naval and military officers without being obliged to travel to different parts of the city. Schedule agreed to. Preamble and title agreed to. B i ll reported without amendment; report adopted.",81
759,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,"Swan-Trea surer) [1.52 a.m.] - The little storm which we have experienced has been succeeded by a calm, and I hope that any little feeling which we may have exhibited has now passed away. May I appeal to my two honourable friends opposite to give us the third reading of the Bill to-night, so that the Senate may be able to deal with it? To-day is to be devoted to private members' business, and it would be a great convenience if I were allowed to move the third reading of the Bill now in order that the Senate may get it with out delay.",81
760,Mr FRAZER,QUARANTINE AND PUBLIC,I object. House adjourned at 1.54 a.m. (Thursday).,81
