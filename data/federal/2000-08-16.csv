Adding to NA Wednesday, 16 August 2000 There are a couple of other proposals that and I would certainly like to. Firstly, at the minute statements.

Secondly, at present if for any reason adjournments that occur in this Main Committee other form of disruption occurring-there is no expired for three-minute statements or adjournments, other business. What we are proposing here-and Kelly would support it-is to give you the discretion those who have put down their names, prepared adjournment or three-minute statement, will disruption.

Therefore, about that. The thing that really appeals to me is the process to be closer to the main chamber and see that we have got some people in the visitors it is difficult for members of the public to get over Old Parliament House is the number of the House, the Senate and, hopefully, the Main accessible and easier for the public to reach-it enhance our democracy.

As with any change, I am sure there arguments. But the point is this: it is not decision.

Most members of seriously have come to use the Main interests and delving in an in-depth to them. Whereas, previously, reports from or even private members' bills had been shunted aside, they can now be dealt with in the to talk about the excellent work that they of the Main Committee, because three of the to be dealt with in some depth and I am sure dealt with issues to do with business and both the House and in this chamber. been a great bugbear with me and with many the historical situation was that the Main committee room, but the senators objected to for the House of Representatives and its new that room. Ever since then, of course, people what the Main Committee was and where it met. the point that when she first got here as a find this particular room because she would she expected the Main Committee to meet. So ever since then, and it needs to be looked This is not the main committee of the House of Representatives standing committees, joint therefore, the Main Committee means very little of Representatives and the public. NA 19200 MAIN COMMITTEE This room is properly termed the ‘second of Representatives. If the House meets for House of Representatives. If there is objection non-partisan issue to a partisan one, it is has So it is as much a house of the main chamber Committee' has always made it seem like a or a tin-pot chamber, which, of course, is not that means something, which is Second recommended-it would go some way to restoring purpose of the Main Committee has been. I note that the Main Committee in Australia country', the United Kingdom, has accepted own set-up in the House of Commons and established Westminster Hall, because it meets in Westminster country' to some is adopting some of the changes Commons, when most people would have expected evolved to the extent where the House of Commons to see. The United Kingdom has called it Westminster much either. I think ‘Second Chamber' is clearly is what it should be called. The second thing that we have suggested, which should be introduced into the Main Committee, from Sir Alastair Goodlad, who was a Tory chief about how interventions worked. It came Commons some time ago I watched interventions flow of debate. Dare I say it, but on that well-known Francis Urquhart-which some members of the but I am sure not the Chief Opposition Whip-I well that worked for the free flow of debate. One of the things lacking in the House think, is that sense of free flow with argument There are far too many set piece speeches in Committee. Interventions, of course, would piece speech. Sometimes they are quite appropriate have thought in this sort of smaller chamber flowing debate. We have suggested that interventions be that, because this is a new idea, the Main Committee are suggesting a trial of about 12 months to interventions have been useful. We do not somebody's speech willy-nilly. The way interventions a person stands up and seeks the call from that person the right to speak, they can say, friend.' If they wish to continue, they can intervention is accepted, the person speaking the honourable member think that ...' and can be a debating type question, but Wednesday, 16 August 2000 chamber', because it is a chamber of the House a division, obviously we have to return to the in this chamber to a bill, if it goes from being a to be removed to the House of Representatives. as the main chamber itself. To call it the ‘Main sideshow alley, as some members have called it, the case. I think if we actually gave it the name Chamber-and that is what the committee has some recognition of what the actual has been so successful that our ‘mother the idea of the Main Committee as part of its a chamber just like ours and called it Hall. It is good to see that the ‘mother of its former colony in its own House of it to go the other way. Australia has now is adopting our practices, which is terrific Hall, but I do not think that means very an accurate reflection of what this is and that is slightly different, is that interventions or the Second Chamber. We had a briefing whip, and he gave a very good contribution from the fact that when I was in the House of and thought that was terrific for the free television serial House of Cards, with Labor Party probably model themselves on, saw interventions in play, and I thought how of Representatives and in the Main Committee, I going back and forth and real, genuine debate. both the House of Representatives and the Main make it very difficult to continue to have a set but they are not at other times. I would it would be more appropriate to have more free introduced. True to form, we have also suggested is the right place for it to be trialled. We see whether, at the end of those12 months, those suggest that people be able to just interrupt work in the House of Commons is that the chair. If the member speaking wishes to give ‘I accept the intervention of my honourable say, ‘I don't wish to be interrupted.' If the has to ask a question. It can be put as, ‘Doesn't then such and such would happen.' Obviously, it everything has to be put as a question. NA Wednesday, 16 August 2000 We are also suggesting in this report that Second Chamber-as, hopefully, it will become-would people who are continuously intervening and speaking. But at the end of the day, the whether or not to allow an intervention. Mr Leo MCLeay-Therein lies the rub.  points out. It would not necessarily lead speaking could always stop the intervention. become quite used to the idea. As many of Representatives and in this place, often interjections and making it more interesting for the person Hopefully, that would be what would happen. have a trial for 12 months to see how it works House of Representatives. Finally, I would like to comment on the earlier, the Main Committee was never supposed committee room of the House of Representatives-a Department of the House of Representatives unable to provide all the requirements for meeting. They would like to have this committee for standing, select and party committees that the main committee room, which would have The committee therefore looked at particular Representatives. It settled on moving closer moving to an area on the upper gallery on this currently being used for offices and which the Main Committee or Second Chamber. That would also make it very easy for public access the second floor, where the Second Chamber to the security people on the first floor outside people to say, ‘I'd like to have a look at the up the stairs. It is quite a nice staircase. It view the Second Chamber, which would give make it more readily accessible to the public. It would also be located closer to members its own space with its own identity, unlike members of parliament who initially do not Many of them go to the first floor, to the room. So we have suggested that it be moved understand that that would involve some cost. accepting most of the recommendations of the prefer to see as many of the recommendations moving the location of the committee In conclusion, I would like to thank the Craig and Anna Gadzinski-for the excellent work the members of the committee-the members Gilmore and Canning-all of whom have made MAIN COMMITTEE 19201 the chairman of the Main Committee, or the have the power to deny the call to trying obviously to upset the flow of the person person speaking would have the power to decide In this intimate sort of settinglies the rub,' as the Chief Opposition Whip to the free flow of debate, because the person But, at the same time, I think most people would us know in giving speeches in the House of are quite useful in changing your speech speaking and for the people listening.

29,Mr LEO MCLEAY,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"I &RPPLWWHH The Second Chamber: enhancing read with interest all the reports on reviewing Main Committee has been reviewed to death, one seems to be able to say it should meet its the beginning there were a number of people were hoping that it would fail. But it seems for it when it originally began. I spent a fair bit of time talking the Procedure that we could have more opportunities for changed the procedures in the House to provide given us the ability to do that. Prior to the the government was to get the government's legislation committee reports to be considered. There considered. There was very little opportunity matters they wanted to raise. It was even worse if you were a chairman had spent, in some instances, years deciding on had a lot of people come as witnesses to provide find you would bid with the government for The government would give a bit of precedence in a lot of instances, used to do the government's referred to them by the government. The Public of seniority in the place as well, so they used committees did not get much chance from the Main Committee became, in a sense, the expanding opposition whip or the government whip, if go to the Leader of the House and say, ‘Look, Committee now. We now have more time to Committee has been quite a success in achieving I guess in any organisation there are times improve it and there are times you can add things should not get away from the original aim flexibility. So if there is a need to get legislation dealt with quickly, the Main Committee the Main Committee enables it to sit, in a opposition. Most importantly, a safeguard stress the government of the day had no worry built into the operations of this committee; only with the consent of the opposition. I continued acceptance of the way this committee Moncrieff being a member of the Procedure Main Committee. She was most insistent that MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 August 2000 most of the recommendations of this report can without too much controversy. Therefore, he to implement this, the third report of the have read the report of the Procedure the Main Committee ZLWKVRPHLQWHUHVWDV, the Main Committee. Sometimes I think the but seeing that each time a review is done nodeath, I guess the reviews are not harmful. At who thought that this experiment would fail and to have reached the expectations that people had Committee into proposing this originally so private members to have their say. We have for a bit more opportunity. This chamber has Main Committee's inception, the major objective of through. There was very little time for was no time for private members' business to be for ordinary backbenchers to have their say on or a member of a parliamentary committee that a report. You put a lot of your life into it and information to the committee, and you would half an hour and end with getting the report up. to the Public Works Committee because they, bidding in dealing with matters that were Accounts Committee had a reasonable level to get a bit of a better go. The ordinary standing government to debate their reports at all, so the file of the House of Representatives. The they had pressure from his or her members, could we can really put legislation into the Main do some of these things.' So I think the Main what was required of it at the beginning. you can expand it, there are times you can to it, but I think in doing those things we of the Main Committee, which is to provide some committee report or some piece of minor is the vehicle to do that. The flexibility of sense, whenever it suits the government or the which we built in for the opposition-which I about building in-is one that we should keep that is, the ability of this committee to function think that is a very important mechanism for the will operate. I remember the member for Committee at the time we were setting up the we should have those safeguards, and I think we NA Wednesday, 16 August 2000 should make sure we keep that particular safeguard. discuss the recommendations. I might just deal with the recommendations my views on those recommendations, for what do not have a problem with most of the recommendations recommendation to change the title of the given the fact that there is the confusion that and the room downstairs that no-one tends to To change the name to the Second Chamber seems think the committee has established itself Representatives. The suggestion to relocate the chamber is is as sensible as what the chairman of the committee difficulty in having the chamber here is that chamber. I say that for two reasons. One reason Chief Opposition Whip, and I am sure the because I used to have that problem when difficulty in those movements, just getting your the Main Committee were going to be relocated, relocate it as close as possible to The third recommendation, about interventions, can understand the desire for more spontaneity, unpleasantness-and that is not putting too of a tolerance for interjections in this intervention process as a method of putting becoming a way for there to be considerable wanting to make an intervention and the chair chair which sometimes is lacking. So I think do this or they can do it-that is point 1-and cannot do it.' But I also think that, if we were because while there might be an idea in people's here, I am not quite sure that that goodwill break up someone's train of thought. I do not have a problem with recommendation programming restrictions that apply to members a close look at recommendation 5 and I just there is any sort of gross misbehaviour, it whether we need to go to the extent of recommendation 5. Recommendation 6 on the surface looks pretty problem while this chamber is located a long want to sit everywhere, then my staff and, I have a considerable problem with knowing who room, there are two television cameras. No or six television cameras that would allow where. I have just been advised there are four you allowed people to sit all over the place, the next speaker was would be a problem. MAIN COMMITTEE 19203 I will reflect on that shortly when I that the committee has put forward, give you they are worth, and wish the committee well. I at all. For instance, I think the committee is a very interesting and useful one, often exists between the operations of this organ use, which is also called the Main Committee. okay to me. After six years of operation, I as the Second Chamber of the House of also a sensible one, but I do not know whether it just revealed when he spoke. I think the it is so far from the House of Representatives is the logistics problem, which I have as the Chief Government Whip has the same problem I was the Chief Government Whip. There is staff and the whips from place to place. So if I think the smart thing to do would be to the House of Representatives chamber. seems a little bit contrived to me. While I I also see that it could become a vehicle for fine a point on it. We do not seem to have much place and I can see members wanting to use the their opponent off their pace. I can also see it difficulties between members who may be because it puts a tolerance in the hands of the we ought to have a rule that says people cannot it should not be up to the chair to say, ‘You going to try it, it ought to be a very limited trial, minds that there is a bit more goodwill up would extend to someone deliberately trying to 4. I think it will remove some of the statements and adjournment speeches. I had wonder why we are doing this. If we find that is quite easy to adjourn this body. I do not know having a new standing order as suggested in good, but provides a considerable technical way away from the whips' offices. If people am sure, the Chief Government Whip's staff will is where and who is what. Currently, in this doubt if you relocated you might have four, five them to be able to see who is who and where is here-well, they are still inadequate. I think if the difficulty you would have in knowing where NA 19204 MAIN COMMITTEE It also would provide a perception problem going to move you will want to have a bigger everyone sitting on one side they will say, ‘Well, it is the government-they could not give up.' But there will also be a tendency for people some sort of a coffee club rather than people parliament works. I am all for getting away from the way to have an adversarial system in the House of and have people sitting next to each other chatting are going to have your intervention procedure, and thinks what you are saying is terrible and their best to make sure you never get your trying to intervene on you could lead to more more unpleasantness from the chair. So 6 looks have a problem with it in the end. I think recommendation 7 is a good idea, but problems that the whips find in having to run offices. If we are going to move, then we gallery, the same as we have done in the House, have access to that officials gallery. So, provisions for ancillary staff. The last recommendation is recommendation you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, enamoured of the idea of the Selection Committee my original point: this chamber has worked well whips have been able to respond to pressures material up here. I do not think there has interest in a motion to take note that has not get their matter on the Notice Paper here. That not there in the way the Selection Committee in the chamber. While I was also one of the people who got think it works very well for the House of Representatives we have in the way this forum works might a closed mind on recommendation 8, but I think with it. You could end up having some difficulty Committee came to the view that they wanted do, something could be bounced out of this think that is unlikely to happen, but In short, I think most of the report is Procedure Committee for their work.

We would say, of course, a damn about any of this and they never turn to sit around and chat, and it will look like who are taking a particular interest in the way the House of Commons works. But if we are going Representatives, then to change it for up here might become rather difficult. And if you and if the person who really does not like you disgraceful and that he or she is going to do point out, then to have them sitting next to you than unpleasantness-and then we would have all right on the surface, but I think you would I would take it further, mainly because of the this place by a bit of remote control from their should provide some facilities for an officials so that our staff, or even members' staff, can if you are going to move, there should be better 8, which I do not like at all-and I am glad because I want you to know I am not at all programming this chamber.
