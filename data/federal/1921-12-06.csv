4,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeIs it a fact that, in consequence of our mineral ores being sent abroad where they can be treated more cheaply, the Cockle, Creek and other works are likely to close down, and, if so, will he consider the advisability of putting an export duty on such ores?",19
5,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I am not aware that such is the case, but inquiry will be made, and if the position be as stated, the matter will receive full consideration. ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION . Mr ' CHANTER asked the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice- 1. Are plans of any of the redistributed boundaries of electoral divisions yet ready for inspection, objections, and suggestions by electors? 2. If so, in what States have the boundaries been decided by Commissioners? 3. How long will the plans be open for such inspection, Ac, by electors before they aTe finalized by the Commissioners and presented to Parliament?  honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. No. %. See answer to No. 1. 3. Maps will be exhibited at post-offices for inspection by electors, and public attention will be invited thereto by advertisement in the Gazette. Objections or writing' may be lodged with the Distribution Commissioners within thirty days after the advertisement in the Gazette, and the Distribution Commissioners will consider and suggestions so lodged before making their reports. It is expected that the mapB will be an exhibition in all States before the end this month. STARVATIONINRUSSI A. - COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE. - Mr LIVINGSTON asked the Prime Minister, upon notice- ' 1. Whether he has received any further information in connection with the meat stored in London? 2. Has it been arranged to transfer such meat to the starring Russian people, and make room for further Australian shipments?",19
6,Mr GROO M,Unknown,"for Mr HUGHES) Correspondence by cable is still being conducted in regard to this matter, but no arrangement has yet been arrived at. PRIOE OF SUGAR.",20
7,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeAs it is reported that many of the fruit growers in New South Wales have been left without resources owing to the poor prices received for many years, and that the increase in the price of sugar under Government control and the embargo on the importation of foreign sugar threatens the extinction of this important primary industry, will the Government give consideration to the request that sugar for jam manufacturing should be made available at the world's parity plus the import duty of £6 per ton.",20
8,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"As sugar is being made available for export purposes at a. price which, in effect, is lower than that' at which raw sugar can be imported and refined duty free, it is not seen in what manner the fruit-growers are adversely affected at the present time by the price of sugar. During the period of Government control, for the most part, sugar has been supplied at prices far below the world's parity, so that if the f r u it growers haye received poor prices, as alleged by the honourable member, it must be due to causes other than the price of sugar.

Motion (by Mr GREENE, for Mr . all objections GBOOM) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for of an Act to amend section T and repeal section 19 of the War Precautions Act Repeal Act 192o: TARIFF BOARD BILL . In Committee . (Consideration of Senate's amendments resumed from Sth December, vide page 13722): Clause 15(1) The Minister shall refer to the Board for inquiry and report the following matters:- . . . (A) Any complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the Tariff, and in particular in regard to his . . . (iv) Refusing to sell to any person goods to the value of £50 at current market rates Senate's Amendment - Leave out sub-paragraph (iv). . Mr MASSYGREENE '.(Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.6] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. It will be within the recollection of honourable members that when the Bill was in Committee in this Chamber before, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH) moved to insert the provision which the Senate has struck out. The Government opposed its insertion, because Ministers felt that it would be almost i m possible, in the practical conduct of business, to give effect to it .",20
9,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [11.8] This is a very important matter, which should not be lightly dealt with. Although the Government opposed the in sertion of the provision which the Senate has struck out, a majority of the Committee here was in favour of it . We voted for the insertion of this provision in order to protect would be purchasers of the goods of local manufacturers who - were receiving the protection of the Tariff. It was pointed out that unless some such provision were inserted, persons in a small way of business might be placed in a difficult position. The provision itself, if retained, will not requiro PAPER. a manufacturer to sell to any person; all that we have provided for is that the Minister shall refer the matter to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report. After that has been done the Minister may or may not accept the recommendation of the Board; but Parliament will have had an opportunity to learn beyond doubt whether those who are getting the advantage of the Tariff are dealing f a i and squarely with small business people. I do not agree with the Minister that in practice effect could not be given to the provision, and I should like to hear argument in support of his view. If a man in business in a small way to place a,n order worth £ 5 0 , is it to be said that he shall not have the right to obtain the goods from the manufacturer, who has the benefit of high protection? Is it to be left to the inaimfacturers to say whether they will supply the goods or not? It is probable that the manufacturer will be quite willing to supply a large firm, with an order worth thousands of pounds, and deny the advantage of direct dealing to the small man. This is leaving an easy way whereby the manufacturer may conduct his business through agents or middlemen, to the detriment of the smaller trader and the public. There is a good deal of merit in this provision, and I am surprised that the Minister (Mr . Greene) should propose to accept the amendment without giving any reason beyond the fact that he was opposed to the paragraph on a former offiasion.",20
10,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I did not wish go over the whole of the ground again. What I said on. the former occasion was that the previous paragraphs, relating to acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public, and acting in a manner which results in unnecessarily high prices being charged to the consumer for his goods, cover the whole of the ground. This paragraph iv does not really carry us any further, whereas it does create a precedent, which, I think, is unhealthy.",21
11,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It does create a precedent, and why ? Because such a provision is necessary in consequence of the way in which we know business to have been conducted. We only create precedents because of our experience; and we know that very often the trading community cannot obtain goods direct, but only through middlemen; indeed, that was the contention, raised here when this matter was previously before us. Now, when it is sought to introduce a safeguard, it is proposed to reject it . If we have a protectionist Tariff, we should protect the consumers as much as possible. If these words are omitted we are simply saying [549] to the manufacturer that he need not supply every person who applies to him for goods, but only those he prefers, possibly big wholesale firms, through which the r l y small man - will be forced to purchase.",21
12,Mr BSTJCE,Unknown,"Would not such a provision as this enable anybody, trader or anybody else, to goi to the manufacturer ?",21
13,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Yes . That is the object of it ; it is to enable any one in desires business to go to the manufacturer.,21
14,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"But would that paragraph not include everybody, whether in business or not?",21
15,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I do not care who goes to the manufacturer; if a man's family is large enough to justify him in placing an order worth £ 5 0 he ought to be able to go direct to the manufacturer.,21
16,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Would it not give anyone the right to go to the furniture manufacturer, for instance, and buy wholesale instead of retail ?",21
17,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I do not care whether it does or not; if a man can save a £5-note he ought to be in a position to do so, and not farced to buy only through certain channels. Co-operation is the spirit of the age; and honourable members here constantly talk of co-operation and the necessity foir dealing direct with cur primary producers; yet it is proposed to reject legislation which will enable a to man io do so. Our primary producers, I believe, are only too pleased, as believers in the co-operative principle, to supply any one, 'but in the case of manufactured articles, where adequate protection is given, it is proposed to compel traders and others to obtain goods, not from the manufacturer direct, but through some other channel.",21
18,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Is there anything in the paragraph to prevent the manufacturer fixing one rate for a £ 5 0 order, and another rate for a, £500 carder ?",21
19,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"No ; it only provides that a man, who requires , say, £ 5 "" 1 worth of furniture, may go direct to the manufacturer, and if the manufacturer refuses to supply him, then the Tariff Board may inquire into any complaint made on that accoiimt.",21
20,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,We rarely import fur niture. It would be better to instance steel and iron.,21
21,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Tak e any article, the fact remains that there ought to be the right to go direct to the manufacturer, and if he refuses to supply, we ought to know the reason why.",21
22,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"If the goods are manufactured here, does the matter come under the notice of the Tariff Board?",22
23,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"An y t h in g comes under the notice of the Tariff Board according to this Bill ; and this clause is to protect ihe consumer, and particularly the small storekeeper, as far as possible. It is not righ t in principle that the manufacturer shall be able to refuse the small trader, and supply the large firm; the time has arrived when that practice should be stopped.",22
24,Mr BAHFOBD,Unknown,There must be some limitation.,22
25,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"There is the limitation of £ 5 0 , the object being the prevention of monopoly, a principle we have been preaching in this House for years. Now, when an attempt is made to do something in that direction, we are told it is an innovation; but any improvement in social relations and conditions is an innovation. Once the innovation is established we have a precedent to follow; and I cannot understand the logic of the contention that we should refuse to accept this amendment, because what it provides has not been carried out in the past. We are here for the purpose of rectifying such defects; and I hope the Committee will adhere to-its former decision.",22
26,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Dampier) [11.18] I supported this provision when it was proposed in this Chamber, but it was, to my mind, somewhat vague, and I should have) liked it further considered. We have given the manufacturers of Australia high protection, and something should be done to prevent them taking undue advantage of their position under the Tariff. We are well aware that quite a number of turers refuse to sell except to wholesale bouses, and one or two large prominent retail firms in this city, which latter are thereby placed in a much better position than are their competitors. I do not wish to mention names, but I have been interviewed by several large country storekeepers, who bitterly complain that these great retail corporations may get their goods direct from the manufacturer, while retail traders in Bendigo, Sale, and other places are compelled to go to the ordinary wholesale houses, and are thereby placed at a disadvantage. If . we are to have a Tariff Board, it must have power to seek the fullest information, and dive deeply into the trading affairs of many manufacturers. I heard the other day of a most extraordinary case; I am not certain of the facts, but the allegation is to this effect: An Australian manufacturer formed a bogus company and registered it in another country. He sells the whole of his output in Australia to that company, and on behalf of that company he then sells the whole of his produce in Australia at very high profits, which are creditedi to the bogus company. I propose to deal with this matteri when the proposal for the amendment of the In come Tax Assessment Act is before us.",22
27,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I think there are some importing companies who operate on somewhat similar lines.,22
28,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I do not care whether the offender be an importer or a manufacturer; I desire to prevent the Commonwealth being defrauded of revenue. I have frequently mentioned the evasion of income tax in connection with trading in oil, and this other case which I have just mentioned emphasizes the need that exists for vesting very strong powers of investigation in the Board. I do not like Government interference with trade, but when, by a system of high Protection, 'we destroy rivalry and competition as far as possible, we must devise some means of preventing the exploitation of the people. I do not agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that a manufacturer should be compelled to sell to any person goods to the value of £ 5 0 or upwards. Such a provision would be all right in regard to furniture, but in regard to iron any and steel, it would be unfair to compel, say the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, to supply some small blacksmith or wheelmanufac- wright with a £ 5 0 parcel of assorted steel comprising perhaps seventy or eighty different items.",22
29,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,All this clause provides is that if the manufacturer refuses to sell the matter may be referred to the Board for inquiry.,22
30,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Quite so, and the Board will have no power other than to report to the Minister that the manufacturer is doing something inimical to the interests of Australia. Certainly, the mere fact of a manufacturer refusing to sell does not involve a penalty, but if a complaint is made to the Board that body may report to the Minister, who can then advise Parliament that the manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the Tariff and recommend that the duties in connection with his industry be lowered or removed. Would it not be well to amend the clause so as to require an investigation in regard to any refusal to sell to the trade generally 1",22
31,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Do not the words "" acting in restraint of trade"" embrace all that is required ? My opinion js that in some cases refusal to sell a certain quant it y of goods would constitute action in restraint of trade, whilst in other cases, such as the iron and steel industry mentioned by the honourable member, it would not. The words "" acting in restraint of trade"" have a wider meaning, and tha provision now before the Committee is in reality a limitation of them.",23
32,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The words "" acting in restraint of trade "" are wide enough if the law is carried out; legislation to deal with restraint of trade has been in existence for a long time, but the Commonwealth has no control over trade within a State. I hear of a hotel being refused supplies of beer and whisky, because it will not sell at a certain price over the counter.",23
33,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"We recognised that, whin we framed this Bill , but the penalties under this measure will not be i m posed by the Courts.",23
34,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"No , but this restraint of trade is condoned and permitted. It is alleged that millers sell flour to bakers unless bread is sold at a fixed price, and we have come to regard action of that kind on the part of various trade organizations as permissible. I read in this Chamber particulars of a similar complaint in connection with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and the Steel Association, but the M in ister made no comment upon that case; he seemed to think that the action of - which I complained was fair. I am under the impression that publio opinion in this country condones that 'sort of thing, and those engaged in trade assert that such action is justified, because through the keen rivalry that existed - before combination took place - more failures resulted, whereas now trade is more secure. I desire competition i a be maintained, and the consumer to be considered more than the manufacturer. I am certain, however, that the consumer is not receiving the consideration that he should get. furthe r consideration I agree that it is not right that any person should be able [-549]- 2 to go to a large manufacturer and purchase £ 5 0 worth of assorted goods. If that provision were inserted, complaints would result which would only give trouble to the Board. If the Minister will assure me that the words, "" acting in restraint of trade "" will be regarded by the Board as empowering it to inquire into the refusal by manufacturers, who are protected by the Tariff, to sell to the trade generally, I shall be content. The ordinary retail trader shcnid be in the same position as are the big dominating houses in the capital cities, and if a protected manufacturer refuses a reasonable order that refusal should be regarded as action in restraint of trade and reported to this Parliament.",23
35,Mr GREEHE,Unknown,"Eichmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.28] - If a manufacturer received 40 monthly orders each for £5,000, and if he gave, to one Bection of his clients a discount of 10 per cent., and to the other section a discount of only 5 per cent., that would be fair ground for a complaint to the Board that the manufacturer was acting in restraint of trade. But if a man ordering £500 worth of goods, per month, claimed the same discount as was given to a competitor who ordered £5,000 worth of goods per month, a refusal to concede that demand would not be action in restraint of trade. That would be perfectly refuse to legitimate business.",23
36,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Quite right.,23
37,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I think what was in the mind of the Committee when it agreed' to this provision was that all persons trading on the tame basis should have the same treatment, and, generally speaking, that is a fair way of conducting business. But if a small retail trader demands exactly the same terms as are given to a man whose order is ten times, or twenty times, greater he is asking for something unreasonable; business cannot be conducted on those lines.",23
38,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"This provision really does not deal with ""that aspect. It is a question, not of rebates, but of a manufacturer refusing to sell to a person.",23
39,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It might be utterly impossible for a wholesale hoxise to comply with orders of this sort. Suppo«dng, as has been suggested, that a man placed On an order for £ 5 0 worth of odd lots of steel with the Broken Hill Company, the net effect would be that, owing to the extra cost of distribution, the extra bookkeeping and other overhead charges which it is impossible to avoid in the conduct of a retail business, the company would be obliged to charge retail prices for those lots.",23
40,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Then a buyer would not bother about going to the company for such lots.,24
41,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Exactly . The whole thing seems to me to be utterly superfluous. ',24
42,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Does the Minister think that in such a case the Tariff Board would bring in a report adverse to the company ?,24
43,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The clause deals with complaints which the Minister is required .to refer to the Board for inquiry and report. He is, smongst other things, to require the Board to report on any complaint that, a manufacturer is .charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods; or acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public. a very much wider power than that which the Senate has struck out of the clause.",24
44,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"But , notwithstanding that provision, if this amendment were agreed toi, a manufacturer would still have the right to refuse to supply a small trader at current market rates.",24
45,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"If the Board found that a. manufacturer, by refusing to supply goods to any trader, was acting in restraint of trade, it would bring in a report on those lines. Then, again, if it could be shown that such a refusal resulted in '""unnecessarily high prices being charged to the consumer for his goods,"" the Tariff Board would have a perfect right to make representations to the Minister along those lines.",24
46,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,The clause deals with certain matters which must be referred by the Minister to the Tariff Board. Why should we agree to the elimination of that paragraph relating to 'a complaint that a manufacturer has refused to sell to any person goods to the value of £ 5 0 at current market rates?,24
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Why should that particular matter be singled out from a hundred others that might also be in cluded in the clause?,24
48,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Why should eliminated while the other provisions are allowed to remain ?,24
49,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Because the others are general in their application.,24
50,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,So is this provision.,24
51,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,No ; it is particular in its application.,24
52,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,The point is that a m i ll is not necessarily a distributor.,24
53,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"There is no question as to that. What I am trying to point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) is that the provision as to "" acting in restraint of trade "" might cover a refusal on the part of a manufacturer to sell to any person goods to the value of £ 5 0 at current market rates, and that in addition it covers a hundred other things.",24
54,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,But it might not touch the refusal to sell £ 5 0 worth of goods.,24
55,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It must include it if such action is in restraint of trade or results in unnecessarily high prices being charged to the public. I have endeavoured to deal with the matter as I That is see it . I do not think that we should add anything effective to the duties of the Tariff Board by restoring the provision which the Senate has struck out. On the other hand, I see in that provision the creation of difficulties which 'might prejudice the whole operation of the claus^.",24
56,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [11.35]. - As a rule I disagree with the insertion of what may be termed "" definitions "" in Bills, because they very often mean limitations ; but I do not think that objection would apply in this case. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), who was responsible for the insertion of these words in the clause, did not have only one case of the kind in mind when he proposed his amendment, and I am satisfied that the Committee, in supporting him, believed that there were very many oases of the kind. The Committee, by a very fair majority, decided that it was essential in the interests of small traders that they should be allowed to purchase direct from the manufacturers. An order for £ 5 0 worth of goods is, ordinarily speaking, not a small one. For the last quarter of a century the operations of business have been moving along parallel lines. We have had combinations of what we may term multiple shops, it be and amalgamations of businesses, running along one line and, on the other, to counteract the ill effects of such a movement on the general public, we have had co-operative effort. Between these two great movements, however, there are a host of small traders who ought to be protected. They should have the right to purchase £ 5 0 worth of goods direct from a manufacturer.  Mills, for instance?",24
57,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yes ; if I wanted, to buy £ 5 0 worth of hats, why should I not be entitled to obtain them direct from that company ?",25
58,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Bti t the honourable member could not.,25
59,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I do not think so, but as long as my credit was good I should be able to buy direct from that company, or any other manufacturing firm, goods to the value of £ 5 0 . This circumlocution in business imposes a very heavy tax on the people. The consumer has to pay the profits of the manufacturer and the wholesale merchant, and often the profits of agents in addition to the retailers' profits. How much better it would be.if a man representing, say, four or five families, could place an order for £ 5 0 worth of goods direct with the manufacturer. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) and the Minister (Mr Greene) said that a man who made large purchases from a manufacturer might be able to obtain a bigger rebate than was allowed the purchaser of a small lot. Some of the customers of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are allowed a rebate of 5 per cent., 6 per cent., or even more, but others",25
60,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Colonial Sugar Refining Company at the present time is 'conducting business as agent for the Commonwealth, and any man-irrespec tive of whether or not he is on the merchants' list-wh o purchases the requisite minimum quantity of sugar per month is entitled to the full discount, and gets it .",25
61,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I was referring to the operations of the company in pre-war days.,25
62,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,There never was a better company to deal with than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.,25
63,Mr FENTON,Unknown,C e r t a in customers of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company received larger rebates than others did.,25
64,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,That is done in every business.,25
65,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Whateve r was done in the past when the Government were not responsible for the distribution of sugar as they are today, the position now is that whoever come along, provided they buy the minimum quantity of sugar per month, get the maximum discount for the quantity purchased.",25
66,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"A f t e r all, those who complain about Government interference must recognise that certain benefits have accrued through the Government taking a hand in the distribution of sugar; because all traders, provided they buy up to a certain minimum, receive equal consideration. But. why should there be any difference between the manufacturer of clothing and the manufacturer of flour? ' I can go to any flour-miller if I am prepared to buy £50 worth of flour, and get it at current rates, whereas if I go to a woollen m ill , and desire to buy £50 worth of cloth, I am referred to Flinderslane, or somewhere else. There are all kinds of restrictions placed on trade, and in the case of woollen goods they mean increased cost to the consumer. The M in ister is perfectly safeguarded by the clause as passed in this Chamber. The Broken Hill proposition is an exaggeration. Where could we find a blacksmith foolish enough to think of going to Newcastle to buy £50 worth of assorted steel? B y the time his order was lauded in his smithy the cost would far exceed the retail price. There are, however, thousands of instances in which reasonable and proper small transactions may take place in a business-like way to the benefit of small purchasers. Certain co-operative companies are now making a start in various parts of the Commonwealth. Their dealings must necessarily be limited when they are catering for the requirements of a small community. However, they are the class of people who are likely to be protected hy the clause. The words the Senate propose to strike out are not superfluous. Even if they are so considered by the T a r if f Board they need not be put into operation. However, it is just as well to retain them so that some protection may be afforded to small buyers. The day will come when the co-operative companies will become so strong that they will be quite in dependent of Flinders-laiie or Yorkstreet, because they will be manufacturer' as well as distributers of the goods they supply to the public. When that d a j comes I shall welcome it , because it will be the means of cutting out a long list of profits that: are now made before goods reach the consumer from the manufacturer. In the meantime, however, this provision is necessary in order to protect the small traders and the individuals who desire to make purchases up to £50 in value from a manufacturer.",25
67,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Grampians) [11.48] I urge'the Committee to stand by the clause as we passed it in July last. fail to see that, any adequate reason has been advanced for leaving out the sub% paragraph to which the Senate has taken exception. We had a long debate in this Chamber on clause 15, and particularly paragraph h. the whole object of which was to see that the consumers should not be charged excessive prices for goods. Honourable members are fairly familiar with the extent to which certain people of late, not manufacturers, have obtained possession of large quantities of Australian-manufactured goods, and have in sisted on holding them for high prices against the consumers. In fact, particular sub-paragraph was inserted by the Committee to protect consumers against excessive charges that might be made in consequence of the Miction of persons who hold such stocks which they themselves have not manufactured. Although the Minister (Mr Greene) contends that the position is amply met by the three preceding sub-paragraphs, he has himself clearly shown that the consumers are not sufficiently protected by those three paragraphs in this respect. Under those paragraphs the Minister can take no action until he has received a report from the Tariff Board concerning any complaint referred to it that a manufacturer is acting in restraint of trade or is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded by the Tariff. But this paragraph iv for which we are fighting is not aimed against the manufacturer at all. What we are asking for is that the refusal of a manufacturer to sell to any person goods to the value of £50 at current market rates is one of those matters which should be referred to the Board for report. We require this sub-paragraph in to protect the manufacturer against merchant who would control the manuunnecessarily facturers' output, and who would at the same time charge the retailer much higher prices than he (the merchant) pays to manufacturer. This sub-paragraph i v will not give to any person the legal right to buy the goods which the manufacturer objects to sell to him. It would only enact that if such a refusal be made and a complaint be lodged with the M in ister it can be referred to the Board. And neither the Board nor the Minister can call upon the manufacturer to sell the particular goods to any particular person. The Board must make inquiry,, I and satisfy itself as to the reason which made the manufacturer refuse to sell, and! must consider carefullv the conditions obtaining in the trade as a whole. It is only on receipt of a recommendation from the Board that the Minister may, if he thinks fit, take action. No hardship will be inflicted on manufacturers who have sufficient reason for refusing to sell to* any person goods to the value of £50'. There are very strong reasons why this provision should be retained. One of its objects is to protect the consumers of locally made goods from . being charged unreasonably high prices as the result of this the combination or caprice of merchants.. The Minister suggested that the consumers are already amply protected by subparagraphs i . , II . , and in . of paragraph h. But I cannot agree to this. It is true that in the clause as it has been returned to us from the Senate a complaint may be made to the Board against a manufacturer who acts in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public. The Minister has said that refusal to sell to a would be purchaser of £ 5 0 worth of goods might constitute action in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public. But we want something more definite than a mere "" might. "" We desire that refusal by a protected manufacturer to sell goods to the value of £ 5 0 shall of itself be a proper subject of complaint to the Tariff Board. sub- The Minister told us also, that refusal to sell £ 5 0 worth of goods might be regarded as action tending toresult in the charging of unnecessarily high prices for goods, which is a proper subject of complaint to the Board. But, again, we want something more definite than "" m i g h t . "" For it would be extremely difficult to prove that refusal to sell £50' order worth of goods to a would be purchaser the was an act resulting in the charging of high prices. The refusal to sell £ 5 0 worth of goods should in itself be a proper subject of complaint to the the Tariff Board, on whose report the M in ister might act. Some persons may think that there is>no need for protecting the consumer in the manner proposed. Those, however, who read the published evidence of the Necessary Commodities Commission, presided over by Major-General MCCay, must have been very much startled by the evidence given regarding the result of various arrangements for the fixing of prices in preventing retailers from buying goods freely. I have already mentioned in this.Chamber a case to 'which I again draw attention, that of a shopkeeper in a country town in Victoria who was a shareholder in a local woollen factory. This retailer wished to buy the goods manufactured by the mill in which he was a shareholder, and to sell them to his fellow townspeople, among whom were other shareholders in the woollen manufacturing business-. He discovered, however, that the whole output of the mill had been bought by a merchant, and when he applied to that merchant to be supplied with goods, he was informed that the merchant did not sell these goods in Victoria, but that they could be bought in Sydney. I do not know how the matter ended, but I am under the impression that the shopkeeper actually had to buy in Sydney, and bring back to a country town in Victoria for eale there, goods which, had been manufactured in a mill in that town in which he and his fellow townsmeni were shareholders. It was to prevent such occurrences in the future that this provision was inserted, and I see no reason why the Committee should reverse its decision of July last..",26
68,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"""Wide Bay) [11.5S] - I have listened very .attentively to the arguments of the Opposition and of the Corner party in support of the retention of the provision which the Senate has struck out; but I would stress the point that if the provision is retained, monopolies will be encouraged. When a. business is started in opposition ta a well established concern, it often has not sufficient capital to carry on the operations of selling, carrying stocks in numerouscentres of the Commonwealth, storage accommodation, a, numerous staff, including travellers, financing customers, & c , in addition to manufacturing operations, aud where a firm has not the capital with which to a selling branch - opening rooms, giving credits, employing travellers and the like-it has to hand over the selling of its goods to someone else. If it could not do this, it could not go on manufacturing, and the oldestablished business, which had plenty of capital behind it , would have a monopoly. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), has told us that when the selling of goods is handed over by a manufacturer to some merchant or distributing house the public has to pay more for them, but he forgets that whether the business of selling is done by the manufacturer himself or by a merchant or other distributer, the costs of it must be charged to the consumer. During the very many years that. I have been in business, many in stances have come under my notice in which newly-established firms desirous of getting their goods distributed through? out the length and breadth of the land-, and without the means to arrange for the selling of them, have arranged with merchants to hold stocks in all of the States, and have given these merchants an agency commission for the selling of the goods. The business of sending out travellers, establishing credits, advertising in all the States, and conducting the operations of selling, often require a much larger sum of money than the manufacturer who is commencing operations is able to provide. I am afraid that the honourable member for Grampians has not considered that aspect of the case. In Victoria, it might not be difficult for a manufacturer to get his goods distributed throughout the State, but a manufacturer located in , say, Victoria, could not easily do this in Queensland or Western Australia without very considerable expense, and if small men could not hand the business of selling over to others on special terms, they would find it impossible to compete with already-established concerns. I do not think that the retention of the proposed clause would effect any saving to the public, but it would probably embarrass new enterprises, and thus give ' a monopoly to established concerns.  the past few months we have been engaged in the consideration of the Customs Tariff, which interferes with the business arrangements of the country, and establish I think that, in view of that intersale ference, the regulation of trade in the manner proposed by this clause is justified. The mere imposition of high protective duties is not all that can be done in the interests of the people of Australia. Indeed, we find that, when a Tariff wall is raised, combines of manufacturers cau shelter behind it , and filch from the consumers very large profits. The provision which the Senate has struck out is aimed at reducing costs to the consumers by cutting out middlemen. To that some honourable members seem ; to have an objection, but Parliament, having protected the local manufacturers by passing a high Tariff, should see that this protection does not allow the manufacturers to reap all the and penalize the consumers. a large town in this State in which there is a woollen mill, and I have been given to understand that that m ill , buying its raw materials in this country and manufacturing woollen goods for sale to wholesale merchants, has been able to make highly satisfactory profits; in deed, paid-up shares have been , distributed to the shareholders so that its balance-sheet may not show it to be too prosperous a These goods have been sold to middlemen, who have disposed of them at an enhanced price of exactly 100 per cent, to the men who utilize them in a retail way; and the same combination of people will doubtless ask Australia for more Protection. But our whole object is to have goods manufactured here for the use of the people of Australia; and why take such a devious and costly course to, give them the goods? The goods to which I refer were increased in price from 6s. to 24s. before they reached the consumer. That is wrong; and that is why I object to high Tariffs, which fence in combines of the kind, and enable them to filch from the people. This view must be realized by the Government, if Ministers were sincere in their pre-election speeches, for we then find the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) talking about the desirability of. conducting business without the intervention of the middleman. In the city or town where this factory is situated there are many tailors in a big way, and also soft goods retailers, but they cannot buy direct; the cloth is sent by rail to Melbourne with all the double handling, and then returned and sold at a price sufficient to return a profit of 100 per cent, or more to the great wholesale house. The clause  under consideration is a natural corollary of the Tariff. We create a Tariff to protect our manufacturers, and now we are creating a Board to protect consumers. This it is absolutely necessary to do, otherwise we shall perpetuate existing powerful and close corporations. When I was speaking to the woollen manufacturer, who gave me the information on this subject, I said to him, "" I suppose that the trading people in the town are able to buy from you direct,"" and his reply was, "" Oh, dear no, - we dare not do that!'-' adding that there were one or two wholesale houses which had advised him that benefits if he sold one roll of stuff in his own I know town they would cease to deal with him , and go to some other manufacturer. Such action is truly in restraint of trade; yet honourable members are found to vote for a high Tariff, thus assisting in this filching process. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) was quite right when he said that practically any one can buy a ton of flour from a miller. The primary producers have to throw their goods into the open market, but, concern. in the case of the manufacturer, middlemen are allowed to make fabulous wealth out of the consumers. That is not right ; and if we legislate for the protection of trade and industr}', as we do in the case of a Tariff-if we legislate to protect one section of the community-w e must protect all. I oppose the amendment made by the Senate.",27
69,Mr BELL,Unknown,"Darwin) [12.10] - When this particular provision was placed in the Bill orginally on the motion of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), I supported it . I have listened very caref u l ly to the arguments of those opposed to it here, and have, read those adduced in another place, and I find no reason to reverse my vote on that occasion. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that this paragraph of the clause has a good deal of merit in it . The Minister (Mr Greene) has given reasons why it is not practicable, and he is supported by other honourable members in that view, but they are evidently opposed to the principle, and therefore advance arguments why it shoiuld not be included in the Bill .",28
70,Mr GREENE,Unknown,What principle does the honourable member find in this provision? That is what I cannot fathom.,28
71,Mr BELL,Unknown,The principle is that those who are protected by the T a r i ff shall not have the right to fleece the public by dealing in a way that is to their own. interests solely.,28
72,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Is that not covered by the paragraphs which deal with action i u restraint of trade, and charging unnecessarily high prices?",29
73,Mr BELL,Unknown,"I admit that it may be covered by the clause, which allows the Tariff Board to report in case of any manufacturer acting in such a way. At the same time it would be very wise for us to let the Board know that we expect it to report where a manufacturer is selling, through his own agencies in particular, for his own benefit or for the benefit of a combination, to the detriment of other honest traders. manufacturers and large traders who arc doing their utmost to crush co-operative companies. I know from what I have been told on the best of authority that certain co-operative concerns find great difficulty in making purchases from certain large trading companies. These cooperative societies have been told by the -"".ommercial travellers of the large companies that they cannot take orders, because, if they do, other traders in the district will do no further business with them. Obviously the intention is to break up the co-operative companies.",29
74,Mr CORSER,Unknown,That is not the case in Queensland.,29
75,Mr BELL,Unknown,"The honourable member may not know of auy instances, but I do not think he can possibly have sufficionti knowledge of the trading transactions of Australia to be able to say there are none at - all.",29
76,Mr CORSER,Unknown,I think I have.,29
77,Mr BELL,Unknown,"D u r in g my election paign, I said that I was perfectly willin g to give reasonable protection to all in dustries in the Commonwealth, but, at the same time, the consumer must also he protected; and this Bill appears to me one way in which the latter protection can be afforded. The examples given by the honourable member for Swan (Prowse) in reference to the woollen in dustry, we have heard on several occasions, aud I have no doubt that they are perfectly correct. It is unreasonable that a woollen manufacturer should he compelled to sell to any man in business, any trader, who wishes 'to place an order. I promised to support protection for the saw-millers, if supplied with all the in formation necessary to show me that protection was necessary, and I pointed out that it was the duty of the millers to 8u PP l y local requirements. It had been reported to me on several occasions that builders in the State to which I am referring, could not obtain supplies direct from the millers, because the timber was all sent to one distributing agency; and I told the millers that if such was the case I certainly would not support any assistance to them by means of the Tariff. The first duty of the miller or manufacturer is tp supply local requirements; and if we find that they do not do so the Tariff Board should have the There aro right to report on any complaints of the kind. The great difficulty is that our only power, after a complaint has been substantiated, is to withdraw the Protection ; and, obviously, the result of such action may be exceedingly unsatisfactory, inasmuch as all the manufacturers in Australia will be penalized because one of them is guilty of acting in restraint of trade. That is a weakness i u the Bill , but I think the provision now under consideration will be very useful; at any rate, I cannot see howi t can be detrimental. The Tariff Board will make full inquiry, and report to the Minister, aud then the , Minister will report ' to Parliament, which is the only body which can take action, and it .is not likelv to be unfair or biased.",29
78,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) |12.19] - There is much merit in the paragraph that the Senate proposes shall be deleted, though, of course, I see difficam- culties_ m the way of carrying it into effect But this is a day of experiment, and I do not see why we should not try . One difficulty is presented by the woollen mills. For years the tailors of Australia have been endeavouring to get their supplies direct. I agree that it would be unfair to ask the mill to sell to anyMr body a £ 5 0 parcel of assorted woollens.; the manufacturer could not do that at the wholesale price or anything like it . But there would be no difficulty in the way of his supplying a man with £ 5 0 worth of one particular make cf blue twill, or one particular pattern of tweed. Such an order would be equivalent to over 100 yards of material.  size is well within the means of most of our tailors.",29
79,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Exactly , but the difficulty is this: If I went to a woollen mill and ordered £ 5 0 worth of a particular cloth the miller would say that he had none to spare, because all be produced was purchased by certain firms in Flinders-lane. And he could prove that that was so. We could not punish him for not selling £ 5 0 worth of goods to a man if he could prove tihat for some years he had been selling the whole of his output to somebody else. During the war we did not get the f f l l l advantage that we should have got from our local woollen mills, because the wholesale houses bought the whole output and put up the price to something like a parity w i fh that of imported material. However, these difficulties should not deter us from endeavouring to prevent the further robbing of the consumer through the middleman. It might be necessary to support this sub-clause' with a provision instructing the Board to use common sense in its administration. During its operation, the Board will gain much experience and will be able to report to the Minister the true position of tihe protected industries, and, guided by the knowledge thus gained, we shall be able to fight the middleman effectively in the future, if we cannot do it now. ' Of course, it would be absurd to suggest that anybody should be able to go to a manufacturer and ask for £ 5 0 worth of a locomotive that costs £1,000, or that a blacksmith should be able to order from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company £ 5 0 worth of assorted steel. Such an order could not be executed. We are told that this provision will have no effect. admit that there is a difficulty in the operation of new legislation, but this is the one provision in the Bill that attempts to deal with the operations of the middleman. It may not be effective; it may require to be supplemented by other powers, but so far it is the only check that we are attempting. When I fight for the imposition of heavy duties I do so in the interests of the people and uot in order that the manufacturer may make abnormal profits.",30
80,Mr CORSER,Unknown,This provision will prejudice the small manufacturer.,30
81,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"It will protect the manufacturers generally. I recall to the Committee a case that happened in 1908. A small hat manufacturer was blackballed by the wholesale trade because he sold direct to one of the drapers, and he had to go out of business. If this subclause is retained it will prevent warehouses from blackballing manufacturers when they do sell direct to the retailers. The provision will have that virtue, if no other.  of some benefit to the community in future.",30
82,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Exactly . Whilst I fought the honourable members of the Country party in regard to tihe imposition of duties, I agree with them that the people should not be robbed by the local manufacturer. We should show that, whilst we impose heavy duties, we are desirous of preventing the consumer from being charged unduiy'high prices. At the present time the manufacturer sells to the wthblesaler, the wholesaler to the retailer, and the retailer to the public. Unfortunately, there are, also, many semi-wholesalers of varying degrees whose operations tend to increase the price of the articles they handle. If this provision is not likely to be effective, the Ministry should have, in the interests of protected industries, endeavoured to d r a ft a sub-clause that would be effective. Until we make somelaw of this kind, our Tariff cannot be regarded as scientific, and we shall not be able to get from the public whole-hearted support for local manufacturers.",30
83,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [12.28] - Quite recently, a fact was brought to my notice which goes far to 1 substantiate what has been said by those who are advocating the retention of this I sub-clause. During the war, the whole of the output of two of the Tasmanian mills was bought by a Sydney firm. One miller was turnin g out a particular kind of rough cloth for overcoats which were suitable for the climate of Victoria and Tasmania. But, through the sale of the whole output to a Sydney firm, no tailor in Tasmania could get a yard of that materialwithout sending to Sydney for it and paying a double profit and double freight. Facts like these make one pause.",30
84,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,They make men Free Traders.,30
85,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I am glad that, slowly but surely, honourable members are beginning to rebel against high Tariffs which, in conjunction with - combines, make these things possible. ""When one large firm swoops down and takes the whole of the output - of a mill, an injustice' is both to the consumer and to competitors in the trade. The line of cloth to which I refer was the only one of the kind made in Australia and, owing to the shipping shortage, it was practically i m possible to get any material from Europe. As a result, we had the exceedingly unpleasant and disastrous experience of people in the State in which'' it was manufactured not being able to buy the cloth except by sending to Sydney and - purchasing it at a price which gave the middleman an abnormal profit. I did not vote for this sub-clause when the Bill was previously before the Committee, but, in view of circumstances which have come to my knowledge since, I shall vote for its retention.. . Mr Bruce (Flinders) [12.30] The question with which the Committee is concerned is whether or not it is right that anybody, without any 'limitation whatsoever, should be able to go to a manufacturer and ask for £ 5 0 worth o*f goods at current prices. The provision in this Bill , if it means anything is designed to safeguard the public against the manufacturer, who is protected by the Tariff, charging exorbitant prices. This provision can have no other bearing, but I cannot see that it will help in the least to achieve what the Committee has in mind. The mere fact of a manufacturer refusing toi supply one person, or a number of persons, with £50 worth of goods, will not establish a charge that he is taking undue advantage of the Tariff and exploiting 'the public. We have to remember, also, that this provision might lead almost to a persecution of any manufacturer to whom a certain section of the people were desirous of causing trouble. It would be impossible for ninety-nine out of a hundred manufacturers to supply - £ 5 0 orders, but as soon as one man refused to supply, an appeal could be made to the Tariff Board. That appeal might, in the end, fail, but, in the meantime, the manufacturer might have been harassed to such an extent as to be unable to carry on his business. As a means of protecting the public, the clause will be useless. But I wish to direct my remarks particularly to a wider - question that has been opened up. The proposal has been made that anybody should be able to trade direct with manufacturers, and, to my surprise, it has received hearty support done from honourable members of the Country party. If the doors of the factory were open to anybody, that would simply mean that the goods would be acquired from the factories by the big retailers in stead of by the big wholesalers. ""That is all the change that that provision would achieve.",30
86,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"That would be a, big advance.",31
87,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I will endeavour to prove to the honourable member that it would not be an advance. All the big retailers are situated in the cities or big towns. They will mop up the whole of the present output of the factories, and, apparently, having regard to the rate at which towns grow, they will be able to continue to take the whole output as the mills grow. The result will be that all Australian manufactured goods will go to the big retailers in the big centres, and country districts will get practically nothing beyond the small output of their own local industries. That will not be a good state of affairs. We have to recogat all, nise the fact that in all big manufacturing countries the makers of a particular class of goods concentrate in one place, as far as possible. During the war, the Fair Prices Commission heard a complaint by several of the large retailers in Melbourne that they could not order goods direct from the manufacturers. In certain .cases, however, they were getting the goods direct from the factory. The position was this: Goods were sold at the same price to the retailers in the big cities and to the wholesale merchants. The latter added their own profit when selling to the small retailer in the country- a profit which many people thought exorbitant. Yet after passing through the hands of the wholesale merchants and carrying their profits, those goods could be bought just as cheaply in the country towns as in the big city stores,. ",31
88,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Yes ; but the point I wish to make is that by restoring this provision honourable members will not benefit the very people whom they seek to help. Instead of doing so, they will place the business in the hands of the big retailer who deals only with the city public instead of in the hands of the wholes>ale merchant who, with all his sins, covers every little town and district throughout Australia. We are asked why the small man is not able to deal direct with the manufacturer. Even if the mills had a big enough output to enable that to be done, and could supply all these people, the unfortunate man situated somewhere in the north of Queensland, or, say, in some small town in Western Australia, would not be able to attend at the place of manufacture, and the manufacturer would not bo able to reach him with his goods except at a. prohibitive cost.",31
89,Mr WEST,Unknown,The manufacturer would do the same as the honourable member's firm does. There are any number of travellers who sell more than one line.,32
90,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I appreciate the honourable member's point, that the manufacturers would do exactly what the big wholesale merchants are now doing. We have to remember, however, that the wholesale merchant does not send out travellers with only one line. He sells a hundred different lines, and therefore his costs of distribution are very much lower than are those of a manufacturer.",32
91,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,The honourable member means to say that a manufacturer would have only one line to send out.,32
92,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Yes , and unlessthe country trader could go to the manufacturer he would be unable to buy at all, because the manufacturer's cost of offering his goods in the different country towns would be almost prohibitive.",32
93,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,Wherea s the wholesale houses deal in many lines.,32
94,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Yes .  traders know what lines a manufacturer dealt in , and do business with him by post ?",32
95,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Any one who has a knowledge of trading conditions will realise that that would be impossible from the point of view of the successful trader. A trader, we will assume, knows - that a manufacturer produces a certain line of goods-h e is familiar with that line-and he therefore orders it . Subsequently, a riva l manufacturer might bring out something infinitely better, but the unfortunate man in the country would be bound to take the old known line, while the man on the spot would be doing very much better. I am not pleading the cause of the wholesaler. I have every sympathy with the desire of those who favour the retention of this provision, and who say that wholesalers should not be allowed to make excessive profits and rob the country. I quite agree that that should not be allowed, but the point I am making is that honourable members will not help those in whose interest they are opposing the Senate's amendment, by cutting out the big merer! ant. By doing so they will either leave the market to the big retailer or place the country trader in the unfortunate position that unless he can get all his goods from the manufacturer on the spot no one w i ll distribute them, to him . Another consideration that must not be lost sight of is that the difficulties of small traders-peopl e who are struggling and whose credit is doubtful-woul d be increased a thousand fold if their sole source of supply were that of the manufacturer alone.' A manufacturer has not the capital or the organization to enable him to handle the weak man and to give him the financial support necessary to keep him going and so to give him 'a chance to make good. These are some of the facts which honourable members should keep in mind. They must have regard to the interests of the country storekeeper as opposed to the city retailer, and recognise that it would be suicidal to compel him to trade direct with the manufacturer. Such a policy would have the most disastrous effect on every storekeeper who is at any distance from the main manufacturing centres of Australia.",32
96,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [12.40] - I should not have taken part in this discussion but for the observations made by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. I have to confess that I lack his imaginative qualities, but I shall endeavour to show that his statements are entirely at variance with the facts, and that he is a worthy representative of the wholesale houses. The object of the provision which the Senate has rejected and which we seek now to restore is to permit a small man in business to obtain his goods direct from the manufacturer, l f there is one question more than another that demands the attention of the best brains of the country it is that of the distribution of goods from the manufacturer to the consumer.",32
97,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I hope the honourable member is not going to discuss this question at length. We want to get on.,33
98,Mr WEST,Unknown,"This is a most important question involving, as it does, the principle of the New Protection. A notice of motion relating to the policy .of the New Protection was on the business-paper submitted to the last conference of the Country party that was held in Perth. This provision would enable a country storekeeper to obtain £ 5 0 or £ 6 0 worth of goods direct from a manufacturer. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Bruce) has endeavoured to show that the effect of it would be to injure the country business man. When in Melbourne I put up at the Commercial Travellers' Club, and from week to week I see the Association's journal. In its last issue I saw several advertisements in which travellers going to the north or to the north-west were invited to take up certain lines which reputable firms desired to place on the market. It was announced further that travellers taking up these lines would receive a small salary and commission. Every one knows that many travellers representing some of the larger houses in our cities, owing to the comparatively small salary they receive, have to undertake commissions. Such men would take manufacurers' lines just as they now accept commissions from various wholesale firms. I find it impossible to obtain in Sydney a hat made in Australia. I am told that the retailers there do not sell them, for the reason that they object to being called on to pay the profits as between the manufacturers and the wholesale houses. They are not able to buy direct from the manufacturer, and they have no wish to deal fro m wholesale houses who, in addition to representing the local manufacturers, are also im porters. Then, again, if a man seeks to obtain in a retail shop a piece of class Australian tweed he has to wait until the shopkeeper obtains patterns from the wholesale houses, because, as a rule, only the poorer qualities and designs are kept in stock. That is common to most Sydney retail houses. I object to the output of any factory being monopolized by any one firm. Quite recently the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) attended here attired in a £ 5 suit made of Australian tweed. The man who made that suit for him claimed that he had the whole of the output .of a New South Wales factory which produces the best tweed in Australia. If we impose protective duties in order to encourage Australian manufacturers, then the people who have to pay those duties should be able to purchase direct from those manufacturers. It is true, as the honourable member for Flinders has said, that many country traders are well known to the wholesale houses, but not to the manufacturers. That disability, however, would soon be removed. We are very far behind in the matter of transport and distribution. In Germany a manufacturer wiio is. overstocked and has almost exhausted his overdraft has not to shut down u n t i l he can dispose of some of his goods, because he can get an advance on his stock. That system has been introduced so as to insure continuity of employment. Proprietors do not care tolose the services of employees who are well acquainted with their businesses. The paragraph under discussion will affect large city firms, who, nowadays, look to the country for their business more than to the cities, where the facilities for indenting have, been so much extended of recent years that many small firms have been able to import their own goods, instead of depending for their supplies on the larger importing establishments. Nevertheless, small country firms would benefit by the sub-paragraph which the Senate seeks to omit, and for that reason honourable members of the Country party should oppose the Minister's proposal. As no doubt the gentlemen in the Senate are friends of the controllers of wholesale houses, we can easily understand how pressure has been brought to bear upon them to oppose the wishes of this Committee. We ought to give people the opportunity of buying direct from manufacturers without the intervention of firstmiddlemen. A few months ago I had the opportunity of inspecting woollen mills at Geelong, and I saw the magnificent cloth which had been produced. The wholesale people would have brought some charge against me if I had bought any of it direct; but through the intervention of a third party I secured sufficient material for an overcoat, which I was proud to display, for the benefit of the Free Traders, in the streets of Sydney. Bur I could not get the cloth without the in tervention of a third party. There should be no need for any such intervention. and I hope that we shall r e t a in - the sub-paragraph, and so enable the small buyer to approach the m a n u f a c t u r e r direct, and effect his l i m it e d purchase.",33

I shall oppose the motion. Atkinson, L .",34

105,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"If the honourable member will look at clauses 23, 24, and 25 Best, he will see that the effect of the penalties Burchell, R. J. provided for is cumulative, and, in the Chapman, Austin circumstances, we are willing to accept Foley, the Senate's reductions.",35

108,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Barrier ) [ 2 . 5 1 ] oppose this amendment for the same reason that I opposed the amendment in clause 23. Whatever argument there might have been in favour of reducing the penalty in the first instance, there is none in favour of reducing it for a second offence. What is the use of pretending that this Board is anything but a farce, if we render it ineffective and useless so far as regards any benefit to the public, by telling offenders that they have practically a free hand to refuse to produce their books and to behave as they think fit? For the first offence the fine is only £250, and it may mean thousands to a person to refuse to produce his books. Then, for a glaring flouting of the Board, and, consequently, of this Parliament and Government, we have the penalty proposed by the Senate. It reminds me very much of legislation in pome of the States, where a poor devil of a grocer is fined for adding a halfpenny ov a penny to his price, while the large and rich trader is allowed to go free. If a person is sentenced to imprisonment under this Bill , I suppose it will not be the managing director, but some poor devil of a clerk or official, who, like the fraol editors of certain newspapers, are kept ou the premises for that purpose. I Lope the Committee' will not allow any reduction in the penalty, otherwise we ""might as well tear the whole Bill up and put it in the waste-paper basket. a measure will he put in operation only against the "" small f r y , "" whilst the ""great captains of industry,"" the people who constitute themselves the inner circle, and pull the strings in the commercial iind manufacturing l if e of the country, will go free. From time to time we shall see some poor little suburban grocer being haled up only to vindicate the majesty of the law. . Mr Charlton (Hunter) [ 2 . 5 6 ] - I was prepared to accept the vote ou the amendment in clause 23 as a test, but quite a different position arises under the present clause. I agree with the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) that to accept this amendment will permit a person who deliberately flouts this legislation to get off with a fine of £500, - the Senate having so reduced the maximum penalty of £1,000. I think that a man who deliberately flouts this law - I should be imprisoned without the option of a fine.",36
109,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The honourable member forgets that every - offence is a separate offence; that is to say, as soon as one prosecution is over, another can be in stituted, and imprisonment will follow.",36
110,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The two preceding clauses provide a penalty for failin g to attend or produce documents, and for refusing to be sworn or to give evidence, and the clause before us refers to persons who, after having been fined, continue to disobey the Court; yet it is proposed to let such persons escape with a fine.",36
111,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The honourable member overlooks the first part of clause 25, which saysWhere any person has on any day done or omitted to do something, and his act or omission amounts to an offence against either of the last two preceding sections, and does or omits to do the 3ame thing at any meeting of the Board held on some other day, each such act ""or omission shall be a separate offence.",36

114,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"We are now dealing with a recalcitrant witness, who refuses to obey the Board. Such Mr MCWILLIAMS - It might pay him well to refuse.",36

117,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [3.0] - The Acts Interpretation Act provides that whenever a penalty is mentioned in a Commonwealth Statute it shall mean the maximum penalty. Therefore it is always within the power of the Court to impose whatever lesser penalty is thought proper. There may be cases which will warrant the maximum penalty which this Committee inserted in the clause now before us, but if we agree to the alteration made by the Senate the Court will not have power to impose that punishment. It will be a serious thing if the law can bo broken without risk of a severe penalty. For that reason, I hope that the Committee will adhere to the higher penalty provided in the Bill when it left this Chamber. In my opinion, there will be plenty of offences that will call for the most severe penalty; otherwise it may pay a merchant or manufacturer to defy the law ancl pay the cash penalty. A f t e r all, commercial morality is no greater than that of the.burglar.",37
118,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Balaclava) [ 3 . 3 ] - In m y judgment, the Senate has been wiser in considering this matter than this House was. The Senate has looked at the matter of penalties as many members of this Chamber desired to look at it when the measure was originally before us in Committee; and I think it has recognised, as we all must, that severe penalties frequently defeat themselves. Mv. MAXWELL - This is not penalty.",37
119,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I admit that a severe fixed penalty is more likely than another to defeat itself; but when we are entering upon an experiment of this kind, when we are establishing a new tribunal, of the personnel of which we know nothing, and the scope of whose operations we cannot foresee, it is wise to fix reasonable penalties, so long as we visit frequent infractions of the law with imprisonment when they are clearly deliberate. We are more likely to get the willin g attendance of witnesses, and f r a n k evidence, if Ave pose reasonable penalties than if we fix Draconian penalties, thus frightening witnesses and leading to the non-conviction of many men who otherwise would be punished.",37
120,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Barrier) [ 3 . 6 ] - It is rather refreshing to hear the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) putting up a plea for those pcojde who try to defeat the law.,37
121,Mr WATT,Unknown,I adopted the same attitude when this Bill was before the Committee on a previous occasion.,37
122,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,I never heard the honourable member urging less drastic penalties when dealing with the penal clauses in an Arbitration Bill .,37

I do not desire the honourable member to wander away from the law, and hold up the. enacti m - ments of this Parliament to ridicule by reducing the penalties in such a way that they may be regarded by the commercial section of the community as an invitation to defy the Tribunal we are creating.

134,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Yes ; and if the plea is successfully raised that only a technical breach of the law has been committed, not even imprisonment until the rising of the Court will be ordered.

It seems that if in every case punishment by prisonment were mandatory, then, unless the evidence in support of the prosecumized tion were of the clearest possible kind, the Court would probably hesitate to conoffence ? vict. This is one of those cases in which the Court should be allowed to exercise its discretion. Where the Court had any doubt whatever it might be prepared to impose only a monetary penalty, but if 'imprisonment were mandatory, the Court in some circumstances might not convict. be prosecuted. The whole object of the clause, and the penalties for which it provides, is the proenforcing tection of employees, and I am inclined to think that the honourable member's position, if agreed to, would have opposite effect.

If , because of the evidence given by him before the Board he is dismissed, then the employer should be liable to prosecution without any time limitaAs it is, if this amendment be agreed to, an employer will combe free to victimize an employee as long as he does so in such a way that it is i m possible for the employee to take proceedings within three months from the date think of the commission of the offence.",39

160,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [3.27] - On the motion for the second reading of this Bill . I said that it was worthless. I am quite in agreement with the views expressed by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), but I do not think we need occupy much time in ' discussing this question, for the reason that the Bill is not designed to serve any good purpose. It merely provides for the resurrection of the Inter-State Commission. It proposes to find billets at from £1,000 to £1,400 a year for three gentlemen who from time to time will institute inquiries, from which nothing will come. I do not think any one will be prosecuted. If we are to take the Bill seriously, then the amendment made by the Senate is certainly outrageous. An employee is liable to a fine and imprisonment if he fails to attend before the Board when ordered to do so. If he obeys the law, and because of evidence which he gives before the Board, is dismissed by his employer, the Government, which has compelled him to give evidence, should initiate the prosecution against the employer. Under this amendment an employee who has been victimized must himself initiate a prosecution, and do so within three months of his dismissal. If the Ministry has any sense of fair play it will see to it that the Government which, under pain of fine and imprisonment, compels a man when called upon to do so to give evidence before the Board, shall itself initiate the prosecution of the employer who dismisses that man because of evidence so given.

161,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.35] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. The Senate has asked us to insert a new clause limiting the operation of the measure to a period cf two years, and I propose to agree to the limitation, because it will be within the power of Parliament to re-enact the measure if the Tariff Board proves its usefulness in the interim. On the whole I think it is the best course to follow.",40
162,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Balaclava) [ 3 . 3 6 ] - I think that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) is making a blunder, because the proposed limitation of the period will clearly, affect the personnel of his Board. We are not likely to get men of the business world, of eminence, probity, and wide knowledge, to forfei t their business connexions and sign up for two years only. Consequently, we shall get men of an inferior type on the Tariff Board. The more we study the question the more we become convinced that everything depends on the character of the men appointed; and by character 1 do not mean merely a man's reputation for integrity, I mean also his knowledge, his experience, his judgment, and his vigilance. I ' do not think that we can expect to get anything but "" fetch-and-carry "" ,men to apply for a two years' billet. Of course, I exempt officers who are likely to be appointed from the Public Service, because they, in response to the wishes of their Minister or the Government, are not likely to object to signing up for service on the Tariff Board for two years, but, clearly, the outside men appointed would be of an inferior kind.",40
163,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Dampier) [3.3S] - I hope that the motion moved by' the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) will be agreed to. Otherwise the members of the Board would probably be appointed for five years if they are to be men of the character that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) would like to see chosen. There is not the slightest doubt that if the Tariff Board does good and useful work Parliament will be bound to re-enact the measure. On the other haud, if the Board proves a failure, the sooner we can get rid of it the better; no one will be anxious to continue the existence of a useless and expensive body. If the Senate's amendment is agreed to, and the Board is appointed for two years only, its members will know that they are on their mettle and that they will be judged by Parliament on their two years' work. I am sure that we shall get better work from them under the circumstances and results that will justify the re-enactment of the measure at the end of two years.",41
164,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Nepean) [ 3 . 3 9 ] - If we are anxious to k ill this proposed Tariff Board at its very inception, the best thing we can do is to agree to this amendment, because the members of the Board will not have a fair show. As the honourable 'member for Balaclava (Mr . Watt) has suggested we will not get good business men to throw up their business connexions for a two years' appointment. We might just as well throw the Bill aside at once as have a second-rate Board doing second-rate work. If we do not get a first class Board, I am afraid we will have a repetition of the War Service Homes trouble.",41
165,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [3.40] - I do not agree with the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) . I think we can get the services df very good men, even for two months, and eet them cheaply. In fact, Mr Ashworth or Mr Knight, of the Taxpayers Association, would be only tooi pleased to take on the job for £200 a year. We have had ample evidence in the newspapers for a long time past that there are a lot of cheap men outside who want low-salaried positions in the Commonwealth Service. I shall vote for the motion to provide an opportunity for them,",41
166,Mr FOLEY,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [ 3 . 4 1 ] - I trust that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) will not press his motion. I differ fro m the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) . He says that if we limit the operation of the Act to a period cf two years we shall not get the services of the best brainy business men, that they will not be too anxious to throw up their business connexions and accept these appointments; and we have just been discussing another clause of the Bill which limits the total expenditure on the administration of the* Act to £4,000 per annum, for which amount we would not be likely to get the services of three very good men.",41
167,Mr GEEENE,Unknown,But the Committee did not agree to that limitation.,41

170,Mr FOLEY,Unknown,"It is wise to limi t the operation of the Act for two years for the present. If we were studying the personnel cf a Board already i u existence there might be something in the argument advanced by the honourable member for Balaclava, but this Board is about to start out on an. unknown path. There will be a great deal of preparatory work to be done, but that should not take too long if it is taken in hand by men who understand the operation of the Tariff and the effect it is likely to have. We are to have a new Board, consisting of new men, and at the end of two years, if the amendment is agreed to, we shall have an opportunity of reviewing the work it has done, and in the light of the benefit it has conferred on the community. It will then be our duty to consider whether the period of appointment should be lengthened. Everything will depend upon the result of the work of the Board during the previous two years.",41

In fact, it will simply be a Board to enable these officials to secure higher positions, it will create greater expense, at a time will be paid so much per sitting. when every one is crying out for economy. We do not know what this Board will grow to at the end of two years. Instead of doing away with it , this Parliament will probably be asked to add to it I believe in these questions being dealt with by the experienced officers of Customs Department and the Minister.

This motion authorizes the Government to proceed with the work of constructing the main outfall sewer to Western Creek. gether. This matter was before the Public Works Committee in 1915, and the Committee approved of the scheme, as shown by their summarized recommendations(1) That the sewage be removed from city by a water-borne system in gravitation sewers to a point at Western Creek, about three miles from the city boundary. (2) That works be constructed at Western Creek to deal with the sewage by the efficient system available at the time struction of such work becomes necessary, as "" relations between the Commonwealth the Government of the State of New South Wales, respecting the water of the Murrumconstruction bidgee Eiver, demand that the utmost care taken in treating sewage and disposing of the port, sayseffluent so that there shall be no possible pollution of the waters of that river."" (3) That approximately three miles of main gravitation sewer from the city boundary to Western Creek be constructed at a (then) estimated cost of £75,000. The Public Works Committee took evidence, and they presented their report to this House on 14th A p r i l , 1915; and, under the provisions of the Public tVorks Act, it is necessary to pass a resolution to the effect that it is expedient to proceed with the work. As a matter of fact, a considerable amount of work has already been done, involving an expenditure of, roughly speaking, £35,000: Owing to the war, however, all work at the Federal Capital was suspended; and in the meantime an Advisory Committee was appointed and asked to report on a scheme for the progressive construction and occupation of the city. That Advisory Committee, of course, had to inquire and report on the whole of the engineering services, and a fundamental work was considered to he the construction of the main outfall sewer. Included in the o personnel of the Committee was Mr de Burgh, Chief Engineer for Water Supply and Sewerage in the service of the New South Wales Government, who is re- I garded as one of the most capable and competent men in Australia to advise on sewerage and water supply. Recently, that gentleman went into the matter very followthoroughly, and he has reported in favour of the scheme I am now proposing to the House. The cost of the completion of this outfall sewer will be higher than was estimated in 1915, owing to the increased cost of labour and material, and it is now estimated at about £50,000.",44

I was at the Federal Capital site quite recently, and, like other visiting members, I was anxious to see whether any improvements could be made on similar works carried out elsewhere. In the case of the sewer channels I know that shafts are sunk and connected underground by drives, but my idea is that the main channel is taken too deep. That, of course, does not make much difference now."" the ground at the deptih chosen not being much harder than it is within a few feet of the surface; but I submit that, when the work of installing each house or unit is undertaken, the cost will be greatly affected by the depth of the channels.

Mr de Burgh, after making most careful investigations, on indepenbe referred dent lines, reported: To summarize them on the suitability of the Cotter River as a source of water supply for the Capital, we find that the average daily flow over years was 70,000,000 gallons per day, or sufficient for the supply of 700,000 persons at gallons per head per day, while the flow as regulated by the existing reservoir will suffice for the supply over the most 'critical of 7,000,000 gallons a day, or sufficient . for 70,000 persons on a 100 gallons a day * Red I remind honourable members that the position in regard to the water supply is this: the weir has been constructed, a pumping plant has been installed, a re has been built at Mount Stromlo, Public and the mains run from the weir into the city itself to the service All the water works have been completely installed up the point that we have now only to provide for reticulation through the city. com Mr de Burgh's report continuedA comparison of the latter figures with the 1,500,000 gallons per day immediately required for the supply of 15,000 persons (see Sec.

The proposal is that the Government shall enter into rivalry with ex-Judge Heydon and other speculators, who are already submitting proposals for the erection of and other accommodation adjacent to Canberra.

We ultimately had from the Minister a statement that it was also to provide accomexmodation for honourable members. This, therefore, is the first step towards committing the House to an expenditure of £3,000,000, and, judging by past experience, even millions more, on the building of Canberra. It is the first step towards committing this House, in these days of so-called economy, to a wasteful expenditure of public money. At a time when industry is crushed by taxation-at a time when we have a public debt of over £400,000,000, and when our direct taxation alone amounts to £ 1 3 per head of the population-w e are invited to support this wasteful expenditure.",48

The £2,000,000 to which I have referred includes £740,000 expended in the purchase of land in the Federal Territory.

The result is that this poor, financially-stricken is called upon to bear the brunt of an annual loss of upwards of £80,000, representing the difference between IJ per cent, and 6 per cent., which is the ordinary rate of interest at the present time.

The manner in which the Government has submitted to this pressure is one of the most appalling speccountry tacles I (have witnessed in my public life. This unique' means of wasting public funds should be arrested, even at this late hour, by the House declining to accept the Minister's proposal. It is not a question of asking the Public Works Committee: to decide whether it is desirable that an hostel should be erected at Canberra or not-that has practically been already decided on by the Government. They are now merely, as a matter of for m for the sake of carrying out the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act, submitting it to that Committee-the point is that the Government have decided to ask the House Albury. to agree to this motion because such pressure has been brought to bear on them that they dare not refuse to go on with the Canberra project, and they have endeavoured to save their hides and skins by yielding to tb© expenditure of £98,000 on an hostel there. Is it a fair and reasonable suggestion?'",49
226,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,No .,50
227,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"This is the most disgusting speech of repudiation I have ever heard in this House. Sir ROBE RT BEST - This talk of repudiation is absurd nonsense, and is a w i l f u l attempt to mislead. There is no suggestion of repudiation on the part of those who oppose this scheme. idea does not come within the compass of consideration on a motion snch as this. The point I emphasize is that the House has already declared by its efforts towards economy that there is no money available for such schemes; but yet when pressure is exerted on the Government they are not honest or courageous enough to tell the truth , and say "" We have not the money."" ",50
228,Mr RILEY,Unknown,But we have the money.,50
229,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that Post Office services have been disgracefully curtailed because we have not money. The Postmaster General (Mr Wise) told us he desired to spend £2,500,000, but was only granted £1,000,000. He said that he really wanted £9,000,000 for various postal and telephonic services; but the funds were not available. We have not money for the Post Office, or for increased invalid and old-age pensions, or for providing reproductive employment; but, apparently, money can be found for wasteful expenditure in this sink at Canberra, in rivalry with private enterprise. . Honourable members must bear in mind that in agreeing to this motion they are committing themselves to an expenditure, in accordance with the Advisory Committee's report, of £3.000,000 within the next six years-that is the Committee's definite proposal-and that the erection of this hostel is but the beginning of the transference of some of the Departments to Canberra, which will mean increased cost of administration. Instead of the central administration being concentrated in one spot, it will be divided. Some of the Departments will be at Canberra, others will be elsewhere. The cost of administration will thus be vastly increased.",50
230,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That is an argument against going to Canberra at all.,50
231,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"No . The point is that, although we may be justified in applying any funds that we may have to spare towards the creation and erection of what is intended to be a Federal Capital on permanent lines, we are not justified in creating temporary accommodation at Canberra by the erection of shelter sheds and other similar structures. The Advisory Committee proposes td create a temporary and not a permanent Capital. Australia invited the whole world to furnish it with designs for a Federal Capital, and we are justified in spending any The money we have to spare on creating that Capital on permanent lines, but that design, representing the best brains of the world on the subject, is brushed aside, and we are now asked to start out upon the erection of a temporary Capital only, and a considerable number of the works and buildings to be put up will ultimately need to be abolished. Such a temporary expedient will lead to vastly increased cost of' administration in place of the economy we had a reasonable right to expect the Government to display. May I point out that the contemplated expenditure within the next six years is based upon the assumption that work which in normal times would cost £100 is now likely to cost £ 1 8 0 . The Treasurer pointed out in his Budget speech that the cost of labour and material had increased by 100 per cent, in some cases, and, speaking generally, he said that expenditure was now over 80 per cent, above what it was in normal times.",50
232,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,It shows the folly of not fulfillin g the compact in normal times.,50
233,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I have never been a party to putting off the building of the Federal Capital in normal times. If our taxation at the present time had been normal I would raise no objection to expenditure at Canberra in building a permanent Capital. In fact, I actually introduced some of the measures in connection with the acceptance of the Territory. It was the bond fide intention of the Governments with which I was connected to proceed with the building of the Federal Capital under normal conditions; but the Constitution never contemplated that when Australia was suffering from the results and reaction of war, when her industries were stifled by the burden of taxation, and when, in fact, the country was in an exhausted condition finan-cially, the Capital should be proceeded with, in other words, whether we had the money for the purpose or not; hut now political pressure is exerted in order to bring about wasteful expenditure of public money in the creation of a temporary Capital. Those who talk economy, and yet proceed with the erection of this hostel, are utterly insincere. They are humbugging the public. The motion we have had submitted today is evidence of want of sincerity on the part of the Government in their so-called policy of economy. It will be a serious reflection on them if, at a time such as this, we waste money in erecting boardinghouses, and, ultimately, I suppese, picture theatres.",50
234,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"If the proposed building costs £98,000, it will be in the nature of a palace.",51
235,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"The intention is to put np temporary accommodation for the Parliament and part of the Government Departments. This is the first step towards carrying out the report of the Committee which was appointed to tleYise a scheme for the creation of a temporary Capital, to house part of the Departments, and from time to time to increase that accommodation. The expenditure now is unwarranted. that the House will reject the motion.",51
236,Mr RIXEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) [5.2] Any one who did not know the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) might take his speech seriously. He has never been to the Federal Capital Territory, and knows nothing of it.

238,Mr RILEY,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to point to a vote given by him in the interests of economy in conuexion with proposed military works.,51
239,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,I have done more in that direction than the honourable member has knowledge of.,51
240,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"We provided the honourable member with plenty of opportunities to give effect to any desire for economy that he might have, but he did not vote with us against the Government then. Ho knows that at the time of Federation a compact was entered into ou behalf of the States, under which the Seat of Government was to be in Melbourne only for a limited time.",51
241,Mr LISTEB,Unknown,No limit of time was stated.,51
242,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"There we have another Victorian. Only twelve men voted against the proposal to spend £200,000 this year in carrying out works in the Federal Capital area. The proposal now under consideration has been spoken of as a proposal for the erection of a shelter shed, but what is intended is the provision of accommodation for members of Parlia^ ment. This Parliament is going to meet at Canberra, in spite of the efforts of the Victorians to prevent it. We shall not be: satisfied with the building of a hostel; we want to have the Parliament House proceeded with. New South Wales has a right to expect that. She has surrendered to the Commonwealth 900 square miles of Territory, and that land is not bringing in the> revenue which it will bring in when the Parliament meets at Canberra. The honourable member for Kooyong is not likely to go to Canberra, because there are no 1""W Courts there. When Parliament meets at I hope Canberra, the Commonwealth Territory will bring in a considerable revenue. The Federal Capital Territory is nearly as big as the State of Tasmania, though that may not bo saying very much for its size. When the population there increases, the receipts of the Treasury will increase, and the sooner we get there, the sooner shall we get an adequate revenue from the land of the Territory. The expenditure that is now taking place will be dead expenditure until Parliament meets at the Capital. My honourable friend did not object to voting for the expenditure of money to make sewerage works, and to provide a water supply in the Territory.",51
243,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,No . That is legitimate.,51

My honourable friend is inconsistent in voting for such expenditure and objecting to the erection of buikling3. The Federal Territory will be one of the finest assets the Commonwealth has.

My honourable friend says that when normal'times come the compact will bo honored; but I have been a member of this House for a large number of years, during which he has always voted against expenditure to take, the Parliament to Canberra. According to him, times never would be normal. people of New South Wales could find the money to build the Capital.'",52
246,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Do they want the Capital at Canberra?,52
247,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"They are anxious to have Parliament meet there. They have been disappointed during a period of twenty years at the non-fulfilment of the constitutional compact. Some honourable members seem to be ready to vote for any expenditure at Canberra which will not have the effect of taking the Parliament there. Personally, I am sorry that the Government does not propose the expenditure this year of the £400,000 recommended by the Advisory Committee. I am sure that the House would agree to that. It would be in the best interests of the people of the Commonwealth to have Parliament meeting at Canberra. Although I live in Sydney, I would not like the Parliament to meet there, because I would not like it to be under the domination of the Sydney press, as it is now under the domination of the Melbourne press. The local newspapers do not influence every member, but there are some whom they influence. We should get a hustle on, and build not only a hostel, hut #lso a Parliament House. It should be our object to make the 900 square miles of the Federal Territory reproductive. Friends of mine who have visited the Territory have been unable to obtain accommodation there, but the district is one which would attract tourists if provision were made them. My honourable friend would have his vision extended were he to visit the Territory. Every man who has gone there, and has not allowed himself to be blindly prejudiced, has returned with a good impression of the district, and anxious to have the Parliament removed there. The climate is a healthy one, and the country Capital. is good. Here we are located in a building which is. not well ventilated, but at Canberra' the conditions will be quite different. The Government is doing the right thing in making a start with the Federal city.",52
248,Mr WIENHOLT,Unknown,"Moreton) [5.11] When votes for Canberra are proposed it is not the depth of the sewers that worries me, as it seems to do the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley), The but the depth of our national debt. On Friday last we had a rather serious debate on the administration of the War Service Homes Commission, when Ministers admitted that the Government had not made a success of the business of a master-builder, and were determined to* give it up. Now it is proposed to spend over £90,000 on buildings at Canberra, a change of plan which reminds one of the old coupletWhen the' devil was sick, the devil a monk would be; The devil got well, the devil a monk was he. I am against the Government entering into trading enterprises, either in the running of a shipping line or the management of a hostel. To say that these things will pay is, I suppose, a form of humor, because we know that Government enterprises never have paid, and never will pay. In my opinion, the money which it is proposed to spend at Canberra could he better spent on the erection of telephone and telegraph lines. For that reason, I have steadily opposed expenditure at Canberra, and I hope that the House will not pass this proposal. Subsequently, we are to be asked to vote enormous sums to provide Commonwealth accommodation in other places, so that at the very best this proposed expenditure at Canberra would mean the duplication of offices.",52
249,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Bass) [5.14] - Appa rently the proposed building will be palatial, because it is to cost £98,000. for On that sum the interest and sinking fund will work out at something like £120 per week. .Does the Minister seriously think that the proposed building could be let at a profit ? If the New South Wales people are so keen about the building of the Federal Capital, why do they not undertake it themselves? We hear ths*t they have the money for it. «",52

The next best .thing we can hope for is that the Public Works Committee will see that if the money is spent it is spent wisely.",53
252,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darlin g Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [5.15] - The suggestion that Canberra is in the wilderness makes one look to historical precedents; and it is rather interesting to remember the record of Washington, which stands today as one of the most magnificent cities in the world. In the New York Daily Advertiser of 24th February, 1789, there was published the following communication from Baltimore: There are already subscribed for the erecting of buildings in this town for the use of Congress f20,000. When we reflect on the present state of population in the United States, nothing can be more preposterous and absurd than the idea of fixing the seat of Congress in a village, or the raising a new city in a wilderness for their residence. Before we give into such fancies, we should consider whether we have such a surplus of people and trade as is necessary for the erection and maintenance of a new city. If we have not, the new city must necessarily draw from our present towns their wealth, trade, and people to compose its greatness. I believe no considerate men will venture to say that a new city can be established by any other means than by attracting the wealth, trade, and inhabitants of the old ones; or that it is consistent with the interests of the United States of America to adopt a measure so pregnant with injury and desolation. The contest for the seat of Congress will, therefore, and must necessarily be between New York and Baltimore. One might almost expect to see a similar communication published in the newspapers of today in reference to Canberra. The honourable member, for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), in his enthusiasm and antagonism, and not speaking with that calm judgment which generally characterizes his utterances, referred to what he described as an absolute waste of millions of money at the Federal Capital. I respect the honourable member's judgment; and if he had visited the Capital, examined the works, and then expressed an opinion, I should have been inclined to listen. But we had the report of the Advisory Committee;",53
253,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,W h i c h condemned the sewerage scheme. [JJoO],53
254,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"No ; that was the Blacket Commission. But, as against the two who favoured the scheme as opposed to the departmental scheme, there are eleven other engineers and medical officers who j u s t if y the Department. Therefore, the weight of evidence is in favour of the departmental scheme. Mr John Sulman, Mr H . E . Ross, one of the eminent architects of Sydney, and Mr de Burgh, a most conscientious public servant, investigated the expenditure to which the honourable member for Kooyong has referred, and this is their report after they had done what the honourable member has not done, namely, visited the place and seen for themselvesBearing in mind the acceptance of a specific design of city lay-out, together with the restriction which any definite city plan would necessarily impose on a subsequent design of engineering works, and having due regard to the differences of opinion usually to be found in all engineering proposals, the Committee has reviewed the works and services now existing, and odviscs generally that these works and services are well designed, of sound principles, and properly constructed, forming necessary and useful development.",53
255,Sir ROBEET BEST,Unknown,"And costing £80,000 a year.",53
256,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable .member's charge was that money had been wasted: but as soon as he is confronted with the report of the Advisory Committee, he points out that the cost is so much per year. The honourable member should keep to his first charge. Has this money been wasted?",53
257,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Was there any money wasted, or dropped, on the brickworks?",53
258,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I shall read the opinion of the Advisory Committee on that matter, showing that there has been very little wasteThe proportion of works unsatisfactorybut, in a measure, useful-is small. The actual capital loss on unsatisfactory work?, in the opinion of the Committee, does not exceed 1 per cent, of the capital outlay thereon. That is an answer to the charge of wastefulness. Why should honourable members continue to make such extravagant statements? This scheme is either right or wrong, and it ought to be condemned on facts, if condemned at all , and not on idle supposition. Further than that, the Committee says The Committee finds that many basic preliminary works have been carried out, of a class the construction of which must necessarily occupy a considerable period, and their provision, therefore, constitutes a substantial contribution to the building of Canberra. J The honourable member for Kooyong refers to an expenditure of £2,000,000; and, in reply, I take the date, 20th April, 1921, when £1,056,000 had been expended on works, and £740,000 on land. The honourable member for* Kooyong adds the whole of the cost of the works to the cost of the land. He then considers the revenue from the land only, and takes it as the yield from both the works and lands. Then, because it appears to return a low interest, he condemns the country as a God-forsaken place. From the land, we are today, without having developed it in any way, receiving about £35,000 a year, together with the improvements that lessees make.",53
259,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I said so, and that is the only income!",54
260,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Can it ""be bad country which produces this return? Of course, there is no return on the public works, and £1,000,000 is there lying idle; but why is there no return?

The Committee reported- > The Committee considers that the adoption of the existing pumping scheme, as opposed to a gravitation scheme from any adequate source with its contingent heavy initial pense, was sound in principle. The works are shown to be sound in principle, and the money well spent. There has been no waste on the sewerage, and the power house is one of the best and most up to date in Australia. Roads have been formed, and there is at 'Canberra one of the finest afforestation establishments, under a most capable man, who has planted over S30,000 trees for the development of the Territory. All the work done has been well and wisely done. The trouble is that we are losing owing to the money now lying idle, and surely common sense dictates our going on with the scheme ? So far we have not - leased an acre of land in the city area proper, but when we do we shall make it self-supporting. There will be a population of 15,000 at Canberra, within six years of the date of its establishment.",54

266,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Committee reported that in three years there will be a population of 6,000, and, in three years more, a population of 15,000; and the desire of the Committee was to keep population back for the first three years only in order to prepare the Capital.

My - correspondent is the honorary secretary of the Kooloonong branch, of the Returned NOES. Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League. He states- . I have just finished reading an account ofyour fight fur telephonic communication is these out-of-the-way Malice districts. We, the soldiers of this district, are indeed pleaBed to see something being done in this matter. For the past six or nine months we have been .fighting, through our Federal executive, for this; and the result up to date is exactly as you say, an utter lack of sympathy, which is, to say the very least of it, disheartening. There PAIR. is no need for me to enlarge on the hardships that are being borne by the soldier settlers, .not only here, but in all parts of the. Commonwealth. You know them, as well as .we do; but add to these the lack of speedy' communication in times - of sickness or accident, together with a two-days-a-weefc train; serand yon will agree that things are about aa bad as they can be. These people have no 'telephonic communication with the outside world, and they receive their mail, as the writer says, only twice a week. My ' correspondent proceeds to quote a case in point:A few weeks ago a man and his - wife and child arrived here. It was. discovered that the child had diphtheria. The child was kept all Sonday till Monday morning, when it was taken down to Swan Hill hy train. It died either during the journey or shortly after admission; I am not sure which. It is possible that had we had a telephone a doctor could have been I brought from Nyah or Swan Hill, and, perhaps, the child's life thus saved. Another also presents itself; that is, in connection harvesting. Should a settler require a spare part for his machine after the train has on Monday morning, he has to wait till Friday morning to even get the message away, - means that the part cannot arrive t ill Saturday night at the earliest. Should it not arrive by that train it would be the fol- lowing Thursday before he could receive it. one Now, sir, let mc urge you to do all in your to remedy this state of affairs, which an absolute repudiation of the promises made by the Federal Government, that the soldiers' welfare, was their foremost thought. not let me be misunderstood, however. fully appreciate all that has been done, and is being done; but you will agree that small things like this have a far-reaching effect on the soldiers, and have a tendency to make them dissatisfied- a dissatisfaction that will ""vow »nd is prevalent in more than one disI., ict at the present time. In connection with the installation here, 1 i ilght mention that the Railways Standing Committee, some little time ago, put a. proposal before the Postmaster-General, that the railway line might be used by making connexions with post-offices where necessary. It appears that the railways have telephones in some cases attached at the various stations; but, owing to departmental regulations, the railway officers are not permitted to make them available, except for railway purposes. My correspondent continuesThis would not be such a tremendous expense to the Department, and I would ask you to try and see if this could not be effected at an early date. I make no apology for reading this letter. I have brought forward such matters as these again and again, and I can get no result. What is wrong? I do not know how to obtain results.",55
278,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Will the honourable member please resume his seat ? I permitted him to read his letter, as I thought it might have some bearing upon the motion before the Chair. So far, however, the honourable member has failed to connect his remarks with the motion, which refers to a specific matter; and although he would have been quite in order in speaking as he has been doing, and in reading his letter, in the course of debates upon the Postal Estimates, he will not be in order in proceeding further in that direction at the present stage. This is a specific motion dealing wish a proposition .to construct certain automatic telephone exchanges. A general discussion on departmental policy regarding telephone exchanges in various parts of the country is not, therefore, permissible. While I have been lenient to the extent of giving the honourable member every opportunity to connect his remarks, particularly in view of the fact that his correspondent has written as the representative of a body of returned soldier pioneers, I must ask him to connect his further statements with the matter before the Chair.",56
279,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"The manner in' which I proposed to connect my remarks Was by comparing'the proposal before the House for the construction of additional metropolitan facilities with the entire lack of consideration for ordinary telephonic provision in remote districts. I have achieved my purpose in bringing this typical case before the House; and I only desire to add an expression of hope that the Postmaster-General will take notice of what I have said, and do his best to overcome the causes of complaint.",56
280,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [5.41] - Inasmuc h as the honourable member for Wimmera has been permitted to bring forward his complaint, I desire now to refer to matters whichalso are not strictly before the House. It too often happens that honourable members are enabled to air grievances, despite the fact that their remarks are irrelevant, and that Ministers are not given opportunities, following thereon, to reply specifically and immediately. As you have very properly pointed out, sir, the matter raised by the honourable member for Wimmera could have been discussed, both in connection with tihe consideration of the estimates for new works and - buildings, and in the course of the debate on the general Esti- ' mates. However, the whole difficulty, such as is contained in the complaint of the honourable member, and .in many others like it, could be got over at once if Parliament would authorize the raising of a special loan of £7,858,000, which-as I have already pointed out-is the sum required to permit the Postmaster-General's Department to overtake arrears of work. My officers cannot possibly hope to undertake that work unless the money is provided. When the Works and Buildings Estimates were before honourable members, I pointed out that country areas were being given more than a fair share of the sum allotted, in proportion to population. Last year, country undertakings involved ah expenditure of £409,899, while' works in metropolitan areas absorbed £487,459. The total of new subscribers added in country districts during the same period was 8,277, while those in metropolitan areas numbered only 8,991. Surely no honourable member will say that' country districts are not receiving their, full dues I The complaint of. the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), might be intensified by the testimony advanced by various honourable members behalf of outlying districts in the States. My Department is doing all that is possible. It has been said, over over again, that a sum amounting to tween £7,000,000 and £8,000,000 w needed if all arrears of work are to be overtaken; and that the task of catching up would have to be spread over a period fore Christmas? of three or four years. I repeat that when the money is provided the work w be undertaken.

283,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,Who would get revenue ?,57

But instead of soldiers to pay out of their own pockets the contribution towards the cost, that is to say, sufficient to pay 25 per cent, of the estimated deficiency, it could be charged they can get: against the whole estate, and paid by the Government. I said to Mr Macprovision kinnon, "" If you will let me know the settlements to which you wish teleshould phone lines erected, I shall get an estidemands mate for each, and let you know what contributions will be required."" said, "" Very w e l l "" ; but from that to this I have never received those ticulars.",57
285,Mr FENTON,Unknown," I do not think the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) can accuse honourable members of the Opposition of on the land. being averse to the provision of telephone lines in the country. The Postmasterview, General has intimated that works in city or country cannot be proceeded with until on money is provided, and I now urge the larger Government to bring before Parliament at the earliest possible moment proposals and to raise money, so that we may make a bestart at onoe to catch up the arrears of ill be work in the Postal Department.",57
286,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,As k the Minister if he will introduce a Bill for. that purpose be,57
287,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I believe that if the ill Minister were to introduce straight way a Bill authorizing the expenditure of £2,000,000 in order to overtake some of settlethe arrears of work in his Department, the House would readily support it . I would be prepared to sit up all night to such a Bill , but I do not think that That would be necessary; a ten minutes discussion would be sufficient to satisfy n every honourable member as to the need for these works. In regard to the Ascot Vale exchange, honourable members who they represent metropolitan constituencies are deluged with complaints that people can. not get telephone services, and the uniform reply of the Department is that the to existing exchanges are out of date, andi m, incapable of accommodating new subUnless new exchanges are it is impossible to provide the ? dozens of new services that are required. Such a state of affairs indicates that the expenditure on the provision of new exchanges will bring additional revenue into the coffers of the Department. The the proposed telephone exchange at Ascot Vale, when erected, will serve an area which has a population of between having 150,000 and 170,000.",57
288,Mr STEWART,Unknown,I have no objection to the city people having all the facilities,57
289,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I know that; but for country and city requirements should be made concurrently. We make an endeavour to satisfy the of the country districts, with whose circumstances honourable members He on this side sympathize, but concurrently day with the extension of facilities in the parcountry, we must improve and extend the postal and telephonic* facilities in the [5.46]. city and suburban areas.",57
290,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"And if one section has to go without, it should not be the men :",57
291,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I agree with that but the two sections should be provided for concurrently. The Postmaster General has h it the nail on the head this afternoon, and I hope that next time he will drive it righ t home by submitting to Parliament proposals for expenditure sufficient to overtake arrears of work in town and country.",57
292,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Dampier) [5.50] - It would be a serious mistake for members representing country constituencies to object to this expenditure on the provision of an exchange at Ascot Vale. This is a business proposition. There has beena demand in Melbourne and other cities for increased telephonic communication, and when the demand exists the provision of a new telephone is a payable proposition. Unfortunately, during the war the cost of establishing these exchanges increased by over 100 per ""cent. Mr MCWILLIAMS Why ?",58
293,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The Public Works Committee, of which I am a member, reproceeded ceived evidence that the price in America had risen fro m £ 9 to £ 2 0 per subscriber for automatic telephones, and it has i creased correspondingly for services the old system;. The question before the House is whether or not the Government shall proceed with has been recommended by the Public Works Committee. after the Committee had obtained evidence from America elsewhere regarding the automatic sysAscot tem. I am quite satisfied that this sound business proposal. If the Departhis ment does not incur this expenditure i will lose good businesss in the city, and of consideration. will probably be compelled to incur greater expenditure in the future. Members representing country constithe tuencies have never failed to impress the Postmaster-General the necessity of further liberalization of the regulations regarding telephones in country areas. Honourable members are aware that, parforward"" ticularly during th© last three years, the regulations have been considerably liberalized, and the country districts are now getting conveniences that they could not get when Mr Webster was in charge of the Department. The terms during his rlgvme were exceedingly harsh. They have been* improved, and it is the duty of the country representatives urge the Government to continue liberallines, izing the regulations so that we may give to: the man in the back country telephone communication, which is the greatest boon he can have. We would be making a great mistake if we resisted this penditure in the metropolitan area Bimply because lack of funds does not permit the Postmaster-General to provide telephone services all over the back country { Whilst admitting that the cost of this work is considerably greater than it would have been in pre-war days, I am satisfied that the proposal is in the in terests of the Department and, therefore, of its customers in the country districts.",58
294,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Will m o t ) [5.52] It would be unwise to reject this proposal unless by so doing we could insure that the money intended to be spent at Ascot Vale would be diverted to a f u n d for the erection of country telephones. T da not think! that would happen, and as an erstwhile member of the Public Works Committee I know that this proposal was investigated and that the Committee recommended that the exchange should be with as soon as possible. I do not like to deprive a place like Ascot Vale of these conveniences, when the n - exchange is likely to prove a good, payunder able proposition to the Department.  a work which proposal to do that.",58
295,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"If we cannot d i vert this money into the country districts and we should not oppose its expenditure at Vale. But I do think that when is a the PoaitmasteriGeneiral, is drawing up Estimates he should be very careful t to see that the country gets its fair share The telephone exchange at Ascot Vale has been long recommended, but the time may come when House will decide that projects of this on kind may very well be deferred, and the a money which would be spent on them ajpplied to the provision of facilities in country districts. When these projects are iput in the first place is the time when the Postmaster-General should take steps to insure that the country districts are not starved. It is better to starve the city of these conveniences than the 'country. The Postal Department is not meant to be primarily a revenue-earning concern; it isintended to be a convenience to the public, and although it may lose a littl e to money at times on country telephone the whole community may derive very big indirect benefits from such services. The time has come when the Postmaster-General should be prepared to curtail city conveniences, so that the country exmay get proper consideration. However, this matter has .been long recommended, and I cannot see that any benefit to the country districts can be gained by rejecting the motion.  [5.56] - The Postmaster-General might have gone a little further than he did . He said either too much or too little. He will be able to refer to his speech in six months' time, and say that he was in favour of borrowing money for the carrying out of telephone facilities and mail services, because he said that if Parliament would authorize the borrowing of the necessary funds he would be quite ready to provide the services that are asked for. It is the duty of the Government to submit a proposal to Parliament.",58
296,Mr WISE,Unknown,"I made the same statement on 15th November.  Postmaster-General may feel assured that Parliament will support him if he brings forward a definite proposal. Mr WATKINS.'-The other chaps will not allow him to do so.  f a u l t lies with the Ministry let them take the responsibility, and not throw it on Parliament. This House will support the Postmaster-General if he will submit a concrete proposal. We are entitled to a statement from him before the House adjourns at Christmas this year that he will submit a definite proposal to raise money for the carrying out of those works that are in arrears. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) has stated a condition of affairs that is only typical of what exists all over the Commonwealth. I have a letter in my box at the present time from a soldier settlement in New South Wales which I know was visited by the postal inspector five months ago. He reported request of the settlement for a mail service and a telephone, and the last letter I received contained the stereotyped reply that the matter was still under consideration. I believe that the real trouble is that the Department has not the necessary funds to carry out these works, but an endeavour is made to cover that fact by the stereotyped reply that the matter is still under consideration. If the Department has no funds available, now is the time, before Parliament adjourns for some months, for the Minister to submit proposals to the House. If the grievances of the country districts in this regard were related in detail they would occupy the attention of the House for a considerable time. It is a pity that notonly soldier settlers, but other settlers in the back country, should be denied the conveniences to which they are entitled. What does the Postmaster-General mean when he says that if Parliament will authorize the raising of the necessary funds he will carry out the works ?",59
297,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Would it not be better to make a fight on any new proposals that are put before us rather than onone which has been inquired into and recommended 1  not matter very much. We care not whether the jPostmastier-General makes his statement on this or any other motion, as long as he gives us at once an opportunity to show that a big majority of the House is in favour of the flotation of a loan to enable his Department to cater for the wants of country districts. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) and I remained here all night to discuss this very question.",59
298,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I would again remind the House that this discussion is quite irregular. The motion deals specifically with the construction of telephone exchanges at Ascot Vale and North Melbourne. That is the only matter before the House, and honourable members are not entitled on such a motion to discuss the whole administration of the Postmaster-General's Department in regard to telephonic communication throughout the Commonwealth.  no desire to commit any breach of the Standing Orders. The Postmaster-General has said that if Parliament would on the authorize the raising of the necessary funds he would carry out much needed yet work in country districts. I ask him now wihether he is going to give the House an opportunity to declare its mind on the subject. If we are not given an opportunity to vote the necessary authority, then the Government, and not the Parliament, must accept the responsibility.",59
299,Mr MCWILLIAM S,Unknown,"F r a n k l in ) [6.4] The only point we have to consider is whether it is advisable, as proposed by the Government, to expend on these suburban telephone exchanges money that could be used to better advantage in other directions. Having regard to the fact that the amount at the disposal of the Postmaster-General's Department is exceedingly limited., is it desirable that £183,000 should be spent in providing telephone luxuries in two of the suburbs of Melbourne, when demands from all parts of the country for telephonic communication are being rejected on the ground of want of funds? Even granting that this will be a profitable. investment, I have always rebelled against a system under which postal and telephonic servioes in back country districts are dealt with on the basis of profit and loss. Such a system can never give satisfaction. Telephonic services in country districts should be placed in the same category as the educational system, the judicial system, and other essential functions of civilization. The indirect advantages from the establishment of such services are far greater than any actual profits that might arise from the provision of increased facilities in suburban areas.",59
300,Mr GROOM,Unknown,But the House has already decided this question. The money for the building of these exchanges has been passed. ',60
301,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,We did not have a proper opportunity to discuss the Postal Estimates on which that nrovision was made. We were asked to deal with them at 4 a.m. last Saturday.,60
302,Mr WISE,Unknown,"That is not so. Provision is made for these exchanges on the Works and Buildings Estimates, which were not discussed during an all-night sitting.",60
303,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I that they were. The point I am trying to make is that it is the system rather than the administrator that is at fault. I am not seeking to attach lany special blame to the Postmaster-General. I believe that he has made the best of what is an unfortunate system. A system that permits a sum of £183,000 to be taken out of a relatively small vote to provide for the erection of telephone exchanges in two surburbs while there are thousands of urgent country requests such as those mentioned by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) which cannot receive attention, is wrong. From the very inception of Federation we have had this bookkeeping system, which is a curse to the postal, telegraph, and telephone services of the Commonwealth. So long as it can be shown that money can be profitably expended on the erection of a costly telephone exchange in the metropolis, country requirements will not receive attention, because in many cases they are not directly remunerative. If a division is taken; I shall vote against this motion, not because I do not believe the undertaking will he profitable, but because I think the expenditure of £183,000 in two of the suburbs of Melbourne is not justified while in the back-blocks people are crying out for telephone services which they cannot obtain.

When a vote was to be taken in connection with these Estimates to which I have referred, I was approached by one of the Government Whips, ancl asked what my attitude would be. I stated that, in view of the fact that it was costing something like £16 each to manufacture rifles at Lithgow when they could be purchased overseas at £ 7 each, if it was thought desirable to effect economy the Small Arms Factory was one in which savings could be effected. However, the Committee saw fit to carry on the manufacture of The rifles at Lithgow to a limited extent, and I was informed that, as I was one who was advocating economy, my project at Geelong was likely to suffer to the extent of £40,000.",66

317,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"The motion moved by the Minister (Mr Groom) has been on the business-paper for quite a long time; but on the Estimates for Additions, New Buildings, & c , there was a proposal to spend £45,000 on the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong, and had it not been for the insistent demand put forMILLS. ward in the Committee of Supply for economies, unquestionably that vote would have gone through. I would like to know now what the Government contemplate doing in regard t d these mills. The £45,000 was required for the purpose of acquiring new machinery, and it was not intended to be spent on buildings. The new plant was required to enable the manufacture of worsted material to be undertaken, and I would like ta know if this expenditure has now been, cut out. It cannot be done with, a view to economy, because there axe very few socialized industries in this country which are better paying propositions than are the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong. I am told that last year, after allowing for every charge that can be legitimately placed against any concern which pay. of this kind , these mills returned a profit of from, £26,000 to £30,000, and I am informed that this profit would be conadmission. siderably increased by the expenditure of the money which was placed on the Estimost mates for the new machinery, and which, for reasons of alleged economy, has been out out.

CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIE S PRESERVATION) BILL . In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 19th July (vide page 10260), of motion by Mr . GREENEThat(1) The undermentioned duties of Customs be collected in accordance with the following provisions :(B) If the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, that goods produced or manufactured outside Australia have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, and that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry- a dumping below cost duty on those goods imported into Australia, which are specified by the Minister by notice published in the Gazette as being goods as to which he is so satisfied, the amount of the dumping below cost duty being in each case the sum* which represents the difference between a reasonable price of the goods at the time of shipment and the export price of the goods. In this paragraph "" a reasonable - price "" means such a price as represents the cost of production of the goods plus twenty per centum plus free on board charges. In the absence of satisfactory evidence in relation thereto, the cost of production to be such amount as the Minister thinks fit to fix, after report by the Tariff Board, as the cost of production. Upon which Mr GREGORY had moved by way of amendment;That all the words after the word "" If "" in line 1 of the paragraph be omitted with a view the insertion of the following words in "" tit any time it appears to the satisfaction of the Minister, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, that the payment of the anti-dumping duties specified under paragraph (A) of tiiis resolution is being evaded by the shipment of goods or consignments without sale prior to such shipment, the Minister may in any case or class of cases authorize such action as is deemed necessary lo collect on such goods, or any of them, the same dumping duties as if the goods had been sold to an importer in lia prior to their shipment to Australia "" ",68
342,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.6] - The Committee has dealt with paragraph A of the motion, and the matter immediately under consideration is paragraph B ; but it is so long since we were discussing this matter that it may perhaps be as well for me to make some explanation to honourable members. Paragraphs A , B , and C provide against three different specific forms of dumping. Paragraph A provides against the dumping of goods which are sold for export, at prices lower than those at which similar goods are sold in the markets from which they come. Para graph B provides against the dumping of goods which are sold in the country of export at prices below the cost of duction. It may appear that this proviwhich sion is to some extent superfluous, explained when moving the motion that we are following the experience of other being laid down? countries which have had anti-dumping legislation in operation for some considerdown able time. Those countries, after prothe viding against the kind of dumping all which is dealt with in paragraph found it necessary to amend their laws to prohibit the kind of dumping provided against in paragraph B>. It may happen 20 per cent. ? that some powerful combination, such as the American Steel Trust, may decide that in the interest of its business-an against fair play-it will sell its goods profits. below the cost of production in the country of origin, and also for export. provision elastic? Such dumping is not provided against by paragraph A . That paragraph, as I said, provides only against the dumping of goods sold abroad below the home sumption price; but paragraph B would enable us to deal with importations of goods which were being sold for export below the cost of production, even though sold at the home consumption price.",69
343,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I have never heard anything of that sort being done.,69
344,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Such things have occurred in the experience of other tries. Probably these cases will be very rare, but at the same time they should be provided against, and our law should protect us from them. I understand that considerable exception has been taken the provision which adds 20, per cent, the cost of production. I have looked into that matter again, and. a littl e later AustraI shall propose a reduction. When the motion was framed, I was under the im pression that the term "" cost of production would include only the actual cost of raw material, labour charges, and so on, but it covers a great deal more; it covers also all overhead charges, such as cost of management. Therefore, a figure considerably lower than 20 per cent, would be a fair one to cover the reasonable profit which should be allowed on turnover. »",69
345,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Why provide for a limitation when the matter has to go before a Board for examination?,69
346,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,This is a matter - which cannot come under the review of the Board. We must provide an absolute definition of the price which the proBoard shall take as the standard with to compare the price at which but I goods are sold' here.,69

350,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Not on their turn over. They may make 20 per cent, if d overhead charges are included with their",69
351,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Why not leave the,69
352,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"We cannot do that. We must provide the Board with a basis for the computation of prices of goods in conarriving at the amount of dumping duty to be charged. Having carefully considered the matter in all its aspects, I do nob propose to adhere to 20 per cent., though I am prepared to listen to what the Committee has to say on the subject. These remarks apply also to paragraph C. Paragraphs A , B , and C provide of against the three kinds of dumping, which are generally understood. Paragraph O deals with consigned goods, and couni? really an addendum to paragraph A ; but it was impossible to provide, for consigned goods in paragraph A j paragraph A provides for adumping duty on goods actually sold, while paragraph' C deals to with consigned goods. I do not propose to to say more at this stage of the debate, but I shall be very glad to hear what honourable members have to say, and later on I shall move a reduction of the 20 per cent. I have mentioned. Mr Charlton '(Hunter) [8.16] I understand that the Minister (Mr . Greene) intends to move a reduction in the percentage; but I am not sure that that will be satisfactory. We shall, however, wait further information before coming to a determination. This Bill is somewhat belated; it was introduced some time ago, but was not carried to a conclusion. 1",69
353,Mr CORSER,Unknown,Bette r late than uever!,70
354,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I agree with the honourable member, but a good deal of in jury has been done in the time between the introduction of this proposal and the present moment. We have evidence today of a large measure of unemployment in our chief industries, due largely to the fact that commodities and material are being brought from overseas at priees below the cost of production in Australia. That was inevitable after the war; we could plainly see it must occur, and, therefore, the necessity then arose for us . to take prompt action. H a d we done so, it is quite possible that there would not have been so many people out of employment at the present time. For instance, the iron, and steel industry, which may be described as the life-blood of a country, was established in this country only in recent years, and appeared to have good prospects, but suddenly the "" b o t tom fell out "" of the market. Last week something like 500 hands were dismissed from the works.",70
355,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"And by Christmas the number, will probably be 4,000.",70
356,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That does not mean unemployment for only those directly employed in the iron and steel industry, but also for large numbers in directly concerned.",70
357,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Is this due to a f ing oS in orders?,70
358,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,It is because of contracts being let in Australia for goods that can be produced abroad at a much cheaper rate.,70
359,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,How do the prices now compare with pre-war prices?,70
360,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The member should know that it is impossible to get. down, to pre-war prices in a few months, and I hope we shall not do so, because I would rather see the conditions of the workers improved than otherwise. But how can we hope for any change with in a few months of the end of the war ? Prices may be inflated in many directions; they were inflated all over the world, and it was claimed that, after the termination of hostilities, there would be such a demand for; material in every country that we in Australia would have a very busy time. To-day, however, the only people who are having a busy time are enemy people, who were supposed, to have lost by the war. They are in constant employment, and everything is going well with them, while our men, who fought on the side of victory, are the sufferers.",70
361,Mr ROBEBT COOK,Unknown,What wages are workmen .getting overseas ?,70
362,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Does the honourable member desire the same conditions in Australia as prevail overseas?,70
363,Mr ROBERT COOK,Unknown,No ; but what wages are the men getting?,70
364,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"What does it matter to a man what wages he is getting ? The real point - is the purchasing power of the wages. In Germany, though the mark has depreciated considerably, the purchasing power of employees is much the same as it was before, and in consequence of the difference in exchange they can manufacture i profitably there, and through Great Britain orBelgium, have the goods transferred to Australia. The raw material is taken ta Belgium from Germany, and in Australia orders are taken for iron and steel at prices far. below those with which we can compete.",70
365,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,The economic conditions - of the workers in Germany are worse now than in pre-war times.,70
366,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am not in a position to say any more on that phase of the question, but authorities tell us that, while that may be soi, the purchasing power of money in their own countries is not affected as it is here with our a l lmoney standard and the difference caused by depreciation.",70
367,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,At the present time no goods are being landed here from Germany except surreptitiously.,70
368,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is the reason we should have taken the matter in hand, and prevented such goods coming honourable here. Tn the Industrial Australian and Mining Standard of 29th September this year there appears the following: Agents of foveign steel manufacturers are canvassing Australian foundry and engineering works' proprietors in a desperate quest for orders. They are offering to supply Belgian iron and steel, but submit no quotations. They guarantee the analysis will be correct, and whatever price the Australian iron and steel industry fixes, they promise to supply considerably below that figure no matter what the figure may be. This is evidence of dumping clear, complete, and absolute. . . . During the recent months thousands of tons of foreign iron and steel have been "" dumped "" in the Commonwealth. The price quoted is several pounds below the actual cost of local production, without taking into consideration the matter of overhead charges. The foreigner is out to collar the Australian market for iron and steel. He will sell below the Australian price, and he cares not what that price is. He is desperately eager for the business. Profits do not count with the foreigner. His immediate object is the extinction of, the .iron and steel enterprise in Australia. . . . The question of sentiment should not be permitted to intrude. Our first duty is to ourselves. If the importation of Belgian iron and steel means the strangulation of our own Australian industry, then we must 6ee to it that Belgian iron and steel is kept out of the country. ^ I could quote quite a number of extracts on the subject. Prices are given of iron and steel produced abroad as compared with the prices in this country, showing that the goods can be delivered here at something like £ 3 per ton less than our cost of manufacture. If that is the case, and we have to find employment for our own people, immediate action should be' taken to deal with the position, which ought not to have been allowed to develop to the extent of crippling our in dustries. Seeing that this dumping has obtained such a hold, I do not know that it is possible for - us in anything like a reasonable time to recover from the great blow we have sustained fro m this foreign competition. I do.no t know whether the Minister has not power under the Customs Act to deal with this dumping if he so desires. Section 154 of that Act seems to me to give him sufficient power.",70
369,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Eve n without this Bill?,71
370,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It seems that there is some reason for this Bill , which covers three phases of dumping, namely, of goods sold in Australia at a lower price than the market price in the country of production, goods consigned to anct finally sold in Australia at a lower price than in the country of production, and goods sold at a lower price than the cost of production in the exporting country. This B i ll differs somewhat fro m the Canadian law, which at first applied only to goods sold in Canada at a price lower than that at which they were sold in the country of production, but later the law was extended to consigned goods. I think that under section 154 of the Customs Act the Minister has power to deal with goods on the invoices. That section readsWhen any duty is imposed according to value(a) The value shall be taken to be the fair market value of the goods in the principal markets of the country whence the same were exported in the usual and ordinary commercial acceptation of the term free on board at the port of export in such country and a further addition of 10 per cent, on such market value. (6) The value shall be verified at the time of entry by the production of the genuine invoice and by a declaration signed by the owner in the presence of the Collector. (o) The invoice shall be stamped by the Collector with the Customs stamp and shall be produced to the officer prior to the delivery of the goods for home consumption or for warehousing. (<2) If the non-production of the genuine invoice shall be accounted for to the satisfaction of the Collector, proof of its contents by a copy or otherwise may be received in lieu of its production. It is doubtful whether the Minister oould not take action under that section.",71
371,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"As a, matter of fact, all ad valorem duties are now levied according to section 154. It is by that process that we determine the invoice value, or the value of goods for duty. If the value be less than the home consumption value en determined by the section we levy a duty according to the home consumption value.",71
372,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,That is exactly what this Bill in one clause does-it provides for much the same thing.,71
373,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"No ; it goes further. First of all , for the purposes of the Customs we have to ascertain the home consumption value of the goods, and the duties are levied accordingly. But that has nothing to do with the question whether the goods are sold below home consumption value for export.",71
374,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I see the distinction. The Minister has power to assess the value in this country; that is distinct from dumping at less than the price in the country of production.,71
375,Mr GREENE,Unknown,"We charge the duty on the home consumption value of the goods in the country of export; but if the goods are sold below the home consumption value, then we levy the duty on the difference between the home consumption value and the price at which the goods are sold.",71
376,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It seems to me that the Minister has made out a case in favour of this particular clause. I am sorry that this measure was not introduced earlier. We are suffering today because of that fact. I regret, further, that certain State Governments, while on the one hand clamouring for population and more employment for the people, have, on the other, given contracts for work to be done outside this country, just because the quotation was a little cheaper.",72
377,Mr RICHAB DFOSTEB,Unknown,In the case the contracts for the Morwell works difference in price was no little matter.,72
378,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The State Governfence ments should set an example. It is use to complain of private employers when the Governments themselves let tenders abroad in order that they may save a pounds. What is the use of their bewailber ing stagnation in industry and unemtrust ployment? We should do our utmost to should find employment for our own people, even though the immediate cost may be a little more. As I have emphasized over and over again during the past few weeks, one can estimate what is gained by tralia preferring to do the whole of her own work within her own boundaries, from her own material, with her workmen.",72
379,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,Unknown,But there is reasonable limit .,72
380,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"There is ; but, in times such as these, we have to be careful how we approach that limit . There honourable members who desire conditions to be the samei today as if no war. I doubt if we shall ever return to pre-war conditions. Although times this may be bad, we are actually better off than before, and so are the peoples most other countries. The standard of member's electorate. our citizens has been raised, and I hope it will not be lowered. We should endeavour, rather, to retain the high standard, and, indeed to raise it still higher.

385,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Dampier) [ 8 . 3 6 ] - I a doubt whether the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton.) has read the title of this Bill or ihas made himself familiar with its clauses. It is not supposed to be are a Bill to impose increased duties.,72
386,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I am not asking for there had been increased duties.,72
387,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"But the object of measure is, in effect, to impose in creased duties in order to favour manuof facturers in and about the honourable",72

I cannot agree with the M in i ster for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) that some great concern, such, for example, as the Steel Corporation, in the United States of America, is not only sending goods out of America and selling them at less than is represented by production cost, but is actually selling them within America at less than the cost of production, in order to destroy trade in other countries. Such big corporations may send their goods into Australia and other countries when they have manufactured more than their own country is absorbing; and sell them abroad at dumping prices. Hence, the necessity for - anti-dumping legislation-the immediate purpose being to prevent local manufacturers from being u n fair l y treated.",72
390,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The purpose of an anti-dumping measure is to provide against cases of unfair competition.,73
391,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,And that is all.,73
392,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Then let it be done.,73
393,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"That is all very well; but there are few honourable members who can say exactly how this Bill w i ll operate. (Mr Charlton - Does not the honourable member 'think that _ what he has termed successful competition may be, in its incidence, unfair to our people?",73
394,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Then , if that should be the case, we must compel our manufacturers to build up. The honourable member was quoting, some minutes ago, from the Industrial Australian- a journal which has stood behind the Minister, and behind all the Protectionist advocates in this House, throughout the course of the T a r i ff Bill . The issue for 24th November contained a leading article having to do with the building up of Australian in dustries, headed, "" High production costs driving work out of Australia."" Are we to continue to impose high duties throughout all time? Why should we do so?",73
395,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,To give good conditions. - Mr GREGORY - To whom?,73
396,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,To the general workers.,73
397,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,What about the consumers ?,73
398,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Are not masses of the workers the consumers?,73
399,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"They are among the consumers in this country; but there are others who work, in other fields of in dustry. I am battling for more than the interests of one section in this community. We must build up industries and make them self-reliant. Is it not fair that those in receipt of good wages should give a fair return to their employers, so enabling the people of this country to secure necessities at fair prices ? In connection with one item alone in the Tariff schedule - that having to do with steel rods and blooms-honorabl e members w i j l be in terested in a comparison which has been worked out. Assuming that the same quantity were imported for the current year as in 1913, the increased duties would afford a protection to local manufacturers amounting to no less than £730,000. That sum becomes a direct present- a straight-out advantage-to those engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel in Australia. In 1913, these manufacturers were producing without a protective duty. The Broken Hill Proprietary boasted of their magnificent iron deposits, of their wonderful plant, and of the fact that they were able to compete unaided with the whole world. I want to assist to build up such works as those established at Newcastle, but I would give them assistance - only after it had been clearly proved that they could not carry on without such help. I would demand, however, that we receive the same return from that source as could be got from the manufacturers of other countries. I have been recently reading the report of a representative Labour delegate, who had been sent from Great Britain to the United States of America to report upon conditions in the steel industry across the Atlantic. The statement of this official was to the effect that, in May last, the average wages paid in the United States of America steel industry amounted to 3s. 2d. an hour.",73
400,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Yet , according to an illustration in this evening's paper, they have been selling unemployed men to the highest bidder who will give them a b it of work; just as though they were slaves.",73
401,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"What is the honourable member talking about? The Industrial Australian states that the price paid for coal by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company was 21s. 9d. per ton, when the price of coal in Pittsburg was 13s - 6d. the general Are we getting a fai r return ? Is it right that one section in the community should be able to earn from £ 1 5 to £ 2 0 a week while another seetion must work hard, and yet harder, and get practically no> return for their toil? If the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) thinks he is right in bolstering up the conditions of industry in his own district, surely I am more than justified in asking that the great majority of the people shall be given a fai r deal. The iron and. steel industry in this country has by the Tariff been given a direct bonus of something like £2,500,000. Surely with that assistance it should, be able to compete w dustries of other countries, more especially when we have regard to the natural protection that is afforded. When we give high protection hy means of the T a r i ff we are justified in asking that the manufacturers shall bring their establishments up to date, and that the workers shall give a fair deal to the community. Our workers are as good and intelligent as those in any other part of the world, but in recent years things have been going from bad to worse, and the responsibility rests with the Labour leaders. We must realise the economic conditions of the world today, and we cannot afford to continue in the fool's paradise in which we have been living so long. The Inter-State Commission, m its Tariff Investigation Report, saidWitnesses have frequently admitted during the course of examination that, in order to get advantage the local market, they sought the absolute hibition of importation of all goods likely to generally. compete with the industries in which they were interested. With nearly all Australian indusseen tries, the local market is the only market the of monopoly manufacturers have to depend upon. There are some honourable members who trol, wish to use this Bill, not for the purpose general welfare. of preventing dumping, but in order to augment the duties which Parliament has already imposed. That is not fair. it can he shown that goods are being sent to this country at less than the cost production in the country of origin, every honourable member will be prepared to worker pass a law to prevent that taking place. countries. It would not he fair to permit the manuare facturers in America to sell their goools in Australia at less than the price at better pay. which they can sell them in their own country. But in view of the protection we have afforded our through the Tariff we are justified in expecting them to compete with the manuwhat facturers of other countries. When we were dealing with the Tariff members recognised that the Minister had :very - considerably increased the duties Mr Gregory. all these articles. Certainly some honourable members did ask for increased duties, but generally even the high Protectionists were satisfied with the duties to which the Oommittee agreed, i i cannot understand why the Canadian farmer is able to purchase his reaper and binder for £60 when the Australian farmer has to pay £100 for a similar article. O u r workmen should be able to do as well as it h the in - the workmen of Canada.",73

403,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The price of a Canadian reaper and binder is £ 1 0 2 . The Inter-State Commission's report continuedOn the other hand, to grant prohibitive duties, especially to industries in which only a few large firms operate, without some form of - control of prices, would lead to certain combinations and a probable increase of cost in price to the consumer. Moreover, to give unrestricted power to advance prices in the absence of the stimulating influence of competition or some form of control would also tend to lower the standard of efficiency, while the total exclusion of new ideas and improvements to which the whole industrial world is contributing could not possibly act otherwise than to our substantial detriment. Prohibitive duties encourage monopolies and and other combinations which destroy competition, unduly increase the cost of living to the of the factory proprietors, but to the prodetriment of the taxpayers and community There is already in Australia, as we have during the present investigation, a growth in various branches of industry which, if not subject to supervision and conwill be attended with mischief to the ' Those opinions .published a few years ago have even greater force today.

406,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I do not say that on Australia is the best country in the world for the working man. There is a section of the community that is destroying the working man, and taking away his liberty, and he is not as good a producer as he should be.",74

408,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Yes , if the honourable member would leave him alone.",75
409,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,He requires looking after.,75
410,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The result of that looking after is seen in New South Wales ancl Queensland today. Notwithstanding the huge expenditure of loan moneys, there is unemployment, with the natural concomitant of destitution. Paragraph B providesIf the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry report by the Tariff Board, that goods produced or manufactured outside Australia have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price Who is to decide what is a reasonable price?",75
411,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,ThT p Minister.,75
412,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"S t is provided that "" a reasonable price "" means such a price as represents the cost of production of* the goods plus 20 per cent, plus free on board charges. I assume that the Minister intends this to refer to the cost of production in the country of origin, and he told me that he would be agreeable to amend the clause in order to make' that clear. But how is he to determine what Was the cost of production in the country of origin?",75
413,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,The Department does that now under ordinary conditions.,75
414,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"If that he so, there is no need for this machinery. The Customs entry form provides that the importer must make a declaration as to the fair market value of the goods at the time of shipment.",75
415,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,The Department does not necessarily accept that statement.,75
416,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"No ; but it is possible to ascertain the fair market price in the country of origin. I am inclined to move an amendment to strike out the words ""reasonable price"" and insert the words ""market price in the country of origin.""",75
417,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The trouble is that the market price may be less than the cost of production, and we desire to provide safeguards against that.",75
418,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The Minister is mentioning a supposititious condition that I do not think has existed in any country in the world. Let us deal with the Steel Corporation, because that is in the minds of everybody, and we know something about it. We have never heard of the Steel Corporation in America selling its goods within America at less than the cost of production, and also, at the same time, dumping them in other countries. There may have been times when the price has been cut very low in order to knock out a competing firm, but such conditions are usually transient. I do and not think we have ever heard of a large organization cutting down both the home market price and the export price below the cost of production for the purpose of destroying competition in other parts of the world.",75
419,Mr FOLEY,Unknown,There are such things as honourable understandings between companies.,75
420,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Of course, there are such understandings within a country, and too many of them here among the class the honourable member is protecting; but I cannot imagine any big manufacturer cutting down his price for export and also the home market price below the cost of production. I ask the Minister to consider, in connection with this clause, whether he cannot fix the fair market price as being the reasonable price. The goods imported will be not only for ready sale, hut also for manufacturing purposes. Large quantities of goods will be required to be imported to enable the local importer to carry on. "" A large consignment of steel and iron and other goods may be imported for the purpose of manufacturing machinery. The Customs officials will have to decide what is the cost of producing the various articles, and this seems an impossible proposition. Of course, that cost will he always changing. The investigation will probably occupy months, and the importer will not know what Customs duties he has to pay on the goods until the Department can state what the reasonable price in the country of origin is. The whole process is very intricate. The Minister knows that I have not risen for the purpose of delaying the passage of this measure. I know that if he wishes to force it through the House he can do so, but those who support him must accept the full responsibility for their action. I feel satisfied that this legislation must mean a big increase of the duties on the majorit y of articles im-* ported into this country, unless the M in ister is firm in his resolution that the Bill shall be used only as a means of preventing dumping. Throughput the Tariff discussion he has shown himself to be a believer in high Protective duties. I , on the other hand, believe in a moderate Tariff, I know, of course, that it is futile to try to force amendments against the will of,the Minister; but if this proposal is to be passed into law, it should be made as simple as possible, so that when the goods arrive at our ports the Department will be able to say without delay what in creased duties are to be collected, and thus prevent any dislocation of the country's trade.",75
421,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Supposin g that the Department says that there must be a reference to the Tariff Board in respect of certain goods that are coming in , are those goods to be held up indefinitely, or will they be allowed to come in as long as they have not been gazetted?",76

427,Mr GREENE,Unknown,No ; once the entry has been passed and the goods have been entered for home consumption we shall not be able to follow them.,76
428,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The hiomorable member for Flinders wants whether it is the intention of the Department, if this proposed be agreed to, to gazette certain classes of goods and to continue to add to or take from the list. If so, would all goods coming under that list have toi be r/eported by the Minister to the Tariff Board 1",76
429,Mr GREENE,Unknown,The report of the Tariff Board has to be particular; it cannot be general.,76

431,Mr GREENE,Unknown,No .,76
432,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"An importer might not be aware whether or not certain goods which he was bringing into the country would be liable, under this proposed legislation, to a dumping duty. The papers relating to such imports would have to be referred by the Minister to the Tariff Board, and the question of whether or not increased or dumping duties should be imposed upon' them would depend upon the report of the Board. I have not gone carefully into this matter, but I thought that the M in ister would have gazetted certain classes of goods as coming within these provisions.",76
433,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"If it is a question of dumping, it seems to me that the reference to the Tariff Board must be particular. It cannot be general.",76

435,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Naturally .,76
436,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"When the Board has to ascertain what is the cost of production in the country of origin a delay of some months must be involved, and this will create chaotic conditions. If it had merely to ascertain the market price in the country of export at the time of ship- y ment less delay would be involved. Such information could be obtained by cablegram t We also have here a paragraph dealing with goods manufactured in Britain pairtly from material obtained from some other country at a low rate, De- and special charges are to be made in respect of these goods.

437,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, Order ! The to- 'know honourable member's time has expired.,76
438,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond-Minister legislation for Trade and Customs) [ 9 . 6 ] - I should like to reply very briefly to the pointsraised by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. In the first place I invite honourable members to rememberi that this proposed legislation, although new to Australia, is not new to other countries. Legislation of the same class has been in operation for some time in , I think I am right in saying, South. Africa , Canada, the United States of America, and recently' in Britain .",76
439,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,And also lately i New Zealand.,77
440,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Quite so. that in connection with legislation of this character there are initial difficulties be overcome. Possibly in the early stages of its administration there may be some undue delays; but I feel satisfied that shall be able, before very long, to adopt lines of procedure which will subject the commercial community as a whole to of the least possible inconvenience and lay. I recognise, as every honourable member must do, that it is very importcent. ant to a commercial man, when he is about to land goods of this class in Ausagainst tralia, that he should know at the earliest possible moment what charges he will have to pay in respect of them. H may be selling the goods before they are actually landed in Australia, and naturally wants to know what charges will have to meet. Speaking generally, I do not think it will be found difficult to ascertain approximately what is cost of production.",77
441,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"May I ask what is the reason for using the words "" cost of production "" in paragraph B , whereas i paragraph A we have the words "" fair market value "" ?",77
442,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I thought I had explained to the Committee, at an earlier stage, the reason for the variation. The reason is that paragraph A deals with goods that are sold in this country _ at lower prices than those at which similar goods are sold in the country of production itself, whereas paragraph B. deals with goods which are sold at a cost below the cost of production, whether those goods be sold in the country of origin at a lower price or not. This is an attempt to deal with classes of goods in respect of which a deliberate effort is made by, say, a big corporation to capture the whole of the market, and so to crush out its competitors. I admit that cases of that sort are not likely to be numerous; but every country which has enacted legislation similar to that for which we provide in paragraph A , has followed up that legislation with provisions such as those to be found in paragraph B . That action, I venture to say, has been taken as the result of experience. When we are introducing legislation of this kind we should endeavour to profit by the experience of other countries, and I have followed the practice of other countries in proposing legislation such as that set out in paran graph B . Having looked into this matter carefully, I feel that while difficulties will I admit arise to a greater or less degree in the initial stages of the administration of this to legislation, still, they will be rapidly overcome, and it will not be very long before we shall be able to deal promptly we with all these questions as they arise.",77
443,Mr WATKI NS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [9.10] I hail with satisfaction the introduction this legislation, but am sorry that the deMinister proposes to amend paragraph B by substituting 5 per cent, for 20 per The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has made certain charges the one big industry that was established in Australia during the war, and I dare say that the debate will largely e centre round the operations of that industry, and at the present time German steel he is being dumped in Australia. It is he coming here vid Belgium, and its introduction is having a serious effect on the iron and steel industry of. the Commonthe wealth. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has already referred to that phase of the subject. I may add that orders are being solicited n in Australia for imported iron and steel, and that agents are prepared to guarantee that the prioe of the imported article will be below the price at which the Australian industry can possibly offer its products. That clearly shows that dumping is going on. The honourable member for Dampier said that the iron and steel industry of Australia would be assisted by this proposed legislation. I am not in favour of unfairly bolstering up any industry, but .the honourable member is utterly mistaken if he thinks that any member of the Labour party is going to join with him in bringing about a condition of affairs such as prevailed here some years ago, when men had practically to work for little or nothing. The honourable member says that the Broken Hill Company set i ip its iron and steel works just prior to the war, and was able to carry on under the duties prevailing before the introduction of the present Tariff. My reply to him is that, because of the dumping that is going on, the company finds it impossible to obtain orders in Australia, and that unless prompt action be taken to assist it , two of its three blast furnaces will have to close down before Christmas, with the result that some 2,000 or 3,000 men at the Newcastle works will be thrown ont of employment, In addition, to that number, many others engaged in handling the products of the industry in other States will also be thrown out of work. The local industry rendered splendid service to the Commonwealth during the war period by supplying steel rails, and other requirements. After the signing of the Armistice, a new set of conditions arose. Manufacturers of iron and steel in Great Britain have been enabled, since thento obtain, through Belgium, iron and steel at such low prices that many of them, have practically closed down their mills, and are not only trading in the imported article in England, but are sending out large quantities of it to Australia. It pays them better to trade in the imported article than to carry on their own works.  that.",77

It 'is also reported that offices are being opened in Holland for the definite purpose of handling German merchandise intended for Canada, and for invoicing the goods in Dutch currency and as of Dutch origin. Canada has passed a n An t i - D u m p i ng Bill , but it does not contain the weak provisions w h i c h the Minister proposes in our Bill . The Minister w o u l d have the Ccanmittee believe that he is i m p r o v in g his measure by amendin g p a r a g r a p h B . This paragraph, provides that the t r a d e value of goods is to be considered to, be t be i r cost cf p r o d u c t i o n in the c o u n try o for i g in , plus 20 per cent., plus f . o . b . charges, but the Minister n o w proposes to alter t h is 20 per cent, to 5 per cent. In the disturbe d conditions of the rates The of exchange all the w o r l d over, will a p a l try 5 per cent, prevent d u m p in g by u n fair means for the purpose of c r u s h in g our Australian industries? We might an well call the measure waste paper if we reduce that 20 per cent, to 5 per cent.  member desire to guarantee the foreigners a bigger profit than 5 per cent. ?",78
446,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I want an An t i Duniping Bill that will protect Australian industry. It is time that Australians began to realise that they can produce everything they require, and that they should be self-reliant enough to attempt to do it . The 5 per cent, proposed by the Minister is not worth 2d. for the purpose of defending; Australian industries.",80
447,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,It is much more than the anti-dumping legislation in the United States of America provides.,80
448,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Not at all . Furthermore, from the time of the American Civil War the loyalty of Americans to their own products has been almost sufficient protection to those products. All questions of anti-dumping are to be considered by the Tariff Board. not let that Board be the judge as to whether the addition should be 5 per cent, or anything ranging from that to 20 per cent. ? We pass a Bill appointing a Tariff Board to investigate these matters, and yet we are now asked to pass another measure which we call an An t i Dumping Bill to take away from that Board the right to add more than 5 per cent, to the value of foreign goods, although as a result of their investigations they may come to the conclusion that the proper addition should be 20 per cent.",80
449,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"If goods are being sold at less than the cost of production, which the Bill defines, the difference between the price at which they are being sold and a reasonable price is to be the amount of the dumping duty.",80
450,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"And there is to be 5 per cent, on that. A reasonable price means, aocording to this paragraph, such a price as represents the cost of production plus 5 per cent., plus f.o.b. charges. Originally the Minister proposed the addition of 20 per cent., but he has reduced that to 5 per cent. Thus, in effect, a deduction of 15 per cent, is made. It seems to me that this provision limits the Tariff Board's power of recommendation. The Board will collect evidence, but this provision ties its hands in making any recommendation, no matter ihow serious the offence may be.",80
451,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.34] - The honourable motion is designed primarily to cure the evil of dumping, and the paragraph now under consideration deals with goods dumped below tihe cost of production. When it was framed I was, as I have explained, under the impression that the term ""cost of production"" covered only the actual manufacturing cost, that is, the cost of raw material, labour,' and factory charges; but, as a matter of fact, it includes all overhead charges whatever they may be.",80
452,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,How can you ascertain manufacturing costs all over the world?,80
453,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It is done in other countries, and I presume can be done equally well here. Many sources of information are available to the Department. It can be ascertained, for in stance, wthat the market value of goods is in countries manufacturing under simiWhy lar conditions. Then there are trade circulars, price lists, and so on which can be» consulted. I do not think that there will be any practical difficulty in getting the information we shall need. As a matter of fact, we have now to determine the home consumption cost of all goods.",80
454,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,But I am speaking of manufacturing costs.,80
455,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"What we wish to arrive at is the cost of production, which we can obtain, approximately, wifihout unreasonable trouble. The paragraph under consideration deals with goods sold below the cost of production. It does not matter what price goods are sold at, so long as they are not sold below the price of production no dumping duty will apply to them.",80
456,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Suppos e the goods that are being sold below the price of production are old stock, and are goods of a kind not manufactured in this country ?",80
457,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Then they will not be liable to the imposition of an anti-dumping duty. Everything turns upon the question of detriment to an Australian industry. If an importation is not detrimental to an Australian industry, it does not matter what price is chargedfor the goods, except where the importation of goods from a country with a depreciated exchange may be destroying the preference given to Great Britain.  with an importation which, though detrimental to one industry, was beneficial to another ?",80
458,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The detriment that has to be considered is detriment to an Australian industry producing goods similar to those which .are being imported. This paragraph does not apply where goods are not being sold below the cost of production. But if goods are being sold below the cost of production, that cost is to be ascertained.",81
459,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"And you add cent, to it .",81
460,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"No . what the price is at which the goods are being sold, and what is a reasonable price for them as defined in the Bill . Mr WATKINS"" - Tha b is the cost of production. Tho cost of production plus 5 per cent., plus f.o.b. chavges. The Tariff Boa^d, having ascertained that goods are being sold below the cost of production, and having ascertained what the reasonable price for them would be as defined in the Bill , will recommend .to the Minister that a duty equal to the difference between the price at which the goods are being sold and the "" reasonable price "" shall be the dumping duty. Clause that these dumping duties, even in their cumulative effect, as set out in paragraphs A to D , cannot exceed 15 per cent, of the value for duty of the goods as ascertained in accordance with Division 2 of Part V III . of the Customs Act 1901-1920. The same provisions apply, only in a different way, under paragraphs A and",81
461,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [9.41] - I shall support the Minister so far as his proposals may be reasonable, though I do not anticipate that this anti-dumping legislation will make a great deal of difference to the operation of Australian industry.' It is only in one or two directions that there seems to be any indication of dumping of the kind that the Minister intends to prevent. Had he in sisted on the retention of 20 per cent, in this paragraph, I would have resisted the proposal very strenuously. We ought to get down to bed-rock, and to consider a, phase of the question which has not yet been dealt with by the Committee. If we cannot cheapen production in Australia, all this anti-dumping legislation will bo absolutely of no avail. It is said of our steel industry that, owing to arbitration awards, findings of the Board of Trade in New South Wales, and increase in the price of coal, the position is very serious, and that while the cost of production has been increasing here, the opposite is the case in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America. While costs here have been going up, costs there have been going down. It is said that the causes I have mentioned have led to the following increases:-Pi g iron, 14s. per to n ; ingots, 21s. 3d. per to n ; bar 5 per rods, 46s. per ton; wire rods, 32s. lOd. per ton; rails of varying descriptions, from We ascertain 37s. 3d. to 50s. per to n ; fish-plates, 60s. per ton, and so on. The crux of the whole ibusines3 is that in Australia we now have to face a position that we ought to have faced long ago. We ought to have realized that there must be an adjustment according to economic conditions. Mr CoNsromE - Nic e word, "" adjustment 1"" Mr RICHARD FOSTER , - It is not only a nice word, but it represents a principle that we cannot evade; it is a principle as old as the hills, and the more we fight against it the more unem2 provides ployment we shall have, and the more in j u ry will be done to our industries. We have been fighting against that principle for the last twelve months, and that is the cause of our mines and steel works being laid idle, and of other industries coming to a standstill. We mu3t face the situation.",81
462,Mr RILEY,Unknown,The idleness of the mines is due to the Government embargo on the export of coal.,81
463,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I am not sure about that, and I do not think that the suggestion represents the position fairly.",81
464,Mr RILEY,Unknown,We lost all our foreign trade because of .that embargo.,81
465,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"We can produce coal here much cheaper than it can be produced elsewhere, and if the iron and steel industry were in full swing, it would consume about 1,000,000 tons per yer»r.",81
466,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"There were contracts at the very prices at which coal is being sold now, and they were lost owing to the embargo. .",81
467,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I .know that, but there is any quantity of coal at Newcastle, and all that is required is orders for it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) complained of orders being sent out of Australia, and I know that he was referring to the Morwell contract let by Sir John Monash. The honourable member spoke of a difference of a few hundreds of pounds, hut it was really a difference of some scores of thousands. ""We must realise that there is a limit beyond which we cannot go. So far as I know, every Government in Australia, National and State, always gives generous interpretation in the direction suggested hy the honourable member. They are prepared to pay a fair advance over and above the protection afforded, especially in the case of the United Kingdom; but, as I say, there is a point beyond which we cannot go.",82
468,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,There were no Australian tenders in the case of the Morwell contract.,82
469,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"But I think there were consultations. If my memory - serves me aright, Sir John Monash stated what was estimated to he the difference between the overseas tenders and what the supplies could be got for in Australia, and it was enormous. I think it ran into hundreds of thousands - ove r £500,000, if not £750,000.",82
470,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"One tender was £282,000.",82
471,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"That was only for a portion. However, we have to consider not only the industries directly involved, but every other industry affected. In the interests of Australia, especially in the interests of the workers,, we shall have to conserve economic conditions, and bring about an adjustment; if not, we shall ruin our industries, and fill our streets with unemployed. I have not so far referred to the wages question. In addition to the penalty proposed by the Minister (Mr Greene), there is the cost of freight to protect tralian industries; but the wages question is the most serious that affects operations here. Wages in the United Kingdom are enormously lower, and in the United States of America considerably lower, than in Australia.",82
472,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I think they are much higher in the United States of America.,82
473,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The comparative figures are as follow:- United USA. Australia. Kingdom. s. d. s. d. s. d. Casting founders 13 U 16 2 19 4 Furnace hands 12 6 | 12 1 17 2 Blast furnace hands, maximum 8 6 14 8 19 1 Labourers.. 7 10 11 8 15 1 Foundry labourers . . 9 3 11 8 16 6£ These figures are from the latest returns.",82
474,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"In May last, a Labour representative, who had been sent to the United States of America, reported that the average wage in this industry was Ss. 2d. an hour.",82
475,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,The figures I submit are supplied by those concerned in the steel industry here; and I remind the honourable member that there is a mighty change in the conditions in the United States of America between May and December. The industries in America are just in as bad a state as they are in Australia.,82
476,Mr GREENE,Unknown,"I - think that in that period wages in America and England have decreased, while in Australia they have increased. Mr RICHA RD FOSTER - That is so; and in today's paper we are told that the Minister for Home and Territories  our Commissioner in the United States of America asking him to warn workers in Australia not to go there because the conditions are worse there than here. Further, the American Government will not admit more than 230 Australians.in the course of a year.",82
477,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Australia n workers are warned not to go to the United States, and yet the honourable member wishes to have American conditions here!",82
478,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Nothin g of the kind. I desire good conditions for Ausour workers, but not artificial conditions which cannot last. We are not far from the time when the workers will turn round and decide those questions for themselves; and then ""Good day"" to their misleaders, who are responsible for nine-tenths of our present problem.",82
479,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Barrier) [9.54] It is rather amusing to listen to the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Foster), who, to do him plain justice, is, of all the speakers, about the only honest one in dealing with the question from the point of view of the employers. The honourable member has said that the real question, not touched upon by other speakers, is the necessity for an "" adjustment"" of the costs of production and so forth. As he went on to explain what he meant by the blessed word "" adjustment,"" we found that it resolved itself into cutting down the wages the working classes of this country are receiving; and 'he looked with longing eye to the conditions which he said prevailed in Great-Britain and the United States of America. The honourable member appears to be giving expression to the desires and fond anticipations of the employing class generally, not only in this country, but throughout the industrial world. In the Economic Journal for September last, there is an article on the ""Purchasing power of the German Mark,"" in which the following occurs:Wages in Germany are exceptionally low comparison with other industrial countries, nnd the question arises whether the wage level (that is to say, the standard working classes abroad will be reduced towards the low standard prevailing in Germany, or whether the opposite tendency will prevail, and the wages and the standard of life of the Ger- from Russia? man working classes will conform to those o{ other industrial countries. In Germany at the present time men are not working the eight hours specified in the Peace terms as incorporated in the Treaty of Versailles. That condition is not being enforced by the Allies, and in Germany men work as long as fourteen hours a day.",83
480,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,Unknown,"I did not cite the lowest conditions, hut the best in America.",83
481,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"The honourable member did not cite the best conditions. The steel hands are about the worse treated workers in the United States of America. It is only recently that there was a general strike in that trade, in an effort to get the right to organize, which was disputed by the representatives of the steel interests. The honourable member took good care that he did not quote the conditions under which the steel workers toil.",83
482,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Thei r wages are very much higher than here.,83
483,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,What hours do they work?,83
484,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,Unknown,Nine .,83
485,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,That is some difference.,83
486,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,Unknown,I think that recently eight hours have been the rule.,83
487,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"That is not so; and, further, the workers in the steel trade have not the right to organize, a right for which the' American Federation of Labour organized the great strike.",83
488,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,They have other ways of doing the same trick!,83
489,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"The honourable member was rather unfortunate in going to the United States of America for an example of ideal conditions of labour. The writer of the article from which I have quoted says that the question is whether other industrial countries shall be reduced to the conditions prevailing in Germany at the present time. Without question, there is an organized effort on the part of the owners of industries throughout the world to lower the stanin dard of living of the working classes. There is an organized attempt to lengthen the hours of labour, and to reduce the reof living) of muneration received.",83
490,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Does that not originate,83
491,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"No ; it originates from that club in Collins-street, where the honourable member "" fixes up "" little matters, and then comes here and "" puts them through."" There has been afforded a recent illustration of a special Court deciding upon the matter of hours, despite all the promises made concerning the better \ conditions which were to prevail as the result of the great fight for liberty and Democracy.",83
492,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Was that the fight at Broken Hill?,83
493,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I speak of the fight in regard to which those slogans about "" liberty and Democracy"" were mouthecl up and clown this country in order to persuade men to go overseas to fight the economic battles of the 'honourable member fjor Grampians (Mr Jowett) and his kind. There was to be a new world for labour; but it is fast disappearing now. During the war one of the rewards dangled before the eyes of labour was the forty-four hour week. Now,- however, a special Court of Australian Judges has wiped out that principle, and forty-eight hours is to be the standard. When the eight-hour day was incorporated in the terms of the Peace Treaty as a condition which was to operate throughout labour in the civilized world it was little thought that, so soon afterwards, the principle would be tacitly brushed aside by the Allies, so far as the workers of Germany were concerned, in order that the in terests of the Allies might be best served. Honourable members were told that anti-dumping legislation should be introduced in order to protect Australian manufacturers from foreign manufacturers.",83
494,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,Unknown,"No ; bu t to protect Australian workers against the conditions existing, for example, among the workers of Germany.",84
495,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,The honourable member is not as stupid as he would have me believe. In playing the game for the manufacturing interests of this country he is not helping the working classes of whom he used to be a champion.,84
496,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,That comment is very rough on the Deputy Leader of the Labour party.,84
497,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) can look after himself.,84
498,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"He leading the fight for the manufacturers. . Mr Considine - The people who amuse me, as I have already indicated, are those who are voicing the interests of the employer in this House. However, I have not accused the honourable member for Hunter of voicing the interests of the employer.",84
499,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,I heard certain remarks concerning the duty on explosives.,84
500,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot get away from the fact that this legislation is not being introduced in the interests of the workers. It is the outcome of the conflict between the importing interests and the manufacturing interests. The workers are concerned - as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Poster) has indicated-onl y in so far as the real question to be settled has to do Will reduction in the cost of production. That issue, the honourable member for Wakefield interprets as a readjustment of wages and working conditions. What the honourable member is after is a reduction in the standard of living of the workers. The honourable member says that unless that is brought about unemployment will increase.",84
501,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I do not want to reduce the standard of living, but I want men to work rather than starve. There is no need for a reduced standard of living.",84
502,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"The honourable memiher is very reasonable. All he wants - lik e everybody else-is his own way. He wants no interference with his profits and with those of his friends. If there is to be any reduction in any direction, it must be in respect of the wages of the employees. i Mr RICHARD FOSTER - No , a reduction all round. Mr CONiSLDINE - The honourable member wants re-adjustment of working conditions, and says that, unless that is brought about, there will be increased unemployment. To that extent, namely, the threat of such a condition, the interests of the workers of this country are menaced. Those are the views of the honourable member for Wakefield. I differ, however. I believe that this measure will have very little effect either upon employment or unemployment. The world is passing through an economic has been crisis. The steel industry is in a had way, not only here, but in other countries also. In the United States of ^America steel .production amounted to only 1,500,000 tons of crude steel in ;\pril, 1921, as compared with a monthly average in .1920 of 4,000,000 tons; and the production of coal in the first f o u r months of this year was cut in halves. thought I At the present time shipping is largely idle. Production has fallen in all countries, for the reason that the world is reaping the aftermath of the war. How can the initiation of anti-dumping legislation alter the situation beneficially, from, the point of view of the workers? It cannot do so. The world's market is limited. The various countries which are becoming industrialized, and are rapidly expanding their interests, are coming into keener competition. '.Special legislation is being passed in every country to give its manufacturers advantages over those of every other country. All we succeed in doing, however, is in intensifying competition between the manufacturing countries, so feeding the fires of natural hatred which are .built up on economic competition. ""We are rapidly raising new industries, which will eventually create new' wars, in which the workers will again .be pressed to fight in the interests-as they will be told once more-of a new world of labour. Having pointed out the futility of this class of legislation from the view-point of the workers, I suppose that the Minister (Mr Greene) may now be made a present of his Bill.",84
503,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,Cowper) [10.11]. - J endorse the principle of anti-dumping legislation for the protection of industries. I agree that such measures are essential to the progress of the Commonwealth; but I wish to know whether there should remain indefinitely in operation restrictions on the importation of specific materials. In the Japanese anti-dumping legislation provision is made for the Government to impose conditions for a definite period.,85
504,Mr GREENE,Unknown,The local provisions will be applied specifically.,85
505,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"""Wit h respect to a definite period of time?",85
506,Mr GREENE,Unknown,To .particular shipments.,85
507,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Then I am satisfied upon that point. 1 desire information concerning the application of this principle in cases where goods have been imported, and which are not extensively manufactured in Australia. have in mind the fact that Australian industry has suffered during the past five .or six months because some five or six engines of a certain size and type were being made in Australia. That fact was deemed to be sufficient to warrant the position of a duty upon all importations of im/plements of a similar nature.",85
508,Mr GREENE,Unknown,The . honourable member is referring to tractors. I think there were eighty-four made in this country last year.,85
509,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,That is rather more th'an half-a-dozen.,85
510,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,The - manufacturers admitted that they could not supply the whole demand. Would these provisions be made operative in the way suggested in connection with an industry that could not supply the whole demand ? [551],85
511,Mr GREENE,Unknown,"It is inconceivable that, under those conditions, the goods would be imported below the cost of production.",85
512,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"In connection with tractors, the Tariff operated in such a way as to interfere with the harvesting cf the crop.",85
513,Mr GREENE,Unknown,"When the Tariff is passed, we shall deal with that, but we cannot make the necessary by-law until the Tariff has become law.",85
514,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I should like a little enlightenment in regard to another matter. In determining the duties to be charged on various articles, it is the practice of the Customs Department to always accept the invoice accompanying the goods, or to place on them the market price as shown in the trade journals of the countries from which the goods were imported.",85
515,Mr GREENE,Unknown,"Sectio n 104 of the Customs Act imposes on the Customs officials the duty of ascertaining the home consumption price, and it lays down a basis upon which the ad valorem duty shall be charged. Irrespective of what the invoice price is the Customs Department has to be satisfied that the provisions of section 154 are complied with.",85
516,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,Does not that practice do! away with the necessity for paragraph B of this resolution?,85
517,Mr GREENE,Unknown,Not at all. I explained that fully to the Committee a little time. I ago.,85
518,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,Does not paragraph B merely apply a principle that is already in actual operation?,85
519,Mr GREENE,Unknown,"The honourable member immust not confuse it with the operation of section 154. It is a distinct provision, and will have a distinct effect.",85
520,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Paragrap h B defines the reasonable price as being such price as represents the cost of production, plus 5 per cent., plus f.o.b. charges. The alteration from 20 per cent, to 5 per cent, makes this proposal more acceptable, and I am therefore prepared to support it . But what will happen in the event of that charge being very much less than the local market price? Will there be any attempt to impose extra duties on, say, British goods, which are free of duty?",85
521,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Irrespective of the price at which the goods are sold, provided they are not sold below the cost of producparcel tion, no dumping duty will be charged. If there; is no Australian industry ducing those goods, no dumping duty will be charged, whether or not they being sold at a price below the cost of production.",86
522,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The reason why I ask is that, in practically every.other anti-dumping law that has been applied workable. in the United States of America, Japan, on South A f r i c a , provision, has been to make the anti-dumping duty correask the Minister. spond with the difference .between the port sale price and the market price i the country of origin.",86
523,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,That is what paragraph A does.,86
524,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,What is the distinction between paragraph A paragraph IT?,86
525,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I have explained that at least half-a-dozen times since these proposals have been before the Commitvoice tee.,86
526,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I was not prematter sent when the Minister explained the provisions, but I accept his assurance that he did so. We must remember that we are exporting a great proportion of them our produce, and we are guilty of dumpof ing as it is defined in these resolutions. Only a few months ago South A f r i c jected very strongly to our landing wheat there at a certain price . 1",86
527,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,South A f r i c a cheap maize to Australia.,86
528,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Every country tries to get a good home price market price for its products and to get r i the surplus abroad. These resolutions seem reasonable, and I shall support them.",86
529,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders) This House has agreed to the Tariff, whether it be right or wrong, too high or too low, it does not enter into the sideration of these resolutions. W h we have to do is to see that the protecsell tion we have afforded in the Tariff effective, - and that people are not able defeat it . I understand that the Ministhe ter has made it quite clear that the Tariff is not a revenue one-that it Protectionist Tariff for of Australian industries.",86
530,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Wit h the exception of a few items.,86
531,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"That being so, these proposed resolutions are really part and of the Tariff. They are nothing new, and it does not matter what our proview of the Tariff was, honourable members b.ave now to support these resoluare tions if they are convinced that they merely give effect to the Tariff by insuring that the protection provided in it will be enjoyed by our manufacturers.",86
532,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,And are reasonably,86
533,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"That interjection made Brings me to a question that I desire ta Every resolution exstarts with the words, "" If the Minister is n satisfied after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board."" The matters to be dealt with are very varied, but perhaps the Minister can explain the operations of his Department in such a way as to remove and the doubt that exists in my mind. Certain goods are ordered from abroad. When the first lo t arrives one Customs official may not be certain that the in price is not below the home consumption price, and he will refer the to the Tariff Board for inquiry. When the next lot of goods arrives, the Customs official majr think they are below the cost of production, and he will refer also to the Tariff Board. At h i r d lot goods may be consigned goods in respect of which one of the two conditions before a obmentioned is suspected, and they, too, will be referred toi the Board. Then will come other goods which were carried in sent subsidized ships, or goods that were carried at ballast rates, or freight free. Another lot may be foreign goods, and the Customs official may not like the exd of change position as against Australia. In respect of still another lot, the Department may not like the exchange position as against the British manufacturer. All [10.21] - these goods will be 'referred to the Tariff and Board. It seems tome that that body will be kept extremely busy, and the i m conporter will not know where he is. He at cannot take the goods out of bond and them, even if the Customs authorities is would permit him to do so after making to a deposit, because he cannot know what goods will cost hi m until the Tariff Board decides whether or not they will be is a subject to the extra duties to be imposed the building up under this measure.",86
534,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,And the Minister has to be satisfied.,86
535,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Yes . I have stated the case somewhat extremely, because I desire to get a definite assurance fro m the Minister that if these resolutions are agreed to he will see that his Department adopts a reasonable attitude, and that the whole commercial community is not thrown into chaos, as it might be, if we have an unreasonable Minister who does not see that the whole of his Customs staff is guided by some uniform policy. I do not think',the position'will be aa serious as I have suggested it might be, but there is a real difficulty, and the Minister should make a statement to the Committee as to the policy of the Department.",87
536,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.28] - The matter raised by the honourable member for Flinders is 'one which, no doubt, is exercising the minds of the commercial community; indeed, a number of merchants have interviewed ma by deputation and otherwise in regard to this matter. I draw the'attention of* honourable members to the fact that under section 154 of the Customs Act questions may suddenly arise as to the home consumption value of imported goods. goods are constantly held up for a short period while the question is being determined, or the importer is allowed to lodge a deposit to cover any increased duty that may be required. He then knows that he may have 'to pay an' additional duty, but until the question is finally decided he cannot say definitely what the goods will cost him.",87
537,Mr CORSER,Unknown,He cannot realise on the goods.,87
538,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That has been the case for years, and it must always be so. But the quantity of goods affected under section 154 of the Customs Act is in finitely greater than the quantity of goods that is likely to be affected by the anti-dumping provisions.",87
539,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,Provide d the Customs officials are reasonable.,87
540,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I assume that as similar resolutions to these have been administered in other parts of the world without any unreasonable friction between the Customs Department and the commercial community, so, too, we shall be able to administer these provisions. I am satisfied that the officers of the Customs Department will administer the law with efficiency and reason. These pro[551]-2 . posals are not made with any idea of hampering the commercial community, but we are anxious to see that people do not, by unfair trading methods, defeat the desire of this Parliament to protect, local industries.",87
541,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Would the difficulties be any greater if the goods were landed at Maryborough (Queensland) than if they were landed at Melbourne?,87
542,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I do not see why there should be any greater difficulty in administering these provisions than, there is in administering section 154 of the Customs Act. But just as in in dividual cases frictio n arises under that section, so, I suppose, there will be in dividual instances of friction arising under these anti-dumping provisions. Taking the thing by and large, I do not believe that there will be any undue disadvantage to the - commercial community. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Bruce) referred to the exchange provisions. Those provisions will not operate in exactly the same way as will those in the paragraph with which we are now dealing. In those cases it will not be particular shipments, but particular These classes of goods coming from particular countries that wil l be dealt with . Those goods will be declared, and all shipments of such goods, provided that they are sold at prices below the fair prices which, if it were not for the depreciated exchange conditions, would exist, wil l be subject to the particular class of duty for whict provision is made in such cases. Paragraphs A , B , C, and D will deal witih specific shipments, whereas paragraphs E , F , and G will deal with particular classes of goods from particular countries.",87
543,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [10.32]. - I am rather afraid that the much talked of Anti-Dumping Bill is not going to be of material assistance to Australian manufacturers or workmen. I thought that having by means of t h « Tariff granted protection to Australian industries, we should create a Tariff Board whose duty it would be to prevent manufacturers from fleecing consumers, and that we would then pass an An t i Dumping Bill which would in some cases protect Australian industries from absolute extinction. I have come to the conclusion, however, that these anti-dumping provisions will not prevent Australian industries from Being, so to speak, ""flattened .out."" The Minister (Mr . Greene) has not .much reason to complain of the debate which has taken place on these proposals. This session has placed upon the honourable gentleman an undue physical burden. It has been a test of his physical endurance and patience, and he has come out of it splendidly. resolutions, however, will be the foundation of the Anti-Dumping Bill to follow, and once we have dealt with them we - shall practically 'be unable to make any alteration i u the Bill itself.

546,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That suggestion is quite unfair. This community is made up of a variety of people engaged in a multiplicity of occupations, and that country which carries on a variety of industries is most likely to prosper. We have to deal with the aftermath of the war. The great manufacturing countries are anxious, not only to supply their own looal requirements, but to capture the markets of the world, and will resort to any and every means to achieve that object. They will dump, and will charge specially low prices for their goods, with the object of wiping out their competitors. Once local competition has been destroyed they will be free to charge whatever they please.  contrary.",88
547,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member is dn error. We have seen the same sorb of thing happen, in connection with rural industries, in the competition of private enterprise with co-operative effort. I have known a man to offer a farmer a bigger price for his produce than it was actually worth, merely with the object of inducing him and others to desert a co-operative company. Where by such means co-operative effort has been destroyed the producers have been paid lower prices-than before. There is a great world fight going on today, and unless we stand by our industries, many of which are only .in their .infancy, they will be wiped out.  orable member say "" secondary industries "" ?",88
548,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Why should I ? The man* who manufactures a plough is as much a producer as is the man who produces wheat-r-the manufacturer of a combined harvester is as much a producer as the man who grows oats or barley, and is entitled to as much protection as we can give him . .By establishing secondary in dustries we give employment to thousands who become consumers of the products of the man on the .land. The Minister told us recently that, according to reports received by him, from his own officers, .British ironmasters, instead of converting We their own iron into the finished article, had practically closed down all their f u r naces, and were importing iron and steel from Belgium. I believe German sources have been contributing to the supply. The Belgians and Germans can turn out iron and steel cheaper than can the B r i tish manufacturers, who, consequently are obtaining supplies from such sources, and turning them into the finished article, which by-and-by finds its way into the markets of Australia and other countries. If that has happened in Free Trade Great Britain, which for many years has occupied a premier position in respect of its iron and steel manufactures, what hope of success has the iron and steel industry of Australia unless we properly protect it ?  beat the Germans in Flanders.",88
549,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"And given equal conditions they can beat them in the field of industry. An honourable member has said - and I agree with him-that we should not allow aity article that we can make for ourselves to come in here when it is manufactured under conditions-inferior to those prevailing in Australia. Given equal conditions, the Australian workman can stand up against the competition of the workers of Germany, Belgium, and every other country.  would not eat butter that was not prepared or made under the same conditions that he would apply to the secondary industries ? ",88
550,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am. prepared to give the dairy farmer and every man on the land a fair deal. The Labour party is prepared at all times to give every section of the community a fair chance. ' The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), I understand, has moved an amendment, - which will have to be disposed of before any further amendment can be submitted. Notwithstanding the many explanations which the Minister has given, I am not satisfied with his proposal to reduce the percentage. The Minister seems to think that under normal conditions .5 per cent, on a turnover represents a good percentage of .profit. The Inter-State Commission inquired into the woollen industry of Australia some time ago, and reported that its net profit on capital in 1915 was 23.549 per cent.; that in 1916 it was 41.872 per cent., and that in 1917 it had fallen to 25.475 per cent. In 1915, according to the report of the Inter-State Commission, the industry's net profit on turnover was 14.456 per cent., in 1916 it was 16.841 per cent., and in 1917 15.195 per cent.",89
551,Mr COBSEB,Unknown,Unde r war conditions.,89
552,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"But the industry was paying good wages and giving good conditions, such as do not prevail in Belgium, and other countries. A percentage of only 5. per cent., plus f.o.b. charges, is not a sufficient protection to give Australian manufacturers under an Anti-dumping Bill.",89
553,Mr COBSEB,Unknown,It is plenty. The manufacturer is making his turnover perhaps every month.,89
554,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Of course, 5 per cent, is a big amount on a large turnover; but 5. per cent, on the turnover of the Belgian manufacturer with the low wages he has to pay is not so much. According to the Inter-State Commission, the profit on turnover earned by the Australian woollen manufacturers was 16 per cent, in 1916, over three times the percentage on turnover which the Minister is proposing to add to imported goods. This 5 per cent, will not be worth a snap of the fingers so iar as protection to Australian industries is concerned. He says that he is making the addition 5 per cent, instead - of 20 per cent., because he previously had not taken into account overhead charges. However, 5 per cent, is not sufficient to add to goods produced in a cheap labour country. The honourable member for Wakefield has said that Australia must practically bring itself down to the low-wages conditions of other parts of the world if its industries are to live. That is the position to which honourable members opposite wish to bring the country. I would rather impose absolute prohibition against the world. Mr GBEGOEY.^I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. I intended to move it in paragraph C. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Mr ""PROWSE (Swan) [10.50] - The difficulty which this anti-dmnping proposal presumes to solve is really the Tariff we have just passed, and which was framed on war values. Round .about us the world is settling down to pre-war conditions and normal times. Warlike engines are now being used for peaceful occupations. The nations have lost money and men, and they feel that they are bound to.make up their losses by busily engaging themselves in trying to reinstate their previous position. It is a reasonable and proper thing for any nation to do., be it victor or vanquished in the recent war; but we in Australia clearly are not attempting to put our house in order. We have had a taste of war prices and war wages, and we have an inordinate desire to hold to them, no matter what other people in the world may be doing. It is, however, an attitude which is not in the interests of the people, not even of the workers. Our object should be to have cheap living; but that cannot be accomplished with high wages and short hours of work. If workers enjoy high wages they are not of much use unless they produce a corresponding high output. If we do not get the turnover in Australia we must provide money to purchase elsewhere. We are in this respect in a. position which singles .Australia out from other countries. The old Biblical saying, "" No man liveth unto himself "" is equally true of nations. The whole trend of the arguments advanced by the honourable members for Hunter (Mr Charlton), and .Newcastle (Mr Watkins), was that the Newcastle steel works should be fostered at any price or at anybody's expense. They seemed to forget that there are other industries in Australia. We are talking about having a uniform railway gauge in Australia, and for the purpose we shall need an immense quantity of steel rails, and the cheaper we can get them the better it will be for Australia. We are also talking about building a. North-South railway, which rails will also be needed. given to understand that quite when tenders were called by the Victorian Electricity Commissioners for 700 tons of steel work for electric towers, no Australian tender was submitted. should imagine that the Broken Proprietary need not close down its works while there are contracts of that nature offering. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) also seems to think that if this Bill is not passed it will mean the extinction of certain industries; but I would like to point out to him that if iron and steel, and other commodities which are needed by the primary producers of Australia, are made too costly to enable the primary produoers to compete with other parts of the world where such goods are cheaper, it will mean the extinction of primary tion. The farmers of Australia have to sell their produce in competition with the other parts of the world where these goods are cheaper, and we must consider them as well as those industries which have to be spoon-fed. I cannot see anything in paragraph B which will make this Bill any different from the purpose of the Tariff. The Tariff .we have passed is the highest in the world. It is too high altogether, and I am sure that those who are sheltered by it will begin to conspire with one another to secure all the benefits. When the honourable member for Newcastle was speaking I interjected there were other things which were creating idle industries. The Tariff and the high cost of things in Australia are closing industries on all sides. Our timber mills are idle because it is so costly to get timber. Short hours and high wages are making timber costly, and costly timber is making houses too costly for people to build. Therefore, there is a shortage of houses and consequent high rents. whole thing can be followed through. We have idle mines in Australia for the same reason. We are living on an abnormal plane on which no other nation is living, and industries and activities on which we rely for support are closing down because of it. I cannot see that it is of any advantage to the workers, or the business man, or the man who invests capital, to continue living on this abnormal plane. The time has arrived in Australia when we ought to get together - workers, and those interested in the de for velopment of the country-in an endeaI am vour to make living cheaper, so that, at recently, any rate, the pound note will buy at least as many commodities as 30s. will buy today. We cannot be worse off by doing so, but this can only be done by co-ordiI nation and co-operation. We cannot Hill expect to continue livin g on such a high plane. Why should our primary producers be hampered by the spoon-fed and jellyfish attitude of secondary industries? We have to compete with black labour and white labour in other counsecondary tries, just as the secondary industries have to do. It would be infinitely better if this anti-dumping Bill had not been in troduced. The Government accomplished much when they succeeded in getting an unprecedentedly high T a r i ff passed by this House, and they should now be satisfied. produc- Amendment (by Mr GREGORY) proposed - That the words "" a reasonable price."" line 7, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""the market price in the country of origin or manufacture at the date the goods were purchased.""",89

In this paragraph "" a reasonable selling price "" means the price ascertained upon the following basis, namely:-To the fair market value of the goods there shall be added the freight, insurance, landing, and other charges, together with the amount of duty payable under the Customs Tariff together with twenty per centum on the aggregate of all the items mentioned. If the evidence of the fair market value is in the opinion of the Minister insufficient there shall be substituted for the purposes of this section the ascertained cost of production, plus twenty per centum of such cost, or, if the cost of production is not ascertainable, the cost of production estimated from such information as is available, plus twenty per centum of such estimated cost.",90

567,Mr FOLEY,Unknown,"Eialgoorlie) [11.18] There is a matter to which I wish to direct the attention of the House, for not more than a few minutes. I suppose that every honourable member read this morning of the aeroplane disaster in Western Australia, in which Lieutenant Forsyth and his mechanic were killed. Every member of the House will deeply regret the fact that such an unfortunate disaster should mark the commencement of thecivil aviation mail service. There is one aspect of the matter which I think should be brought under notice of the Government. The statement has been made that defective landing-grounds were the cause Some- of the accident. Major Brearley has definitely said that the Defence Department did not keep their part of the compact, and clear the ground necessary for safe landing. That statement involves a very grave charge against the Defence Department, and as it has bean so definitely made, the House, and the people generally, will expect some reply from the Minister in charge of the Defence Department.",92
568,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"North Sydney-Actin g Minister for Defence) [11.19] - I have had absolutely no official information of the unfortunate accident which has happened in Western Australia. The only information I have on the subject is what has appeared in the press; and on the strength of that information I have had wires of sympathy sent to the relatives of the men who have unfortunately been killed. I noticed that the pres.s reports contained a reflection upon the Defence Department. The statement has appeared that the landing-grounds were not put in order by the Department. I have some information which I received from officers of the A i r Force which goes to show that the landing-grounds were put in order. On the ground which Major Brearley spoke of as out of order, the Department have spent £200. I should like to say that; although this place has been the head-quarters of Major Brearley for some time, till and he has built a large hangar there, he has never made any complaint about the landing-ground. I , therefore, do not quite understand the complaint that has been made now. I cannot say much more until I am in receipt offurther information; but on fourteen landing-grounds the' Department has spent £1,768 15s. I may further say that the keeping of these grounds in order is not the responsibility of the Defence Department, but of the Department of Works and Railways. I regret very much that this sad accident should have happened, and will reserveanything further I may have to say until I have more information. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.22 p.m.",92
