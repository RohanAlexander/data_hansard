2,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of housing service families at HMAS Cerberus. HMAS Cerberus is the significant and panding Royal Australian Navy training establishment with a complement of 132 officers, 310 senior sailors and 460 junior sailors. The number of officers and sailors under training at anyone time giving a total population of about 2,000 serving members. The Defence Housing Authority is responsible for the provision housing for married defence personnel at HMAS Cerberus. There are currently some 554 families located both on board HMAS Cerberus and ashore in the surrounding area. This project is aimed to partially redress the imbalance in housing available on board compared with ashore by increasing on board housing from 109 to 152 in accordance with the Defence Housing Authority's mission to provide defence personnel and their families with good housing consistent with community standards. The work will include the provision of an additional 55 houses on new and revised lots, . the provision of 45 houses as replacements for existing substandard houses, substantial upgrading or replacement of 10 existing older brick houses and the retention of 27 existing houses which require less substantial works. Work is expected to commence in 1994 for completion in 1997 at an estimated cost of $14.2 million. I commend this motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

3,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of Defence office Reference accommodation at Russell, ACT. Russell has been the main administrative and planning centre for Defence for more than 30 the years and is located at the third apex of the Parliamentary Triangle as proposed by Walter Burley Griffin. The Russell Defence complex for consists of 15 buildings, eight of which are considered unsuitable for renovation to current occupational health and safety and exbuilding code of Australia standards. As a result, these will be demolished. Defence also occupies another 10 buildings in the ACT, and it is proposed that four of these buildings be vacated and the staff and functions relocataverages 1,150, ed to Russell. The redevelopment proposal will provide of 54,000 square metres of new office accommodation in two buildings, each of 22,500 square metres and a third of 9,000 square metres; and 30,000 square metres of office accommodation as a result of the refurbishment of four of the existing buildings. The Department of Defence has been working with the National Capital Planning Authority to define the planning constraints to be imposed on any new development at Russell. Defence will also carry out the necessary roadworks to create the development sites in accordance with the National Capital Planning Authority's proposed amendments to the capital plan. The project will be undertaken at an estimated out-turn cost of $212 million, and it is anticipated that construction will start in March 1995 and continue until the year 2000. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",11
4,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of housing for service families at Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, Qld. The Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, which this year saw the establishment of the defence intelligence wing, DIW, is a vital training establishment for the Australian Defence Force, the ADF, with a complement of 364 posted military personnel. The Defence Housing Authority is responsible for the provision of housing for married defence personnel at LWC, Canungra. There are some 211 families located on the base and in the surrounding Gold Coast area. Housing provided by DHA at Canungra is generally well below acceptable community standards and it is increasingly expensive to maintain. The lack of suitable housing is of concern to the military community and reflects poorly upon DHA and the army. Some spot purchasing of civilian community housing in the Gold Coast area, approximately 30 to 40 minutes from Canungra, during 1992 and 1993 has eased pressure to a limited extent but also served to highlight the poor standard of on-base housing. The work will include the provision of 56 new houses as replacements for existing substandard houses on revised lots. Work is expected to commence in 1994 for completion at the end of 1996 at an estimated cost of $7.6 million. I commend the motion to the House.",11
5,Mr TIM FISCHER,COMMITTEES,"I will not detain the House. I indicate the coalition's support for this motion. Some of us have long memories of the Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, otherwise known as the jungle training centre, Canungra. We have pretty ugly memories of that particular location and of the training that we were subjected to many years ago in the 1960s. I have since revisited the centre and have noticed, as is necessary, that the army must have stringent training conditions. Equally, families must have totally adequate conditions and that is why we support this reference to the public works committee. From my own experience, I have seen the operation of this committee second-guess some of the recommendations that are brought forward from time to time and improve on those recommendations with regard to some of the detailed aspects of redevelopment. One case in point was at Albury-Wodonga, and this may well be the case at Canungra. Certainly, additional housing of adequate standard for service families in close proximity to the Land Warfare Centre and a new defence intelligence wing at Canungra are worthy of support, given the very high cost of accommodation that pertains on the coastal corridor just to the east of that location. I therefore support the motion. In addition to all of that, there is an underrecognised museum at Canungra, which relates to the coast watching services that were provided during World War n, the 50th anniversary of which we are leading to the culmination of next year. I commend that particular facility as one worthy of a visit as it recognises that part of our rich military heritage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",12
6,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Refurbishment of Scarborough House and construction of Commonwealth offices, Phillip, ACT. The 1992-93 budget provided for the refurbishment of Scarborough House together with construction of an annex building to provide office accommodation for the AIPO in the Woden town centre. Scarborough House has not undergone major refurbishment since constructed in 1970. The building's internal fabric is now at the end of its economic life and its services are generally below currently required standards. The proposal is for the total refurbishment of the building and upgrading of base building services to be of a standard commensurate with current commercial office building standards. The proposed new building will provide approximately 10,400 square metres of net lettable area for offices and approximately 600 square metres of net lettable area for storage. The estimated outturn costs for both the Scarborough House refurbishment and the new building's construction-including AIPO's fitout cost-is $50.38 million. The project will be undertaken in two stages with the construction of the new building scheduled to commence in July 1995 and it will conclude with the refurbishment of Scarborough House to be completed by February 1998. I table the supporting drawings and commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Native Title Committee",12
7,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on Native Title, I present the first report of the committee entitled Consultations during August 1994, together with the evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
8,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This committee was formally established with the full complement of its members in May. The committee chose to use the winter parliamentary recess to consult widely across the nation. Consultation meetings were held in Sydney, Brisbane, the north of Queensland, Perth and the north of Western Australia. The committee had discussions with the Western Australian government, miners, farmers, the tourism industry, lawyers, local government authorities, Aboriginal people and Aboriginal organisations. The report does not make recommendations regarding the government's native title legislation, but it summarises the issues raised from consultations with the committee. It is the view of the committee that it is still too early in the implementation of the native title legislation to make a definitive judgment on the need for amendments or recommendations to this House or the Senate. Rather, it is the view of the committee that the clarification the Mabo II decision that will arise out High Court consideration of challenges by the Western Australian government and also challenges by Aboriginal groups in Western Australia to their state legislation needs to be understood before the parliament can make any definitive judgment. My early impression is that the government can be well pleased with the progress of its native title legislation. While changes to the legislation may usefully be considered after the Western Australian government's High Court challenge next year, there is no evidence to justify rushed amendments. The legislation should be allowed to work in practice, free from pre-emptive strikes against native title by the coalition parties and business interests. Each of the concerns of industry can be Report resolved under the current provisions. Quite simply, the Native Title Act is not aggressively set against the interests of private investment. Unlike the Northern Territory legislation, it has no mining veto. Special measures under the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act have been used to secure leases and freehold tenure. At a cost of just $300 and with minimal delay, businesses can lodge non-claimant applications under the legislation to clarify whether native title applies to the parcels of land in which they hold an economic interest. Nonetheless, some captains of industry are on edge and have presented their concerns to the committee. They have been agitating under the all-purpose banner of investment uncertainty. In a market economy, certainty never exists: only varying degrees of uncertainty. When asked in Brisbane to define his argument for certainty under the Native Title Act, the head of the Queensland Mining Council expressed an expectation for all legal issues to be fully resolved. In the early days of any new statute, not just native title, this is near impossible. Our system of government allows the parliament to enact and the courts to interpret. Legal certainty on native title must await the High Court challenges and a range of test case claims in the Federal Court. Without the of Native Title Act, the High Court's 1992 Mabo of the II ruling would by now have produced at common law scores of native title claims and injunctions, each questioning the validity of freehold and leasehold investments. This would have been the mother of all uncertainty. The mining and pastoral industry chiefs have concentrated their complaints on the so called low threshold test whereby claims on pastoral leases have been registered by the Native Title Tribunal. Even though valid pastoral leases extinguish native title, the act of extinguishment may raise issues of compensation paid by government and land access, which the tribunal or Federal Court can properly consider. Coexistence, where graziers and Aborigines use the land on a pastoral lease, need not damage the interests of either party. The Law Society of New South Wales has testified to the committee that the legal rights of property holders and leaseholders are in no way diminished by the low threshold test. The National Farmers Federation is aware that non-claimant applications could clarify this issue for its membership but so far has failed to act. Pastoralists have in their hands the catalyst for dealing with claims of uncertainty. Claims of reduced mining exploration or delayed tourism permits need to be supported by a rational assessment of cause and effect, not just anecdotes and rumours. The peak industry councils should not be allowed to set up native title as a catch-all scapegoat for fluctuations in investment. As ever in the electronic media, simple misrepresentations are easier to communicate than complex facts. The work of our committee has been to sort through those suggestions and try to find instances of investment that has been delayed or cancelled. It has been very hard for the committee to find that definitive evidence. It is clear that a range of industry groups, especially those in Western Australia, do not want the Native Title Act to proceed. They are seeking to avoid the provisions of the act while undertaking private legal advice on the applicability of native title to development projects; that is, they are sidestepping the legislation, taking their own legal advice, and then proceeding on the basis of that advice with exploration and mining. Public claims of uncertainty and chaos are designed to mount political pressure on the legitimacy of the legislation. From consultations with the committee, it is clear that there is enough evidence for the Liberal and National parties to reassess their stance on native title. It is regrettable that not one of the committee members from the opposition is present in the chamber to contribute to the tabling or debate on this report. I would have thought that the shadow spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), would have been here contributing to the tabling of this important report. It is not good enough for the opposition to say that native title is a matter for states rights because in Western Australia leaving it to the state government means that native title will be abolished. That has been the purpose of the Court government. Consultations with the committee show that the Liberal Party's confusion about these issues is noted by Aboriginal people. It needs to do a lot better. I am not saying that the Liberal Party or the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) is racist in his views, but certainly paternalism underlies the way in which the coalition has addressed this issue. Paternalism relies on a pessimistic judgment about the nature of Aboriginal people: that they cannot be relied on to make effective decisions about their needs and welfareneither land, employment nor social conditions. Only affluent European stock can make these judgments. This is the missionary reborn into public policy. A truly Liberal Party would regard any denial of decision making as a fundamental breach of human rights. In any disadvantaged community, irrespective of race, progress cannot be sustained without a growing sense of confidence and higher expectations. Welfare dependency can only paper over the cycle of defeat among demoralised people. Access to traditional land is the key to lifting up the spirit and expectations of Aboriginal people. More than a matter of cultural rights, it is an essential foundation for economic and social justice. With native title and the tools of local self government, each community and tribe can move closer to self-sufficiency. No Aboriginal group in Australia has ever argued that, beyond the short tenn, social and health standards can be advanced without access to traditional land. I urge the Liberal and National parties to take a greater interest in the work of the committee. It is disappointing that the shadow spokesperson is not present in the chamber to participate in these matters. As a product of this report and the committee's consultations, the coalition should end its opposition to the concept of native title in Australia. This is not a matter of states rights but a true national responsibility properly discharged by this parliament.",13
9,Mr KNOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-When this Native Title Bill was first introduced into this parliament, I asked the people in my electorate, particularly those in the RSL, to reflect on how we would feel and where we would be as ordinary Australians had an invasion by the Japanese taken place. It is quite an appropriate argument, and there has been some discussion about that argument. But now, over the next 12 months, we will be looking at the 50-year anniversary of the war with its potential for invasion, and it is very much time for us to reflect on our own values and on the way Australian people would have evolved if, in fact, that invasion had taken place. The relevance of these remarks to this debate is that an invasion, in fact, did take place 200 years ago. The members of the Joint Committee on Native Title have been touring all around this country and having a good look at what is happening within this country's communities. It was my privilege, with a number of others on that committee, to go to Western Australia-it was the first time. I had ever been to Western Australia-to tour through those communities and to see what has happened. Quite honestly, I have to say to this House that the love and tolerance that were shown by the members of the Aboriginal community were quite outstanding. If those of us who are members of the white Anglo-Saxon, Celtic and multicultural communities in Australia had experienced the havoc which has been wreaked on Aboriginals and their families, if we had suffered the indignities that they have suffered in their dissociation, divorce and breaking away from the land-even though the ownership of that land is not a cultural concept to them; in fact, it is the reverse: the land, the mother earth owns them-if our families had been broken up and our children stolen, which is what happened in New South Wales, I wonder whether we would show the same degree of love and tolerance that the Aboriginal people show. One of the big things that has really moved me about this issue is that level of spirit within the Aboriginal people. I think it is one of the truly remarkable things about the Aboriginal people in this country. If, in essence, you have to find a reason why they have survived, I would put it down to that great, endearing quality within them. This report into the Native Title Act is the beginning of an investigation to try to make sure that the process that we go through works. Many great ideas-I will not discuss them now-are put forward by politicians, and then, after they have been translated by bureaucracies, are totally transfonned and become completely different animals. We are attempting through this committee, through this first report and its subsequent reports, to make sure that the great idea, the great value that was put forward with this native title legislation, is translated into real communities, into real people in the fabric of Australian life. I have great respect for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and for the vision and leadership he has shown in the hard ball game of politics, which have enabled us to make this courageous decision and to now follow it through. Mr Speaker, I am sure that you will find, as will everyone else in this House, that those from both sides of the House who are serving on this committee will put all their efforts into making sure that this committee reflects the true values of the Australian community-values that are there, even though we cannot always see them. I speak of the values of toleration and inclusion and of that old much used cliche of 'a fair go'. It has taken us a long time to realise that Aboriginal Australians should also get that fair go. But there is another old adage: it is never too late. We have made that decision and we have formed this committee to make sure that our high ideals are translated into real policies. We realise that our high ideals have to be delivered and that the bureaucracy has to put in place the appropriate arrangements. That is the task that confronts this committee, and this report is the first of an ongoing series. commend the report to the House. I hope that the work which the committee undertakes in the future will ensure that we earn the long term respect of the community for the decisions that we have made in this place.",15
10,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEES,"by leaveUnfortunately, I was at a meeting which is currently in progress. I heard on the grapevine that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) said that I should be here. So I have left the meeting in somewhat of a disarray to come to make a statement in this place. It is with regret that I have come to learn that this debate on the first report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title has been a somewhat political one. It is always of great distress to me when these types of committees become too political. My understanding is that most of these joint committees work best when they are not political. I once shared a committee with the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), who is at the table, and I was always delighted that the committee never brought down a minority report; the members of the committee worked very well together. I would hope that the Joint Committee on Native Title will do so in the future and that no political stand is taken. I reiterate the coalition's commitment to betterment of Aboriginal people in this country through the processes whereby common law has established that native title exists. That has been a very important step for this country. The coalition totally and utterly supports the High Court's decision on native title and it will not pull back from that. There is no secret that the coalition had enormous concerns about the Native Title Act; those concerns remain and many of them are coming out as a result of the activities of this committee. The committee has heard from Aboriginal people across Australia who do not understand the act and for whom the act has caused great confusion and unhappiness. I have talked to Aboriginal groups around Australia with the committee and by myself. I have been told by Aboriginal groups in Western Australia that this Mabo business is dividing Aboriginal people. As somebody who has an I interest in and cares for the Aboriginal people, that causes me great distress. To use an exact quote, Aboriginal people have told me, 'There will be bloodshed over this.' Mr Knott-This is outrageous.",16
11,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,It's true. You have not been anywhere to know. How would you know?,16
12,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! The member for Mitchell and the member for Gilmore, speakers in this debate have been heard in absolute silence, as will the member for Hindmarsh.",16
13,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEES,"Aboriginal people have said in sincerity, 'How can people who have not walked on my land make claim to my land?' This is a problem that is coming up in Aboriginal communities. Aboriginal people have shown me lists of people who have made claims and they have said, 'This fella is not from my land.' This matter is causing problems in these communities. I do not think that the members of the committee or members across the chamber would want these sorts of things to happen, but they are some of the results. There are the obvious problems-which the press makes much of-where there are claims over pastoral leases. There are problems of how we are ever going to have a mediation the process when there are up to 220 claimant and non-claimant applications for one area. This situation is a mediation nightmare. These are some of the problems that are arising from this act. The coalition foresaw these problems in the way that this act was quickly cobbled together. This committee now has the responsibility to examine the resulting statutory legislation. The work of the committee is going to go ahead. I look forward to being a part of the committee in the months to follow to examine the effects of this legislation. Hopefully, the work of the committee will result in the legislation being improved, updated and changed to properly reflect the needs of Aboriginal people as weIl as the needs of the wider Australian community. Public Accounts Committee",16
14,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to table on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the Finance minute in response to the committee's report 326An assessment of tax. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you may recaIl, I tabled the committee's report 326 in November last year. The report contained 148 recommendations which were aimed at improving the administration of Australia's tax system. The committee's recommendations have been very favourably received by many individuals and organisations working in the tax profession. I am pleased to say that the government too has responded positively to our recommendations. In August this year the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) released the government's response to the 60 recommendations of the committee on matters of policy. The Finance minute I have just tabled is the second and final part of the government's response to the report. The Finance minute addresses the 88 recommendations of the committee which deal with administrative matters. In summary, the vast majority of the committee's recommendations have been accepted and are being implemented. Some of the most significant policy recommendations agreed to by the government are: to est.ablish the tax law improvement project, the alm of which is to rewrite and simplify the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936' to establish a smaIl taxation claims tribun;l to provide a cheap and streamlined review process for taxpayers with claims below $5,000; to sponsor the development of a charter of taxpayer rights to better define the relationship between taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office; to create a taxation ombudsman within the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to provide a discrete and readily identifiable avenue of administrative review for taxpayers; and to publish rulings issued the tax commissioner in the Commonwealth Gazette and table them in parliament within five sitting days of publication. The administrative recommendations accepted by the government cover such matters as: encouraging the further development of the Report ATO's computer systems, particularly to aIlow external access to some databases; providing explanatory information which is well targeted, accurate and up to date; improving the quality of training for staff involved in tax audits; and restructuring the ATO and reorganising particular groups within the office. The measures contained in the Finance minute, in conjunction with those announced by the Assistant Treasurer, will go a long way towards ensuring that ordinary taxpayers are treated fairly, are clearly informed of their rights and have access to appropriate forms of administrative review. I believe it is vitaIly important that the momentum for change which has been generated by the committee's inquiry and by the positive nature of the government's response not be lost. The committee, therefore, intends over the next few months to meet with the tax commissioner, Michael Carmody, to discuss the implementation of those recommendations which have been accepted and also to meet with the director of the tax law improvement project, Brian Nolan, to discuss progress in the simplification of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The rewrite of the tax act is a very significant undertaking with potentially huge benefits for the Australian community. Although the early results from the improvement project are encouraging, I know that there are some in the tax profession who are concerned that the complexity of the tax laws will not be substantially reduced unless questions of tax policy are considered as they arise. I am inclined to agree that the best results will be achieved if the substantive provisions of the law are reviewed at the same time as the words are being redrafted. The work of the Corporations Law simplification program shows that such a task can be undertaken successfully. In conclusion, as the Finance minute acby knowledges, the committee's report has created a real opportunity for change. I am pleased that the government and tax office have shown a willingness to grasp the opportunity, and I am hopeful that the changes being made will be to the benefit of all taxpayers. Public Accounts Committee",17
15,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following report: Report 334-report of activities 1993-94. Ordered that the report be printed.",18
16,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to present, on behalf of the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the committee's annual report of activities for 1993-94. This report, which is the 334th tabled by the committee since 1951, presents an overview of the committee's activities for the last financial year. The committee began the practice of presenting annual reports to parliament in 1976. Prior to that date, the committee regularly prepared indexes of committee reports for the information of parliament and less frequently tabled statements of committee activities and procedures. The committee's decision to prepare annual reports was explained in the 1979 annual report in the following terms: In reporting this way to parliament, the tee has recognised its responsibility as a statutory body to report on its activities. This committee has always taken the view that bodies established by the parliament should report to the parliament and has been in the vanguard of encouraging increased standards and regularity in reporting. This statement is as valid today as it was in 1979. The period 1993-94 was a year in which the committee tabled five reports, published a discussion paper in relation to its inquiry into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments and gave its approval to a new set of annual report requirements for Commonwealth departments. The most significant of the reports tabled was undoubtedly report 326, An assessment of tax, which I tabled the finance minute on today. The inquiry was a significant exercise which generated considerable attention within government circles and the wider community. It is the committee's hope that its recommendations will lead to real improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of Australia's tax system. Other reports tabled by the committee in 1993-94 were report 327, which contained the Report committee's comments on aspects of the finance minute in relation to the report of the Midford Paramount inquiry; report 328, which was the committee's report of activities for 1992-93; report 329, which contained all the finance minutes presented in response to committee reports in the year 1993; and report 330, which presented the results of the committee's review of those reports of the Auditor-General which had been tabled in the period 1991-92. One notable development in the last financial year has been the committee's decision to give a renewed focus to its statutory responsibility to examine reports of the Auditor General. The committee believes this responsibility to be one of its most important duties. The committee has developed new procedures to allow it to report regularly to parliament on its examination of audit reports. These procedures are described in chapter 4 of the annual report. Another highlight in the committee's year has been its approval of the new annual report commit- requirements for departments. The new requirements state that an annual report must be tabled by 31 October and call for a much sharper focus on past year program performance rather than on administrative details. For over 60 years, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has watched over the expenditure of public money by successive Commonwealth governments. I believe that the committee's work over the last 12 months has continued the tradition of helping keep the executive accountable to parliament. The committee's achievements in the last year would not have been possible without the energy, enthusiasm and commitment displayed by my fellow committee members. For this, I thank them. On behalf of the committee, I also thank the very enthusiastic and hard working staff of the committee secretariat for their dedication and professionalism throughout the year, which I have referred to when I have tabled previous reports in this place. I commend the report to the House. Public Accounts Committee",18

EMPLOYMENT SERVICES BILL 1994 Cognate bill: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 August, on motion by Mr Crean: That the bill be now read a second time.",19
19,Mr CADMAN,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Mitchell) (10.10 a.m.)We are considering today the Employment Services Bill and a cognate bill. This legislation follows from the government's initiatives in the green paper and then in the white paper Working Nation which was presented in May. When the white paper was first presented the House, it seemed as if it was a sunshine document to drive away the dark clouds of view unemployment. It was of little substance but not contained a lot of light talk. This legislation goes to the heart of the government's ments made in the white paper. The white paper announced a range of initiatives achieve the government's stated objectives. One of the reasons the House has become particularly interested in this legislation it contains a number of initiatives of a that the parliament has not seen before. It establishes a working relationship between the Commonwealth Employment Service and a whole range of privately employed case managers who will be working on a contract basis with the CES or a subsidiary of the CES Report known as the Employment Services RegulaESRA's role is to make sure that the manof people who have been so unfortunate as to be unemployed, particularly those who have been unemployed for a substantial period, is done in a way that enables those people to gain the best benefits. What the Report government is doing is in a way inventing a 16th new quango to move the management of long-term unemployment further away from government. The government seems to be distancing itself and its agencies from the in the problems of people suffering long-term unemployment. There are many features of this legislation of which one could be critical. The major thing that appeals to most members of this House is that the government is trying to do something about the situation, even if belatedly. It blew up the economy, it caused massive BILL 1994 sackings and it produced massive bankruptcies, but now belatedly-three or four years beyond the time when it should have been showing some interest in the unemployed-it is introducing an initiative to help those people. We wish it well, even though the initiative is too late, it seems inappropriate and it has obvious flaws. The greatest flaw is that the government has declined to apply itself to providing sustainable job opportunities. Hence the opposition moved a second reading amendment to this to legislation which stated: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a to substituting the following words: ""whilst declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House deplores the Government's failure to provide commitreal sustainable job opportunities'. The fact of the matter is that the government to has not applied itself to the detrimental employment features in the current economy, nor has it applied itself in budgetary and is that financial management terms to determining type the most appropriate strategies to create employment. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) hates to admit failure or any flaw. The Prime Minister's overweening pride and his absolute enthralment with his own ability have meant that he and his lifestyle have become remote from the Australian people. As a result, he does not want to admit that he has caused a massive failure in the Australian economy and that he and his government have wrecked the lives of over a miIlion Australians. He has done that but refuses to admit it. If he were to admit it, he would then set about facing the issue squarely instead of this window-dressing with a quango endeavouring to case manage those who are unemployed. At best this is a patch-up process. It is not dealing with the core of the problem for the unemployed. The government's record for creating employment opportunities is mixed. It certainly has created massive unemployment. Over the last few months with the slight improvement in the economy the employment position has changed. But today we read predictions from the Reserve Bank and others that we are not too far away from further dreadful times unless the government takes appropriate action to try to manage the economy and the processes needed to sustain employment. So the government has failed to focus on employment for Australia-what are the impediments to employment and how can we have the economy moving so that businesses and government can employ people? That should be a prime responsibility of government. But the government has not recognised that. Instead we have the legislation before us today, the Employment Services BiIl and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill. The House was pretty concerned about the style of this legislation. I am thankful that government agreed that this legislation could go before one of the committees of the House of Representatives-the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is an unusual process for a bill on employment to go before the legal committee of the House of Representatives. The original concerns that were raised about this legislation related to privacy and to the role of the ombudsman in being able to check up on behalf of clients of the case managers as to whether they were receiving appropriate treatment, whether they had been properly dealt with. The other privacy factor related to the privacy constraints upon private contractors working with people who had been on the unemployment list for 12 months or so. In the process of counselling and encouragement of those who had been unemployed for 12 months, those contractors had come to gain a lot of private information about income levels, about family situations, about relatives, about attitudes, about possessions-all of which is part of assessing a person's eligibility for government programs, unemployment benefits, and government support schemes and encouraging them to take employment or training. So there was concern on the part of the parliament about the privacy aspects that relate to individuals coming to a private contractor under direction of the Commonwealth government. It was not long, however, into the consideration of this legislation before the legal and constitutional affairs committee of the parliament realised that it was necessary for the sake of both the House and the Senate that we look more broadly than at just the privacy issues or the role of the ombudsman at fair play for the clients of ESRA-the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. It is not usually the function of a legal committee to look at policy matters. So it was a new experience to have before the legal and constitutional affairs committee of the House of Representatives people from a range of government and non-government agencies responsible for employment policies and programs-from the Salvation Army, the the Brotherhood of St Laurence and similar organisations-to explain exactly what they felt about the policies lying behind this legislation and whether they would work. Because these agencies deal on a day-today basis with people who have been unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, it was possible to gain an impression of the effectiveness of the government's policies. The report of the committee made some very strong recommendations about the government's proposals, which were set out first in this legislation. In fact, the governwhat ment was so pleased with the fact that the committee was doing this work that it decided to load another bundle of amendments onto it, hoping that the committee would pick up a fresh lot of amendments. The committee felt it was unjustifiable to accept these amendments and felt that it was completely inappropriate and wrong of the department to try to swing onto a committee of the House of Representatives matters to which we were uncommitted and which the parliament had not said we should investigate. The government bears responsibility for any comments or any mess that might ensue from that last batch of amendments proposed by the government. The recommendations of the committee went to the heart of the legislation and found that there were a number of deficiencies. will list some of the deficiencies because I think the public of Australia and those operatintroduced ing in the system need to understand why parliamentary committee was appointed carry out this task, what that parliamentary committee found and the deficiencies that pointed to, both in the government and Public Service process of designing legislation this type. The committee recommended in one inwhat stance that even the definition of case mantheir agement should be amended. Case managething. ment is the process of taking people who are long-term unemployed and sitting down and examining in detail with them what is the most appropriate work pattern and the most effective training for them. This is done on one-to-one counselling basis to try to come grips with personal or geographical difficulthis ties of employment, to try to come to grips with the core reasons that person has been unemployed for a very long period. One of the first recommendations from the committee's inquiry was that the bill amended so that the case manager's role more clearly defined to accurately portray responsibility the case manager has to assist job seekers to find and maintain secure employment. That was a deficiency of the legislation. The very core of it was the case management process, yet the definition of case managers were supposed to do was lacking. The significant feature of applying responsibility to the very essential activists, the very central providers of information, sustenance and encouragement to those who are unemployed, was not in the legislation. The committee said that it had to be there or the legislation would not work. The committee found that the government had not applied itself to the needs of people with disabilities and those with other disadvantages, for example sole parents, in formulating the disallowable instruments. I explain to the House in passing that one of the features of this bill which I think is deplorable is having the framework of the bill erected and then being told, 'Well, you guys are all going to find out what this biIl does later I because there is no substance in it.' The Employment Services Bill when first contained nothing of substance to a tell anybody anything. The government said, to 'We are going to have a whole lot of disallowable instruments.' Disallowable instruit ments are regulatory processes that limit the Public Service in the process of applying the of government's policy. They say how much people are paid, how they can be sacked, job specifications they should have, who clients should be-all of that sort of The very detail of the way in which something is going to work has in this instance been formulated in disallowable instruments. I find that obnoxious. The government has a asked the parliament to undertake a program to which it proclaims as the natural follow-on of great white paper Working Nation, and to accept it and the legislation without detail. Talk about buying a pig in a poke or signing a blank cheque! One of the strong objections of the House be of Representatives Standing Committee on is Legal and Constitutional Affairs concerned the why the government had adopted this mechanism as one of its major initiatives. Why has the government decided to keep secret from the parliament the way in which this program is going to work? Due to the work of the committee, the government and the department made a commitment that details of disallowable instruments and any other regulatory processes will be made available to the Senate before the Senate considers the legislation. When the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) replies to the debate, I want a confirmation that that will be the case. Otherwise, the government will be continuing with this facade. This legislation in the House of Representatives is nothing more than a facade. Members of the House of Representatives do not know what this bill is going to do. We have a rough idea. All the detail is somewhere else: it is buried back in the department. Nobody in this place knows it. The government has a bright idea that it hopes will work, and that idea is basically supported and encouraged by those who are responsible for programs for the unemployed. The government has brought it into the parliament as a framework, but the detail of that framework is lacking. There is no detail at all. There is no substance to what the government is proposing. We do not know whether the disallowable instruments will give full attention to people who are disabled or disadvantaged. The parliamentary committee of this House believes that they should. The government needs to give that assurance. The committee also said that it believes that, in the case management process, ESRA and the Department of Employment, Education and Training should look at payment on results. If we are going to have private enterprise case managers in this process, they can be employed forever on a piecework basisso many clients per hour or per day-but nobody cares too much about the results. So payment for results was one of the recommendations of the committee. We want to see a greater focus by those case managers on resolving unemployment problems. We also felt that this process was necessary to ensure that Commonwealth funds were expended appropriately and that the government was not paying twice-or even more times-for an individual placement to be arranged. We believe that the central agency, ESRA, should take into consideration the difficulties that apply in rural and remote areas where it is extremely difficult to find employment. In rural areas you can case manage until the cows come home but, if there are no jobs, people are not going to get employment. ESRA should take into account the problems of rural and remote areas. There is also a need to maintain a service so that people can upgrade their educational and employment skills, even in remote areas. Consultative committees are part of this legislation. In western Sydney, we are in the process of establishing a consultative committee. It is the first step in the whole box and dice of this new age in which it is believed that by case managing long-term unemployed we are somehow going to get them jobs. In conclusion, I go back to my opening statements. This legislation is, no doubt, necessary and well-founded. However, it lacks detail, which is deplorable. It is also based on the white paper Working Nation, which cannot be counted as any more than a broad statement of intent and a whitewashing of the government's failure in the economy and the government's failure to think of the people of Australia needing employment. The bankruptcies and the sackings that have taken place under this government are shameful. The government continues to fail to apply itself to the needs of Australians, to the disabilities that are preventing employment and to the management of the economy in such a way as to create jobs positively through a healthy economy.

20,Mr OCONNOR,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"by leave-I have previously taken the opportunity to participate in the general debate in this House on the Employment Services Bill, which seeks to give effect to the initiatives contained in the white paper on employment and growth entitled Working Nation, brought down by the government in May this year. I am pleased to report to the House that in my electorate there has been a very strong community response in support of the initiatives contained in the white paper. We have seen the public sector, the private sector, community groups, employers and unions come together to fonn a campaign entitled Jobs Action Geelong, which is well under way and which is achieving some encouraging results. I will speak about that a little later. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate both the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who is in the House, on their tireless efforts in managing this rather momentous structural and administrative change to the delivery of labour market programs in this country. They have worked tirelessly to encourage employers to take up the range of concrete employment initiatives that have been provided under the white paper, and we are now starting to see the runs appear on the board. My electorate has a very professional private case management sector. I am very much looking forward to its participation in the task that the community is facing in bringing the long-tenn unemployed and the generally short-tenn unemployed back into the work force as quickly as possible. We also have a very dedicated and expert public sector labour market delivery system. I commend the work that is being done by members of the CES, employees of the government of the day, in their efforts to come to grips with a problem that besets not only the community of Geelong but also many other communities throughout the length and breadth of this country. I want to briefly outline some of the amendments made by the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994. They reflect some concerns and some proposals of a committee of this House. These amendments basically seek to amend the Freedom of Infonnation Act 1992, to extend the powers of the ombudsman and to amend the Privacy Act 1988 and the Social Security Act 1991. These amendments are mainly designed to improve the flexibility and the delivery of services to clients and to protect clients and case managers once this particular case management system really grinds up, and I expect that will occur to an even greater extent as we move into 1995. The consequential amendments bill amends the Freedom of Infonnation Act 1992 by providing members of the public with the right to access to documents relating to case management services that are held by contracted case managers. It is very important that clients are assured that they will have access to documentation generated by private contract case managers should they require it. The bill also gives the ombudsman the power to investigate complaints about contracted case managers. The opportunity is there for the ombudsman to investigate these matters or to refer them to ESRA should the ombudsman consider that appropriate. The bill also amends the Privacy Act by protecting clients in respect of information generated under this particular system. From time to time, information between the client and the contracted case manager is of a fairly personal nature. It is important for clients to understand, appreciate and have confidence that the information generated will be protected by the Privacy Act. The Employment Services Bill 1994 establishes the case management system. This represents one of the most significant refonns in the delivery of labour market programs that Australia has seen at least in the last decade. One could not expect that, with a refonn of this magnitude, we would get great results overnight. It is a system that will improve dramatically over time. We ought not to have great and unrealistic expectations of what might be delivered in a period of some months with such a momentous refonn. It will take time for the expertise and the systems to be built up, for the bugs to be ironed out and for the system to be working at its most effective. Even in the few months that this system has been in place, we have seen rather impressive-let me say quite dramatic-results. For example, in the period from April to October we have seen some 160,000 unemployed people enter that case management system. The figures indicate that in the vicinity of 2,000 case managers are now working in the field. The minister has reported to the House that the case management system is proceeding on schedule. As I have indicated, a natural momentum will be built up more in 1995 than in 1994. We on this side of the House are very pleased with the introduction of this system. We have had a lot of debate in this chamber about the case management system, and members opposite have levelled some rather harsh criticism at the government's desire to quickly introduce it. But we all should look at this reform from the client's perspective. In the past, governments of all political persuasions have failed the clients in many ways. It is not a pleasant task for an unemployed person to walk into a CES office, which may be old and which may not be user friendly, go to a rather impersonal interview and then hazard themselves with everybody else on the unemployment queue to get a job off the board, so to speak. Unemployed people will now, under the case management system, receive far more personalised attention in addressing their particular needs and their particular problems. The case management system will provide an assessment of job readiness to that unemployed person. There will be personal contact between the unemployed person and the bureaucracy-in this case, the case manageron a continuing basis over time. They will be dealing with somebody who, like themselves, has a vested interest in the success of what is being undertaken and who is committed to achieving results. What is also overlooked is the positive impact that this will have on the employees of the government-I am referring to public sector managers-who will receive a lot of personal benefit from this sort of exchange. They will undertake a more personal contact with clients, will have a better opportunity to develop their own personal skills and work skills and will have a very powerful and strong interest in achieving outcomes. This is what the government is really on aboutachieving real outcomes with the introduction of this system. From society's perspective, when it is outlaying significant amounts of money to this task, we will get greater efficiency and a better result from the dollar. I take issue with the opposition on the way that it has criticised the government for the introduction of this initiative. I do so on the basis that it has argued before this House that the only people who will gain employment from the introduction of this system will be those in the public sector. That may be so. There may be an increase in the number of people who are employed in the public sector. But the opposition cannot then come into the House and say, 'You set a target for 2,000 case managers by this time. There aren't 2,000 case managers working in the field. You have failed.' Those opposite cannot mount that particular argument. It is not a valid way of approaching the argument. The minister refuted that in the House the other day when he said, 'If you can achieve a significant outcome-a target ahead of schedule-with a minimum number of staff and you are doing it efficiently and effectively, surely that is the name of the game. Surely you should attempt to do that?' We have seen a dramatic and significant improvement in unemployment over time. Those opposite have always criticised the government for the fact that it has not created jobs. It is not the role of government to create the jobs. It is the role of government to set the general economic framework in which the private sector will invest and enterprises and employment will grow. Any fair analysis of what Australia is experiencing at this point compared with some 10 years ago would indicate that we have the best framework in place and the best chance of the private sector growing and creating the jobs that we so desperately need. We have high growth-the highest growth in the OECD. In an historical sense, we have a low level of interest rates. We are enjoying low levels of inflation. We have seen the profitability of enterprises grow dramatically and with that their capacity to invest in new plant and equipment, which allows the economy to grow even further. We have seen significant structural adjustments in the economy that are now yielding massive increases in productivity. More importantly, we have seen a very low level of industrial disputation in this country, which has added to a better investment climate and a better rate of productivity in the economy. What is the upshot of this? Since October 1993 unemployment levels have fallen from 964,400 to 836,100 in September 1994. In February 1994 there were 365,900 long-term unemployed. In August 1994 that figure had reduced by some 20 per cent to 290,100. Since April 1993 employment growth has been in the order of 413,800 people. The government gave a commitment to the Australian people that it would set an economic framework for the next three years of its term in office that would see the creation of some half a million jobs. There is the evidence: some 413,800 jobs have been created in the Australian economy. The government does not create jobs; it sets the framework; it manages the levers. This government has done that extremely successfully, as the evidence that I have just presented indicates. I have referred in recent adjournment debates to the rather encouraging signs that are occurring in Victoria's largest provincial manufacturing centre, which is also one of the nation's most important manufacturing centres. I will refer to some of the smaller statistics in the bigger picture. Since August this year jobs have been found for some 323 people who had been employed for over a year. In the same period last year, 227 jobs were found for people. There has been increase of some 40 per cent over the same period last year. In addition, we have seen the introduction of jobs in Geelong. We have seen that community initiative, which I referred to before, coming off the back of the white paper and pulling the communityemployers, unions, the community and the government-together to confront this very real problem. In Geelong, we are seeing larger employers such as Ford and Alcoa taking on staff. We are seeing a dramatic increase in job intakes by small businesses; they are showing some very real interest in the labour market. If you want an overall indicator of how a local economy such as Geelong is faring, you would want to have a look at the hospitality statistics and see how many restaurants are opening in Geelong. We have seen a rather significant increase in that area in recent times. It is a very good sign. It means that consumers are coming out to spend a little bit of their money on recreational and other pursuits. The member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) levied some fairly substantial criticisms at the government. I do not agree with many of the propositions that he has put before the parliament. The government has not just introduced this piece of legislation hoping that the whole system will work. It is working. I see opposite me the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who has criticised the minister in recent times. The honourable member for Goldstein is a fantastic fudger of the figures. He is really the doctoring doctor of this House as far as the unemployment statistics are concerned. Dr Kemp-Your union claims you are fudging them.",22
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,Mr Andrew)Order! I would be grateful if the honourable member for Goldstein would restrain from making comments and if the alliteration that the member for Corio has shown such a flair for could be directed through the chair and not directly to the member for Goldstein.,25
22,Mr OCONNOR,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"I apologise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for that rather glaring omission on my part. It is very good to see the honourable member for Goldstein in the House. The other day he made some accusing statements of the minister, who has carriage of this legislation and this government program, saying that we did not have in place a certain number of case managers by a certain period of time. On my information, near to 2,000 case managers are in the field as well as some 540 specialist staff assisting them. The member for Goldstein put out a press release entitled 'Union claims DEET in disarray'. The minister quite rightly pointed out to the member for Goldstein that you would really have to be naive to the nth degree to take that document and trumpet it around this parliament as a supporting argument for the case being made. But, in the past, the honourable member for Goldstein certainly has made incorrect claims to this House about the numbers of long-term unemployed. Those have been refuted quite clearly by the minister. I would suggest to honourable members on the other side of the House, to the honourable member for Mitchell-who levied these criticisms of the government - and, indeed, to the honourable member for Goldstein, who is vigorously shaking his head, that we do not have a credibility problem. It is the opposition which has the credibility problem. We have a program in place and results are being achieved. Indeed, the general economic situation will support the initiatives that we are undertaking. (TIme expired)",25
23,Mr SNOWDON,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (10.50 a.m.)-It is my happy task to bring this second reading debate to a close. In doing so, I thank all of those members who have spoken in the course of the debate, not the least being the honourable member for Corio (Me O'Connor), who gave what I thought was a very fine contribution-not only because the flattering remarks he made about certain members of the government but also because of the substance that he drew upon in the course of his remarks. On 24 August, the Minister for Employthe ment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) in his second reading speech to the parliament outlined the effects of the Employment Services Bill 1994 and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill in providing assistance to unemployed people and ensuring that the best possible services will be provided to assist them to find quality long-term jobs. Enhanced case management was introduced as a major initiative in the government's white paper Working Nation to support the aim of getting long-term unemthing ployed job seekers into work. From the introduction of case management in April year until 7 October, 160,500 unemployed job seekers entered case management. Of that, 112,000 people entered case management during the first quarter of this financial The number of job seekers being case mancompetition aged is therefore well on target. We now estimate that around 462,000 eligible clients will be case managed in 199495 compared to the original target of 500,000 when Working Nation was released. This lower estimate can be attributed to the positive effects of the new case management arrangements and the strength of the economic recovery. I think no better illustration of the strength of that recovery is in the number of jobs that have been created. Over the last 12 months, employment has grown by over 303,000. The number of long-term unemployed is now 290,000, a fall from March 1993 of some 76,000 job seekers. I think that is an indication as to why we have been so successful. Around 2,200 full-time case managers will be required by the CES to meet currently anticipated workloads for case management activity. The CES currently has about 2,000 case managers who are case managing job seekers. The Employment Services Bill provides for the establishment of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, to regulate and monitor the case management system and for of the formation of Employment Assistance Australia, EAA, as part of the Commonwealth Employment Service. This morning I will table disallowable instruments which have been prepared by the department and the interim ESRA secretariat. I have agreed that next stage will involve public consultations to be conducted jointly by the department and the interim ESRA. ESRA has been given the task of developing an accredited system for case management organisations and ensuring that only organisations that can provide a quality service are allowed to tender for the delivery of case management services. The introduction of a competitive environment into the delivery of services to unemployed people is a bold new approach, somewhich was debated long and hard within the government and the wider community. this But in my view it has been successful and will continue to be so. It has traditionally been the sole province of the public sector. Now community and private sector organisayear. tions will be operating in fair and open with EAA in the delivery of case management services. Unemployed people eligible for case management will be able to nominate a preferred case manager, and the CES will make every effort to ensure that this nomination results in a placement with a preferred case management organisation. I welcome the referral of the Employment Services Bill 1994 and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments Bill) 1994 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on 25 August 1994. The committee tabled its advisory report on 22 September this year. I commend the committee and its chairperson, my good friend the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham); for the thoroughness of its inquiry and presentation of its report in such a short time frame. The committee conducted hearings over a two-day period, took over 20 submissions from a variety of groups and investigated the bills in depth. The committee expressed support for the thrust of the bills and noted that the case management approach is supported strongly by a variety of groups as a strategy for assisting unemployed people. The findings of the committee support the policy directions of the Employment Services Bill. I am pleased that there is a measure of bipartisan support for these initiatives. The committee made 28 recommendations, 11 of which related to the making of disallowable instruments under the Employment Services Bill. The government's response to the committee's recommendations will be tabled shortly. Indeed, I will be tabling amendments to this legislation later this morning as a result of those recommendations. It is fair to say that in general we support the recommendations made by the committee, and the amendments will be in that vein. The amendments which we will move today will incorporate the government's response to those recommendations which would have required legislative amendments. I note the comments of the opposition spokesperson on unemployment, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who in the second reading debate of 24 August applauds the government for contracting out some of its case management services. The introduction of competition to case management will result in a better service for unemployed people. I would now like to touch briefly on a number of matters raised in the course of the debate. The member for Goldstein raised the issue of the extent of ESRA's powers and questioned whether they were too wide. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was not persuaded by the evidence that ESRA's powers were too wide for performing the functions provided for in the bill. The committee's report did not find widespread scepticism; instead, it found that the case management approach established by the bill is strongly supported as a strategy for assisting unemployed people. The committee's report then quoted from submissions from the Welfare Rights Centre; the Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS; the Disabled Peoples International; and ACROD. They all supported strong support for the case management system. The comment by the member for Goldstein that there was widespread scepticism in the community about case management did not spread as widely as I think he first thought it did. The opposition's spokesperson on social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), questioned the information contained in the disallowable instruments. I am pleased to be able to share that with him today by tabling those instruments. The honourable member for Corio pointed out that the measures included in the white paper and the Employment Services Bill will constitute the broadest set of real reforms to the delivery of Commonwealth labour market programs in our postwar history. I think that is beyond question. These reforms will give the long term unemployed a real chance to participate in the economic recovery. Again, I think that is beyond question. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), eloquently expressed her support for the bill in the second reading debate and pointed out quite rightly the pessimistic aspects of the speech by the member for Goldstein. She made the point that the case management system will be phased in and that it will take time for case management expertise to develop. We all should acknowledge that. She also recognised that compassion, fairness and decency with equity and access are the hallmarks of both this bill and the government, and that the bill provides a climate for maximising opportunities for all Australians to participate in growing prosperity of this nation. I was pleased this morning to hear the member for Corio reiterate the remarks he made earlier in the debate supporting the commitment of the CES staff around Australia to unemployed people. Indeed, I think he highlighted the work which has been done in his own electorate in assisting unemployed people to find work through the existing case management process. I say to those with an interest in this subject that it has been difficult for us to recognise that the CES has been required to do things which it has not been asked to do before. I thing that, generally speaking, the commitment which has been shown by the CES staff is to be absolutely applauded. I travel widely around Australia discussing these matters with not only CES staff but also employers, community groups and trade unions. I have absolutely no doubt about the level of dedication or commitment of the CES staff to the objectives which have been outlined in these pieces of legislation. I wish now to table the draft disallowable instruments which have been prepared by the department and the staff of the Interim Employment Services Regulatory Authority. I hand a copy of these instruments to the member for Goldstein. The purpose of tabling and publishing these draft instruments is to allow the public consultation of these instruments before they are required to be made under the proposed legislation. It is proposed that the drafts be open for public consultation until 21 November 1994. I would welcome the comments of members of the opposition, and the government would be happy to facilitate discussions between the member for Goldstein and officials for that purpose. The department and the Interim Employment Services Regulatory Authority will publicise the names of contact officers so that members of the public and other interest groups may obtain copies of these instruments. There are two instruments, however, which I am not tabling today. The departmental information technology assistance scheme, which was recognised by the House standing committee as requiring the most detailed work, will be available for publication shortly. the The instrument referred to in clause 32(10) of the bill, which deals with persons becoming eligible under the job compact, is not required at this stage, as clause 32(9) of the bill already specifies all people who are currently eligible for the compact.

The proposed amendments generally relate to the following: they respond to those recommendations by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report on the bill which will require amendments to the proposed legislation. I propose to table a complete government response to that report after the parliament resumes on 7 November 1994. The amendments more accurately define the class of persons who may be participants in the case management system. They also clarify the relationship between the operation of the case management system under the Employment Services Act and the related provisions of the Social Security Act 1991. They provide a more adequate regime for management of documentation with the case management system. They restrict the powers of search by ESRA inspectors, and they simplify the provisions relating to the review of decisions by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal under the Employment Services Act.

25,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"The handling of the Employment Services Bill whic- is before the House, has been totally unsattsfactory. The government has just introduced further amendments. These amendments became available late last night. They were in the hands of the Bills and Papers Office for quite some time before that I think some days before that. My office has been unable to obtain them. We have been in constant communication with the office of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), attempting to get some adeq-Iate forewarning about these very substantIal new amendments. But it has been impossible to get any clarity whatever from the minister's office about how he intended to handle this legislation or to get permission to get access to these amendments. According to the minister's office, these amendments were on the minister's desk and he was going to be looking at them. What we are witnessing in the handling of this piece of legislation is a chaotic approach to the introduction of the case management system. We are seeing the public expression of the same chaos which the Community and Public Sector Union has identified as existing behind the scenes in the department as it seeks desperately-and I have great sympathy for the department and for the CES because their members have been asked to do an h-roic job-to put into place systems, whose aim is to help the long-term unemployed which have not been thought through and were far from being thought through when announced in the white paper in May. We have the most extraordinary situation where the government announced in May a very substantial program to address a problem which had arisen under its policies over the last 11 years, which is the growth of an underclass of long-term unemployed peoplea major component of the underclass living in poverty, locked out of employment-and a widening gap between rich and poor in this community. The government finally in the white paper came to the view that it was going to have to do something to address this problem. It put down, as we remember, a green paper late last year and then the white paper detailing what it was going to do to help the long-term unemployed. It picked up in that white paper a number of the initiatives, in rhetorical form at least and to some extent in substance which the coalition had put forward in the last election campaign. The concept of the training wage for which we were vilified was brought in, in concept at least-and I emphasise that because it is still not there in substance-in the white paper. The notion of a community level approach to the handling of problems an- assistance of the long-term unemployed, which we had, again, strongly advocated during the election campaign, was brought into the language of the white paper. Since that time, the minister and the government have sought to tell us that the white paper has come into operation and that long term unemployed people are now being helped under the white paper. Indeed, have heard this from the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), who was telling us how well the case management system was working. Yet this legislation before the House is to establish the case management system and done so. to put into place the Employment Services Regulatory Authority and Employment Assistacknowledged ance Australia to administer the case manageconfronted ment system. As the parliamentary secretary tells us, the case management system is to phased in. So, on the one hand, we have claims that the system is fully operational-as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told the Hobart conference, 116,000 people have now entered the case management system-and, the other hand, we are now considering before this House legislation to establish reality, of course, is that the case management system under the white paper is not yet in place.

26,Mr SNOWDON,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Northern Territoryproperly Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister Employment, Education and Training) (11.09 a.m.)-I understand the keenness of opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), to make some rhetorical political points, but I think needs to have some cogent understanding what takes place. He has been told on any number of occasions that we now have around 2,000 case managers working with the Commonwealth Employment Service. I would have thought that reasonable human beings would accept the proposition that have as a community, a nation, a responsibilimember ty to address the needs of long-term unemSnowdon), ployed. The government in its wisdom-and I think quite properly, according to the sponse from the general community-introhave duced Working Nation which outlined a framework, a strategy, for addressing the needs of the long-term unemployed, included in which was the issue of case management. Under the guidance of this government, CES properly undertook the responsibility put in place case management. Notwithstandmanaged. ing that the white paper sets out a framework whereby we are going to have private sector case management, it would have been inapit propriate and indeed irresponsible for the we government not to pursue case management promptly, which is what has been happening. I do not believe that the government's pursuance of case management is a dereliction; it aimed would have been a dereliction had we not The member for Goldstein has already the difficult task the CES has as a result of these changes. He should acknowledge that the CES has acceptbe ed a responsibility, knowing full well that there would be a separation of those functions after this legislation had passed through the parliament. It is therefore not unreasonable that, once this legislation is in operation, the on CES put in place the structures which will allow for those case management services to it. The be separately badged. The long-term unemployed in this country have a valid expectation, directly arising from the white paper initiatives, that they will be case managed. The government has for operated properly, the CES has operated properly. We have 2,000 case managers in the place and we have, as the member for Goldstein has already pointed out, in excess of 100,000 people already being case manhe aged. That is proper government. It is responof sible government. It would have been irresponsible for us not to have taken that course.",43
27,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"We have seen in the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, we Education and Training, the honourable for the Northern Territory (Mr the utter confusion that there is in the rhetoric of the government on this matter. reThe parliamentary secretary now says that we seen 116,000 people being properly case managed. Those were his words. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did not even claim that when he used the figure of 116,000 in Hobart. He said that 116,000 people had entered the the system. There is a great difference between to entering the system and being properly case What the government is proposing in the Employment Services Bill is a system which claims will allow proper case management. As I said in my opening remarks, the system is not in place. Something called case management-and I have no doubt about the very good will of the officers in the CES as they attempt to implement and move ahead on case management-is in place, but it is very different from the case management that is being proposed. It is not at all clear how the present system is working and, indeed, to what extent people are receiving the kinds of case management services that the government has promised in the white paper. What we have at the moment is a rhetorical claim without very much evidence of real substance. I have already referred to the claims of the Community and Public Sector Union, which includes staff in the department responsible for and involved in the system of case management. The claims made in that union's most recent bulletin, the September bulletin, are quite contrary to the claims made by the parliamentary secretary, and they raise real questions over what is actually happening and whether the long-term unemployed are receiving the sort of help that they were being promised in the white paper. The union claims, for example, that the budget simply failed to provide the extra resources necessary to support case management and other white paper activities. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) says to this House, 'Forget that. What would you expect it to say? It is just after another grab for resources. ' But it has negotiated with the department, and the department has apparently agreed to a draft agreement which will protect resources in other areas of the department's activity so that the other general activities the CES network are not scaled back in order to provide case management. So there is a question over what resources are available and what effect that is having on the other activities of the CES. The union went further. It said that there was 'chaos' in the department surrounding the introduction and establishment of the case management system. It claimed that senior management in the department was trying 'to frantically rearrange staffing resources to meet case management targets'. That could be a coloured version of what is happening: management is trying very hard to reach case management targets and the union says that it is frantically trying to rearrange staff, and that this is chaotic. The union goes on to make a further, and I would say very serious, allegation that the management of the department is 'fudging' statistics to make it look as though targets are being met. Here are people who are involved in the establishment and development of the case management system saying to their members throughout the Public Service that, presumably based on the knowledge of people in the department, statistics are being fudged to make it look as though targets are being met. Then we have the parliamentary secretaryand the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor)-coming into this House and asking us to take at face value, in the light of these allegations, their claims that targets are being met. What credibility do these claims have in the face of the quite specific allegations by the union? The parliamentary secretary tells us that we have 2,000 case managers in place. But the union says in its bulletin that there are apparently people not actively involved in case management who have case management ID numbers. (Time expired).",43
28,Mr SNOWDON,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (11.17 of a.m.)-The member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has been batting this ball across the table all day. Frankly, I say to the member for Goldstein, who is a great friend of trade unions, someone who always posits the views of trade unions-he is someone who normally spends his time attacking trade unions-that I do not accept the assertions which have been made by the union. Dr Kemp-Why should we refuse to accept it? Give us some evidence.",44
29,Mr SNOWDON,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Tell me on what other occasion you have ever agreed to accept anything from trade unions, let alone this. I Thursday, 20 October 1994 am confident of the management of the CES, I am confident of the information which has been made public, and I am confident that the only person who has been fudging statistics around here, brother, has been you.",44
30,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"The union's claims have not been refuted by the government. The government denies their validity, but we have to remember that those claims are from people who are actually and actively involved in the introduction of the system. Naturally, one would give those claims some credence. Why would one not give them some credence, particularly when they are so specific? Yet the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) expect us to totally ignore those claims, to act as though nothing has happened, and to accept the fact that the white paper is rolling along. The fact is that the government is facing enormous difficulty in introducing the white paper. This difficulty has caused significant and substantial delays in the proper introduction of the white paper. Earlier I mentioned the training wage. The training wage was supposed to be in place from 4 July. The training wage has been described as the centrepiece of the government's efforts to help the long-term unemployed get real jobs and work experience. Yet the training wage is still not satisfactorily in place. The minister chose to go down a certain route to introduce it. That route was to introduce the training wage by means of a national award. The ACTU told the government how it was going to implement the training wage and what kind of training wage the ACTU and the union movement were prepared to accept. The government went along with it, as it generally does. So what we have is a training wage that was established without any satisfactory consultation with those who were actually going to have to implement it-that is, small business and the employers-and who were then told, 'This is it, and you will introduce it or not.' The implication then dawned on the government that since the ACTU had insisted that a training wage be introduced via a single national award how was the training wage REPRESENTATIVES 2469 going to apply to people under state awards? How was the training wage going to apply to people who were not under awards at all? Those issues still have not been resolved. They are still being raised in the states. So we do not have, at present, a satisfactorily operating system. A body was established based on the KeltyFox task force, called NETTFORCE, to introduce and promote the training wage and to persuade employers. The agreements with the states under which NETTFORCE will operate are still in question; they have not been settled. So, although we were told back in July that this training wage would be in place to help people, it is still not helping any significant number of people at all. The long term unemployed, once again, have been denied the sort of assistance they were promised in the white paper because of the great delays and mismanagement that have taken place in its introduction. This legislation is so complex that the government agreed with the opposition that a standing committee of this House should look at the legislation and consider whether or not the powers that were given in this legislation to the Employment Services Regulatory Authority were too broad. The report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, a bipartisan committee with a government majority, is very revealing about what is happening. The committee made the point that this legislation had been introduced with enormous haste, so much so that a number of significant elements of the scheme were not available to the committee when the legislation was referred to it. The majority of amendments to the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill were received by the committee on 7 September, well after the public hearings. The committee report says: This has made it very difficult to subject these amendments to proper scrutiny, although the Committee has been able to receive some comments on them. The report goes on to say: The large number of amendments has resulted from the haste with which the legislation was prepared. It commented on the extraordinary amount of detail which has been left to be spelt out in the 13 disallowable instruments. (Time expired)",45
31,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"The committee commented on the extraordinary amount of detail which is left to be provided in the disallowable instruments, the first of which we have just seen today. The committee made the point that this legislation should not be passed through the parliament until all these disallowable instruments had been subjected to very close scrutiny. I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) for offering in his speech to provide a briefing by officials of the department to me and the opposition on these disallowable instruments. We will certainly be looking at them in great detail to see what their implications are for the operation and structure of the system. The committee, however, said that it was firmly of the view that some of the detail should be incorporated into the primary legislation and that the reason we have so much detail in these disallowable instruments is that, frankly, the scheme had not been thought through at the time the legislation was introduced. What a strange paradox we have here. We have a white paper which is really struggling to get up and running because of the way in which the government has gone about it, and effective assistance to longment. term unemployed people being delayed month after month. I repeat what I said in my speech in the second reading debate: there is widespread scepticism out in the community amongst the helping organisations in particular, bodies like the Salvation Army and the city missions and so forth, about whether or not this white paper will be effective in helping the long term unemployed. Whether it is or not, we will have to wait for quite some time. Although it is now five months and more since the white paper, a great deal of it come into place. From the government's point of view, this is probably not a major problem, because the white paper has one overriding objective: for the white paper schemes to be in place sufficient months before the next federal election to be seen to be having an effect in removing a large number of people from the statistics of the long-term unemployed. The white paper, as Professor Helen Hughes of the full employment project at Melbourne University said, is really all about concealing the long term unemployed from the electorate at about the time of the election rather than actually helping the long-term unemployed into sustainable employment. From the government's point of view, it is perhaps not a major problem that the white paper has got off to such a stumbling start and that the staff involved in the department, through the Community and Public Sector Union, have raised questions about the accuracy of statistics and whether its introduction is being handled in a chaotic way. But it is of great concern to the coalition and the long term unemployed in this country that the white paper has been extremely slow to get up and running. I referred to the paradox that the white paper has been slow in its introduction, yet the committee is criticising the government fully for the haste with which it has introduced legislation. How can these two circumstances be reconciled? The reason is that the government made promises and announcements at the time of the white paper which it had absolutely no idea how it was going to impleAn enormous amount of effort is clearly going on in the department by very wellintentioned officials to give the government a scheme that will work. All the time the minister is riding on the back of the department saying, 'We have to get it in. The Prime Minister wants to see this white paper in operation; he has a lot riding on this white paper. He is going out telling everybody it is already in operation. In fact, I've told them it is in operation. Let's get this legislation into the House.' So the legislation came in and, of still has to course, it was not ready. As soon as it was introduced, there was a flood of amendments to it-44 amendments were introduced at the time when the original bill was put before the House. Further amendments were then later introduced when the bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and last night another swag amendments was introduced. The minister must be wondering what is going on-'What is wrong with these officials of mine? They cannot produce a bill and a scheme which is to going to work. They keep hitting me with these new amendments.' He should be reassured that these people who are putting this together are undoubtedly trying to do a decent job. (Time expired).",46
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Mr Andrew)I call the honourable member for Goldstein, but I remind him that, although this is a cognate debate, we are in consideration in detail and he ought to confine his remarks to focusing on the specific amendment which, I understand, is focused on case management.",47

Therefore, it is not easy for me to address in great detail amendments which have just come before the House. But I do want to draw to the attention of the House the committee's views on the amendments that it saw. The committee also considered the policy of these amendments and the proposed strucassist ture of the case management very interesting that when the committee, a bipartisan committee with a government majority, looked at the policy of the case management system it said that 'on balance' it accepted the proposed structure of the management system with which these amendemployment ments before us today are concerned. That hardly a warm endorsement from a bipartisan committee of the case management system. was an 'on balance' judgment by a committee dominated by government members. a fair warning, I think, from that side of the House that this whole structure that is now being put in place requires very close scrutiny. The committee heard evidence from memof bers of the Disabled Peoples International, Australia, that the model in the legislation was not a case management model at all and that these amendments do not implement a case management system in the ordinary understanding of that term by people involved in welfare organisations. They said that the case management system is characterised, and ought to be characterised, by clearly defined roles and responsibilities that apply equally to the case manager and the person whose case is being managed. They are also of the opinion that case management is a process which requires great flexibility, and that it is very difficult to legislate for flexibility. The committee itself was concerned over this matter and felt that it had some merit. It recommended that the definition in the bill should highlight and be adjusted to accurately reflect a case manager's responsibility to assist job seekers both to find and to maintain secure employment. There has been some attempt by the government to amend the definition of case management services in the of bill presumably in response to this recommendation of the committee. But I believe that there is quite a distinct difference between the words which the government has used in the bill and the words which the committee is looking for. The government's words are that it is the case manager's responsibility to assist the person being case managed to find sustainable employment. The committee says that the task of the case manager should be to job seekers both to find and to maintain system. It is secure employment. As I read it, the committee is saying that the case manager's responsibility should not finish the moment it seems as though the case long-term unemployed person has attained but that the case manager should is keep a weather eye on the progress of that person and see whether or not that person is It successful in maintaining that employment and, if that person is not, take action to do That is something about it. The government's amendment seems to terminate the case manager's responsibility at the point when employment is entered into. Therefore, it does not seem that its amendment adequately reflects or implements the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee was also concerned about some other matters. I will seek the indulgence of the chair to comment on them at a slightly later moment. (TIme expired)",47
34,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"The committee underlined the concerns which the coalition has been expressing, and which I have expressed, over the state in which the so-called case management system is at the present time. As I have said, the government is saying, 'Yes, it's up and running; long-term unemployed people are being helped; 116,000 people have entered the system,' and so forth. What system have they entered? The committee noted in its report that eligibility for case management has not yet been determined. The question of whether or not somebody is to be a participant in the case management system is to be the subject of a disallowable instrument. When the committee considered this matter, it was told by the department that the disallowable instrument was in the process of being drafted. This meant that in fact no system was in place under the white paper structure to determine whether somebody was eligible for case management or not. This immediately raises the question: who are these people who are currently being case managed or have entered the case management system? Are they people who would be eligible under the terms of the white paper or not? It is quite clear that the system which the department intends to put in place to assess the eligibility of long-term unemployed people, and people at risk, for case management has not yet been designed. So doubtless there are many people going through case management who would not be going through case management if the terms of the white paper were being implemented. It makes one wonder what is the nature of this fudging of the statistics that the Community and Public Sector Union has alleged is occurring. How are the numbers of those in case management being bumped up at the moment to make it look as though targets are being met when, as the union says, targets are not being met? It has been said that there is a view that some of the people who are notionally in case management at the moment are simply names on the computer lists and that if you were to approach some of these individuals and ask them, 'How's the case management going?' they would say, 'What case management?' They are on the lists of people to be case managed, the department considers that they have entered the case management system, but so far as they are concerned case management is not a reality of their lives; they are not really aware of this. Questions have been raised not by the opposition but by the staff of the department and by government members on the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs who make the point that the system to determine eligibility for case management is not yet in place. From the point of view of the long-term unemployed, and from the point of view of the introduction of the system, a totally unsatisfactory situation is developing here. There are some other aspects of the amendments to this white paper and the bill which certainly warrant comment upon, and which were commented upon by the House of Representatives committee. The coalition has consistently said that one of the major objectives of the white paper has been to remove people from the unemployment statistics and put them onto other programs; to hide the unemployed rather than to help the unemployed. The committee expressed its concern at the fact that, under the provisions, participants in the jobskills and LEAP programs who are being case managed will be reclassified; their status will be changed. The committee's report states: Prior to the introduction of the Bill, participants in these programs were considered to be unemployed during their Jobskills or LEAP placement and thus retained eligibility for LMP assistance at the end of their program. The Bill has the effect of changing this status, so that the participant is considered to be employed during the program placement(TIme expired)",48
35,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"The committee makes the point: ... the participant is considered to be employed during the program placement and may, therefore, no longer be eligible for program assistance end of the placement. In any case, it is clear that this person is no longer to be considered an unemployed person but to be considered somebody who has a job placement under the job compact as a result of the white paper. The committee points out that this has another consequence, probably an unexpected consequence. That is, participants in case management who are participating in jobskills or LEAP placements may also be entitled to assistance from bodies to which the government has contracted out case management activities. The committee is concerned that a broker may be paid for organising a placement and that the Commonwealth may also be paying a case manager to arrange that same placement; in other words, that there may be double dipping into the funds that are available for assistance. The committee report states: The Committee recommends that ESRA and DEET examine closely the payment for outcomes, particularly payment for placement into subsidised employment, to ensure that Commonwealth funds are being expended appropriately and that the Commonwealth is not paying twice for an individual placement to be arranged. It is quite clear that this legislation will lead to a number of unintended consequences. These consequences are going to become apparent as the implementation proceeds. It is difficult to give consideration to all the amendments because of the way they have been introduced and the rush have been introduced. But one matter that has certainly agitated the government, it has talked to the opposition about, is the amendment which was introduced in the Senate some time ago relating to the notice which had to be given to people who were be cut off benefits. The Senate accepted an amendment that a period of two weeks has to elapse before a person can be removed from benefits. The government introduced amendments the consequential amendments bill which, like others, were not received by the committee until after the public hearings were conducted. The committee commented that, consequently, it did not have sufficient time to consult at the widely on these proposed amendments. Nevertheless, it did have time to receive some evidence from ACOSS, which expressed its extreme concern about the proposed amendments, and the Welfare Rights Centre, which argued that the extra two payments were most important to allow recipients time to lodge an appeal against the decision before any financial loss was incurred and to arrange their financial affairs before the penalty period takes effect.",49
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Mr Andrew)I am reluctant to interrupt the member for Goldstein, but the amendments he is now referring to are amendments to the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill. That is not the bill that we are currently considering. It is the Employment Services Bill that is being considered.

43,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"I am at a loss to understand to why the government is concerned that the coalition is making a number of comments on this legislation. I presume that the haste with which the Employment Services Bill was introduced and the fact that amendments keep pouring out of the government is intended to stifle debate on this matter. There has scarcely been enough time to consider and give adequate scrutiny to the amendments which the government has put forward. This is a matter which the committeewhich comprised a majority of government members-complained about and it is a matter which the opposition is very concerned about. The government should not consider for a moment that the opposition feels compelled to accept all these amendments just because the government has seen fit to introduce and move them through the House at this extraordinary speed. It is quite appropriate for the opposition to be making comments on the amendments before the House. If the government does not like it, it will have to wait. Mr Snowdon-Come on, or we will shut you up.",49
44,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,Try that. Mr Snowdon-It can be very easily done.,50
45,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,Are you going to stifle debate again? Mr Snowdon-Get on with the subject. Move!,50
46,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"The opposition has not had much time to consider these amendments. We will certainly be giving them detailed consideration before they come before the Senate. The opposition will be reserving its position on a number of these amendments until we have time to properly consider them. The government has introduced a great deal of additional material which spells out the detail of this legislation. It has done this not only through the amendments but also through the 13 disallowable instruments, some of which have now been made available. We will certainly not be prepared to pass this legislation in the Senate until there has been adequate opportunity to consider the detail of these disallowable instruments. I once again draw attention to fact that the government's claims about the effectiveness of the system now in place have no credibility in light of the fact that what we now have before us is a very complex schema which is growing like topsy before our very eyes. The department still needs to produce a great deal more detail on the operation of this legislation before it comes into operation. It is the government's fault and the fault of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) that its credibility is being called publicly into question on the operation and introduction of the white paper. The only people who are suffering as a result of this are the long-term unemployed who have been placed in that position by the government's mismanagement of the economy over the last 11 years. They have had to wait a very long time to get some rhetorical acknowledgment of their problems. They now have that rhetorical acknowledgment and, when this system is in place, presumably they will have some hope of further assistance. Whether or not the system embodied in this legislation and in these amendments will operate to help them is another matter. As I said in the second reading debate, there is widespread scepticism throughout the caring organisations in our community about the scheme which is being put in place. There is great concern whether it will actually be effective. We will be closely scrutinising it as it proceeds. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon)-by leave-read a third time. NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 30 June.

I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum. The amendments to the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994 will provide for provisions relating to extension of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1988 to operate in an alternative way to the current provisions of the bill. Under the current provisions the identification of what documents are subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 can be found in schedule 2 to that act. There are activicomplementary provisions in the Privacy Act 1988. Amendments to the bill which would amend the Ombudsman Act 1976 are proposed to allow the transfer of information relevant to the operation of the case management system from the Ombudsman to the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, or ESRA. These amendments follow from a recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which recently tabled an advisory report on the bill. As this bill would amend the Privacy Act 1988, the opportunity is being taken to propose a minor technical amendment to the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Act 1994. Amendments to the bill which would, in turn, amend the Social Security Act 1991 in relation to deferment periods for the payment of jobsearch and newstart allowance are also proposed. The supplementary explanatory memorandum explains the detail of the amendments.",51
48,Dr KEMP,RELATING TO DEFERMENT PERIODS,"I now take this opportunity to address myself to the amendments relating to breaches of obligations by those under case management and, indeed, under the jobstart and the newstart arrangements. The matter was considered in the Senate. A non-government amendment to social security legislation in the Senate provided that suspension of an unemployed person from payments due to a breach of obligations under the act could only take effect following two further payments covering 28 days of jobsearch allowance and newstart allowance. The government has been concerned about this particular amendment because it causes administrative difficulties the way in which it is worded, in particular, and seems, according to the government-and one can understand what it is referring to here-not to accord with the signals that the government wants to send to job seekers in regard to the importance of their reciprocal obligations. The matter has been discussed with me by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). I have corresponded with the minister on this matter and notified him that, while the opposition has sympathy with the concerns of the government on this matter, we did want to see this issue referred to the legal and constitutional affairs committee for consideration. The government undertook to do that. Unfortunately, according to the committee, the amendments were not received by it until after public hearings had been conducted. The committee consequently, it says, did not have sufficient time to consult widely on them but it did have time to receive some comment on these amendments. It received comment from the Australian Council of Social Service and from the Welfare Rights Centre. The Australian Council of Social Service told the committee that it was extremely concerned by the most recent proposed amendments and that it was concerned that tighter reciprocal obligations constitute a punitive approach that is unhelpful and that runs entirely counter to the case management approach. ACOSS agreed that the amendment to allow deferral periods to operate from the time that notice was sent was necessary but accepted the department's views about the administrative difficulties being caused by the Senate amendment. It went on to say it was acceptable only if there was a period of notice. The Welfare Rights Centre sought to maintain the previous arrangement. The committee investigated the issue. It came to the view that the system has some built-in safeguards that may make the additional two payment periods unnecessary on a number of grounds. It did feel that sufficient notice probably would be given to unemployed persons before they lost their benefits in or payments because of a breach of the obligations on their part. The committee, however, did say that, in relation to administrative breaches, the matter was not so clear because the nature of an administrative breach is that the person cannot be contacted. It recognised that every attempt was made by CES and the Department of Social Security to make contact and that a total of 35 days was allowed for a person to respond, which entailed more than two pay periods. The committee said that if a person is not responding to this correspondence because he or she is no longer looking for work and therefore no longer eligible for payment then the concept of making an additional two payments to the person does not seem to fit with responsible financial management practices. (TIme expired)",58
49,Dr KEMP,RELATING TO DEFERMENT PERIODS,"The committee also noted that it could result in a large increase in the number of overpayments and a corresponding increase in administrative workload. The committee, however, was concerned at this question of sufficient notice being given before income support payments were deferred due to a breach of obligation and it made a general recommendation on this account. Recommendation 11 of the committee says: The committee recommends that it is essential that sufficient notice be given before income support payments are deferred due to a breach of obligations. It is unfortunate that the committee did not have more time to consider and report upon this matter. Certainly it is no criticism of the committee that it has run into these difficulties. It is therefore a matter that the coalition will take on advisement. We will have a closer look at the concerns the committee has expressed on this matter. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon)-by leave-read a third time. STUDENT ASSISTANCE (YOUTH TRAINING ALLOWANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Cognate bill: STUDENT ASSISTANCE (YOUTH TRAINING ALLOWANCENA CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 13 October. Second Reading",59
50,Mr FREE,TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill will establish youth training allowance, which will provide income support for unemployed people under 18 years of age. The introduction of the youth training allowance is an integral component of the government's youth training initiative. The youth training initiative will commence on 1 January 1995. Youth training initiative The government's white paper ment and growth announced wide-ranging measures to generate continued employment growth and involve all Australians in economic recovery. An important part of these measures is the youth training initiative, a fundareplace mental reform to assistance for unemployed young people under 18 years of age. The focus of the youth training will be to encourage young people to undertake' full-time education or training, level training, and appropriate employment opportunities. This will be achieved through an integrated program comprising personalpeople ised case management, access to labour market or vocational training program places and the new income support arrangement, the youth training allowance. The first strand of the youth training initiative will provide intensive case management to unemployed young people. A young person will have ongoing, one-to-one contact with a case manager to identify his or her individual needs, help the search for suitable education, training and work opportunities, and coordinate access to services such as labour market programs. Clients will be eligible for case management 13 weeks after registering as unemployed, with earlier case management assistance for clients assessed as being at high risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Case management will be provided by Employment Assistance Australia and contracted case managers from the community and private sectors. This will be regulated by the Employment Services Bill 1994, which is currently (12.00 before the parliament. The second strand of the youth training initiative will provide labour market or vocational training program placements to young the people who remain unemployed six months after registering with the Commonwealth Employment Service, with earlier assistance for the high risk group. This will involve a major expansion in the labour market program assistance available to young people. To this end, the government has substantially expanded entry level training opportunities and the youth training initiative will provide over 50,000 labour market program places a year on employwhen fully implemented. The third strand of the youth training initiative addresses the issue of income support. The youth training allowance will the current jobsearch allowance for unemployed young people under the age of 18 years. However, young people who are receiving jobsearch allowance as at 1 January initiative 1995 will continue to do so. entry Youth training allowance It is important that income support arrangements do not provide a disincentive for young to undertake full-time study or training. To address this issue, the government been progressively moving to align student assistance payments and benefits for unema fortnight. ployed people. The introduction of the youth training allowance is a further policy development and will align benefits for unemployed young people more closely with assistance available under Austudy. In particular, the youth trainclients ing allowance will introduce an away from home rate for unemployed young people who do not qualify as independent but who need to live away from home to seek employment or undertake suitable training. Payment of away from home rate will be subject to certification by the Commonwealth Employbreaches ment Service. As a result of the clear emphasis on embe ployment, education and training outcomes sought for the target group of the youth training initiative, the bill will establish youth training allowance by amending the Student Assistance Act 1973, which will renamed the Student and Youth Assistance Act, providing for youth training allowance, Austudy, Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children scheme. The delivery of youth training allowance will, however, be similar to that of allowance. The Department of Social Security will be the payment agency handling grants, ongoing payment matters and benefits control aspects. The Department of Employment, Education and Training will handle market matters, such as labour ment, and labour market program placements. Benefits under youth training allowance An allowance will be available to unemal ployed young people aged 16 and 17 years. An allowance will also be available to unemallowance ployed 15 year olds who have reached the school leaving age, live away from home and are unsupported. The allowance will be paid at three rates: independent, away from home and at home. The latter two rates will be subject to parental income and assets tests. As with present jobsearch allowance proviassets. sions, a minimum payment will be payable, subject to the personal income test, to clients who are not independent and would otherwise has be ineligible because of parental income or assets. For 1995, this payment will be $62.90 The general eligibility conditions for the youth training allowance will be the same as those for the present jobsearch allowance for under 18 year olds. The allowance will be subject to the present waiting period for leaving full-time education. There will be an activity test requiring clients to undertake jobsearch or approved education or training, and clients may be required to enter into case management activity agreements. There the will be non-payment periods for administrative breaches, activity test breaches and of the activity agreement. The youth training allowance will generally paid fortnightly. The fortnightly payments will include, as applicable, remote area allowance and pharmaceutical allowance. the Where clients undertake formal training as part of a labour market program, their youth be training allowance may also include some formal training assistance ancillary benefits, namely, the living away from home component and the home base maintenance component. The fortnightly payments will include rent assistance for eligible young people jobsearch receiving the independent rate. Other legislation will be amended to provide that a youth training allowance recipient will also qualify for a health care card and, as applicable, education entry payments and labour employment entry payments. market assessIncome and assets tests The parental income test will be based on the Austudy parental income test. The personincome test for the youth training allowance will be the same as for the jobsearch personal income test, as it will need to be applied on a fortnightly basis. The youth training allowance assets test will be the same as for Austudy. This will be generally more generous than for jobsearch allowance as it will include a 50 per cent discount on farms and other family business Further, the assets test will not apply if the client's parent or spouse receives jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance or other specified income support payments. The government will move to amend the bill so that the youth training allowance assets test will not apply where a client's parent or partner receives the new drought relief payment. Further, the assets test will not take account of farms located in an area severely affected by drought. This concession will continue for six months after the drought has broken. Youth homelessness The government recognises that there is community concern about the approval of young people as independent on the basis of homelessness and notes that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs is presently conducting an inquiry into aspects of youth homelessness. To give an idea of the dimension of the issue of homelessness in relation to the youth training allowance, I would mention that approximately 20 per cent of clients are expected to receive the independent rate on this basis. This is a difficult issue and there is clearly a need for a balanced approach while ensuring that assistance is available to young people in genuine need. The bill proposes that a person will qualify as independent if he or she is unsupported and cannot live at the parental home because of extreme family breakdown or other similar exceptional circumstances or because of serious risk to his or her physical or mental well-being. The government recognises the desirability of having one approach to defining homelessness in its income support programs. The criteria adopted for sickness allowance and special benefits will be amended to reflect the definition adopted for the youth training allowance. The government is examining the feasibility of adopting this for Austudy also. I would emphasise that all applications based on claims of homelessness are carefully checked and parents are normally contacted during this process, unless there are exceptional circumstances that indicate this would be inappropriate. Appeals The bill provides a comprehensive review process to clients who disagree with a departmental decision about youth training allowance. A client can seek a reassessment by an authorised review officer, a review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and, finally, a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The adoption of the appeals system is indicative of the close cooperation between the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Social Security resulting from the introduction of the youth training allowance. The government is also reviewing the appeals system for the student assistance schemes, in the light of the introduction of the youth training allowance, to see whether it would be possible to achieve a more integrated approach. Information management The youth training allowance will be subject to the same information management regime as applies under the Social Security Act, providing for powers to compel disclosure of information and controls on the use and release of that information. The bill will extend these controls to the student assistance schemes also, so that the new regime will, for the first time, impose explicit obligations on officers not to disclose information obtained for the purposes of student assistance schemes. As with jobsearch allowance and the student assistance schemes, youth training allowance clients may be asked to provide tax file numbers in order to receive payments. The Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance-Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994 will include the youth training allowance in the ambit of the Data Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act. The Privacy Commissioner has been fully consulted on these provisions. Financial details The total cost of the youth training initiative is estimated at: $73.7 million in 1994-95; $193.6 million in 1995-96; $227.3 million in 1996-97; and $235.8 million in 1997-98. Of this, the expected annual expenditure for the youth training allowance is: $36 million in 1994-95; $101.9 million in 1995-96; $118.1 million in 1996-97; and $125.1 million in 1997-98. Payments under the youth training allowance will be funded from a standing appropriation under the proposed Student and Youth Assistance Act. This appropriation will also be used to fund payments made to youth training allowance clients under the Social Security Act. This will apply to employment and education entry payments. As the partner allowance will be linked with eligibility for the youth training allowance, it will be funded under the proposed Student and Youth Assistof ance Act appropriation. However, the parentperiod ing allowance, which is to commence on July 1995, will not have the same nexus will come under the social security appropritraining ation. Conclusion I commend the bill to the House ent the explanatory memorandum. STUDENT ASSISTANCE (YOUTH TRAINING ALLOWANCE) (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994 The Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994 will amend the Student Assistance Act 1973 to establish the youth training allowance. The present bill will amend other acts to make changes resultrative ting from the introduction of the youth trainthe ing allowance. Transitional provisions A number of transitional provisions have been included in the bill to deal with the transition from jobsearch allowance to youth training allowance as the source of income support for unemployed young people aged under 18. Where people apply for the pendence jobsearch allowance before 1 January 1995 and their payments would start after that date if they were eligible, then the application will be treated as relating to the youth training allowance rather than the jobsearch allowance. Where people apply for the youth training allowance or jobsearch allowance after 1 the bill. January 1995 and their payments would start before that date if they were eligible, then application will be treated as one relating to the jobsearch allowance rather than the youth training allowance. Young people who are receiving the jobsearch allowance as at 1 January 1995 will continue to do so. The qualification conditions for the jobsearch allowance will be modified by consequential amendment to the Social Security Act 1991, so that only certain 'saved' clients who are under 18 years of age can receive the jobsearch allowance. This will continue unless a person ceases to receive the jobsearch allowance for a continuous period at least six weeks, but not including a during which a person transfers to 1 sickness allowance. Any subsequent applicaand tion by that person must be for the youth allowance. Provision is also made that determinations and instruments applying to a young person's jobsearch allowance will continue to apply if the person later qualifies and presfor the youth training allowance. Consequential amendments Because of the links between the youth training allowance and social security payments, extensive consequential changes are needed to the Social Security Act 1991. These include avoiding duplication of the youth training allowance and social security payments; providing that youth training allowance clients may qualify for employment and education entry payments; ensuring adminiscontinuity where a person moves from youth training allowance to the jobsearch or newstart allowance because he or she turns 18; and enabling youth training allowance overpayments to be recovered from social security payments. As mentioned in the second reading speech on the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994, the indecriteria for sickness allowance and special benefit will be modified to align with the proposed approach for the youth training allowance. These criteria will be included in a new rate calculator applicable to under 18year-old sickness allowees which will be inserted into the Social Security Act 1991 by The present bill will also amend the Health the Insurance Act 1973 to enable youth training allowance recipients to qualify for health care cards. A number of amendments will be made to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The Taxation Office will be authorised to provide information for use in the administration of the youth training allowance. Ancillary benefits under the allowance will be exempt from income tax, and recipients of the allowance will qualify for the beneficiary rebate. As I mentioned in the second reading speech on the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994, the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act is to be amended to include the youth training allowance in its scope. This will ensure that the youth training allowance is treated on the same basis as the jobsearch allowance, Austudy and other income support schemes. Minor consequential amendments will also be made to a number of other acts. Financial impact As the present bill is essentially dependent on the introduction of the youth training It is not practicable to give a separate financial impact statement for the present bill. Instead, I refer honourable members to the financial impact statement in the second reading speech on the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994. Conclusion I commend the bill to the House.",60
51,Dr KEMP,TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND,"We have here another piece of legislation introduced as part of the government's white paper program. Like the Employment Services Bill and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill associated with it, which the House has just finished considering, this legislation has been introduced with great haste. The main bill-the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994-has 267 pages. It was introduced last Thursday afternoon and, consequently, there has been very limited time for the parliament to consider it. This bill has not been accompanied by a flood of amendments and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) is probably entitled to some commendation for that. It is a bill within covers and it gives some evidence of having had satisfactory attention given to making sure that at least all the components of the scheme are in place. Regardless of what one thinks of the various detailed elements in the bill, at least this piece of legislation has been put together and introduced in what appears to be a complete form. I may be proven wrong. There may be a lot of amendments to come, but so far we have not seen them. The government has created a good impression that it has got its act together on the drafting of the bill. Unfortunately, I cannot be so complimentary on the timetable of this introduction. The government is really saying that it does not care whether the parliament or the House of Representatives, in particular, has time to consider this piece of legislation. As I say, the bill was introduced last Thursday night and is being debated a week later. In that time, the parties have had to organise their party meetings, shadow cabinet meetings and so forth. This is an unsatisfactory situation for such a substantial piece of legislation. I protest in the strongest terms on behalf of the coalition at the way in which this is done. I can assure the minister that this piece of legislation will get very close attention not only from those of us in this House but also from those in the other chamber. The main bill, the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994, is designed to establish the income support component of the youth training initiative. Young people are desperately in need of constructive assistance; there is no doubt about that. The circumstances that young people in Australia find themselves in at the present time are very difficult. Unemployment, as we know, has been exceptionally high amongst young people. This problem has a number of sources, but one of the major sources, regrettably, has been the decade and more of economic mismanagement which we have suffered under this government and which we are still suffering from. The government's boom-bust approach has had a disastrous effect on families around Australia, and this country now has the highest rate of divorce that it has had for a decade. It has impacted particularly on young people. The youth of this country have also suffered greatly from the attitude that the government has taken to the employment and training of young people. When the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training was a union secretary, he worked vigorously to close the gap between junior and adult rates of pay. When one compares the situation in Australia with the situation in a country like Germany, which has a long established and generally very successful training and vocational education system, what stands out is that young people in Germany move through a very clear progression of stages and wage rates. In Germany the concept of a training wage has not been controversial. It has been recognised that, if a young person is going to be successful in gaining employment, that young person must be productive when he or she comes into the workplace. Until he or she is as productive as more experienced people, it is entirely proper that he or she should be paid a training wage rather than a wage which is much closer to a full adult wage. This is a view which I have put for some time in this chamber and which the coalition put very strongly in the last election campaign. It is pleasing that since the election the government has at least picked up in the white paper the concept of a training wage. The reason why there has been so much difficulty with this on the government side is that this country is governed under the terms of an agreement, a contract, which was reached and signed between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions in 1983, known as the accord. The accord deals with virtually every area of policy. It means that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has in virtually every portfolio a veto over policy developments which it sees as impinging on its own interests. It has pursued a view designed to promote the role and the influence of the trade union movement on youth wages, wage differentials, and how training should be organised. I regret to say that that has been its first priority, the interests of young people. Young people have been the victims of this approach. Young people have been willingly sacrificed to maintain the wages system and the training arrangements which the trade union movement has seen as contributing to its own interests. This is deeply regrettable and it has had a devastating effect on the opportunities for young people in this country, whether they be opportunities to undertake appropriate training or education or whether they be opportunities to obtain employment. Vocational education is not dealt with at length in this bill, but it is certainly relevant because it relates to the kind of training that is available to young people. It is a tragedy that we have not had a clear strategy to develop vocational education and training opportunities over the last 11 years. Since 1983 we have seen the deliberate neglect of training through formal institutions such as the colleges of advanced education and the TAFE system, which was greatly built up by the Fraser government. The TAFE system was put in limbo for virtually a decade. The colleges of advanced education, which offered vocational education and education relevant to the various regions of the country within which they existed, were pushed out of existence. They were told that they had to become universities. A former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, at the bidding of the college unions-college staff were very keen to get the employment conditions and research opportunities of university staffdecided that the colleges should become universities. For a period of years we had young people in this country being told, 'If you are not interested in university education, you are not with it. Everybody has to go to university.' So the colleges, with their vocational emphasis, disappeared; the TAFEs were neglected; and we had the young people of this country being pushed into university education whether that was suitable education for them or not. The government realised, some years after Mr Dawkins had had his way, that it had made a terrible mistake. His successor as the not Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the present Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), came out and said, 'Australia has too many universities'-too many universities, after the number had been bumped up from nine to 38 by the former minister-'and what we need to develop is vocational education and training.' The government then said, 'We will put more money into TAFE and we will develop a training system in this country which is suitable for young people.' All this time young people were out there wondering what on earth they were supposed to be doing, given the conflicting messages they were getting from the government. So Australia started to go down a different track. One of the features of this government is that when it changes course, boy does it change course. It suddenly shifts. It said, universities have reached their optimum size. They are now going to be cut back and the whole system is going to be swung onto training through TAFE. We are going to build up the TAFE system.' It was a bit like the case management system for the unemployed. The government said, 'The long-term unemployed have been neglected so we will shift the whole system onto the long-term unemployed. All the skillshares will now take on long-term unemployed. We will push resources in the CES onto the long-term unemployed.' This approach to government has a sort of an eastern European flavour. The fashion at the moment, the top priority, is the one that gets the resources so resources have been swung into the TAFE area. Australia now has one of the lowest proportions of young people in the entire Western world, in the OECD, in industry related training and employment. A country such as Germany, which has had a well-established system, has always recognised that young people should have workplace experience as an essential part of their training. They should have experience on the shop floor. They should have experience that makes them productive in the workplace. This government has not been concerned about this because apprenticeships and traineeships have not fitted easily into the schema. Until recently, this country has had the lowest number of young people, as a proportion of the work force, in apprenticeships and traineeships that it has had since the 1960s. Australia has one of the lowest rates of workplace experience-based training in the Western world because of the total confusion on the part of this government as to what sorts of opportunities it should be providing to young people. The bill before us, which is part of the government's training agenda, aims to provide people who are under 18 and presently receiving the jobstart allowance with increased opportunities for training. There are a number of questions that we should be asking about this. What kind of training will these young people be receiving? Will this training be appropriate to their needs? As other young 'The unemployed people have suffered before them for a number of years under this government, will they suffer the indignity and the demoralising pressure from the government to go through one short-term training program after another knowing that these training programs are quite disconnected from the labour market opportunities which are there? Will they realise that these training programs do not offer them the job opportunities they want? Let us make no mistake about it, the way in which the government has gone about developing its labour market programs for young people has been one of the most destructive efforts we have seen in this country for a long time. We have seen the demoralisation of young people in this country. Many young people are despairing because of the lack of opportunities before them. I regret to say that a very sad indicator of this is the fact that this country now has the highest rate of youth suicide in the world. There is a sense of hopelessness around this country due to the complete confusion and lack of direction and vision from this government. When a piece of legislation such as this focuses on youth training, the first question we have to ask is: will this training give these young people real job opportunities and increase their productiveness to employers or will it be more of the same? I see no answer to this in the legislation. But I do see an answer to another question that the coalition has asked on a number of occasions: what is the government really about? This is yet another approach which is going to have a very interesting statistical effect. Young people will be removed from the jobsearch allowance and put on the youth training allowance. The consequence of the introduction of this legislation-from figures taken from 20 May this year-will be that 37,346 people will be removed from the jobsearch allowance and put onto the youth training allowance. This seems to have surprised the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), the next speaker in the debate, but it is a very interesting fact. I assure the honourable member that those people on the youth training allowance are still unemployed people, but that is not going to be quite so obvious. I have no doubt at all that government speakers will be going around this country saying, 'Oh, look at the fall in the people on jobsearch allowance. This is remarkable-the effectiveness with which the government's employment programs are working!' They will not be saying, 'Of course, the young people on the youth training allowance are unemployed and regarded as unemployed people.' They will just be focusing on the fall in the statistics those whom the public understands to be unemployed, because those people are receiving what the public still regards as the unemployment benefit-the jobsearch allowance. This is part of the general approach that the government is taking under the white paper to shift as many people as possible out of the unemployment statistics. It will be interesting to see what effect the implementation of the youth training allowance will have on the unemployment statistics produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Will the young people on the youth training allowance regard themselves as still being unemployed, or not? I suppose this depends on the kinds of training programs they will go into and the sorts of opportunities they will get under the case management system. It is quite likely that many of these young people will say, 'Perhaps I am not unemployed after all.' So not only will we see a quite substantial fall in the numbers on jobsearch allowance, but also we may see this flow through into the ABS unemployment figures. This is all very good news for the government, which is why this legislation is being introduced. But it is not good news for this country and for young unemployed people. Unless they can be offered effective training and unless case management really comes to mean something for young people, it will be simply yet another example of how their interests have been sacrificed to the political interests of the government. I have no confidence at all in this. I can tell you that, having talked to a lot of young unemployed people since I have been in the shadow employment portfolio, there will be very little expectation on the part of young people in this country that the youth training allowance will do a great deal for them. There will be very little expectation indeed, because they know the way they have been treated in the past and they will want to see a very significant change in that treatment before their attitudes change. These bills introduce some substantial and significant changes to administrative arrangements. There is no doubt that the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) of Amendment Bill is a very significant piece of legislation from the point of view of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It gives the department a large new brief and a foothold in this area. Not all those who look closely at these matters are happy with this. A strong view has been expressed by some that there is no need for this bill and that the Social Security Act should have been amended. They ask why, as jobsearch comes under that act, the youth training allowance and other income support programs which help unemployed people should not come under it as well. Some rather unpleasant comments have been made about the capacity of the department to administer income support programs, based on the experience with Austudy. But there seem to be some improvements occurring in that area. Nevertheless, the question has been raised as to why this whole schema should not be put with the Department of Social Security, which, after all, is skilled in the making of income support payments. One really has to question what the rationale is for this particular bill being introduced in this form. I have looked closely at the explanatory memorandum and have seen the explanations offered. They are remarkable for their brevity and sound rather like rationalisations to me. I would be interested to hear this issue addressed at some stage in the debate. It is of concern to a number of organisations concerned with helping young people and with social security and welfare matters generally. It explained why this bill is being introduced in this way. It certainly places a great premium on satisfactory relationships in this area being established and developed between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. We would not want to see developing the loopholes and gaps through which people can fall that sometimes have occurred in the past when more than one department was involved in the administration of schemes. The youth training allowance depends for its effectiveness on the effectiveness of the case management system that is to be introduced. In principle, the coalition has no quarrel at all with the notion of case management. That is undoubtedly, in principle, an effective way to help unemployed people, particularly longer term unemployed people. It is a more costly system, but it allows the individual person seeking assistance to be treated for his or her individual needs. These needs have more chance of being understood. There is a chance of some continuity in the assistance given to that person and some potential for flexible adjustment. The concept of case management is one that we find attractive in principle. To say that it is positive in principle is not to say that in practice it will be implemented in a way which will work. In the debate on the previous bill, concerns were expressed from various bodies in the welfare area about the nature of the case management system which is being established. There has to be a major question as to whether or not we have a case management system which will follow people through in the way in which the rhetoric says that it will. Whether a case manager who has a load of 250 people under the job compact over the year plus who knows how many others will be effectively case managed remains to be seen. This issue I think is still to be resolved. It is not a positive factor that the government is jumping up and down telling us how many people are currently under case management or how many people have entered the case management system. Rhetorically it sometimes says, 'This shows the white paper is up and running.' As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told the ALP conference in Hobart, 116,000 people have entered case management. But what case management system have they entered? We have before us today legislation to establish the case management system under the white paper. I have no doubt that the officials in DEET are doing their best to meet the demands coming down on high from the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who say, 'Please get this case management up and running so we can say targets have been met and the system is in operation.' We have heard very serious comments made on this matter by the Community and Public Sector Union, which said that the whole system is presently in chaos in the department. It said that senior management was rushing around trying to reallocate resources to get people into case management at the risk and cost of other activities undertaken by the CES. Most seriously of all, it said that figures were being 'fudged' to make it look as though targets were being met when they were not being met-targets presumably of the numbers of case managers and the numbers of people being helped by case management. I am constrained to mention an example of how this fudging seems to be leaking up to the ministerial level. In early August the Minister for Employment, Education and Training told us that there were 2,000 case managers in place-this is to show how quickly the white paper was getting under way-and another 500 were to be appointed over the coming months to do the job. Then, several months later, he comes in and tells us that we have 2,000 case managers in place. The 500 new case managers apparently disappeared. The question arises not whether we have 2,000 in place-in fact, the minister's latest figure was under 2,000-but whether we had 2,000 in place at the end of July. I think the only conclusion is that we did not have 2,000 case managers in place at the end of July. As the union said, there are people actively engaged in case management who are being given case management ID numbers within the department. It has also been said that some of these people who are said to be in case management are in case management only on the department's computers. If you ask them whether they are on case management, they would not know what on earth you were talking about. They have not seen any case managers or heard about case management. They have not been told that they are in case management, but the department's record system says they are in case management. I do not know whether these charges by the union are true or not, but they are quite serious charges and they have not been answered by the minister or by others who have spoken on behalf of the government. A very large piece of legislation is being introduced in a way which is quite unsatisfactory and making all sorts of commitments and promises which seem to be much more closely related to the political interests of government than to helping young people in this country.",64
52,Mr SAWFORD,TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND,"The Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994 will change the name of the Student Assistance Act 1973 to the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. This bill establishes the income support component of the youth training initiative as announced in Working Nation, the white paper on employment and growth. The youth training initiative comprises three main strands. Firstly, it provides intensive case management to unemployed people under the age of 18 years. A specific case manager will assist the young unemployed in their search for suitable training, education and work opportunities. Young people will become eligible for case management 13 weeks after registering as unemployed. Young persons at high risk will be provided with earlier case management. Secondly, the youth training initiative provides a labour market or vocational training program placement for young people who remain unemployed six months after registering for unemployment. Thirdly, it provides new income support arrangements to encourage young people to undertake approved education training or jobsearch activities. This, of course, will replace the jobsearch allowance for under 18year-olds. Just to make a comment on a statement of the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the people on jobsearch currently will remain on jobsearch. This income support component will be the youth training allowance which will be established by the present bill. The youth training allowance and the other youth training initiative components will commence on 1 January next year. Young people who are already receiving jobsearch allowance at that date will continue to receive jobsearch allowance. The total cost of the youth training initiative is estimated at $73.7 million for 1994-95 rising to $235.8 million in 1997-98. Of this, the expected annual expenditure for the youth training allowance is $36 million for 1994-95 rising to $125 million in 1997-98. The youth the training allowance will provide over 50,000 places per year to 15to 17 - year-olds when fully implemented, which is a major increase over the current level of 26,000 commencements in labour market programs by under 18-year-olds. In general, the bill will not affect the student assistance schemes. However, the bill will make three changes. Firstly, it will implement safeguards for information about students; secondly, it will repeal the requirement for an annual report on the act, as this duplicates the department's annual report; thirdly, a government amendment will move that student assistance appeals be heard by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. In an ideal world teenagers aged 15, 16 and 17 should be in education and training and not in the work force, unless their being in the work force is accompanied by training of at least a threeor four-year duration. This not only helps young people to possess the necessary prerequisites to enter the work force but also provides them with a much more solid basis for secure employment and further training. The Commonwealth government's objective, agreed by all Australian governments, is that by the centenary of Federation 95 per cent of 19-year-olds will have completed year 12 or an initial post-school qualification, or be participating in formally recognised education and training. Last year, 1993, 77 112 per cent of 19-year-olds achieved this goal, but that figure is still well below the average for the OECD. There is no doubt that this nation needs to acknowledge the dramatic changes which have taken place in the Australian labour market over the last 30 years. As I am sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, 30 years ago low skilled jobs were readily available, and probably both you and I in our own lives took advantage of them. Getting work as a teenager was the norm, and few people expected to retrain during their working lives. In fact, in the mid-1960s nearly 60 per cent of 15or 19-year-olds had full-time jobs, and under a quarter completed full-time secondary education. Today, less than 20 per cent of teenagers hold a full-time job, but 75 per cent now complete secondary school. It is important to recognise that we will never return to the world of 30 years ago, where large numbers of jobs were available for unskilled young workers. Today, half the number of people who are unemployed are under the age of 30. Australia's high rate of youth unemployment reflects the fact that we have one of the highest rates of labour force participation in the OECD. Conversely, we have one of the lowest rates of participation in apprenticeships and in secondary school vocational education. It is an area of secondary school level vocational education and the time spent before that in primary school that I would like to address more fully. The young people on which this bill is focused are the 14 per cent of young people who still drop out of school early without going on to further education and training. There is no doubt that those young people who drop out will be disadvantaged throughout their lives, facing much longer periods and much higher rates of unemployment. Working Nation states that young people are much more likely to come from lower socio-economic backgrounds, have a disability, be an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander or homeless. Unfortunately, it omits the most important factor: the success or otherwise of schooling at the primary school level. To Working Nation's credit, it states that we need to act now to stop the cycle of disadvantage continuing and building, but it does not state when or where we should start. There is a paucity of research in this country as to why young people are unsuccessful in primary school. For that reason alone, state governments of all political persuasions stand condemned. But there is international research available, and certainly that would apply to Australia. I refer to one example: the London Education Authority'S four-year longitudinal study on primary schooling which was completed in 1986. It states that the most significant determinant of future success is the quality of education received between the ages of seven and 11, and that schooling was a more significant factor in the determinant of future success than socio-economic background, gender, race or religion. As someone who spent 25 years with children, I know in my head and heart that the findings of the London Education Authority are correct and apply to this country. The question that needs to be asked is: why has similar research not been conducted in this country? As all members of this House are aware, it is state governments which are primarily responsible for the schooling of 5to 15-year-olds. It is the failure of state government education policies that contribute more than any other factor to the 14 per cent of young people who leave school early. This age group, the 5to 15-year-olds, are the forgotten sector of Australian society. They comprise a powerless group in Australian society-governments fail their needs; business and unions generally ignore them; the media trivialises or sensationalises their activities; church and welfare groups give faint-hearted attention; and fellow vested interests in education at universities, TAFEs and senior secondary schools white-ant-and I do mean white-ant-almost their every plea for a fair share of resources and ridicule the credibility of their claims. These young people do not leave school early because of poor socio-economic background, their gender, their religion, their race or because they have a disability. They leave because for years and years they have been at school without success. They are downright bloody angry, hurt and ornery-and who can blame them? Children know; they do not need someone to tell them. They know that, when they leave primary school, they need to possess literacy skills, numeracy skills, appropriate social skills and technological skillsand they know when they do not have them. These children do not need someone removed from society in some ivory tower in a closeted university conducting some research, some educational bureaucrat pontificating on whether there is a problem or not, or another politician suggesting an inquiry. It is all around us-graffiti, damage to public transport, vandalism, petty crime, homelessness, arson, stealing cars, suicide, drug abuse. What else do these kids have to do to get some attention in this country? They do these things because they feel that they are failures. They are frightened, desperate, hurt and angry at their lack of success, and some will let fly at anything. It is a very uncivilised society that does not care for its young. Children, when they first go to school, are generally pretty excited and full of hope. Certainly, the odd one is tearful, but often a sympathetic and caring teacher can overcome that, and usually very quickly. But the child who fails to grasp early literacy and numeracy skills is at risk as early as six years of age when the symbols placed in front of him or her make no sense and there is no specialist teacher available to deal with that problem with an appropriate program such as 'reading recovery' or 'first steps'. A child is at risk in large classes when, because of lack of social skill, a disability or a difference, child is ostracised by others and does not have the counselling skills available to him or her to learn the strategies to overcome and resolve those conflicts. In that situation, self-esteem and confidence of young people falls. Anger, hurt and confusion rises. These are the children who make up the majority of those 14 per cent who leave school early. Yet many of these children, even in their last years in primary school, have not yet been overcome with hopelessness nor, indeed, do they have significant behavioural problems. They hold out for a second chance of what secondary school may offer them. This brings me to the second major issue I want to raise: secondary school vocational education. I am not asking to go back to the technical schools of the 1950s and 1960s, even though they were a superior form of education. But certainly we need technological and operative skills in the context of 1994 leading on to the next century. There is no doubt that one way of encouraging young people to stay at school is to make sure that the school curriculum is flexible enough to meet the needs of each individual and that all young people, no matter what courses they follow, acquire the key competencies which are needed for work and life. Staying on at school does not mean everyone should study the same academically oriented curriculum totally removed from the needs of industry. In fact, smart young people these days are not necessarily taking the road to university. They can see the future, observe what is going on around them and know that they need technical and operative skills, and that those skills will be required in future industry. Yet the young person without effective literacy, numeracy, social or technological skills is in store for one hell of a shock on arrival at secondary school. Such young people very quickly learn that they cannot fit in, and life at school becomes a misery. That is exacerbated if they come from a low socio-economic base, are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, have disabilities or are homeless. They do not just leave school; they run the away. They hide, and they vent their anger at great cost to society. I remain quite convinced that, for the great majority of this group, this is all preventable. It is to our shame as a nation that we have so long ignored the needs of our forgotten people: children aged from five to 15 years. This bill deals with the consequences of that negligence for young people who have failed at their first chance of schooling, in primary schools, and at their second chance of schooling, in secondary school. It provides a third chance to participate in education and training, this time with desperately needed individual case management. I acknowledge the member for Goldstein for approving case management and individual attention, because perhaps the basic goal of all education is the impact of mind on mind. It is not necessarily the technology. It is that personal relationship, as well as the building of trust into that personal relationship, that gives the confidence to explore all the options that are available. How much more productive, efficient and cheaper for the taxpayer would it have been, and how much less damage would have occurred, if that early school leaver had had a remedy by way of a specialist teacher, a counsellor or a case manager when he or she was six years of age and, probably, first exhibited the signs of the learning or social difficulty he or she developed at a later age? I welcome the move to a closer integration of general and vocational education. I welcome the spread of joint school-industry programs involving work placements combined with high quality vocational training. The further expansion of vocational education and training is important if we are to provide individuals with the level of skills try requires. Since 1989, the Commonwealth has more than doubled its expenditure on vocational education and training. As a result of the agreement with the states and territories to establish the Australian National Training Authority, the Commonwealth will provide $1.1 billion in growth funding over the period 1993-96. It is a substantive investment in our collective future. However, the dividend of that investment will be greatly diminished if we fail to meet the needs of our young before they leave school. In that context, it is extremely disturbbeen ing to read about the cuts to education made by the Kennett government in Victoria and the Brown government in my home state of South Australia. At a time in this nation's development when we are trying to develop a skilled and flexible work force and when additional resources are required by schools, expenditure by the states is decreasing as Commonwealth recurrent expenditure increases. Since the 1992 state election in Victoria, Kennett has slashed $400 million from the state education budget. In October last year, cuts worth $230 million in a full year were introduced in Victoria. Dean Brown in South Australia-your colleague, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew-cut $22 million in the recent budget, with more anticipated in the next three years. That is not smart. That is not clever. That is not even honest. New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland have traditionally not spent highly on schooling. Yet, to Premier Wayne Goss's credit, expenditure in Queensland has increased in each year in which he has been the Premier. Of course, it needs to be understood, from Queensland's point of view, that Queensland came off a very low base after many years under Joh Bjelke-Petersen. This is a particularly dangerous situation for the future of young people who have difficulties at school. It is a particularly dangerous situation for Australian society, as those young people who do not have their aspirations met or their needs attended to will take that indus- out their anger on society. By the centenary of Federation, this bill ought not to play a significant role in the fortunes of young people seeking education and training for entry into the work force. Fifty thousand places are anticipated under the youth training initiative by 1996-97. That ought to be an absolute maximum. The next generation of young people going through our schools, if success is to be measured, should not need 50,000 places. They should be in appropriate education, they should be in appropriate training and, if they have had learning or social difficulties, that should have identified and remedied when it occurred. However, with state governments behaving as they have in recent years, I am not holding my breath. This bill is important legislation. In an ideal about world, it should not be necessary to the extent that it is, but it does provide a safety valve. By including early schoolleavers and providwe ing opportunities for them to participate effectively in education and training with guidance of a case manager, their chances securing employment increases. I commend the bill to the House.",69
53,Mr WAKELIN,TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND,"The children. Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowam ance) Amendment Bill 1994 is one of almost 50 separate labour programs that have come into this place in the life of the Labor ment. It is part of 26 major economic statehours ments, including the last federal budget, to come into this 37th parliament. The Labor matter of money. government has had 12 years of opportunities to overcome the difficulties that this student assistance amendment bill is trying to over Mr come. So it would be unwise of the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), any other member of the government, or the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), to be too glowing in his defence the last 12 years. Before anyone considers that I have suddenin ly acquired two heads since I have become Liberal member of parliament, I would mind the House that I am a proud father four almost grown children and that I have interest in their future. I do not have to member of the great labour movement to have an interest in this matter and to well. I have watched my children grow up, and I have watched with some dismay some of the offerings that have been put their from the education system. I think the ber for Port Adelaide and I would share many concerns about how that has been done. I want to point out to the House that all us in this place are very keen about, and an acute interest in, the future of the young people of this nation. If we are going to talk about socio-economic situations, I suppose should say that as a farmer-a proud farmer, I quickly add-from the Eyre Peninsula I would probably be in the bottom 14 per cent socioeconomically. That was before my election to this place, where I am of course handsomely paid. In response to the comment the state governments, I remind the House that, if my recollection is correct, during the period of the Whitlam government actually doubled in real terms the amount of per capita spending on education, yet from the that period on we seem to have got into more of and more trouble with unemployment. I do not think it is just the amount of money. I come back to the experience of my own I will not name the child of mine I thinking of when I consider that it is not just a matter of money. Being a bit lost in one of the courses and wanting to refocus, this governindividual came home and spent 60 to 80 a week working and training to achieve a particular goal, so I know it is not just a Before we become too critical of the state government and too critical of Mr Brown or Kennett, perhaps we should just consider the stewardship of previous state governments. Perhaps we should remember that in Victoria we had a fellow by the name of Cain and a lady by the name of Mrs Kirner, who of were there for some considerable time and had great opportunities to make improvements primary school and in any educational a programs. In my own state, the current Premireer, Dean Brown-lam sure the member for with Port Adelaide would remember-was elected an only in December 1993. Before that we had be a a fellow by the name of John Bannon as premier, who had stewardship of the state for wish them something like 10 years. No-one likes to cut money from programs. No politician in his or her right mind wants way to do that, but let us remember that great memSouth Australian experience. As a former bank clerk, I remember it very well. We had a loss of about $3.1 billion from the State of Bank, which the state government has to try have to manage. The people of South Australia know dam well the difficulties created by that tragedy. It is not a matter of $3.1 billion as I much as what the opportunities might have been for South Australia if that disaster had not occurred. So let us not become too selfrighteous in this place. Lynn Arnold, on his way to Spain now-a man I must say that I had some considerable personal respect forwas left with the stewardship of that state until Mr Brown took on a very difficult task. Turning to the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill, I point out that the youth training initiative is one of many promises contained in the promotional package known as Working Nation. Under the initiative the government will introduce a payment for unemployed 15to 18-year-olds. The youth training allowance will replace their jobsearch allowance. I support the concept of the federal government providing more intense case management for these jobless young people, and I will say more about case management if time allows later. Since there have been 50 separate labour programs over the last 10 years, I am concerned that this should not be just another publicity program; that it should not be designed to mask the lack of options which the government is able to provide for our youth. I am absolutely fearful that the youth training allowance may be nothing but a new name for an old payment. It is also another in a long and growing list of various government payments. When anyone is going to be employed through these training schemes, sadly it may well mean just more public servants. I see that the Commonwealth will increase its own intake of trainees to 2,500 by 1995-96. The purpose of the youth training allowance is to encourage young people to think of further training as their first and best option. I am concerned that this training be worthwhile, and I am sure participants will be too. The last thing we need is more young people being pushed through remedial type courses when many have skills which go beyond that. I was glad to see in Working Nation that the federal government has acknowledged the need for this training to be accredited wherever possible. I encourage the government to work vigorously to ensure that the maximum amount of this training is accredited and contains training in skills which young people can directly apply to the workplace. We need training courses that will help people acquire skills which are beneficial to potential employers and not pointless training schemes the only purpose of which is to help people buy time and appear active. I am glad that an attempt will be made to have this training accredited, and I urge the government to take action towards that end. It is interesting to note that, with the youth training allowance, all jobless youth will receive a minimum payment of $30.90 regardless of their parents' income. Although the allowance is subject to their personal income-which in many cases I presume will be nil-I find it a little incongruous that there is not some cut-off point for the children of parents who are very well off. Austudy has a cut-off point which the government is happy to administer quite strictly. While I am on Austudy, I make the point that Professor Chapman, in his assessment of Austudy in 1991-92, said that if we did abolish the Austudy assets test it would result in a total cost to revenue of $57 million. I understand that there is a need for restraint in government expenditure but, when we consider the billions of dollars that are going into programs such as this and into the tertiary sector, $57 million in 1991-92 terms to allow the people of the regions to have reasonable access to Austudy seems a small price to pay. Given the drought, the thing that has struck me most in the last few weeks is that there is an overwhelming desire by so many rural people to get their children out of farming, to get them off the land. That is the kindest thing that they can do for them. I think we must be mindful of that. I return to the youth training allowance and whether it should be means tested or otherwise. The government has been most strict in applying the Austudy assets test to rural families. Therefore this measure of a minimum payment regardless of the level of parental income seems contradictory. I note that a remote area allowance will be a component of the youth training allowance. Whilst I am not aware of the full details, this is a move which I welcome cautiously. On past experience, it is extremely difficult to qualify the remote area allowance or isolated children's schemes. This is one of my main areas of concern with youth unemployment and education. The young people who need assistance the most, the young people living in regional Australia, find it so difficult to obtain the level of assistance they need. The honourable member for Port Adelaide mentioned Aboriginal people as the most disadvantaged group. In a report to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the following point concerning this whole issue was made by Mr Ramsay from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission: In remote communities, isolated from the mainstream labour market, it should be recognised that case management and job compact may not deliver lasting job outcomes. Of course, that would be part of this whole youth training issue as well. While I am on the subject of Aboriginal people, I would like to draw to the attention of the House an issue that came up in recent weeks on Aboriginal people in management and how we might get a better outcome. I understand something like 76 per cent of Aboriginal people in a particular community-a fairly advantaged community by many standards-may make it to year 9. That means that 24 per cent try to go on to year 12. The point I make is that we have to be careful about what actually happened in this case. The TAFE or some other provider said, 'We've got 76 per cent of people not going on to year 12, so we're going to offer a program.' But what it found was that it did not pick up many of the 76 per cent who were disadvantaged; it picked up the 24 per cent who were trying to go on. We have to be careful about the signals we send and how we manage programs. Most students from regional areas must move away from home to study their chosen course. Many apprentices and trainees from regional Australia must also travel to metropolitan areas from time to time to take up the theoretical part of their traineeships. The remote area allowance must be fair and flexible in recognising these realities. Aside from the introduction of yet another training initiative, a new government payment, what can we as a parliament do for the unemployed in Australia? This governmentas I suppose, all governments do-relies very much on the Australian Public Service. However, in the matter of case management, new payments and intensive marketing, perhaps the service could be more flexible. The government is trying to do that, but perhaps it needs to be more open and more flexible by looking at the outcomes more than it has in the past. I hope the government will take that on board. Another perspective is that of the employer. The employer is the other half of the jobs equation. We spend so much time looking at the plight of the unemployed that perhaps we neglect what their potential employers need. Perhaps we neglect the relationship between the employer and the employee. It is not a matter of class warfare. It is not a matter of being taken advantage of. It is a matter of the opportunity that an employer can offer an individual. My first paid job was as a bank clerk. I was paid the princely sum of $15 a week after tax. It was a wonderful wage. After paying $12 board, I had $3 to spend for the week. I felt like a king because I had a job, I was part of the work force, and I was an independent 15year-old. I accept what the honourable member for Port Adelaide said about encouraging young people to go on to higher education. I have encouraged members of my family to do so. Young people should aspire to that and we should encourage them. However, life is not just about theories and academic solutions. It is about reality. It is about opportunities. I came from a period of full employment. I was paid a very modest wage, but I had a job and I never ever felt disadvantaged, however modest that job was. I could speak for a long time about opportunities for employment, but suffice it to say that countless reports have pointed out to the government that business is constrained by taxation and regulation. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled Small business in Australia: challenges, problems and opportunities-the so-called Beddall report - said in 1990 that the amount of regulation in business had to be contained and monitored. The committee recommended that the Business Regulation Review Unit be expanded. At the time it had a staff of only six. Business was suffering from the amount of red tape, and that red tape had to be removed. That bipartisan committee also recommended that the Business Regulation Review Unit do a stocktake of all Commonwealth regulations. However, the government did not take its recommendations on board until Working Nation. It took four years for the government to take some notice of the committee's report. am sure that the member for Port Adelaide was on that committee. He understands and has some respect for the role of small ness in employment. During those four years, thousands more people became unemployed and businesses became more frustrated. Finally, in Working Nation the government stated: The Government will expand the Office of Regulation Review and provide better review processes for both new and existing Commonwealth legislation. As I said, the government first saw that recommendation in the Beddall report of 1990. What else can the government do to employers and therefore help the jobless? Where do I start? There is the old chestnut of industrial relations. I noticed the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) on Lateline last night really doing, I thought, a pretty commendable job, considering the pressure him from a variety of quarters, defending indefensible in terms of the industrial tions legislation. Any progress which the government has made in industrial relations over recent years has been made with ideas essentially spawned within the coalition, and I think that is recognised. We on this side the debate, and the current government has actually come in and picked up many ideas and no doubt tailored them. I would be too generous in saying that I am satisfied it, but the reality is that it was spawned this side of the parliament and then tailored to the award system for the ACTU. It is simple: more taxes on business equals fewer jobs. This student assistance amendment bill is supported by the coalition, although some amendments may be proposed.",73
54,Mrs CROSIO,TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (1.26 p.m.)-I am very pleased to be able to speak on the legislation before the House because it plays such a very important role in bringing to fruition some of our government's aims for helping our youth, as outlined in our Working Nation document. I have to say that, contrary to the negative attitude that has been I displayed by the opposition, our government at least is prepared to put its money where its mouth is. It has implemented and continues busito implement programs and policies which will achieve a fairer and more equitable society. It is a government which directs energies in a very positive manner. This Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill changes the name of the Student Assistance Act 1973 to the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 and provides for the payment of youth training allowance instead of jobsearch allowance to young unemployed people under the age of 18 years. As part of our federal government's $660 million white paper youth training initiative, the youth training allowance is an help income support measure for unemployed people under the age of 18 years. The Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance-Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill compleon ments the Student Assistance (Youth Training the Allowance) Amendment Bi1l1994, referred to relaas the YTA legislation, and enacts saving provisions and transitional provisions. It also makes amendments to a number of provisions of other acts which deal with jobsearch allowance and, of course, our Social Security set Act 1991. It does that so that uniformity is achieved in all aspects in portfolios dealing of those with youth unemployment. While our Department of Social Security with will remain the paying agency for jobsearch on and youth training allowance, the Department of Employment, Education and Training will have responsibility for YTA. This is in line with the idea of placing more emphasis than previously on the integration of income support and processes which lead to employment or employment related outcomes. DEET will have responsibility for program delivery and for the labour market program placements. In my view, this is a very logical move. Combining these elements demonstrates the government's commitment to enhancing cooperation between portfolios and ensuring improvements in knowledge of each other's responsibilities. With this legislation some changes will occur to student assistant schemes, such as the implementation of safeguards for information about student assistance clients, the repeal of the requirement for an annual report on the act, as this duplicates the department's annual report, and moves to have student assistance appeals heard by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The YTA aims to ensure access to education, training or work for all young people and to equip them to compete effectively in our labour market. It also provides for access to comprehensive specific case management and vocational training programs. Realistically, it endeavours to reinforce for young people that sound education and training are pivotal to a successful career path and the need to implement early action to prevent young unemployed from entering the ranks of the long-term unemployed. Specifically, providing over 50,000 places annually to 15to 17-year-olds will significantly increase the number of commencements in labour market programs for that specific group. The bill's transitional provisions provide appropriate treatment of claims for a jobsearch allowance made by people under the age of 18 years and will have a date of commencement before the commencement of the YTA legislation. Youth training allowance will align benefits for unemployed young people more closely with Austudy, encompassing a rate for unemployed young people who do not qualify as independent but need to live away from home to seek employment or undertake suitable training, subject to CES certification. Some of the benefits of the YTA are that there will be flexibility of rates, YTA clients will qualify for a health care card, and the fortnightly rate of the YTA may be increased by various allowances. Obtaining meaningful employment has always been a key concern to young Australians. Increasingly, youth unemployment is a major concern to the whole community and indeed to our government. There is no doubt that Australians place enormous priority on all facets of their children's welfare, development and particularly their future prospects. The 1990 ANOP youth survey found that the main issues of concern to our young people in the 15to 20-year-old age group were money, education and jobs. Expressions of concern about future employment and financial circumstances featured strongly. The issues confronting youth today-completing their education, training, gaining employment and economic independence, forming their own living arrangements and social relationships-are being faced in a time of considerable structural change to Australia's economic base. This has been compounded by the worldwide economic downturn of recent years. I believe it is fair to say that, to some considerable extent, high levels of youth unemployment are the result of technological and structural changes within our economy. Simply, entry level training for many of our youth has declined with technological advances. Irrespective of our politics, we all know that many jobs have disappeared. As the former New South Wales Premier, Nick Greiner-and I do not often quote him in this House-put it when he launched the 1991 New South Wales government youth policy, the problem is not youth but the rapid changes in society, particularly in technology and in the labour market. Many jobs which in the past provided entry to the work force for our youth have gone. White-collar and clerical work for youth has declined. For example, between 1966 and 1986-the period of the figures which I have available to me-the number of typing positions has been estimated to have fallen by some 28 per cent, clerical positions by 38 per cent, telephonists positions by 66 per cent and postal workers positions by nearly 70 per cent. Full-time teenage employment has fallen in skilled occupations such as nursing, drafting, electrical work and printing. Additionally, higher entry qualifications have closed off work options in banks and in the Public Service. The declining share of full-time employment and the increasing economic dependency of young people over the past 20 years have been recognised in federal government policies. The government has encouraged participation in further education and has targeted its assistance measures accordingly. Certainly, the majority of Australian young people are obtaining higher education levels and more skills than young people of previous generations. Many of them take part-time jobs while in school and further education to supplement their slower moves towards economic independence. A 1993 study from the research group in the Parliamentary Library shows that of most concern to social researchers and youth workers are the 10 to 15 per cent of young people who are estimated to be falling out of the net of mainstream education, training and work opportunities. This is the group who are most likely to be forced to leave their parents' home early, who are most likely to leave school, who are most likely to have limited employment skills and who are certainly most likely to be living in poverty on the streets. That group is of concern to our federal government. That is why the government introduces policies to assist young people in every possible way. However, as fast as we introduce positive measures to help our youth, we seem to have the opposition taking a contrary stance. Consider the Liberal Kennett government in Victoria. Over the past two years, the Kennett government has continued its demolition, which has seen over 230 schools closed, 8,000 teachers forced out of the state system and a further 1,000 made redundant. In fact, the federal government's share of the funding to the Victorian education system has been increased substantially since 1992, as the Kennett government has progressively reduced its own spending. In my own home state, New South Wales, the Liberal coalition government has sacked 2,500 teachers since 1988. However, the federal government will persevere with those policies which are achieving results. Since 1983, the federal Labor government has embarked on unprecedented reform programs to improve Australia's education and training systems, to enhance our society and culture, and to provide a work force which is highly skilled, productive and internationally competitive. Work has been under way on the consistency and quality of school curricula between states and territories in many core subject areas. The nation's literacy and language skills improvement programs have been, I am pleased to say, implemented. We are very proud of our retention rates, which have increased remarkably. For example, when Labor came to office in 1983, only four out of 10 people were staying on at school until year 12. That figure is now eight out of 10. Importantly, improvements in educational systems have been accompanied by new and dynamic approaches in the training area. Central to the federal government's programs is the idea of increasing opportunities for everyone, particularly those at the bottom of the socio-economic scale. Recent figures are gratifying. Economic growth is strong. Consumer and business confidence levels are high. There is improved international competitiveness, less time is lost through industrial disputes these days and, of course, inflation is at an all-time low. The latest industry survey has also shown a continuing pick-up in recovery in the important metal and engineering industry, with production at a five-year high and investment set to jump. According to the Metal Trades Industry Association, three out of five firms now in the industry have reported busy trading conditions in the three months to September of this year. Almost 40 per cent of the 290 firms surveyed have increased their work forces. About 30 per cent have reported higher exports, with further gains expected within coming months. These good news stories are a by-product of our government's policies. In the final analysis, what we have achieved is real. The achievements of our Labor government since 1983, in difficult times, have given us healthy economic base on which to build for the future. Certainly, in the International of the Family, the federal government nises the importance of providing for youth and constantly displays willingness to particiskills pate in innovative ventures that positive results. That the federal government has endorsed a proposal from the Australian Football League for the establishment of a six-year sports traineeship program for something like 1,200 unemployed young Australians is just one example. This sports traineeship program, based on federal government funding and support, is a major initiative for Australian football. It will provide an excellent opporfederal tunity to develop a national program with of our clubs and to give young chance of developing specific skills to assist their ultimate entry to the work force. The agreement with the AFL can serve as a model for establishing traineeships in other sporting codes. Discussions are already under way, I gather, with a number of major sportwould ing organisations. AFL traineeships will our young people useful, marketable and portable skills by offering training in sports administration, umpiring, ground keeping, coaching and catering. As a national program-with trainees available to all clubs in the national league, including Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelment aide, and country players-its potential is obvious. As well, a formal curriculum, comthe prising a range of accredited training modules, will result in trainees receiving a portable qualification under the Australian vocational certificate training system following the successful completion of that traineeship. Other programs, illustrating clearly government's commitment to getting young people into jobs, will of course include our $700,000 federal funding package to improve the national coordination of youth programs and services. Called the youth strategy action grants program, this program will fund projects nationally, in cooperation with state and territory governments. Focusing on the needy, special attention is to be paid to people who are currently unemployed, homea less or living in the more remote areas. YSA programs include strategies aimed at improvYear ing coordination of case management for our recogyoung people, assisting non-government bodies to improve financial and management and developing innovative strategies to will produce assist young offenders. Further, the federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has recently commenced discussions with the National Farmers Federation on a package of rural traineeships specifically designed to help our drought ravaged farmers. In launching a green jobs report commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and DEET, the minister noted that by the year 2000 all we can expect as many as 700,000 jobs in people the environment industries. Contrast such lateral thinking and involvement in positive ventures with the approach of the opposition. What does the opposition stand for? Looking at their paper, The Things That Matter-hardly an inspiring name, you have to admit-I notice that it is full teach of motherhood statements. What does the document say? Nothing substantial, and certainly nothing specific. It says, 'Young people should be able to look to the future with hope and optimism.' But what does this mean? The document says the coalition will provide young people with genuine employopportunities and give our youth the basic skills needed to find employment. But coalition does not provide any substance or specific outline for its policies or intentions. Its paper is merely a set of cliches. The federal Labor government has the runs on the board. Since it was re-elected in March 1993, 413,900 new jobs have been created. the Figures now show that 31,000 long-term unemployed people have been helped under the federal government's job compact in its first three months of operation. Interestingly, these figures have been disputed by the coalition, which claims that the white paper 15 measures have failed. What have we really received from the opposition? Zilch! But there has been strong support from many quarters young for the government's ideas for nationally recognised vocational skill based competencies. Views from the union movement, youth organisations and the community generally are that, while the young may be viewed as trainees rather than workers, their pay be based on their level of competence. That is where the federal government policies are assisting our young unskilled people. Training is being provided, and improvements in educational systems have been accompanied by new and dynamic approaches in the training area. While the government has implemented plans for long-term systemic change, it has also modified existing programs. Vocational training has been high on the government's agenda. Substantial funds have been provided for the establishment and expansion of a national system of vocational education and training with the establishment, of course, our Australian National Training Authority. We have also substantially increased spending on TAPE. We are now on a path of strong sustainable growth, because we have implemented a comprehensive and intensive program of economic reform, concentrating on many sectors. Consequently, employment has increased by 3.8 per cent since April of 1993. That represents 286,000 new jobs in only 11/4 years. At that rate, we will easily have exceeded our election target of 500,000 extra jobs in this term of office. Our federal Labor government acknowledges that unemployment still needs to be addressed. The government's introduction of a training wage, allowing businesses to employ more people and train them to acquire appropriate skills, will help meet needs of the modem Australian economy. It will also help people, particularly our young people, get the skills they need to enter and to stay in the work force. Our training wage contrasts sharply with that punitive, slavelabour youth wage that was originally put forward by the opposition. With a highly educated, skilled and motivated work force, Australia can take its as a leading player within the world community. Australia is enjoying a strong economic recovery which is well based, thus giving Australia the real prospects of achieving a strong economic performance for the rest of this century. I am very pleased with the bill before the House, and I am particularly pleased that it forms such a vital part of the should program of implementing what we, as a government, see as vital structures for the youth of tomorrow. I commend the minister on the bill, and I am pleased to support it here in the House today.",76
55,Mrs BISHOP,TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND,"Mackellar) (1.45 p.m.)Continually I hear government members bleating about what they have heard from the opposition. They say, 'What is the opposition doing about this?' and, 'What have they got to say about such and such?' I am getting increasingly more angered by it because government members are the people who are responsible for the development of policy, for bringing it before the parliament and the of Australian people and for implementing it through legislation. In my own area of health I find I have an opposite number in Minister Lawrence who continually espouses a wish list of what she might like to achieve, but never do I see anything that could possibly be called policy, anything with detail of how it will be implemented or precisely what has been negotiated. The package brought down in August was a classic example. The minister's best statement at her press conference was, 'I'm terribly sorry that this is so difficult.' What the press forgot to ask was, 'For whom, Minister-for you or for us?' On that occasion all we heard was a PR blurb about how this package was supposed to slow down the rate of decline in private health insurance. It will fail on every the count, as we have seen in the last two days when the government's own health fund, Medibank Private, in Victoria put out a press release saying that 750,000 Victorians will benefit by cuts to their premiums when in fact one-quarter of Medibank's membership had a premium rise. This is the sort of doublespeak and double standard we get. When I look at the financial place impact of the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance-Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994 I see that the explanatory memorandum says: There would be negligible financial impact on the Commonwealth arising from these amendments. In relation to the sickness allowance the financial impact would be minimal because few people will be affected. I just happen to have had come my way a letter signed by Minister Lawrence written to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), which says: Dear Minister, I refer to your letter of 29 September 1994 seeking my agreement to include consequential amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Disability Services Act 1986, the Health Insurance Act 1973, and the National Health Act 1953 to the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994 in the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments Bill 1994. I note that the consequential amendments to the National Health Act 1953 will have the effect of increasing the overall cost to the budget of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I agree to the consequential amendments to these Acts being included in the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments Bill 1994 which, I understand, is due to be introduced in Parliament in the sittings week beginning 10 October 1994. Remember that the explanatory memorandum said there would be no impact. Here is a statement from Minister Lawrence to another minister saying that the bill will result in an increase in overall costs to the budget of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Where is that disclosed? How much is the legislation going to impact upon it? We are supposed to have a government that is paying attention to the development of policy. Policy means that we get all the facts. It means that when we have a financial impact statement we want a financial impact statement. If the minister takes sufficient time out in her letter dealing with all the other bills that are to be addressed to say that she notes there will be an impact, why are we not told about it in the parliament? Again and again I hear ministers and members on the opposite side say to us, 'When are you going to give us all your costings and all the things that you're planning?' Apply it to yourselves, because you are in government. We are not the government in exile. We are offering another way. Again and again I have sat in Senate estimates committees and questioned bureaucrats who had been forced to abuse their function by doing party political work in analysing statements that had been made by the opposition. Allegedly they were doing this work for the benefit of government but in fact it was for a party political purpose. I will not be a party to encouraging that sort of behaviour in the Public Service. The strains that a government headed by a man of such arrogance as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who does not stop at threats, puts upon people-be they people in the private sector or people in the public sector-threaten people, literally, so that they act out of fear. I will not be party to making their lives more difficult. The point I want to make here today is that the government is obliged to give us particular details with regard to expenditure that is being incurred, not global statements that it is all going to be okay, and to tell us where the money is coming from. Again and again I say that we have a financial crisis in health. We have a crisis because the private sector is collapsing slowly but surely because of the people leaving private health insurance. For every one per cent of people who leave private health insurance, the government has to find another $100 million. Where is the minister to find that money? She glibly says she will not put up the Medicare levy. It does not matter. The Medicare levy accounts for only seven per cent of our total expenditure on health care. We spend $34 billion and the Medicare levy raises in the vicinity of $2.4 billion for an equivalent year and is predicted to raise $3 billion in the current financial year-a piddling amount, if you will pardon the expression-so it is ordinary taxation revenue that provides the money to pay for health care services from the Commonwealth. The minister has to come clean. As the costs continue to blowout, we are entitled to know where the money is coming from. Is it coming from a further blow-out in the budget deficit, or is it going to come by way of increased taxation? There is no special bank account marked 'Medicare levy'. It does not exist. The Medicare levy is just ordinary tax that goes into the consolidated revenue, like fuel tax or any other form of tax. We are entitled to know whether we are simply going to see a continuing blow-out in this deficit whether we are going to see a rise in taxation. Just as we are not told how much the cost of the PBS system will rise, the minister refuses to answer as to what the financial impact of this legislation will be. We are entitled to know those things so we can make a judgment about the way in which this government is managing our economy.",80
56,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND,"I find it hard to place the remarks of the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) in the context of the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994 again. and the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance-Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994, work. particularly if one looks at the consequential amendments in terms of other portfolio areas.",82
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND," degree. I interrupt you briefly, before you begin your speech, to say that I too wondered at the reference to the health portfolio until honourable member for Mackellar indicated its relationship to the bills before the House. That was the reason I had not interrupted her.",82
58,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND,"Yes, I was as a mindful of that. I had hoped that the member would have contributed to the debate on the legislation rather than using it as an excuse talk about something entirely different, which is obviously what she has done. The consesentatives quential amendments have much more to do with the introduction into the national system of a new terminology and a new classification which need to be accommodated in all sysmy tems. People who were previously accommoissue dated under the jobsearch allowance be accommodated under the youth training allowance. It is that consequential amendcommunity ment, obviously, which this debate is about. There may be a cost to it, but the cost obvithis ously will be inconsequential. The changes in world technology, in world skills and in world trade are sufficiently profound to have been reflected deeply in society. We were one of the slower countries to respond, if one looks back to the 1970s, in the education and training of our youth. In the early 1980s Australia was lagging well behind the Western world in school retention ratios or and in the options, directions and diversity available to our talented young people. It is in that context that a set of rapid changes have taken place, and we are trying to adapt and position ourselves in that context. People no longer will go from school to work, which was certainly the tradition for the majority of people when I grew up-and, I think, for most members. The minority went into training of some form, whether it was university, a trade or whatever. The fact was that most people went from school to a job. With this legislation, that may never occur It could still happen, technically, but the desirable way is for people to go from school to training of some sort and then to That will ensure that every person is given the opportunity and support to develop his or her skills to the greatest possible In that way, the white paper signals a sea change in the conceptual relationship between the school, work and the community. The idea that we no longer will pay unemployment benefits was changed back in 1985 or 1987 when we switched to the jobsearch allowance concept. That was, as it were, a halfway house. The full development now, which is clearly needed, is the youth training allow to ance. That, I think, has broad community support. In that context, the House of RepreStanding Committee on Community Affairs, of which I am chairman, has been conducting an inquiry for quite some time now into aspects of youth homelessness. So comments on this legislation and on this are primarily related to matters that have need to arisen in that context. There are a number of young people in our who clearly do not have traditional family support, and they will be affected by legislation. Some weeks back, the committee produced a discussion paper which particularly referred to the introduction of the youth training allowance and some of the our concerns that have come through the inquiry process to the committee. We did that both to assist the government to focus on the issues and also for the community and agencies to respond. Those issues involve the differences, to some degree, between the youth training allowance and Austudy. One needs to understand that there will still be two separate systems. Young people who are in training or are seeking work and young people who are still at school will be treated differently, managed by two different departments and under separate legislation. That, in itself, is understandable and I have no particular argument about that. But looking at it from the point of view of homelessness-for children who do not have traditional family support-it seemed to me that there needed to be uniformity and a lack of discrimination. In discussions in recent weeks, it has become clear that the original position of the Department of Employment, Education and Training on the introduction of the youth training allowance was to have separate criteria defining homelessness for people who applied for the youth training allowance as contrasted with those who applied for Austudy. In recent weeks, the two departments have now been able to agree that there be one set of criteria. Whether people are at school or seeking work or in some form of training program, if they are homeless that is a separate issue. To them, the government should be acting as one-not as separate departments with separate rules. We have established now that there will be one set of criteria. I express my appreciation of departmental officers who have been responsive to that problem and of their negotiations with the Department of Social Security to establish that. However, what happens after the legislation, with the application and the processes which are involved, is equally important. Having a separate set of criteria is a vital first step. is an extremely important signal to those applying. But there is not much point in having a single set of criteria if the processes are grossly different. What we suggested in the discussion paper, which followed the hearings we have been having and discussions which include the department, was that young persons presenting at Social Security, DEET, a CES office or a youth access centre would be treated equally whether they were applying for Austudy or the youth training allowance. That appears to be where we are going, and the interchangeability of the two departments is apparently developing also. However, with the processes used by the departments in assessing and determining the methodologies-the use of social workers and even the forms that are filled in-it is extremely important that we do not give a signal to young people at school that it would be simpler and easier to get an allowance for homelessness if they were not at school. That is the case right now and it has been the case for some time. Our feedback from the inquiry has certainly been of concern, which is why that matter has been raised. So I urge the department, as it moves to the implementation of the legislation, to build on what it has achieved so far. The single set of criteria is a major step forward, but it will not be fully effective unless the processes it incorporates are uniform. The idea is that a person simply approaches DEET or Social Security and is treated without discrimination. Therefore, in those towns or areas where there is either a DEET office or a Social Security office-but not both-people can apply for the youth training allowance or Austudy at either office and be treated the same throughout Australia. That will be a major step forward, and I am delighted about it, for a group of people who are greatly disadvantaged. In giving honourable members some of the background to the inquiry I do not wish to pre-empt either my views or the travels and conclusions of the committee. But I point out that, in our investigations and inspections to date, we have talked to a number of young people, and many of the stories we have It heard have been both tragic and disturbing. Certainly, the idea that the government makes life more difficult and more confusing for people who have been so severely traumatised is one that I am sure all members of this House would not support. Another issue we raise in the discussion paper that has been picked up and incorporated in the legislation is the question of appeals relating to homelessness. At the moment the appeal process is through the Student Assistance Review Tribunal and we have raised some concerns about that. The decision to use the Social Security Appeals Tribunal for all appeals-for the youth training allowance and for Austudy-is another step forward. There will now be the same appeal process relating to homelessness for both Austudy and the youth training allowance. Whilst such a procedure has some complications in terms of some of the issues that may be dealt with, the composition of the tribunal and how it will take on the expanded role, it means that again we-the government and the communitypresent one face to our disadvantaged young people. I express appreciation that the ment has been responsive to the need for a uniform process. We will be having some more hearings in outlying areas and talking to people who are living in remote areas in difficult family circumstances, where the nearest offices are a long way away, where the processes are forbidding, and where there is a lack of funds. To be truly equal in our treatment of people, we really have to find ways to get services out to the smaller towns. That is a challenge that has yet to be truly faced up to. Another matter that comes up quite commonly in our hearings and that we have raised in the discussion paper is case management. I want to refer to a danger that I perceive. New methods are found and new ideas come forward: they are good, exciting and constructive, and they blossom. We have new terminology, a phrase such as 'case management', which is an excellent phrase, but as we talk to different departments and different organisations in the non-government sector, we find it actually means quite different things to different people, and there is a danger that we diminish the potential by definition. In the discussion paper, we have documented the possibility of five or six different people being involved in the case management of one person. Obviously, that can come up. However, we need to look very carefully at the methodologies of having key workers or having someone who acts as the prime worker. Homeless young people, in particular, have different kinds of problems. Their main concern is stability in terms of where they live. Once that is established, their prime need may change, and then the key worker may also change. There is a real danger that that will create a system of ownership, whereby an agency or an organisation or a department will feel responsible for a young person whom it has helped through a major crisis. The young person may need to move on in order to evolve, but will be held back by that case management structure. We need to think through case management very carefully. The concern is that, to date, the evidence on depart- communication between Commonwealth departments has not been good. I have had strong reservations about that, although in recent months DSS-DEET discussions and negotiations on criteria have certainly been very welcome. The potential for the Commonwealth to improve its performance in terms of coordination is great. It could do a great deal better. We can also do much better in terms of communication between the Commonwealth and the states, especially in the context of protocols. In supporting young people there are great gaps in terms of the definitions of, understanding about, application of and access to services. One finds when reading the submissions from state governments and talking to people active in the community and to young people themselves, that there appears to be a gap between the rhetoric and the performance. That is of concern. The Commonwealth has displayed excellent leadership to date in terms of establishing protocols but, frankly, the Commonwealth protocols have some distance to go. According to young people, governments-both state and federal-do not go far enough in providing coordinated support. We and our state colleagues need to recognise that the more the departments are territorial, the more disputes seem to happen, and those intergovernmental disputes do enormous damage to young people. The lives of young people from traumatised backgrounds have been difficult enough. They are traumatised enough without then having to face conflict between governments, departments and agencies. So the question of case management, and Commonwealth relations and protocols, and state relations and protocols, is still a fairly profound issue. However, I am optimistic. I am urging the ministers and departments to look forward. Having established a better relation between DEET and DSS in terms of the common set of criteria, having recognised the need for change to the appeal process, and having recognised the need for common processes and the linking of the protocols between the two Commonwealth departments, we can now extend that platform into a much more uniform approach. I am also concerned about the lack of national coordination. That has occurred partly because of the confusion and uncertainty about the roles of the various departments. This legislation will clarify that area. The jobsearch allowance was almost a holding device, an interim measure. Although it was not recognised at the time, it can now be seen as such. The youth training allowance and this legislation will give a very clear definition responsibility. It will make it much easier to coordinate them. The issue of youth homelessness has been divisive. The community and, I am sure, my colleagues in this place are concerned about it. Youth homelessness will not be solved by divisive rhetoric. It will not be solved by manipulation of data. However, it could be solved if governments and parliaments could present a unified approach. I had hoped that this legislation would have brought about a fair degree of unanimity, and that is why I was disappointed that the member for Mackellar was at pains not only not to support the legislation but also not even to oppose it. She spoke on something entirely different. I found it quite amusing that she questioned bureaucrats who abuse their functions. I thought that she abused bureaucrats who questioned her functions. If she gets her phraseology right, she may be more accurate. She was saying that what the opposition is doing is offering another way. If there were another way to solve some of these problems about youth homelessness or about the youth training allowance, I would have liked to have heard it from her. If this is the wrong way to go, we should be talking about that now. My disappointment with the opposition in that context is because I had thought the community discussions and feedback that we have had since we started the inquiry, particularly since the white paper came out, had shown a high level of agreement about the direction of the youth training allowance and the youth training initiative, but with a number of queries about the application. With legislation with a single set of criteria, with changes to appeals processes and so on, we have got the base direction right and the platform right. I now very strongly urge the minister and departments to try to get the processes right, because there is not much point having a single set of criteria if we apply the processes in entirely different ways. There is not much point in young people coming to Social Security and having a conversation with a social worker on a face to face basis who helps understand the trauma of and clarifies what has gone on in their lives and what is real and what is important to them, and on the other hand going to another department and having to have six statutory declarations, a whole lot of paperwork and a very long form done, and then wait three weeks for an interview with somebody. That is a very different process. That is what happens now with the current system. I am confident that, with the changes caused by the youth training allowance, we can in fact get to a single seamless and transparent system where young people who have been through distressing family circumstances can approach the government for support to continue in education, to continue in training, and be treated the same, regardless of the town they live in, regardless of which department they approach. I think those objectives are broadly agreed across the community, and they are very achievable. This legislation is the first step in that, and I therefore support it in the House.

59,Mr ELLIOTT,AUSTRALIA LIMITED SALE BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The planned sale of Aerospace Technologies of Australia Ltd-ASTA-is a unique step in the government's micro-economic reform program. The process of reform in this case commenced in 1986 when the Minister for nance (Mr Beazley) as the then Minister for Defence approved the formation of ASTA is under the then Companies Code. This started the transition of the Government Factories-GAF-from an organisation with a narrow defence focus to an internationally competitive company whose prime interest in the civil aerospace industry. ASTA's productivity improvements have been brought about largely by improved work practices and in this regard the government would like to acknowledge the commitment moved of the employees of the company in this transition and the initiative of the new mana third agement for its vision and implementation of these important changes. ASTA has long-term contracts to manufacture important components for the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group and Aerospatiale, a member of the Airbus Consortium. It also has a long-term relationship with the MCDonnell Douglas Corporation through the FA18 aircraft program. The quality of the work carried out by ASTA has been recognised in two ways. Firstly, through ASTA winning awards from the world's prime aerospace companies, such as the President's Award for Excellence from Boeing and by achieving the MCDonnell Douglas 'silver' preferred supplier status. Secondly, by being the sole worldwide manufacturer of specific key components for both read a third of these companies. It needs to be recognised that ASTA operates in industries that have shown distinct cycles of activity. Both the airline industry 1994 and the aerospace industry have been in a trough which has slowed orders for the components that ASTA manufactures and that has seen demand for heavy aircraft maintenance decline as airlines defer this type of work. As these industries come out of the trough there should be significant opportunities for ASTA and its new owner. ASTA currently has an order from the UK Ministry of Defence for 18 Jindivik unmanned jet aircraft-an aircraft originally designed by ASTA's predecessor, the Government Aircraft Factories. ASTA will work with the preferred tenderer, E-Systems, in the refurbishment of Fithe RAAF's fleet of P3C Orion maritime surveillance and anti-submarine aircraft. This a long-term project that will bring additional work to ASTA at Avalon and employment Aircraft to the Geelong region. Since the formation of ASTA, the company has established a major subsidiary at Avalon, is Victoria. ASTA Aircraft Services Pty LtdASTAAS-was formed in 1988 to conduct major maintenance of wide-bodied civil aircraft, such as the Boeing 747. However, heavy maintenance is a demanding industry which is highly competitive. There are significant challenges ahead for ASTAAS as it seeks to capture work emerging from any growth in the market. The government wishes to sell all the Commonwealth's equity in ASTA. Its preference is to maintain ASTA in majority Australian ownership. It wishes to find a buyer, or buyers, able to demonstrate a capacity to provide synergistic benefits to ASTA and able to commit to the ongoing development of a strong, export oriented, domestic aerospace industry. Passage of this bill will provide certainty for both current employees of ASTA and for bidders in relation to a number of issues that are important in the sale process. The main purpose of the bill is to ensure that existing Commonwealth legislation applying to ASTA because of its status as a Commonwealth owned entity will cease to apply to ASTA from the sale day. After the sale, ASTA will not, as far as practicable, be subject to Commonwealth legislation which does not govern the activities of private sector companies. In addition, there are saving provisions to preserve certain pre-sale rights or obligations, for example in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 for acts or omissions that occurred before the sale day. The bill makes provision for a separate sale of a subsidiary before the sale of the company itself should this be necessary to achieve the objectives of the sale. Employee entitlements, such as long service leave and maternity leave, are covered by awards and enterprise agreements that apply to ASTA and ASTA Aircraft Services Pty Ltd. As with any change of ownership these agreements will continue after the sale. A major part of the bill applies to superannuation arrangements to ensure that no employee is disadvantaged by the sale if they are relying on service with ASTA to qualify for deferred superannuation benefits. After the sale day, the service of employees of ASTA or its subsidiaries, even if sold separately, continue to be recognised as public employment for the purposes of qualifying for certain deferred superannuation benefits. For those employees who transferred to ASTA from the Government Aircraft Factories in 1987 and 1988, the right to apply for jobs in the Commonwealth Public Service as an alternative to taking a redundancy package will cease from the sale day. This is standard practice applied to all government business enterprises when they move into private sector ownership. The bill makes a consequential amendment to the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987 so that no levy will be imposed on ASTA's borrowings after the ASTA sale day. The primary financial impacts of the sale of ASTA will be the offset to outlays occurring when the sale receipts are credited to the Commonwealth public account and the return of any surplus in the Commonwealth superannuation scheme additional contributions trust fund to the consolidated revenue fund. In relation to employees, no further employer contributions will be received by the Commonwealth from ASTA in relation to those employees who are currently members of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. It should be noted that employee superannuation contributions are classified as financing transactions and do not affect the budget outcome. In addition, the cost of monitoring ASTA currently met by the portfolio department, the Department of Defence, and the Department of Finance will cease following the sale and the need for any future call on the Commonwealth, such as for capital, will be eliminated. This bill puts in place the necessary legislative framework to enable the sale of ASTA to be completed once an acceptable sale agreement has been agreed. It will remove ASTA from the remaining Commonwealth accountability arrangements other than those of a normal company and allow the company to develop with a new owner committed to ensuring that ASTA continues to play an important role in the Australian aerospace industry. I commend the bill to the House.",86
60,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIA LIMITED SALE BILL,"It is will worth recalling that, although the government has lately been selling its assets, it decried the sale of government assets when I raised the matter of privatisation in the late 1980s. In the book that I put out at the time entitled Privatisation-the Australian Way I outlined a series of companies, corporations and government instrumental ities. Today I think there are only three left that have not been got at but, at the time the book was brought out, the notion was decried as something that could not be done. Yet today, in six minutes, bang go the old Government Aircraft Factories. So we have certainly gone a long way in terms of debate within the Labor Party. We heard all about what was going to happen in Hobart with privatisation, how the Left was going to line up and resist but, this afternoon, in six minutes, away goes privatisation. There has to be some significance in this. The cabinet minute in relation to the decision on ASTA is quite interesting with regard to how things have changed. Firstly: The value of ASTA was unlikely to increase significantly if retained in Government ownership for a further period. Secondly: Further returns to the Commonwealth were unlikely to be great, given the depressed state of ASTA's markets and the company's resultant marginal viability. That is not bad. So the government accepted that the company in its hands had no future, according to the record of the cabinet's decision. So then the government put out a rosy press release saying that all was well but it planned to sell the company and called for expressions of interest by putting an ad in the paper. The other day we were told that two people were already lining up. I bet the government did not show them the minute on what the cabinet thought of the viability of the corporation. We are supporters of the privatisation process and we take the view that this company, out of government hands, will have a future. We wish it well. The old government aircraft corporation had some remarkable successes but it did tot up a heIl of a lot of losses over the years-at least $30 million. As a consequence of that the government, when it reorganised it in its current form, came along with some money to help out over that period. Those losses have been turned around in recent times to modest profits. But when we look at the annual accounts of the company we can see there have been some very significant changes in assets. Also, in its last financial period, the $28 million it got from the government by way of R&D was probably its most significant inflow for the year in terms of making the whole show work. Looking at this and at the people of some eminence that are on the board, I expect that they will be delighted to go to the private sector. Some might even retire. The burden of trying to pull the point around has been borne during a long, heavy haul. It is also worth casting thought for a few moments on what goes on in the ALP in relation to privatisation. I have not seen any debate about this. There was a statement about a year ago by Senator Ray to announce the decision of the government to sell. There was not much else after that. It is obviously not an ALP icon, which has to be discussed. It is easily cast aside. The sale was not the subject of debate so far as I can recall. There are no national strikes, there are no backroom deals and there is no PAYE tax break such as we have seen applied to ANL in recent times to see if the government can get that one going. Task force B, which is running the sale of this company, happens to be the same task force as the one that was handling the proposed sale of ANL. So we go down the trail to see what the differences were. Here are corporations with the same task force handling the selling of them, but with different ministers. One was handled by Senator Ray and one is handled by that other well-known minister who seems to bungle everything-the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton)-and here we go again in relation to that. I do not want to hold up the process at all, because we support privatisation and we wish this corporation well. It pays just to point out some of the benefits that flow from privatisation-efficiency and what we get out of the flow in that area. All GBEs have improved enormously in productivity and in terms of profitability from the moment of privatisation. Moreover, additional capital can be raised without the taxpayer putting it in, on the basis that it must stand to return on the moneys raised. Thirdly, we have employee participation. Employees in the company can own shares in it and by doing that can feel a genuine part of it, which is so important these days. Further, consumers benefit in terms of better product, better service and certainly better pricing. The company becomes more efficient and more responsive to service needs, and more conscious of market conditions and the potential price and product advantages that flow from that. On behalf of the opposition, I welcome the privatisation of this company. I wish it well. In the past it has contributed to the defence of Australia and I am sure that it has a remarkably good future in the hands of the private sector.",87
61,Mr OCONNOR,AUSTRALIA LIMITED SALE BILL,"The AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Limited Sales Bill 1994 gives effect to the government's announced intention to sell this company to the private sector. The bill and the sale complete a process which was begun in 1986 when then defence minister Beazley commenced the process of transforming the old Government Aircraft Factories from an entity with a fairly narrow defence focus into an internationally competitive company with great potential for growth in the civil aerospace industry. This bill canvasses certain technical arrangements and matters relating to this sale, such as the commercial status of the entity after the sale, the limits to the Commonwealth financial responsibility once this sale is effected, the responsibilities and obligations of the management in the transition period, the safeguards that are being provided for employee entitlements, the protection of the status of current enterprise agreements and the matters relating to the superannuation of employees. My position on the sale of this public asset in the Geelong region is well known. My opposition to the sale of ASTA at this particular point in time has been put in print in the Geelong area. I will canvass some of the arguments that I have advanced in my local community in support of that particular point of view. I do so acknowledging that the ultimate responsibility for this matter lies with the executive of the government, which made this decision some time ago. I am satisfied with the assurances given to me and to this House by the minister in charge of this sale, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), that the workers in this enterprise will be protected. I am not convinced that the issue of the sale of assets that are now in the hands of the Commonwealth has been fully understood or debated enough in the Australian community generally. That is a general proposition that I hold, because this is a very important area of public policy and one which I think deserves the greatest level and measure of debate within the government, the opposition and the community generally. I suppose we eternally face this argument about what the government should own, what it does own, whether what it owns is productive and whether it should be sold. As a general proposition, perhaps these issues have not been debated widely enough. I certainly hope that, over the next few years, there is a high level of debate on these issues in local communities, in state communities and, of course, at the federal level. In the public statements that I have made, I encouraged the government to postpone the sale of this asset. ASTA and Avalon are of importance to the Geelong region. Avalon is situated outside the city of Geelong proper. As many members would know, the economy of Geelong is based mainly on some heavy manufacturing areas, on motor vehicle and component manufacture, on aluminium, on value-added production to wool, as well as on petrochemicals. ASTA represented to the Geelong community a very concerted attempt to diversify the economic base of the region and to introduce into manufacturing in the area a very highly skilled and high valueadded area of production. The Avalon facility itself is not just the airport and the aircraft maintenance services that are there at the moment. There are some 4,000 acres of land around this facility, and I will allude a little bit later to the plans that the community had-wider plans for the development of this area-which I hope proceed after this sale is effected. I consider it very important for the Commonwealth to retain an important leverage over the development that would take place in the Avalon area. I consider that a very strong argument for the government to retain a significant interest in this area. Of course, there were fairly bald economic considerations. They relate to the fact that, although this particular enterprise has been going through some difficulty in recent times, it would-with the upturn in the aerospace industry and with the progressive ageing of the Boeing fleet-be positioned to take advantage of increased work. Over time, I guess that would lead it to greater levels of profitability, and it would an asset of increasing value for the Commonwealth to sell. I also have some concerns that, if the sale of this enterprise were to proceed, an overseas buyer who is not compatible with the overall plans of the community and the region for this area might run down the facility and might not take care of the interests of the skilled work force that we have built up over time. It is for all of those reasons that over time. I have argued in the Geelong community the case for a fairly cautionary approach to the sale of this asset. I am very encouraged by several key statements in the second reading speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) on behalf of the Minister for Finance. Firstly, it was stated that the government wishes to sell its equity in ASTA. The government's preference, as expressed in the second reading speech, is to maintain majority Australian ownership in ASTA and to seek out buyers who are prepared to commit to an export oriented domestic aerospace industry. Those statements in the second reading speech are of some comfort to me, given the position that I have held on this issue in the past. Those statements will also be of considerable comfort to those workers at ASTA, who in the past have been concerned about their future not solely because of the prospect of privatisation but because of the general state of the aviation industry. As I said before, this industry demands high levels of skill from its work force. It is a high value added industry which has significant export potential. Geelong has attempted to diversify its manufacturing base, and ASTA is a very important part of that. The positive words about the ASTA labour force from the parliamentary secretary in the second reading speech give me some comfort. He acknowledged, on behalf of this Labor government, the contribution of those workers to workplace reform in this country. I must say that these workers can be very proud of their national contribution. The process of structural change in the economy and cultural change in the workplace is never an easy process. It is easy for the armchair theorists be and it is easy for those who are not affected by the decisions that are made, but it is certainly not an easy process for the workers and their families who cope with change on a daily basis. The ASTA work force has much to be proud of at this point in time. It has embraced the cultural changes necessary to improve the productivity of this enterprise and place it in the situation of profitability it now enjoys. It has participated fully in the restructuring of the enterprise; it has changed its work practices; it has led the field in striking enterprise bargains at the workplace; it has constructed work teams that have seen massive improvements in profitability; and it has participated in very innovative processes of change. All of these things have been done against a background of uncertainty-internal uncertainty about the process of change and external uncertainty about the future of the industry. The recession in the industry has certainly added to that uncertainty. I pay tribute on the floor of the House to those workers in the ASTA facility, and in particular the unions that represented them, for managing this process of change, not without difficulty but exceptionally well. I noted in the second reading speech the positive signs that the minister and the parliamentary secretary alluded to for this particular facility. That ought to be a source of some comfort and give great heart to the workers at this facility. Over time we will see the world recession easing and the level of air activity increasing. This, coupled with the ageing of the Boeing fleet, should ensure the continued viability of facilities such as ASTA. If the government is able to manage a successful sale to a buyer that sees the skills that have been built up in ASTA as a springboard for future and ongoing development, the economic future of the workers in this facility will be secured. It has been a long haul for the workers of ASTA. They have poured a lot of time and effort into muItiskilling themselves. They have poured an extremely large personal effort into bringing this particular enterprise into a state of profitability. The government owes the workers of this facility much because, as I said before, they led Australia in workplace reform. They were held up to other enterprises throughout the nation as a model that should be followed to achieve the sorts of reforms that have now positioned Australia in such a very powerful position in the Asian region and in the world economy. Humble workers in a facility have played a very significant national role for the enterprises of this nation, and it is something of which they can be proud. Many members opposite speak very strongly in this House about the union movement and criticise it heavily. They fail to recognise that at the end of the day unions represent working people. These are ordinary Australians, ordinary men and women, who have a right to upgrade their skills, a right to particiDefence, pate in employment in an enterprise such as this and a right to earn a decent living from the efforts they put into those enterprises. At the end of the day, when you strip all the rhetoric away from the position that the opposition puts before the Australian people, it really says in essence to the ASTA workers, 'The only way that you will survive over time, and the only way that the Australian economy will survive over time, is if we see a diminution of your wages and a diminution of your working conditions.' I take with a grain of saIt the words uttered by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) because at the moment a Liberal government in Victoria is proceeding with a privatisation program that is not well thought out, that is not well constructed, but is driven by ideologues that occupy some very powerful positions on the shadow front bench and in the formulation of coalition policy. I congratulate the parliamentary secretary and the minister for the concern they have shown for the workers in this facility. I hope there will be an ongoing dialogue with the unions in that facility so that at the end of the day, when this sale is effected and when the contribution of those workers is rightfully acknowledged, they will continue to take their place at the forefront of economic and workplace reform in this country.",89
62,Mr TAYLOR,AUSTRALIA LIMITED SALE BILL,"Groom) (2.44 p.m.}-In support of the AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Limited Sale Bill, I firstly want to take a few minutes before question time to make some comments generally about Australia's aerospace industry and secondly want to mention two of the six elements of Aerospace Technologies of Australia-ASTA components and ASTA defence, in particular, to pick up what I think is the strategic importance of this facility to our nation. It is clear that there is very little justification for the government remaining in an aircraft commercial activity. We commend the government for doing what the opposition in government would have done some years ago. The proposal was first foreshadowed in the budget in August 1993 and was supplemented by an announcement by the Minister for Senator Ray, in December last year. I say to the parliamentary secretary, who is at the table, that it is amazing to see the difference between the comments that were made by Senator Ray in December 1993 and some of the comments that were clearly reflected in the cabinet minute that came out of that meeting. That point is picked up in today's Australian Financial Review in a very interesting, albeit small, article. A number of key issues are involved in this legislation. Both the parliamentary secretary, when introducing the legislation, and the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) have mentioned them. The first concerns the future of the 700-plus employees at ASTA. I do not intend to go into that matter. I think the honourable member for Corio has covered that, albeit with understandable parochial attitudes. The second issue relates to the future of Avalon airfield. Again, I do not intend to go into that today. I will make some brief comments about the third issue which concerns foreign ownership levels. My understanding is that the government's preference is to have a majority Australian holding in that facility once it is sold. Up to a point, I agree with the honourable member for Corio. It is a strategic asset and I think it has to remain very firmly in the hands of Australians. I refer to a few comments made in the 1989 edition of Aircraft where it talked about the old Government Aircraft Factories and ASTA. The article stated in part: One of the industry's throwaway lines is that Mr George Stuart and his executive force at Aerospace Technologies of Australia have performed one the greatest come-backs since the resurrection Lazarus. An article in the Financial Review last year, entitled 'Aircraft components industry adds value and wins exports', stated in part: Australia is not generally renowned as holding particular expertise in aerospace technologies; appears to have no real natural advantage in area and, given the seemingly massive investments involved in the industry, would be expected to a very small world player. Look a bit closer, though, and the export prospects in aircraft components are almost assured to the end of the decade by significant long-term contractswhich the parliamentary secretary referred toheld by the key players in the industry. The article went on to state: ... ASTA turnaround is perhaps the most fascinating. When the group was formed in 1987 from the old Government Aircraft Technologies businesses, it was losing between $20 million and $40 million a year. The article further stated: ASTA's sales have grown steadily from $96.9 million in 1989 to $161 million last year, with exports rising from $48.2 million in 1989, about per cent of sales, to $128.5 million last year, per cent of the sales total. The sales growth has also been profitable: from heavy losses in 1987, the business achieved a profit of $1.2 million in 1991, representing an $11 million profit from the components operations offset by start-up losses from the aircraft maintenance business. An article in the Aircraft magazine in December last year made the very pointed comment: . . . the fact it has moved from a dog of a business losing $30 million a year at its formation to a profitable concern with apparent attractions for the sharemarket is quite remarkable in itself. Australia's aerospace industry has emerged as a sophisticated supplier of technology, components and services to international markets. June Aviation electronics, the manufacture of airframe components and the design of airport systems, air traffic control and space related projects are among the industry'S export related activities. Work on the design, development and production of airliner components of such as the giant rudder and elevator for the of tail of the Boeing 777 spearheads a significant export drive. The industry, emerging from a period of restructuring, with a work force of about 12,000, has continued its strong export performance despite the global recession. Apart from the manufacture of airframe it components, export related activities include the aeromaintenance, aviation electronics, the design of airport systems, air traffic control be and air navigation equipment, the production of engine parts and mechanical equipment and growth a wide range of space related projects. Australia's advanced aerospace engineering, technological and education and training capability comes from a 50-year tradition of aircraft design, manufacture, assembly and maintenance, mainly to meet defence needs and also the needs of commercial airlines. Australia from 1970 had an offsets policy under which overseas companies selling aircraft to Australian customers were required to place local orders for up to 30 per cent of the value of the contract. Since 1991 the offsets policy has been succeeded by a policy of reaching understandings with the major aircraft makers to give Australian companies free and fair access to significant contracts. 50 The aim has been to integrate the Australian or 80 industry more fully with the world industry and to boost its international competitiveness. The move has encouraged Australia's two leading aerospace companies-one of which the legislation before us today is concerned with-to seek more business in making composite and aluminium components and subassemblies for large airliners under agreements with the prime aircraft makers that increasingly involve research and development commitments and financial risk sharing. Between them, the two companies, Hawker de Havilland and ASTA, now make subassemblies for most large international aircraft, including the Boeing 737, 747, 757 and 777, the Airbus 300, 310, 320, 330 and 340 and, as the parliamentary secretary indicated, for MCDonnell Douglas in terms of the MD80, MD90 and more latterly the MDl1. ASTA makes the 12-metre-long Boeing 777 rudder, one of the largest single-piece carbon fibre skin panels ever built. It also produces five components for the European Airbus group, including the main landing gear floor structure for both the Airbus 330 and 340 aircraft and the carbon fibre landing gear doors for the 340. Hawker de Havilland is involved similarly. The aerospace industry in Australia is significant. I would like to say a bit about strategic dimension to which I referred earlier. One has to go no further than the history of the government aircraft factory, now ASTA, and the large input that it made and has been making for about 50 years in producing aircraft, anti-submarine and anti-tank missiles and, as the parliamentary secretary said in his opening comments, in terms of the P3C Orion and the PC9 and others, being involved more latterly in their production and follow-on support. So it is a substantial industry economically and strategically. In regard to the foreign investment connotations, I commend the government to look very carefully as to what extent overseas interests would, if they are interested, be involved in such a strategic asset. That should be borne in mind in the sale process. In the few minutes leading up to question time, I refer to one specific program and one specific aircraft involved with the former Government Aircraft Factories cum ASTA; that is, the Nomad. A number in this House have heard me over the last five or six years condemn that aircraft in terms of its safety record. We heard more about that yesterday during question time when the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) was questioned in that area. I say nothing further on that at this stage, but I specifically refer the House to that tragic accident of March 1990 involving the fatality of a young air force officer. This raises the tragedy of not only one air force officer being killed but also the wider connotations of big question marks over that particular aircraft. In terms of the strategic implications of ASTA and its sale, I think that is very important indeed. I take the opportunity to remind the House of what I said last week in the context of that aircraft's safety involving not only the Minister for Transport-that minister should be condemned and remains condemned for the dereliction of his ministerial duties in the area of aviation; I am sure the opposition will have a bit more to say on that later on-but also the Minister for Defence. The minister has a lot to answer for in relation to that aircraft. I the ask the minister once again to answer my questions relating to that particular aircraft, which I put down on the Notice Paper some three or four months ago. As I said last week, the Australian designed and built Nomad, which operates here and overseas, both in civilian register and defence roles, has had a chequered history of operational constraint, grounding, in-flight incident and, in the extreme, fatal accident in Australia and, unfortunately, overseas. In the latest fiasco-I referred to this in question time yesterday-I am informed that, arising from a major in-flight incident in the West Indies with a Nomad, remarkably like an incident with an RAAF aircraft at Tindal in the Northern Territory a few years ago, further bulletins have been issued by AeroSpace Technologies of Australia and others which impose additional operational constraints. I repeat a number of the questions posed to the Minister for Transport yesterday in the context of that aircraft and its operations. Has he seen the ombudsman's report relating to that specific accident? Has he been briefed by CAA officials on the Adelaide accident? What has been its reaction to the ombudsman's criticisms? Are the minister and the Minister for Defence fully satisfied that the civil register Nomads and defence force Nomads are safe? Is the Minister for Transport going to ground the civilian register aircraft until all operational question marks are resolved or is he going to sit back as he did with the Aero Commander aircraft, similar to the one that crashed en route to Lord Howe Island? Finally, is the minister going to take appropriate action with the Minister for Defence and, I might add, overseas authorities? There are 50 or 60 aircraft flying overseas and there are international ramifications, so what are the ministers going to do to resolve the aircraft's obvious shortcomings? With those few words, I have much pleasure in supporting the legislation before the House.",91

64,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, four weeks ago you attacked barrackers for lower deficits, saying that savings from a lower deficit would just end up chasing real estate and property prices. Now that the barrackers for lower deficits include the Reserve Bank Governor, the Treasurer-who has been barracking for lower deficits all across the globe, from Madrid to Tokyo-and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, do you still stand by that statement or will you concede you were wrong and that the government's deficit reduction strategy must now be changed?",94
65,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The term 'deficit reduction' means virtually whatever anyone wants it to mean. The fact of the matter isMr Costello interjecting,94
66,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know I am. I intend to stay one, too. To me, it means that the medium-term deficit reduction strategy, which the government put into place for the first time on the publication of the One Nation statement in 1992, was aimed at showing that, as the recovery strengthened, the fiscal stimulus would be withdrawn. This is an entirely sensible and reasonable thing to do, and is an entirely natural thing to happen. As the economy improves, as the Commonwealth outlays on unemployment benefits are reduced, as the natural stabilising cost to the budget starts to recede and as the revenues from the economy start to pick up, then the budget balance changes. It comes back towards surplus. That is what is in the One Nation forecast. The government's target has been that the deficit would come in at around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Lately, the questioner has been running around talking about interest rates. Mr Costello-They are going to rise, anyway.",94
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,94
68,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But let me just repeat a couple of things that Mr Fraser, the Reserve Bank Governor, said: Accelerated cuts in the budget would not remove the need for official interest rates to rise further. The shadow Treasurer has been saying, 'Unless you cut the budget, you will have a rise in interest rates.' But the governor debunks that view. He is sayingMr Costello-So you concede that interest rates are going up anyway?",94
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked the question. He will listen to the answer.,94
70,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Fraser said: Accelerated cuts in the budget deficit would not remove the need for official interest rates to rise further. He went on to say: I haven't sort of posed that as an alternative to any further increase in interest rates. He continued-and I want you to listen to this: I wouldn't subscribe to the view that you could slash and bum on the budget side so that you can keep interest rates down so that people can run around and buy and invest and do anything they want to. In other words, he was saying, 'I am not subscribing to the view that you should massacre the outlay side of the Commonwealth budget simply to supposedly hold down interest rates and then let anyone do what they please with the savings.' The burden of your remarks in recent times has been that, unless the government reduces the budget deficit, there will be an attendant increase in interest rates, whereas the governor is making it quite clear that the role of monetary policy is basically to sustain the recovery, to smooth the recovery, and that monetary policy has a role to play in this cycle. That is not a message that burdens the government because the government used monetary policy in the last cycle over a period of eight or nine years, which I thought would demonstrate even to you that we know it is available as an instrument. Mr Fraser said also: There was no immediate pressurethis is on the budgetfrom either the CPI or the current account deficit on the current account at present. I do not know why the shadow Treasurer takes any comfort from Mr Fraser's remarks. Mr Fraser has made it very clear that he believes that interest rates and monetary policy have a role independent of the current account deficit and that, if one wants to make any impact on the current account deficit, that is a question of the savings balance in the nation and not some adjustment to fiscal policy for interest rates. Mr Fraser is basically saying that he thinks the recovery may be stronger than forecast; therefore, the deficit consolidation program needs to be faster. To this, I say that, if the growth is greater, the deficit reduction will automatically be faster. Creative Nation",94
71,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the cultural policy statement which he delivered earlier this week. What benefits will flow to all Australians as a result of that statement?,95
72,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Creative Nation, the government's arts and cultural policy statement, is the first national cultural policy for Australia. It recognises that cultural concerns are central to the development of Australian society and that no economic or social decision is without a social consequence. It aims to encourage excellence in every field of cultural endeavour. That is why the government is spending $252 million of additional spending over four years on arts and culture in this country, starting with an increase in the base funding of $18 million for the Australia Council and an allocation of $8 million for the Major Organisations Board to take up bodies like the Australian Chamber Orchestra and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. In terms of the performing arts, a National Institute for Indigenous Performing Arts will be established at a cost of just on $15 million for Brisbane. Amongst other things, a National Academy of Music-that is a national music school of world standard-will be established in Melbourne at a cost of just on $9 million; the enhancement of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra at a cost of just on $8 million; and an extension of the National Gallery of Australia for casual exhibition space. In respect of film, television and radio, $60 million will be provided over three years for a television production fund for the production of higher end quality product, local TV content product, such as mini-series, and also a production fund for SBS television. As well, there is the establishment in Australia of a major international film facility with 20th Century Fox. In terms of multimedia, there will be an Australian multimedia enterprise of $45 million as a venture fund, a capital fund, for the development of CD-ROM; an elite performance tour program for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-integrated Australian promotions are in that quarter as well-a repair of the facility of the National Film and Sound Archive, and many other changes. It is a major and dramatic change to the arts and one which I think will be welcomed by the arts community. In terms of public comment, amongst other things, in the Sydney Morning Herald Mr Justin MACDonnell, who is the author of Arts, Minister?: Government Policy and the Arts and the managing director of a Sydney based arts management company, said: For the Opposition, with its sad little document of two weeks back, Keating has well and truly thrown down the gauntlet. Senator Alston, on the publication of that document, was asked-this is a little transcript that sounds like a John Clarke interview: Alston: I have spoken to literally hundreds of people. As a result of that, we have been able to identify a number of very important areas. Questioner: So when does the document become a policy? Alston: A policy is a set of initiatives which are normally costed and which are proposals to change existing government arrangements. Questioner: So there's no costing in this? Alston: No, no, because it doesn't contain policy initiatives. It could be on Channel 9 on Friday night. Mr MCGauran-Will you repeat that?",95
73,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me go to the point of it: Questioner: So when does the document become a policy? Alston: A policy is a set of initiatives which are normally costed and which are proposals to change existing government arrangements. Questioner: So there's no costing in this? Alston: No, no, because it doesn't contain policy initiatives. This is the so-called policy document.

74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bennelong-disorderly behaviour!,96
75,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I turned away to leave, I looked back quickly and there was this body coming out of a bush. It was like in a Greek picture. There he was-Senator Alston had been hiding in the bush waiting for me to finish with the cameras. While they were still whirring, out he popped, out of the bush, and wandered over to do his interview. Is that right or not? It is right. From this mind comes this sort of policy response. Mr Howard interjecting",96
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Bennelong!,96
77,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So is it any wonder that the commentators are calling the cultural frontier 'that sad little document' when compared with the government's comprehensive statement on the arts. I am pleased to say that, as a consequence, the general opinion that has been offered in response to Creative Nation is overwhelmingly positive. I think the arts and creative community in this country appreciate the fact that the government does believe that art and culture are central to Australian life and have been prepared to support what the government has done. At the completion of question time, I will table the speech that I gave at the Australian National Gallery launching the policy. Arts Fellowship: Mr G. Tozer",96
78,Mr CONNOLLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Did the Prime Minister advise the eminent Australian pianist, Geoffrey Tozer, to purchase a former convent at Queanbeyan for development as a centre for the arts as reported in the Good Weekend magazine on 16 April this year? Here is the article; no doubt you can read it.",96
79,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can read, eh?",96
80,Mr CONNOLLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hope you can read, too. Did Mr Tozer's 1989 application for his initial four-year Australian Creative Artists Fellowship state that the money would be used to develop such a centre for the arts? Was the Prime Minister extensively involved in renovations at the convent, supervising and paying contractors on Mr Tozer's behalf during 1991, as also reported in the Good Weekend magazine? Did Mr Tozer, shortly before selling out of his disastrous project in November last year, receive a then unprecedented second five-year fellowship, taking the value of his back to back fellowships to $525,000? Is it the case that the first fellowship was squandered on your poor advice: if so, did this necessitate a second grant to bail out Mr Tozer? Is this an example of what is supposed to be-and I quote from your minister in the other place- 'arms length peer review funding' under the creative fellowship scheme?",96

99,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Blake, not Black, Blake. The average income of that group, including Mr Tozer, was $9,000. This is how Australian artists were being valued-people of international standing, of accomplishment in midcareer-at the level of $9,000 of income. You asked about Mr Tozer. He was in the first group of beneficiaries. Senator Alston asked why artists suddenly require an extraordinary level of beneficiants. The answer is that they were living, on average, on $9,000 a year of income. Of course, that would not matter a jot to you. The quote continues: . .. rather the fellowships merely widen the riftthis is a quote from yesterdaybetween the haves and the have-nots by creating an elite band of artists whose financial well-being is effectively guaranteed by government.

101,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are not creating an elite band of artists. They are already elite artists; otherwise, they do not qualify. You think we are creating an elite band. This is for people who have already accomplished themselves, people like John Olsen; Garth Welsh, the dancer; Frank Moorhouse, the author; and Geoffrey Tozer, the pianist. How mean-spirited are you? This is obviously the question for the day that you have ticked, saying this is the question you support. Mr Downer-Why don't you answer it?",97
102,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let it be understood that Alexander Downer's view is that he should chase artists about grants from the Australia Council in the House of Representatives. I understand exactly the kind of damage this will do to you in the arts community. It will do huge and massive damage-and it ought to. It ought to for your mean-spiritedness and your plain nastiness in going after artists. Mr Tozer, for his part, decided to do two things: to develop and further add to the music repertoire-the piano repertoire long forgotten in the international repertoire; and to support younger pianists. Mr Tim Fischer-What about Queanbeyan?",98
103,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The premises on which he was to run his life and to take on artists were essentially overtaken by his success abroad on disc and in world international forums.

131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister has remarked on an issue, as have the Leader of the House and members of the opposition. I have just suggested to members that the standing orders be adhered to. I have given a general warning on that.",99
132,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can understand the opposition not wanting to hear anything about the good story on the Australian economy. On various key criteria Australia looks very good when compared with industrialised countries generally. I might just mention a few of those. In relation to the GDP growth, our rate of growth of 4.3 per cent through the last financial year compares very well with the OECD average as a whole. It is over twice the OECD average rate of growth. It puts us at the top of the growth league. Australia's employment growth in the year to September of 3.9 per cent was far and above the OECD average, which was 0.9 per cent. We had 3.9 per cent so we are at the very top of the employment growth table in the OECD. Australia is in the low inflation league. Our rate has been below 2 11z per cent for the last three years. Our 1. 7 per cent inflation rate over the last 12 months was well below the OECD average of 2.3 per cent. If we look at the budget outcome, we see that our general government deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 was 1.4 per cent of GDP below the OECD average. So we are definitely in the league of the lower budget deficit countries. That OECD average of 4.2 per cent was made so low only by a surplus in Japan. Many other industrialised countries had quite large deficits, including the UK which had 7.7 per cent; Canada, 6.8 per cent; France, 5.8 per cent; Italy, 9.5 per cent; Spain, 7.2 per cent; and Sweden, an astonishing 12.9 per cent. Our performance in terms of a general government deficit outcome last year of 2.8 per cent of GDP obviously compares exceedingly well with that of most other industrialised countries. In terms of public sector debt, we are well below the average of OECD countries. Our net public debt-and this is all levels of government - last year was 24 per cent of GDP. That compares with an OECD average of 40 per cent. There are only three countries for whom we can get figures out of 16 OECD countries whose figures are lower than ours. You have some countries, like Italy and Belgium, with ratios of over 100 per cent. In terms of the size of our public sector and our tax burden, as we know, we are at the bottom of the league in terms of the tax burden. Apart from Turkey, we are the lowest taxed Western industrialised country. Our public sector, accordingly, is amongst the very lowest. Australia looks very good in every respect against these sorts of key criteria when one compares us with other industrialised countries. That, of course, makes us very attractive to foreign investors who are also impressed by the fact that our corporate profits are high; that our corporate tax regime is quite competitive with those of other countries; by our greatly improved industrial relations performance-which saw time lost in industrial disputes last year at only one-fifth of the average in the 1970s and the second lowest for any year since 1959-and by our structural reform program which, as this House is aware, is a very widespread program based on the unilateral tariff reduction program. The unilateral tariff reduction program in itself is unique in the world. As well there is the widespread reform in various service industries; improvements to the labour market; and our extraordinary export diversification, which has given us growth of manufacturing exports, elaborately transformed manufactures, of 16 per cent per annum since the mid-1980s, and service exports growing by nine per cent per annum. On every front, this record of performance by the Australian economy looks very good indeed. Of course, in terms of the balance of payments, the fact that we are diversifying our exports so rapidly, reducing commodities from 80 per cent of merchandise exports to 65 per cent in just the last eight years-a tremendous change-in itself shows that the country is directly addressing the problem with its balance of payments, the current account deficit, this long-term structural problem, and is pursuing the right policies. One factor, however, which I think is very important for us to bear in mind for the future in terms of public policy formation is the fact that the rest of the world is clearly determined to grow in a low inflation environment. Everywhere I went, everyone I spoke to and heard speaking was talking about the need to grow with low inflation. So finance ministers, central bankers and everyone else who matters in that respect are talking about the need to grow with low inflation. That is very important for us because it means that countries everywhere are determined to keep their currently quite low inflation levels at relatively low levels whilst they have their economic recovery. That is being reinforced by the Maastricht treaty, which has various convergence criteria for entrance to the European monetary union later in this decade. One of those criteria is low inflation. That treaty requires countries which are going to join the European monetary union to keep their inflation rate lowin fact, within 1112 per cent of the average of the three best performers. That means there is an added discipline internationally for low inflation. For us, the important lesson to learn is that we have to keep inflation low as we continue to grow. The Reserve Bank has set a range of two to three per cent for underlying inflationMr Costello-Come on; wind it up. We're going to sleep over here.",99
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,100
134,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know you do not like to hear about this-over the course of the cycle. The government has endorsed that. It is very important that we maintain inflation within that range as we continue to grow, because not to do so will clearly mean that, in the context of the other countries keeping their inflation low, we will have loss of competitiveness, a worse current account problem and higher bond rates, all of which will be quite damaging to our prospects for future growth. So low inflation is a key element of ensuring that we can continue to maintain strong growth, and policy will be set to ensure that that is the outcome. Mr Costello-What about the slides from your foreign trip?",100
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations,100
136,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree that the five-month delay by the Minister for Transport-a delay that would no doubt have been even longer had it not been for the Seaview crash on 2 October-in seeking and obtaining verification of the claims made by me in May regarding the safety standards of Seaview was unreasonable and that it indicates a complete failure on the part of the Minister for Transport to carry out his ministerial responsibilities? When will the Prime Minister hold the Minister for Transport responsible for that failure and sack him?,101
137,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Where problems affecting aviation safety and deficiencies in aviation safety regulation have been found, the government has acted quickly to address them. It is worth remembering that Australia's international and domestic passenger carriers continue to enjoy a worldwide reputation for rigorous safety standards. When the government announced changes in respect of the BASI recommendations, the questioner put a statement out in which he said that he: . . . welcomed . . . Laurie Brereton's announcement of a major shake-up of the Civil Aviation Authority. This is in July. The statement went on: Mr Sharp said that the measures announced by Mr Brereton were in accord with those Mr Sharp had called for in his speeches ... Now he tries to traffic on the back of a tragedy and come and represent himself as some sort of clairvoyant in all this. The government has agreed to a comprehensive reform strategy to strengthen air safety regulation in Australia by establishing a new independent aviation safety agency. We have increased the government funding contribution for all public interest regulation aspects of aviation safety by $29 112 million, and we have increased insurance cover for all passengers. As well as that, the government has agreed to a judicial inquiry to investigate the CAA's handling of Seaview Air checks and, as honourable members know, the inquiry is to be headed by Sir Laurence Street. I notice that, in an absolute orgy of press statements and unsubstantiated allegations, the member for Hume has put out statements suggesting that Airlink-a Qantas subsidiary-is in some way a safety risk. I note that in a statement put out yesterday: The Managing Director of Qantas, Mr James Strong, expressed amazement that the Shadow Minister for Transport, Mr John Sharp had made sensational claims about Airlink and (National Jet Systems) today without any attempt to consult with Airlink or National Jet Systems or Qantas on the accuracy or significance of the information. He goes on to say: No one appreciates more than Qantas the importance of scrupulous attention to safety at all times. However, a public statement based on some unidentified reports without reasonable check with Qantas is clearly not a responsible or constructive approach. The statement further says: Airlink is a wholly owned subsidiary of Qantas. In the statement, Mr Strong goes on to talk about that and to repeat his point that Qantas has an enviable safety record. There was no checking by the member; he simply made a claim. A day or so ago the member said that the Royal Australian Air Force had permanently grounded its Nomad aircraft. This is untrue. I was advised by the chief of the general staff that no Nomad aircraft in army service are grounded, other than those in normal maintenance, and no ADF Nomadsthat includes air force and army Nomadshave been grounded as a result of the most recent incident in the French West Indies. So that claim is wrong. The claim about Airlink was attacked by Mr Strong. This is the kind of unsubstantiated flurry of allegations that the member for Hume has trafficked in ever since these most unfortunate accidents. The minister has acted quickly and appropriately and, as a consequence of the judicial inquiry, we will get to the bottom of the Seaview checks issue. The reform of the aviation safety system, with the establishment of an independent aviation safety agency, is probably the most appropriate change that the government is able to introduce to divorce air traffic management from the question of safety standards. A little less crowing, grandstanding and blackguarding from the member for Hume would help the whole debate. Development Allowance",101
138,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the success of the development allowance announced in One Nation? Has the development allowance encouraged investment and is it a force for micro-economic reform?,102
139,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for her question.,102
140,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Have you got it written out, Ralph?",102
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mitchell.,102
142,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The development allowance is an important addition to the tax incentives which are on offer by the government to attract more investment. This was intended to be a medium-term incentive to attract investment in large projects worth over $50 million. It was announced in One Nation, but the implementation of the allowance is a gradual process. To the end of the 1993-94 year, the Development Allowance Authority has registered 217 projects worth a total of $55 billion. The average registered project is worth around $250 million, well above the $50 million threshold. The allowance is obviously having the effect of attracting very large investments indeed. Another 200 projects are still being evaluated, and all up we can look forward to something in the order of 400 projects being finally registered with hopefully an outcome around the $100 billion mark. Registration is the first step. Following a project needs to receive a pre-qualifying certificate, which involves demonstrating that it meets various competitive criteria. It is important for us to have this competitiveness test because it requires projects to reflect best practice labour relations, to have significant inputs priced economically and efficiently, and to not be receiving significant levels of government assistance. These are projects which are large but they also have to be projects which promote microeconomic reform by being at the leading edge in terms of their labour relations practices and the pricing of their inputs. In that respect, they are a doubly important factor in the economy at the present time. These large projects in themselves are helping to bring on the investment boom which is anticipated to occur in this financial year, with a 14112 per cent increase in business investment expected-and certainly we would hope for strong investment in the years to come-and this development allowance clearly will be a factor in bringing about those projects. That is important, but the drive for further microeconomic reform is also important. Using our investment in the most efficient way is very important. We do not simply want to squander large amounts of money on large capital projects which utilise those funds inefficiently. That is not good for the nationnot good use of our resources, and not good for building our living standards. The criteria which are built into this program ensure that does not happen and that we will get from these projects highly efficient outcomes. One also hopes there will be incentives for other projects and other parts of the economy to improve their efficiency. This is a very important development for the economy. Construction has begun on $25 billion worth of the projects which have so far been registered. It is not simply a matter of them being a paper entry; this is something which is real and happening in respect of $25 billion worth already. It is also important to note that the survey conducted by the Development Allowance Authority indicates that these projects have an increasing focus on Asia, the Asian market being of greater that importance than non-Asian markets because of the outlook for the end products of these projects. Finally, in terms of the prequalifying certificates where they have got to the final stage and can claim the allowance, so far there have been 11 projects which have achieved that prequalifying certificate, involving $2 billion worth of projects. There is obviously a lot more of that to come, and the development allowance will be a very important factor in helping our economy to grow substantially over the next several years. Air Safety",102
143,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to the proceedings of the parliamentary inquiry into air safety particularly to the evidence of Mr Stephen Swift, the head of the CAA's aircraft fatigue section, who has stated that the fiying public was being exposed to unacceptable risks and that some 200 planes in Australia were in danger of their wings falling off! Why is the Prime Minister prepared to stand by and allow Australians to be exposed to this unacceptable level of risk? Why does he continue to protect his mate the Minister for Transport, who should clearly be sacked?",103
144,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not aware of advice that has gone before the committee. The committee in due course will weigh the advice and make reports. But for you to draw a bow that there are 200 aircraft that have,103
145,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He didn't; Mr Swift did.,103
146,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But he is the one drawing the linkage to the minister, not Mr Swift. It is you who is drawing the linkage to the minister. Mr Downer-The minister is responsible. He is the one who has the responsibility. Mr Tim Fischer-Who is responsible?",103
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister has been asked the question.,103
148,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is trying to make the claim that, because Mr Brereton is in office, there are some 200 aircraft which are suspect. That is a very indecent and dishonest thing to try to do. Secondly, as I made clear in my earlier answer, the government has established a new independent aviation safety agency. The government has made a further contribution of $29 1/2 million to public interest tion aspects of aviation safety, and has established a judicial review into the particular handling of the ramp checks in respect of Seaview. The minister has responded appropriately to these various points. This reference to the minister being a mate, so-called-in other words, that I in some way am incognizant of public safety because the minister enjoys some friendship with me, is an entirely disreputable thing to say.",103
149,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. He has been at it all day slinging names around the place. We know who thinks Australia is the backside of the earth.",103
150,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat!,103
151,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When I was out on the roads over the course of the year, particularly around rural communitiesOpposition members-Ha, hal",103
152,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"people were saying to me, 'There was a time when the National Party stood for something. There was a time when the National Party was led by people like Jack MCEwen or Doug Anthony and had ministers such as Peter Nixon or Ian Sinclair.' They said, 'It's an affront to be led by a donkey, a nong like this fellow.' Mr Reith-Oh, that is unacceptable.",103
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order. No.,103

157,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister! I have remarked in this place about expressions used. regulaUnder the standing orders, even quoting somebody else can be determined as not being within the standing orders. It will help the House if the Prime Minister withdrew those last comments before proceeding.",103

160,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,With qualification.,104
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am asking the Prime Minister to come back to the substance of this question.,104
162,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am asking you to have withdrawn the implication in the point being made by the questioner,104

170,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat!,104
171,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You came second. Take your seat. The implication of the question very clearly is that because, he says, Mr Brereton is 'my mate', I have compromised Australian air safety. I want that withdrawn.",104
172,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Does the member for Bennelong have a point of order?,104
173,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My point of order is that it is the practice of this House to unconditionalwould askly withdraw. If you assure me the Prime Minister has withdrawn without condition, then I do not have a point of order.",104
174,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has also raised what he believed,104
175,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Did he withdraw unequivocally?,104
176,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister has withdrawn, and I accept that that is the case. In his point of order he has requested that",104
177,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Too late.,104
178,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me get the words out before you determine it is too late. The Prime Minister has also requested that an inference against him be withdrawn. Under standing orders he is entitled to ask that. I ask that that inference be withdrawn. Opposition members-Oh!,104
179,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then we can get on with the debate and we can all be happy and get home. Mr Tim Fischer-My question related to the administration of the CAA. As such, that is a legitimate question; therefore, I am not sure what I am asked to withdraw.",104
180,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have been asked to withdraw an inference which the Prime Minister has found offensive. In this place, members on both sidesMrs Bishop-What inference?",104
181,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We will get question time overMr Abbott-A point of order!,104
182,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume your seat! On a number of occasions members on both sides have believed that something that has been stated contained an inference and they have been slighted. On this particular occasion, the Prime Minister has withdrawn the comment and he has subsequently asked that an inference contained in the Mr Downer-What is the inference?",104

186,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister no longer requires withdrawal.,105
187,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question has a vicious implication. It is that there are 200 aircraft that put public safety at risk, but minister unreasonably maintains his tenure of office because he is a friend of mine. That is the implication. If you do not have the decency to withdraw that, when you take umbrage at being described by a farm leader as 'a donkey', that is your problem.",105

190,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. I remind the honourable member about spurious points of order. Mr Abbott-This point of order is very serious-just as serious as the Prime Minister's. I objected to being described as 'lice' earlier and I ask the Prime Minister to withdraw that.,105
191,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That was a long time ago. There is no point of order. The Prime Minister will conclude his answer.,105
192,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the National Party traffics in the notion that he can take terribly reactionary positions and say defamatory things under privilege. Then he is excused because 'it's two minute Tim, he's not a bad fellow'. His presence as the leader of a major party is an affront to our professionalism. For him to be up there asking a question which contains a savage and vicious implication, without foundation, reflects on him and his party.",105
193,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Minister for Communications and the Arts if he would advise details of funding of SBS in this month's cultural policy statement. Could he explain how this will assist in the production of Australian multicultural drama.,105
194,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has provided in the cultural policy statement announced on Tuesday $13 million over four years for SBS Television to commission high quality multithe cultural drama. This new fund is to be put into the independent production sector, which we believe will go a long way towards ensuring that Australians have a chance to see the rich mixture of contemporary Australian voices and faces on SBS Television. SBS is already internationally acclaimed as a multicultural broadcaster. It is the government's belief that up until now SBS has had little opportunity to produce quality Australian multicultural drama. Because of its limited resources it has relied on importing product produced overseas, in some cases from the Republic of Ireland-programs such as Glenrowan, which will be of interest to some people in the Speaker's gallery this afternoon. That is because overseas products can be purchased at a much cheaper rate than Australian produced programs. It is the government's very strong belief that SBS, by commissioning works through independent producers, can develop a very strong export potential. Especially by linking up with potential markets in Europe and in the Asia-Pacific we believe that Australian produced products specially commissioned by SBS could be earning Australia export dollars in these markets. We think that with SBS's expertise in translation, in subtitling and in multicultural broadcasting there is as a real opportunity for these independent producers. It is also the government's belief that this will create a lot of employment for Australians of non-English speaking backgrounds and Australians of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent. The government will be very keen to ensure that SBS puts these funds into an independent organisation, to be known as SBS Independent, a branch of SBS that will SBS ensure that all of the funds allocated go into the commissioning of this new production. We believe that out of the government's decision we will get about 30 hours a year of new multicultural drama which will be shown on SBS. I am sure all Australians will welcome that. RAAF: Air Traffic Controllers",105
195,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, you will be aware of warnings sounded by the opposition this week about a possible disaster looming because of a shortage of RAAF air traffic controllers because they are being siphoned off to the CAA. What was the government's 'speedy response' to the near tragic incident where the pilot of a civilian commuter aircraft out of Taree was cleared into restricted airspace around Williamtown? I ask whether an official report dated September 1994 of the incident says: A civilian commuter aircraft (that's one that carries passengers) was given an ATe clearance to track TareeWilliamtown. The pilot contacted Williamtown approach 12-15 minutes after entering Williamtown restricted airspace",106
196,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. Under the standing orders of debate related to question time there are strict limits put on the amount of information that you can include in a question. This has become ludicrous.",106
197,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will have a chance to conclude his question but I do say that there has been criticism levelled at ministers about the length of answers they giveMr Bruce Scott-Come on!,106
198,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the member for Maranoa disputing that there has been criticism of ministers about the length of answers, is he? No, he is talking to himself; I just wanted to check. The point is that those answers will be limited if so too are the questions. I might just caution members about that. You will conclude your question.",106
199,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The report continues: The pilot contacted Williamtown approach 12-15 minutes after entering Williamtown restricted airspace. The aircraft had transited an active air weapons range. . . with four Macchi aircraft firing guns ... once the approach radar controller realised the situation the macchis were instructed to stop firing . . .,106
200,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your question?,106
201,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, is the Prime Minister aware of this report? What speedy response has he made? Given that the cause of the near tragedy has been put down to reduced ATC manning at Williamtown, just how safe are Australian skies to the travelling public? When will the Prime Minister ensure his incompetent minister who has caused all these things is sacked or replaced?",106
202,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,106
203,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are laughing about people being shot at.,106
204,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat.,106
205,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware of that incident. No doubt there are incidents periodically through the air traffic control system around Australia at various airports. It is always, I think, a challenge to operate a military airport in conjunction with a civil airport facility. As far as I know, this facility at Williamtown near Newcastle in New South Wales has carried on free of problems and with harmony over the years. There are a number of regular transport services into William town. As well as that, the RAAF operates air superiority aircraft from there. Given the fact that the member has asked me a question about the matter, I will inquire about it and endeavour to give him an answer.",106
206,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: could I give the Prime Minister the official report to help him out?",106
207,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. If you want to table something, you ask to table it. Proceeds of Crime",106
208,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. Is the minister aware of a report concerning the proceeds of crime? What action is being taken by Commonwealth enforcement agencies to recoup the proceeds of crime?,106
209,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am extraordinarily aware of reports regarding recoupment of proceeds of crime because of a press release by the shadow Attorney-General, one of the few press releases of the shadow Attorney General, in which she made criticism of the government as not tracing or collecting proceeds of crime. She quoted the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Michael Rozenes QC, as having said that tens of millions of dollars go untraced and that money that could be collected is simply being missed because crime fighters are not paying enough attention to chasing the crime trail. That is pretty serious stuff, but, unfortunately for the shadow minister, she did not accurately quote the Director of Public Prosecutions. He said no such thing. What he did say is exactly to the contrary. The paper which he delivered to a seminar in Tasmania states: The Commonwealth has a very effective armoury of weapons that can be used to recover ill-gotten gains in a variety of circumstances. He also said: One pleasing aspect is the way in which the Proceeds of Crime Act has been enforced. So there you have it. Contrary to what Senator Vanstone has said that tens of millions dollars was going untraced, there is a clear and ringing endorsement by the Director of Public Prosecutions of what the Commonhis wealth has done, for our approach in the recovery of those proceeds. Commonwealth law enforcement agencies have, under proceeds of crime legislation, recovered more than $23 million since for December 1991. In fact, the National Crime Authority's report, tabled in this House yesterday, showed a record $15 million that was deposited in the consolidated assets trust fund in the past year. Senator Vanstone did manage one accurate statement in her press release. She said confiscated proceeds of crime should be to the benefit of the community generally, that is exactly what we are doing. All the assets confiscated from criminals are being returned to the community through the fundfigures ing grants to law enforcement agencies and through drug prevention programs. In the last funding round, $5.23 million from the confiscated assets trust fund went back into federal law enforcement agencies. The government is not complacent. We had a major review of Commonwealth enforcement arrangements and we are refocusing the work of both the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority. are making a serious and determined approach in relation to these matters, and we are not helped by people who go about misquoting and giving rise to public fears in this irresponsible way. Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations",106
210,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Given that the Director of Aviation Safety Regulation has been sacked; that the future of the Chief Executive Officer of the CAA is in jeopardy over misleading statements about air safety; that the personal aviation adviser to the Minister for Transport has been sacked; that an unsafe airline grounded last week is still flying; that the Minister for Transport has made a complete mess of the privatisation of ANL, costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars; that the of minister has bungled the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal; that the colleagues of the Minister for Transport are publicly saying that responsibilities are beyond him; that the minister has admitted to selected journalists that he not paid sufficient attention to his responsibilities; and that today the Prime Minister has been urged by the General Aviation Association to replace the minister his mishandling of safety matters and put in someone of greater skills, when will you sack your mate the Minister for Transport?",107
211,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He spat the bile out all at once. As a federal minister, the minister has to date a very distinguished record. Let me just recount some points. The minister has that introduced ground breaking legislation in put industrial relations, and he has extended and across-the-board the prospects of enterprise bargaining and improving the flexibility of the Australian labour market. He has also given in recent days of the growth of enterprise bargaining across the country, yet state industrial relations regimes operated by coalition ministers in New South Wales and Victoria have only a small proportion of the flexibility agreements which have now been have enacted by the Commonwealth under the law legislation of the minister. At the same time as doing that, the minister successfully introduced in the legislation the We notion of a safety net for those Australian employees on lower incomes who cannot access enterprise bargaining and whom he and the government want to see protected from the callous policies espoused by the member for Bennelong, which would cut the wages of low income people. So that changeimportant socially and in terms of economic efficiency-is there for the spread of enterprise bargains across the work force. As the minister himself has said in recent days, this is in the climate of the lowest level of trial disputes since the nation has been keeping data on industrial disputations. There is the record. In relation to his stewardship of the transport portfolio-not a long time-his success to date has been to pilot through the Labor Party, at its conference, and the government the privatisation of the major airports of this country. This is a not inconsiderable achieve- heroes. ment and one that is important in allowing greater facilities for important airports like those in Sydney or Melbourne. It is a policy which has been supported by the Victorian Liberal Party and government in respect of Melbourne airport and, of course, supported by other groups around the country. Not only has he done that; he is also reserving the option of a second airport for Sydney, building on the Badgerys Creek proposal and reserving the transport linkages between that and Kingsford-Smith airport. I would have thought these were substantial achievements by any measure. I also would have thought that the minister's acting firmly in terms of the BASI report and in terms of establishing the specialleader ised safety agency and the judicial review into aviation was fairly significant. I just note-the opposition leader questions me about a minister's record-that the series on the federal Liberal Party history, in the bit of CDorderROM and audiovisual we have been exposed to in the last two weeks by the ABC, talks about the founder, Sir Robert Menzies. Mr Costello-Oh, come on!",107
212,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,108
213,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, what I am saying is that introducing a flexible labour market and changing the face of aviation all within the space of about 18 months compares with any record of anyone opposite. That is the point I am making. The cat was let out of the bag on the series when the most telling thing was said by Bob Santamaria. He related how Menzies had asked him what he thought were the three worse things that Menzies had done. Santamaria said, 'Creating a Canberra oligarchy, creating more universities than there were good academics to fill them and creating the Liberal Party.' Sir Robert thought for a indus- moment and said, 'But they are the only things that I have done.' I went back to Sir Robert's press conference in 1965, because I remembered it. Mr Downer-Do you support Santamaria now?",108
214,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,NoMr Downer-One of the Labor Party's,108
215,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,108
216,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But I just think it is an interesting juxtaposition of achievement-18 months against 16 years. He was asked: What do you see as your most lasting achievements? Sir Robert said: The creation of the Liberal PartyMr Downer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I asked the Prime Minister a question about the abominable record of the Minister for Transport. If it is in order for the Prime Minister to quote Sir Robert Menzies' press conference, presumably it is in order for us to quote the abominable and quite hysterical record of Dr Evatt, who was a failed of your party, as was Arthur Calwell.",108
217,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,108
218,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of Mr Downer-Tell us about Evatt; he was mad.",108
219,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,108
220,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the opposition leader asked a very broad based question which invited a contrast and an explanation after a whole series of propositions were put forward as to why the Prime Minister would maintain his minister in office. I would suggest that it deserves a very broad based answer.",108
221,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have already ruled there is no point of order.,109
222,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He said: The creation of the Liberal Party . . . Mr Thckey-Tell us about Calwell and his racist acts.,109
223,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor!,109
224,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then he said: I would like to remember what has been done about education, about the universities ... And then he went on to say: . . . and Canberra is my pride and joy. So that tallies with Mr Santamaria's recollection-Canberra, the universities and the Liberal Party. I would have thought that, against that dismal absence of achievement, the achievements of the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister for Transport in introducing a flexible labour market to this country, in privatising the major airports of this country and in seeking to establish an ongoing basis for our national shipping line represented a reasonably solid performance.

The Prime Minister, in his answer, certainly went to the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister for Transport. He also compared the records of former members in this place. I would now suggest that the Prime Minister, as I have said to other speakers, is entitled to do so. Mr Downer interjecting",109

230,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And rightly so. I am concluding on these points. It is no wonder they are interested in the National Museum over there. They always want things in glass cases. If they could throw a glass dome over the Albury proceedings it would be Jurassic Park all over again. Is it any wonder they cannot adapt to Australian life when they are always walking backwards and looking over their shoulders? Here they are with their maudlin recelebration of the founder who could lay claim to only three changes: Canberra, universities and the Liberal Party-after 16 years in office. And they have got the temerity to try to ask a question about Laurie Brereton who has been in the job just over 18 months and has a distinguished record of achievement behind him.

I know that he was the chairman the House of Representatives community services committee that looked into the whole process? question of the home and community care program. I thank him for the recommendation which relates to access of war veterans to HACC services. I am very well aware that in some commuin nities it is difficult for war veterans to get access to these services. Last month member for Fremantle and I agreed to have a task force set up between our respective departments to look at the question of improvement of access of war veterans to HACC services. I am looking forward to quality receiving that report in February. The position at the moment set up some 20 veterans advice networks throughout the country-starting in Cairns and Townsville; down to Bairnsdale and Frankston; and Wollongong and Lismore in New South Wales, et cetera. What we are trying to do is to make sure that we tell war veterans-even those who get nothing from my department-how they can best access mainstream services that are available not only through the Commonwealth government but also through state and local governments. achievement. I can assure the honourable member that we will be doing everything we can to make sure that we direct them to the proper place. I all colleagues, on both sides of the House, ensure that they tell war veterans where these veterans advice networks are. Arts Fellowship: Mr G. Tozer",110
238,Mr CONNOLLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Following the Prime Minister's non-answer last time. I will try Is it true, as reported in the Sydney Herald in May 1989, that the Prime Minister personally supervised the recruitment of the advisory panel of six members for the Australian Creative Artists Fellowship. Is it a to the fact that Mr Tozer's agent, Mr Rueben Fineberg, and the producer of the CD Geoffrey Tozer in Concert-which I think the Prime Minister referred to in his answer- Mr Ross Gengos of Abels Music, were on this panel which awarded Mr Tozer his first fellowship. Can the Prime Minister assure the of arts community, which he is so concerned about, that this was and is an arms-length",110
239,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here they are trying to climb onto the little artists, the people who are individuals. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Is it any wonder the country has written you off? Is it any wonder you are held universal contempt by all thinking people around the country? Is it any wonder the arts the hate the sight of all of you? This is entirely a peer cross-disciplinary selection process. The reason Mr Tozer was selected, obviously, was because of his and calibre. That is the reason he was chosen for a second fellowship as, indeed, this week some other person was chosen for a is that we have second fellowship. Mr Speaker, let me tell you this: yes, I did help Mr Tozer reconstruct his building, and I was very pleased to be able to help him. I have helped many other artists in a private function because I think it is an important thing to do. It is a dreadful affront to think that people of the calibre of that first group had an average income of $9,000. That is a dreadful affront to any country that believes in and puts a premium on culture and I am really surprised that the Leader of the Opposition can condone as preferred quesurge tions in the House of Representatives questo tions on a list about individuals and their grants as though they are favoured I?eople, rather than raising the issue as a reflection on, or-dare I say it-a rejoicing in, the merit of their work and their contribution to the nation.

He has also accused me of not appointing any people with expertise in honours to that committee.

283,Mr CONNOLLY,JOINT HOUSE DEPARTMENT,"Bradfield) (4.26 p.m.)I note the Auditor-General's report on a special investigation into Casse1den Place. This report reveals massive losses of $100 million on the project; that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) and the Minister for Trade, Senator MCMullan, may have inadvertently, at least, misled the people of Australia on the business deals made up to cover up these losses; and that there was massive waste and mishandling of the planning of the Casselden Place project.

295,Mr BILNEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Kingston-Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs)-by leave- Mr Speaker, I would like to report to parliament on the outcome of the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo from 5 to 13 September and to draw attention to the part Australia played. Australia's paramount concern at Cairo was to ensure that consensus be achieved on a strong, forward looking document. This was important both because of the critical goals contained within the draft program of action and the importance we place on the United Nations process of consensus in advancing international reform. In fact, the agreement reached at Cairo has been a triumph for that process. The major themes of the conference not only had the potential to generate controversy-potential which was fulfilled-but there was a strong possibility that the conference would split irreconcilably along north-south or religious lines. Such a split did not occur. Australia played its part in ensuring that agreement was reached on the widest possible range of issues and, just as importantly, that the program of action which emerged was indeed forward looking; that it built on, rather than withdrew from, previous agreements; and that it could be placed clearly within the framework of internationally accepted human rights. Two major advances in thinking have occurred since the earlier UN population conferences in Bucharest in 1974 and Mexico City in 1984. The first is that population growth is seen as a global concern. The second is that population is no longer seen as a problem which can be tackled in isolation from social and economic conditions, particularly those which limit the power of women to control their own lives. One of Australia's major objectives at Cairo was to promote agreement on strategies for empowering women, strategies to enable them to enjoy equally with men the full range of human rights. The program of action translates the principle of female empowerment into a range of practical actions involving: greater educational and employment opportunities for women and girls; making marriage an equal partnership; taking steps to protect women and girls from physical abuse and exploitation; and enabling women to participate fully in decision making at all levels of society. The program of action, in prescribing gender equality, calls on men to take greater responsibility for their actions and to assume an equal share in the raising of children. The document recognises the importance of families within society and urges governments to support them. It also acknowledges that there is variety in the forms which families may take. Australia, as a nation which accepts cultural diversity, was active in promoting principle. Some countries sought to limit the obligations under the program of action by seeking to place religious, ethical and cultural considerations on the same plane as national sovereignty and universally recognised international human rights. Australia was one of a number of countries which worked to preserve the balance between these considerations to ensure that human rights were not compromised. Australia was also concerned to ensure that differences in views about contraception and abortion amongst member nations were not permitted to prevent agreement on strategies critical for addressing important issues of sexual and reproductive health. Although the Holy See and a small number of other states entered reservations in respect of chapters on sexual and reproductive health, wide agreement was nevertheless reached on a number of important new concepts in sexual and reproductive health not only encompassing physical well-being but also fulfilling human relationships. One of our major objectives was to achieve agreement on a program of action which would support the internationally agreed right of men and women to have the information and the means to determine the number and spacing of their children. Agreement was reached not only on the need to ensure the widest availability and choice in safe and acceptable family planning methods but also on the need for adolescents to have access to appropriate information, services and counselling. The program of action enshrines the principles of freedom of choice and non-coercion in family planning programs but takes a strong position on making available the means to exercise that choice. It seeks to address problems such as the maternal and infant mortality associated with high-risk pregnancy and to minimise both the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the need for abortion by making family planning and primary health care services as widely available as possible. For the first time, unsafe abortion and its consequences have been acknowledged as a major public health concern which this governments are urged to address. As I mentioned earlier, there is now widespread recognition that to be successful population programs need to integrate development and family planning objectives and to include strategies for addressing the social and economic disadvantage so often associated with high levels of population growth. The program of action adopts such an integrated approach, and Australia was pleased to contribute to this conclusion through the independent inquiry into population and development-a copy of the report being made available to other delegations. The program of action commits both donors and developing country governments to closing the gender gap which exists at every level of the education system in the developing world. There are 130 million eligible children who are not enrolled in primary school and 70 per cent of those are girls. Education is essential to the social development of countries and the dignity and well-being of its population. Lack of education, particularly for girls, exacts a development cost in terms of lost opportunities to slow population growth, raise incomes, productivity and the quality of life. That said, improving basic education, particularly for girls, is not a simple task and it requires action in a wide range of sectors, including particular efforts in training teachers and strengthening institutions. Australia will be seeking to increase funding in the education sector. We have already significantly increased assistance to health and population programs. Our task will be to design effective, culturally appropriate assistance that consolidates the efforts already being made by developing country governments. The program of action recognises that significant additional resources will be required to translate the goals of Cairo into reality. The Australian government will be endeavouring to do its fair share. There was also agreement to allocate resources for broader reproductive health concerns in addition to family planning programs. They also include maternal health, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-AIDS, and basic actions for collecting and analysing population data. This approach is consistent with Australia's development assistance programs which focus on women's empowerment, their health and education as essential to population programs. Although it is important that population and development issues be pursued in concert, it is also important that governments develop policies which embody the principle of sustainability. Another important objective for the Australian delegation at Cairo was that of securing continued commitment to the principle that all economic activity, in developed and developing countries alike, should be environmentally sustainable. Australia was one of a small number of countries which pursued sustainable development issues consistently throughout the preparatory process and during the conference itself. I am happy to report that the program of action builds on the international agreement reached at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio. It does this by reiterating the importance of the concept of sustainability and strengthening language on the relationship between production, consumption and population. No fewer than five of the 15 principles adopted by the conference highlight the significance of sustainability in ensuring the future well-being of the world's population. The concerns of indigenous peoples are important in the context of a program of action which deals with development and population. At Cairo we argued for explicit recognition of the needs of indigenous peoples in the program of action, not just because they comprise marginalised and disadvantaged groups in many societies, including our own, but as custodians of values which reflect a uniquely durable relationship with the environment. Indigenous peoples often have a cultural and spiritual attachment to the environment which goes beyond economics and which could be threatened by unsustainable development and some forms of population growth. Australia was very active at the preceding preparatory committee meetings in New York in strengthening references to indigenous peoples throughout the text. It also managed to have a principle on indigenous peoples accepted within the revised draft set of 15 principles considered in Cairo, despite the number of draft principles having been reduced from 33, none of which dealt with indigenous peoples. Australia, along with many other nations, is now pleased that a principle was adopted in Cairo which calls on member nations to recognise and support the identity, culture and interests of indigenous peoples and to enable them to participate fully in the economic, political and social life of the country. The program of action also calls on governments to respect the cultures of indigenous peoples, to enable them to own and manage territories, protect and restore natural resources and ecosystems on which they depend and to take these into account when formulating national policies. Some difficult migration issues had to be addressed at the Cairo conference, and it was important to achieve a balance between the need for national sovereignty and recognition of the needs of refugees and migrants and the contribution that they can make. One issue that emerged with unexpected force in Cairo was the question of the right of family reunion. Few countries have recognised the benefits and desirability of family migration more than Australia. However, Australia and many other countries, including the other traditional countries of migration, were not prepared to concede a right, particularly when its application to family groups was uncertain. However, Australia was happy to be able to playa key role in brokering a solution calling on countries to recognise the value of family reunion and to reflect it in their legislation, as we have done in Australia, and which refers to article 10 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This requires member nations to deal humanely and expeditiously with applications for family reunion between parents and children and to respect the right of exit. I would now like to tum briefly to the future. Member nations are committed to regularly assessing their progress towards implementation of the program of action and reporting on a periodic basis. Many of the goals set out within the program are ones to which Australia has already given high priority and the targets are more than met. In other areas, Australia meets standards at a national level but needs to continue to address the needs of particular groups, such as indigenous peoples, people in rural and remote areas and people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Australia needs to position itself early in ensuring that it meets, or more than meets, the objectives of the program of action. A detailed examination of the program of action has therefore been initiated and further statements on the results of this review are expected to be made early next year. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to all those who contributed to Australia's success at Cairo, particularly Richard Woolcott, chair of the National Advisory Committee, and Ambassador Butler. I single out particularly the parliamentary members of the delegation, including the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, who made a particular contribution-one for which I was personally very grateful. I also thank officials from government agencies and representatives of non-government organisations who played an important part. I present the following paper: United Nations International Conference on Population and Development-Ministerial Statement, 20 October 1994. Motion (by Dr Theophanous) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",116

297,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Minister for Transport to adequately explain his failure to respond to concerns expressed in the Parliament about aviation operators, which has led to a loss of confidence in aviation safety and the Minister's ability to administer his portfolio responsibilities. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",119
298,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Hume) (4.50 p.m.)Yesterday in the House and, indeed, over the last couple of days, the opposition has been leading a campaign highlighting its concerns about the state of air safety in Australia. Yesterday I made a speech which outlined the fairly brief history of the Civil Aviation Authority, which is the policeman of our aviation industry, and highlighted that, even though it has a brief history, it is one centred on controversy and a great deal of concern. I also pointed out yesterday that there had been a very significant failure on the part of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to respond to and act upon concerns that I expressed to this parliament about Seaview Air in a speech in May this year. I pointed out to the House that it was five months from the date of my speech in this House about Seaview Air before the minister decided require a response from the Civil Aviation Authority about the concerns I had expressed. He raised those questions, or asked for that response from the CAA, only after the Seadocument view Air crash of 2 October this year. I created a picture, if you like, of some of concerns we have and of the failure of the minister to respond as clearly and as correctly as possible. I note his entry to the chamber, having been here for question time today when issue for which he is responsible is one of the central issues of the day causing concern right did. throughout the community. The fact that he was not prepared today or on Tuesday to confront questions on this subject highlights the dereliction of the minister in his duties. I noticed that the Minister for Transport came in for the division a few minutes ago. Who did he sit next to-none other than Ros Kelly! I note he is getting used to her comminister pany because she sits on the backbench-and that is where you will be very shortly. Yesterday, I also responded to the calls by the minister to provide more detail about concerns I have about aviation safety in country. I outlined those concerns in the form of discussing and, indeed, trying documents about the matters surrounding an airline called Airlink-not Air Link which is another airline based in Dubbo one I refer to. Airlink is owned by National Jet Systems, carries Qantas's colours and is marketed by Qantas because National Jet Systems is owned by Qantas. I raised the matter of Airlink in this House because it was an airline I had specific concerns about. It does not give me any pleasure to have to raise these concerns in this fashion. a smart I do it because of the minister's failure in his duty of care over the last several months to ensure that air safety in Australia has been maintained. The only way I can ensure the minister will act is to do things in the way I did yesterday. I want to talk about the two operations mentioned in this parliament: Airlink and what is now called the Phoenix Aero Club, stand by that. which used to be called the New South Wales Police Aero Club. I raised the story about to Airlink, and tried to table the document, because of some very serious concerns I had. Before I go into those concerns, it was interesting to note that when I tried to table the yesterday, after the minister had been calling for me to do such a thing, the the minister would not allow me to table it. It was a very silly thing the minister did. He realised that not long after he got back to his office and he wrote to me and said, 'Would not you please give me the document now and I an will take the matter up for you?'",119
299,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It was a very smart thing I,120
300,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It might have been too. It was a smart thing then but you made a very silly decision earlier on in the day. Mr Thckey-Isn't it nice to be smart about people dying? He is pleased about that.,120
301,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I did that. I provided the with an outline of my concerns about the airline. The concerns are based on a number of grounds,120
302,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise the on a point of order. The honourable member this for O'Connor just interjected across the chamber that it was a case of my being smart to table about people dying.",120
303,Mr CADMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is not a point of order. Mr Brereton - I take offence at that and and is not the ask him to withdraw.,120
304,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Mitchell will resume his seat. I am sorry, because of the honourable member for Mitchell, the minister will have to repeat his point of order.",120
305,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member said that it was way of letting people die. Mr Thckey-That is not what I said.,120
306,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What did you say? Mr Thckey-I am happy to repeat it.,120
307,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Please do. Mr Thckey-The minister was saying,'1 I was smarter than you were,' and I asked, 'Is it smart to be joking about people dying?' I",120
308,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. The honourable member for O'Connor is not assisting by making those types of interjections. If the minister has taken it as an affront, I ask the honourable member for O'Connor to withdraw. Mr Thckey-I will withdraw it to let John go.",121
309,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As I was saying, the concerns that I have about Airlink are based on a number of grounds. Firstly, Airlink has been using unauthorised, unqualified people to carry out maintenance on BAE 146 aircraft. I cited specific examples in the document I gave the minister yesterday of that occurring. I also pointed out that it was not just people like me raising these concerns but that licensed aircraft mechanics from both Qantas and Ansett had raised concerns with the CAA about these deficiencies in Airlink's maintenance procedures. I also pointed out that the Airlink company had these concerns passed on to the CAA and that the CAA had not done anything about it. I also pointed out in the document I gave the minister that the company was set up in 1990 by a person who was, until he started working for Airlink, the manager of CAA in South Australia. He did not actually leave his employment from CAA. This gentleman, Mr Barry Lodge, took a 12-month leave of absence-technically still employed by CAA-and set up the airline Airlink. Whilst he was doing that, the person who took his place as the manager of CAA in South Australia gave the airline that Mr Barry Lodge was setting up all of the authorities and all of the licences to set up the airline and get it operating. At the end of the 12 months, what happened? Barry Lodge, the former general manager of CAA in South Australia who had taken leave of absence, resigned formally and the gentleman who had taken his place, who had given him all of the licences and endorsements needed to set the airline up, resigned from CAA and got a job with guess whoAirlink! That is the problem. There are clear examples in the document I gave the minister yesterday of deficiencies in the maintenance procedures of a particular airline that are being reported to the CAA, for which action has not been undertaken to correct the problem. If you look at the way the airline was set up in the first instance, you come back to the very core issue of this whole problem: this unholy relationship between the CAA, the policeman of our airlines, and the airline operators themselves. They are running hand in hand. Airlink is a classic example of the problem. That is exactly why I raised it in the manner that I did yesterday. I also raised another concern about the Phoenix Aero Club, which was called the New South Wales Police Aero Club. It is a pilot training school based at Bankstown airport. What is the problem with it? The problems with this aero club are such that earlier this year the New South Wales police commissioner withdrew his patronage from the aero club and had the name 'police' removed from the operation of the aero club because of his concerns with the maintenance procedures and the activities of the club. What are those concerns? Those concerns relate to the person who was maintaining not only the aircraft at this aero club but also other aircraft. This licensed aircraft maintenance engineer was renting space in the aero club's hangars to carry out his business. The members of the club's committee finally realised that this person was not maintaining the aircraft in a safe fashion. It had been pointed out to him by other licensed aircraft maintenance engineers that there were some serious deficiencies. The club decided to report the deficiencies. The deficiencies are quite serious. I will give you an idea of some of the problems it had. In one of the training aircraft that the club operated the pilot seat had broken and actually sat on the floor of the aircraft. Student pilots could not see over the dashboard. In order to see over the dashboard they put cushions on the seat. Do you realise that that deficiency in the aircraft lasted for five 100hourly maintenance checks? It is illegal for an aircraft pilot's seat to be broken in that fashion. Yet the person licensed to maintain these aircraft allowed it to go on for five 100hourly maintenance checks before the problem was corrected. Not only did that happen but the licensed aircraft maintenance engineer went on holidays for six months. He put his son-in-law in charge of running the aircraft maintenance business. His son-in-law is not a qualified aircraft maintenance engineer and he is not certificated to sign off aircraft for maintenance purposes to ensure that they can continue to fly. But his son-in-law did all of those things. He maintained the aircraft and, in addition, signed off that these aircraft were in proper order as if he were a certificated LAME-licensed aircraft maintenance engineer. The club committee was absolutely alarmed at what was going on and so it decided that something had to be done. It reported it to the CAA. The airworthiness inspectors at the CAA recommended not only that this licensed aircraft maintenance engineer should lose his licence but also that the fellow should be prosecuted. Do you know what happened? A person higher up in the CAA blocked it. He said, 'Oh, no. This isn't the right way to go. This person ought to be counselled.' A compromise was finally arranged. The CAA said, 'We'll put the fellow through a written examination for his licence again to ensure that he is up to speed.' That did not happen either. Finally, it appears, so we are told, that the person who blocked the original recommendation actually carried out, in his words, an oral examination of the person and approved his licence renewal. No-one else was there to see whether it was done; no-one else was there to see whether he got the answers right or wrong. Mr Nehl-That's outrageous.",121
310,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is outrageous, as has been pointed out. They are the sorts of concerns that ordinary Australians should have. But, if ordinary Australians are not concerned enough about that, they have only to look at the submissions to the air safety inquiry that were released last night by the honourable  chairman of the inquiry. If members go to submission No. 56, they will see that it is a submission written by a person who is the head of the Civil Aviation Authority'S fatigue section, a bloke by the name of Steve Swift. He is a professional aeronautical engineer with 17 years experience in the aviation business. In his brief report he says: In the last ten years I have observed a deterioration in CAA's ability to efficiently set and supervise fatigue safety standards for Australia's growing, and ageing fleet. It has reached the point where the flying public is exposed to an unacceptable risk of structural failureHe then goes on to talk about the particular airlines for which these fatigue stress problems are most prominent. He says: First, is the Aero Commander. . . Thirty years ago wings started breaking off by fatigue. Later, serious corrosion problems developed. He then goes on to say: Another is the Piper Chieftain, the type which crashed at Young. Cracks are occurring in the part which joins the wings together. Two hundred Australian aircraft, many of them in commuter airline service, are at risk of losing a wing right now. Some 200 of these aircraft, which are very commonly used as commuter planes in Australia, are at risk of losing their wings right now. What other statement could you get that would cause you more alarm? Whilst it is the CAA's responsibility on a day-today basis to maintain air safety in this country, there is one person who is ultimately responsible for maintaining it, and that is the minister-the man sitting opposite us today. Whilst he has been in the chair of the transport portfolio, the alarm bells have been ringing long and loud and he has done nothing to fix it other than the things that he really had to do after major incidents like the Monarch crash and the Seaview crash. It is his inactivity, his delay in responding to my claims in the parliament in May of this year, that justifies the call by people throughout the industry-the latest of which has come today from one of the aviation associations-that he should be sacked right now. (TIme expired)",122
311,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (5.05 p.m.)-I am delighted that the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) has been stupid enough to submit this MPI today because without it I might not have had the opportunity to make some of the comments that I am about to make here in parliament about the behaviour of the honourable member for Hume. They relate particularly to his behaviour over the last 24 hours. As honourable members know, today was my day out of question time. But I am very pleased to be here for this matter of public importance. All week, I have been at the honourable member to explain why he declined to use the appropriate channels to provide the information he allegedly had about shonky operators, even though three separate approaches were made to him-the first approach being made on 5 May this year, the day after he stood in this parliament and made his allegations for the first time. The first excuse he used was that he could not trust the CAA. Yet he was offered confidentiality through the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. The second, which he outlined in his letters, was that he was having discussions with me. He wanted a parliamentary inquiry-a parliamentary inquiry that I gave him and for which he put out a press release praising me. Did he have any doubts about the avenues that were offered to him in those cases being the appropriate channels? Look at what he had to say only this morning in his latest effort about Airlink. He said: . . . I think the important thing is to get itmeaning the allegationschecked out and it can only really be checked out via the procedures that the Civil Aviation Authority has ... That is what you said in your interview this morning-exactly. They need to be checked out through John Pike, the man who grounded Seaview after he received hard evidence about its conduct, or BASI's confidential reporting system. This was offered to you before and has been available to you at every point along the way. Yet the honourable member declined to use these avenues previously. Today he is admitting that these are the appropriate avenues to take. At least now, after a week of asking from me, he has decided to use those avenues in respect of Airlink. Airlink is a 100 per cent wholly owned subsidiary of Qantas. But he did not decide to use these procedures before he publicly dragged Airlink's name and, by association, the name of its owner, Qantasthe safest airline in the world, Australia's own national carrier-through the dirt. This operation is owned by Qantas, flying under the Qantas livery. You dragged its name and its reputation through the dirt. You did it before you had a chance to use the avenues that you acknowledged only this morning were the appropriate ones to ascertain whether the allegations were true. What was the timing of the honourable member? The day of a serious incident involving our second major international carrier, Ansett. How utterly irresponsible of you to proceed in this way! If honourable members want to know just how worried some people are about this issue being pursued responsibly, they should look at what Steven Holle from the Australian Tourism Industry Association said today in a story entitled' ATIA warns air safety concerns could damage the tourism industry'. The article states: ATIA policy and research manager Steve Holle said Australia's aviation industry had an enviable safety record. But incidents like that of the Ansett crash on the Sydney runway yesterday, the fatal flight of the Seaview plane on the way to Lord Howe Island and speculation about air safety standards could cause damage to tourism . Mr Holle said the government and Ansett had handled yesterday'S incident extremely well. However, if the debate leads to an improvement in the bureaucratic processes . . . and in the safety performance of the airlines then there can only be a benefitHonourable members should look at the question the honourable member got this morning on radio station 4BC. The interviewer said: Well the Transport Minister Laurie Brereton last night was attempting to re-assure the travelIing public about safety. I'm just wondering if comments such as yours would not only be damaging to the industry here but also could damage our reputation internationally. He said to you: ... you said yourself, you hope you're you're wrong could I suggest a lot of the damage has already been done. That was the proposition put to the honourable member this morning. And what did you say in reply? You said this: I ... hope I am wrong ... That was after the damage was done. Then you claimed that you had never been wrong before. But you stood in this House on 4 May and you said that Western Airlines were still flying. Look at the Hansard. Mr Sharp-I did not. You are misleading the House.",122
312,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Look at the Hansard. Mr Sharp-I did not.,124
313,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It says 'Western Airwhere lines still flying' - on 4 May. Look at the Hansard. Mr Sharp-That is wrong.,124
314,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You said it. They were, in fact, still flying. Mr Sharp-They closed in December. I said in the House that they ceased operations Airlink. in December.",124
315,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They had ceased opermediately ations in June 1993, so you are wrong again. You said in the House they were still operatallegations ing. You are now saying that you said they closed in December but in reality they in June 1993. Last night the honourable member said on PM that he had provided information on Airlink and Phoenix Aero Club to me. He went on the radio and said he had provided to me when he knew he had not. It was, the ABC, a barefaced lie. My office had to make two calls to his office seeking the information. I personally spoke to his secreAirlines? tary and was told that he would sign the letter, the letter he said on radio he delivered to my office. She said to me he would sign the letter and send the information as soon as he got back from doing his media rounds. Where was he? In the gallery. How darned decent of him! I had to wait until honourable member finished his rounds of the media gallery here before I could refer the information that he said in that barefaced lie wrong, if he had provided to meDr Kemp- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order",124
316,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Rocher)Order! The minister will withdraw the remark.,124
317,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will withdraw the remark, Mr Deputy Speaker. These are the people who have come into this House this week and accused me of being the minister for news clips. That is what they called out across the chamber. Yesterday, when it came to news, you certainly knew where your priorities lay, did you not? The honourable member was running around the gallery criticising me for not letting him table a document here in the parliament. But it was on a day that Ansett had had a major incident, there was already public concern. I have to admit: I did not want to see an as yet unsubstantiated, as yet uninvestigated, allegation referring to safety becoming a public document. Twenty-five years of public life have told me it was the right thing to do to take that approach-particularly when it involves Qantas, the 100 per cent owner of The honourable member knows that imafter the MPI yesterday, as soon as I left this chamber, I offered to get these checked out in a confidential way by the appropriate authorities and to have the closed honourable member informed about the progress of the investigations. We were already having them investigated immediately through the appropriate channels, that is, through Mr John Pike. But what if they were it not true; what if they were not correct? What on if the honourable member was as wrong in those allegations about Qantas as he was in his statement in this parliament about Western What do you say in those circumstances to Airlink? What do you say in those had circumstances to Qantas? The honourable member basically did not care. He wanted to get out there and score some cheap political points. He wanted to do that rather than do the responsible thing. He did not care for one the moment about dragging Qantas's name through the dirt. He knew then, as he has known all along and as he knows today, that this company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Qantas. The honourable member chose to do this without giving Qantas a chance to answer or to investigate the material that he had. James Strong phoned him last night after the damage was already done. He had to put out a statement which indicated that Qantas was not unaware of the allegations and that it had had them checked out. Now he will do it again, and John Pike will investigate them. But, had the honourable member chosen to do the responsible thing, that would have happened anyway, and it would have happened properly and with confidentiality. Instead, it is being done now after the damage has been done to the name of Qantas. I have been in politics long enough to know one thing, and that is you can get a stream of leaks-it always happens in opposition-but it is another thing to know how to use them responsibly. I put it to the House that the honourable member has displayed the very worse of judgment in how he has handled this matter. The reality is-and we should all know this-that leaks are not always going be true and they always need to be investigatinstructions ed. People do not always leak to you in interests of safety. Sometimes they have other agendas to pursue. Sometimes they have other motives. Sometimes they are not wholly motivated by safety considerations. Someseveral times their views are coloured by other considerations. That is why you have always got to be responsible. That is why you have always got to go through proper processtime exactly what the honourable member did do yesterday. It is for this reason that we have the various channels available to investigate these claims. It is for that reason that you have a parliavisiting mentary inquiry, the inquiry set up to pursue allegations. But in pursuing them. I stress the House that you have to act responsibly and use the correct channels-that you self acknowledged today as the appropriate ones-the ones that you chose not to use earlier on this year and that you chose not use on the basis of confidentiality as offered to you by me yesterday afternoon. Until this week I could never have denied the sincerity of the honourable member in his pursuit of aviation safety or his commitment to bipartisanship in the pursuit of such safety. All that has changed this week. For me it has changed profoundly. The way these allegations have been handled leaves me in no doubt that the honourable member has given away the whole commitment he has previously espoused to the pursuit of the safer skies. He is in here sluicing around with the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and his colleagues, looking for the lowest common denominator, looking to score the cheapest possible points. I have welcomed the way the honourable member has supported me at every turn of my handling of the Civil Aviation Authority. All week you have been at it to deny that you did, but you have not been able to because there has been press release after press release, letter after letter, interview after interview. The honourable member is condemned by his own statements. When did he change his approach? He changed his approach only this week when he to returned to Australia and he got his riding from the Leader of the National the Party and from Mr Seventeen Per Cent. Government members-Where was he?",124
318,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He was in Canada for weeks, but no-one is having a shot at him about that because he had his phone by his bed and he was able to make those very congratulatory remarks from Canada all the until he arrived back here in Australia. not What did he do this week? He caved into the Leader of the National Party, the same Leader of the National Party who has today issued a press release attacking me for not the headquarters of the Civil Aviation Authority. That is exactly what you would to expect from two-minute Tim, a great new angle from two-minute Tim. Perhaps he yourwanted me to do a Lionel Murphy and go down and stage a raid on the Civil Aviation Authority. We all know he wanted me to to charter a plane and go off and search for the Seaview crash the week before. He was all over every bit of media around the place. These are the very people who stand here in the House and complain about hurt to their families-as the Leader of the National Party complained of this week-in comments that I made, comments that I withdrew, but who are all too happy to get out there and attack me for spending time with my family. That is what you did last week and that is what you have done again this week. Now we have the member for Hume all out to politicise this issue and getting right into the gutter in doing so. It is for me a matter great regret that the member for Hume has decided to follow his leaders. I said yesterday that forever in my view it relegates him to the ranks of the B-graders, along with the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who let that debate run on yesterday. I conclude by assuring the House that I will treat every bit of material brought forward to me with the utmost seriousness and have it investigated by the appropriate authorities. I will take very seriously the findings of the parliamentary committee that I established and also the findings of the judicial inquiry and the police inquiries. But after last effort, and with the tactics that have been employed by the opposition and the member for Hume today, I will forever treat you in this respect with utter contempt. Mr Sharp-I seek leave to table some documents that might assist the minister in his calls for further details.",125
319,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What are the documents? Mr Sharp-The documents relate to the Phoenix Aero Club.,126
320,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You can submit them to the inquiry.,126
321,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Leave is not granted.,126
322,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just heard one of the most outrageous speeches we could ever hear from the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), responsible for air safety. We all know what has gone on in the last five months, and a number of people have been killed in aircraft. Had the proper rules of maintenance, written down for decades in Australia, been complied with under this minister's direction, over 20 people would still be living. That is the issue this parliament and, of course, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) have addressed time and time again. Issues of solid substance were raised five months ago and, tragically, they have been vindicated by further crashes. Did we get anything from the minister today about what he did in those five months? We know what he has done since another nine people got killed. We know what he has of done in the last few weeks. We heard him tonight pontificating about what has happened today and about the damage that will be done to our tourist industry when he should have taken action five months ago that would have ensured that none of these problems for the tourist industry would develop. That is the problem. He has not acted when appropriate. How does the minister try to excuse himself? It is just typical. There has never been a time when he has stood up in this parliament and given us evidence of the appropriate action that he took. It is always, if I may use a piece of prime ministerial terminology, a night's practice of protecting Laurie's arse.",126
323,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member knows that he must not use that language.,126
324,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is the way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talks. I withdraw that and say 'backside'. Mr O'Keefe-You are a piece of lice, like you were described in question time.",126
325,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am a bit of lice for drawing attention in this parliament to where aircraft are flying around with Macchi aircraft shooting their guns!,126
326,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. The honourable member will withdraw that at his place. Mr O'Keefe-I withdraw.,126
327,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Where is your place in the parliament? Mr O'Keefe-Here. This is it.,126
328,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is a parliamentary secretary, I think. Mr O'Keefe- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: you have asked me to withdraw. I asked him to withdraw and he would not. You heard the terminology; you were in the chair. Ask him to withdraw what was found to be offensive.",126
329,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I did not hear it. What was it? Mr O'Keefe-He knows what he said. Do the decent thing and withdraw.,127
330,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I said that I replace the word with 'backside'. Mr O'Keefe-Do the decent thing and withdraw.,127
331,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am not going to withdraw. Mr O'Keefe-You are always coming up here to the box and demanding that people withdraw.,127
332,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member will resume his seat. The honourable member for O'Connor did withdraw that remark, as you would know if you had been paying attention.",127
333,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, I did. The point I am trying to make is that there has never been a time during this dispute, going back five months, that the minister has come in here, stood up and said, 'Tragically, I've got to admit that there are substantial problems in my department. Here is how I am going to fix them.' When dealing with people's lives, you would think that would be a reasonable and proper response; but, no, it is always a political response. Mr O'Keefe-That is exactly what he has done.",127
334,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He has not. Until it was drawn out of him like teeth. Mr O'Keefe-He has outlined a whole litany of things that are being done.,127
335,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,After 20 people lost their lives. Mr O'Keefe-What are you talking about?,127
336,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am talking about the fact that the member for Hume raised issues in this parliament five months ago relevant to a crash that had already killed nine people.,127
337,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member will cease interjecting. Mr Leo MCLeay-He didn't do anything about it?,127
338,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No. Isn't it amazing? Everybody on the New South Wales Right runs to the same principles: find an excuse; find a political argument; cover your backside; don't do the things that save people's lives. You stand as condemned for that remark as anyone else. The simple fact is that you did not do it. You did not carry out appropriate action. You ran around and called on the member for Hume to put up or shut up. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I am not part of this. I object to the member attacking me on this issue and I would like him to withdraw the remarks he made about me.",127
339,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I did not hear anything offensive in the remarks he made, but the honourable member for O'Connor will address his remarks through the chair. Mr TUCKEYI will be delighted to do so and point out to you what the situation has been. This minister is not the Minister for Consumer Affairs where a mistake hurts nobody. He is the minister for air safety. There is only one response from a minister for air safety if he gets a letter in the mail or, more importantly, substantial concerns from a member of this House based on a crash that has already occurred. It is absolutely ridiculous, since we have seen three members of parliament sued in recent times, to tell him that he is guaranteed confidentiality. Three members sued and a couple have settled. That is wrong. The facts are that once a minister for air safety gets that sort of advice it is his job to do something about it-not just cover himself politically by writing a letter and forgetting about it for five months. He should have had written on his desk diary or entered on his or his chief adviser's computer: 'Every Monday check with CAA for a response on my letters regarding Sharp's comments on Monarch Air'. I would like to see evidence of that nature floating around the place becauseMr O'Keefe-He had lots of responses.",127
340,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No. For five months nothing happened. Another nine people went into the ocean before the minister rang up and said, 'What happened to my letter?' That is what happened. Mr O'Keefe-He got responses and invitations. What is wrong with you?",128
341,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You are trying to hide behind a political argument.,128
342,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,If the member continues to interject I will deal with him.,128
343,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am quite happy for that type of interjection because it puts another person from the government benches in the group of those who say, 'As long as I've got a smart alec response, the rest doesn't matter. ' We are talking about people being asked to fly in aircraft that are overloaded and underserviced. We are talking about a RAAF air traffic control capacity that is so depleted they did not know for 15 minutes that there was a commuter aircraft in an area where four Macchi jets were running around at 500 miles an hour shooting their guns. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about the fact that five months ago the minister was warned about the situation and all these extra people lost their lives before he came up with some responses in the last week or so. What is his excuse? He says, 'The opposition did not tell us all.' When any decent minister gets this sort of advice he goes in and demands answers. He does not just write a letter and wait five months for the response. Of course he does not. We are not talking about the Minister for Consumer Affairs. He should not come in here and grin and smirk, as he did today, and say, 'I am smarter than you are.' It has nothing to do with smartness. It is a tragedy. The member for Hume would be the saddest man in this parliament that his predictions have been tragically vindicated. But the minister did not do anything about it until it was too late. Today he is saying, 'You might be damaging our tourist industry.' No, the minister's inactivity for the last five months is damaging our tourist industry and he stands condemned for that. The minister's inference was, 'It is our national icon.' Therefore, apparently, it can do things. It can use people who are not fully licensed to carry out maintenance on its aircraft. Is that true? Do you believe that? That is what he said. We cannot possibly damage their commercial representation! Just let a few more people die! The facts of life are that the Ansett incident would have been no more than spectacular had it not been for all the associated events which this minister failed to deal with, act upon and prevent, starting five months ago. He need not have known before then, but he should have known from there on. The quicker you get rid of him, the safer airlines will be. In my view, Australians are as much at risk today as they were five months ago because you still have not fixed the problems. You have just got to the process of talking about it, and that is a tragedy. That is something that really means a minister should go. He must go for what he did not do, starting five months ago. NA",128
344,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Rocher)Order! It being 5.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. The Coasters Motel, Sawtell",128
345,Mr NEHL,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to put forward the case of a small motel in Sawtell, which is in my electorate. It is a very nice little motel called The Coasters and it is operated by a mother and daughter. Whereas on television last night and today we have heard from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) about the widespread access to enterprise agreements, I want to quote an example of a small familyrun motel being wrecked by the lack of enterprise agreement and by the hard-fisted impact of the award system. In a letter to me, one of the ladies says: . . . we are a small motel run by mother and daughter, who have been employing 4 people for various short daily terms. The three ladies, who have been our housemaids, basically have been selecting their own hours. None of these ladies like to work more than 2 hours daily, they will on occasions but do not want to on a regular basis. We have been paying them a flat rate of $10 and $12. The fourth lady is employed 'live-in', and the agreed payment has been $250 for approx 20 hours per week and the value of the rent to be worked off by attending telephones and desk for various times. This position was created and discussed with the Lismore Office for the State Awards and seemed to be in order for them. As a result of the first visit by the Federal Officer the other 4 members of staff went into his office (3 together and 1 separately). The older group tried to explain to the officer that they were 100% happy with their pay, hours and conditions. They did not want changes and did not want any back pay. They were told that they also had to conform with the award and that means they cannot work less than 3 hours daily. If you work one hour a week you are not counted as unemployed, so how can the award force these women to work three hours daily if they do not want to and the work is not there? The letter continues: On this second visit by the officer he is adamant that under no circumstances can we continue with our present system of giving work. He has worked out example methods of payment for us, both for casual and part-time employment. A part-time worker can be so called provided they complete no less than 48 hours in any 4 week period, working not less than 3 hrs a day and no more than 128 in the same 4 weeks. 1\vo examples of his calculations for part-time shows: 1. Six straight working days from Monday to Saturday inclusive total 18 hours = $181.59 gross. For 18 hours at $12 per hr (which is what we have been paying our regular worker) the gross pay would be $216. The interference of the federal department officer is going to see the worker earning less for the same work. The letter continues: 2. Five working days, including Sat and Sun total 16 hrs = $170.77 ... At the moment, these women pay $192. The letter continues: The fourth member of staff ('live-in') on the officers calculations of the award, should be paid $246.79 gross, we pay $250. Where is the sense in this? The letter continues: We are now left in the situation where we will probably have to dispense with the ladies who we pay $10 per hour. Mainly because they do not want to work a minimum of 3 hrs, and secondly (and most importantly) we cannot provide the work. They own only a small motel. The letter goes on: The usual day is 2 ladies approx 2 to 2112 hours. This will equate to 1 lady 4 to 5 hours. Not one of them will accept that. Currently they work together, enjoy the company and are happy with their pay. They are mature women who run family homes and in some cases do other little jobs for charity. They do not want to increase their hours here as they find the work too hard for long periods. These days it is increasingly hard to provide small jobs that actually pay more than the dole money does. We are now listed criminals for employing staff, who have been very happy in all respects, because the award says they cannot work in this manner, and we cannot employ them in this manner. Just who is the award protecting and what do the previous shown figures prove? I know we are not the first, nor unfortunately will we be the last, to be condemned by this award. We will be prosecuted for our ""crimes"", to what degree is yet to be determined. Even more unfair is that at least two of our ladies will become unemployed again. The winner-the federal purse. Is that really what it is all about? The officer ensures his job remains secure!! My daughters health has totally collapsed under all this. Yours sincerely, NA This is where we are going wrong. We do not have sufficient flexibility in our industrial relations scheme to allow people to get on with the job of employing others who are happy to accept the employment they can get. Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations",128
346,Mrs EASSON,BRENDA THORNE,"I was so inspired by the matter of public importance this afternoon that I decided to make an adjournment speech on this topic. We really cannot blame the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) for his vicious attack on the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). After all, he is not really attacking the minister; he is showing his colleagues in the National Party that he should succeed the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) as Leader of the National Party. The honourable member for Farrer is obviously past it and clearly shows that he is not a patch on the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) or the late John MCEwen. The honourable member for Hume should keep up his vicious campaign for his party leadership. He is certainly a popular choice on this side of the House. No-one denies that there are troubles in civil aviation. I worked for five years in the aviation industry and I know considerably more about it than do most members opposite. It is complex. Problems do arise and there are plenty of troubles. That is why the minister has appointed a judicial inquiry into the Civil Aviation Authority. The opposition has demanded the minister's resignation because he has allegedly failed to adequately deal with the situation in the Civil Aviation Authority. He has not failed. He has done the first thing that he should do, and that is compile the facts. He has appointed Sir Laurence Street to do the job. Who would the opposition suggest for the job-Jeff Kennett's friend who has the Crown Casino licence? He may be a little busy counting his money and sending the Liberal Party its share. Amongst the welter of problems in civil aviation are some which have been forwarded to the Australian Federal Police. It is not the minister's fault if any crimes have been committed. His duty is to see that any allegations of crime are promptly dealt with. This he has done. The minister has acted decisively and appropriately, and to suggest anything else is malicious. If opposition members think that the minister is responsible for crimes that took place under his portfolio jurisdiction, then they must hold the minister for health responsible for every case of medical malpractice, the Treasurer responsible for every shonky tax return, and the minister for schools responsible for every bit of homework that is not done. Obviously politics-not policymotivates opposition members in their attacks. A key indicator of this is the absolute silence of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Those in this political double act-our very own Bib and Bubare not participating in this effort because they do not want to give the honourable member for Mayo, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), a victory. The game plan is for the honourable member for Mayo to struggle along and become an even greater figure of fun-like Pooh Bear with his head stuck in the honey pot-and then replace him. The honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Higgins will then face the Prime Minister at the next election. It is a great plan. It will probably succeed. Then the voters will reject the honourable member for Bennelong for a second time. Why? Because the voters want a government with policies and the honourable member for Bennelong has only one policy. It is the fundamental policy of the Liberal Party-that is, to stand on street comers waving the Union Jack and cheering as she goes by. This is 1994, not 1954. The Liberal Party refuses to accept this and so we will continue to govern. All this froth and bubble from the coalition about Minister Brereton is driven by politics. The minister has done what needs to be done. He has appointed an inquiry and, based on the inquiry's findings, action is being taken. I personally have worked in this industry and know that the level of morale is very high. I also know that Australia, under all party governments, has had an excellent record in civil aviation matters. Members opposite should think with their brains and not their ambitions before they say anything to damage our tourist trade. Overseas visitors do not need to read Australian political point scoring and think that these remarks are accurate. We have a $9 billion tourist industry-most of it airborne-and we need it to grow bigger. Can opposition members please keep this fact in mind when they blindly rush towards their party leaderships? It is clear that this minister is doing everything that he should do to settle these vital matters. The travelling public can have full confidence in the integrity and seriousness of the minister. The attempts of the opposition to paint the minister as laggard or incompetent are contemptible and contrary to Australia's interests. Our travellers and foreign tourists do not need to be subjected to a phoney campaign that the sky is falling in. It is not. It is only the opposition's stocks are falling. Warringah Peninsula",129
347,Mr ABBOTT,BRENDA THORNE,"I rise to highlight some of the difficulties commuters face on the Warringah Peninsula of Sydney. As members would know, the Expressway, Warringah Peninsula is God's garden. Mr Connolly-God's country.",131
348,Mr ABBOTT,BRENDA THORNE,"It is God's own country. It is one of the best places in the world to live-until you need to go somewhere The problem is that there are very few paths in and out of this magnificent garden. This beauty spot, where hundreds of thousands of Sydney people live and work, is in danger choking on its own traffic. Getting from Seaforth to the city normally takes 15 or minutes, but on some mornings it can take one hour. This will be exacerbated if developMinister's ment mooted for the Ingleside-Warriewood area goes ahead. The plan is to develop 30,000 new home sites in that area. This should be of concern not just to residents; it should be of concern to the whole of Australia because in the years leading to the Olympics people will spend a lot more time at Sydney's beauty spots-Manly beach, Balmoral beach and Taronga Park zoo. They will spend a lot more time on the northern beaches than they will ever spend at Homefrom bush Bay. It is important for the image of countryMr Leo MCLeay-Do you want a motorway?",131
349,Mr ABBOTT,BRENDA THORNE,"Get back on your bike, backbenchers Leo. It is very important for the whole nation that this area be put into tiptop shape by time the Olympics start. The state governTransport ment, to its credit, is doing a very great towards remedying a hundred years of negbourne. lect. In the 1870s the first plans were posed for a railway in this area, and Bradfield wanted to put a railway in when Harbour Bridge was built. The Wran government shamefully neglected this part of Sydney, as it shamefully neglected most parts of Sydney. The state government is to be congratulated for its efforts to build a community consensus on the forms of transport infrastructhat ture that the Warringah Peninsula needs. The federal government is to be condemned. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the same Prime Minister who is prepared to offer $150 million to tear down a perfectly functioning road and rail system, the Cahill has not offered a cent to improve this much more vital piece of transport infrastructure. The Prime Minister, who is prepared to give $250 million to his mates in the arts industry, ought to be prepared to match state government money to improve the infraelse. structure in this area. We all used to wonder about the amount on the IOU that the Prime Minister wrote to the of arts community at the time of the last election. Now we know-$250 million. If the 20 government can give $500,000 to Geoffrey Tozer, who is in trouble because of the Prime failed attempts to renovate his Queanbeyan convent, it can surely find money to help the people of Warringah, who are choking on their own traffic. If this government is prepared to waste so up much money on things that are not going to help people, can it not at least consider doing something for the people of Warringah? If the Prime Minister can find $150 million to take away the Cahill Expressway so he can see Kirribilli House those magnificent this buildings behind-a couple of old pubs and a MCDonald's outlet-surely the government ought to support a useful project. We all know that the government's own are so terrified of air travel and about getting on the planes to go home, the thanks to the efforts of the Minister for (Mr Brereton), that they will be deal calling for more trains to Sydney and MelI think it is high time that the governproment spent more money on on the ground infrastructure-road and rail systems-on the the Sydney Warringah Peninsula. Haemophiliacs: Factor VIII  ning I wish to draw the attention of the House to the plight of haemophiliacs around Australia. There is currently a crisis in the supply of factor VIII in Australia, a blood component necessary for blood clotting. This is absent in the blood of haemophiliacs and thus replacement with the derived plasma product or the artificial product is necessary to prevent uncontrolled haemorrhage. The Australian Blood Transfusion Society recommended in 1993 that three international units of factor VIII per capita should be the standard supply in Australia. At best, the amount available is a paltry 1.6 international units. Whether a person will suffer from haemophilia is determined before birth by one's genetic configuration. It is incurable and, as such, correct medical management requires lifelong vigilance. If this government is serious about being equitable in providing preventable health measures to all Australians, it needs to consider increasing the supply of factor VIII. There are other medical conditions for which the government readily provides large amounts of funding through the pharmaceutical benefits schedule: for example, Paget's disease of the bone, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, various congenital metabolic deficiency syndromes and neoplastic diseases. A general shortage of factor VIII means that stocks for haemophiliacs requiring elective surgery are at times inaccessible. This has included orthopaedic, cardiac and gastrointestinal surgery. In the long term, patients are frequently denied access to treatment which would prevent the tragic complications that I have mentioned previously. Adequate supply of factor VIII would allow most sufferers to lead near normal lives. Haemophiliacs themselves would suffer fewer and less severe bleeds, which would reduce the risk of death due to haemorrhage; elective surgery would be performed more promptly; and the long term destabilising effects of recurrent bleeds would be minimised. Other less measurable benefits also deserve mention-the improvement in the quality of life experienced by haemophiliacs and their families due to their ability to perform the activities of daily living with less interruption and with less worry about their future. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories manufacture factor VIII from blood donations. There are two problems with relying on this product: donations have been in short supply for some time, meaning that there is not enough plasma available to produce the necessary quantity of factor VIII; and there is also the problem of product quality. During the 1980s the haemophiliac community in Australia endured the tragedy of infected blood products. Several severe haemophiliacs contracted the HIV virus and more recently hepatitis C. Haemophiliacs deserve special sympathy because of these events and should be considered a priority target for quality health care. The artificial products, while common overseas, are in the process of being approved in Australia. Known as recombinant DNA, it is more expensive but it is pure and does not carry the risk of infection. Action has not been forthcoming. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) will not fund the cost of the supply of factor VIII. This government will probably lay the blame for the stalemate on recalcitrant state governments. The Minister for Human Services and Health cannot shirk the responsibility she has to provide enough funds to maintain the basic health services of Australians in need. Compared to other OECD nations, such as Canada, the United States and Great Britain, Australia is neglecting this issue. The government should discontinue the prolonging of the suffering of haemophiliacs and their families. Drought",131
350,Mr HAWKER,BRENDA THORNE,"Wannon) (5.48 p.m.)Tonight I want to bring to the House's attention a classic case of gross insincerity by this country's Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Today we heard him again make reference to his concern for people who are suffering from the drought. I want to show just how insincere he really is when it comes to genuinely trying to help people who are trying to help others suffering from a drought. I want to tell a story about the real generosity of some real Australians who live in my electorate. The Timboon Lions Club, to its credit, organised for donations of hay to be sent to Queensland to help people suffering from the drought. They were very generousthey arranged for a total of 62 semi loads of hay to be sent to Queensland to help farmers whose stock are starving because of the drought. I think that generosity deserves the applause of all honourable members. I want to point out how niggardly the Prime Minister is when it comes to doing something genuine to help in this drought. Obviously that hay has to get up to Queensland and this is a very expensive exercise. As a local member, I asked whether the Prime Minister would assist, at least in part, by, say, forgoing the excise on fuel required for the carting of this hay. So far, the Prime Minister-in true form - has not even bothered to respond to the request. The farmers were not the only people who were generous. Shell donated a lot of the fuel to help send some of the hay up as well. If honourable members were to sit down and look at just what it cost to get 62 truck loads of hay from Timboon to Queensland, they would find that the amount of fuel excise that had to be paid exceeded $50,000-it worked out to be around $53,000. The Prime Minister and the government are quite happy to cream off $53,000 from the generosity of those who are trying to help other Australians. Frankly, not to acknowledge or support the generosity of the people who are trying to help those who are suffering from this horrendous drought would be un-Australian. I want to draw the attention of the House to just how insincere the Prime Minister is. He will not even acknowledge what those people have done. He should do the decent thing and say that the government is prepared to forgo the $53,000. The work that is being done by the Lions Club in Timboon is a fabulous example of what it means to be an Australian. Many farmers have donated this hay and many people from Lions Clubs around Australia have helped to distribute it. It is a generous exercise and the government should come to the party and help. I call on the Prime Minister, even at this late stage, to tell us that his government is prepared to refund this money. Given the sincerity of farmers in the Timboon districtand right throughout areas in western Victoria, where there have been better rains than in many other parts of Australia. I believe that if the government were to be seen to be genuinely interested in the voluntary efforts of others, it may well find that others in the area would be forthcoming in giving more assistance. I would have thought that, in the true spirit of what it means to be an Australian, the government would have been prepared to refund this money. This is a classic case of the generosity of others being taxed by the Labor Party, which is very un-Australian. All members of the Labor Party would be ashamed of the Prime Minister's attitude. This is a really generous donation by the people in my electorate. Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations",132
351,Mr CAMPBELL,BRENDA THORNE,"I did not come here to talk on this matter, but I wish to take issue with some of the comments made by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I have not heard so much sickening drivel for quite some time. There is no doubt that the Lions Club in Timboon is to be congratulated for supplying fodder to Queensland. The Lions Club in Timboon knows what the rules are. To come in here and whinge, like the honourable member for Wannon has, about taxation measures, not Labor Party measures, and expect the taxation system to be adjusted for this one incident-which is one of generosity, no doubt-is absolutely absurd. It is a nonsense way of going about it. If I were the honourable member for Wannon, I would have made sure that those semitrailers left the properties full of excise-free diesel from the farms. No-one would have questioned that. Shell was very generous in supplying fuel. Obviously, the last component of this fuel excise has already been paid. Noone has taken one iota away from the generosity of people in the electorate of Wannon. But for him to come in here and whinge about the excise that was charged on the fuel to get the hay to Queensland-a cost is incurred to get fodder anywhere-and expect a special provision to be made on the whole taxation system is simply absurd. I suggest that the member for Wannon should do something useful rather than come in here with this heart on the sleeve, tear-jerking drivel. I originally came in here to talk about the attacks on the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) that I have had to endure in this parliament. I have no particular brief for the minister one way or the other, but I know that he has one of the most complex jobs. For members of the opposition to get up here and attack the minister as though they expect him to be down there personally inspecting the planes himself is absolutely ridiculous. To put it bluntly, the honourable for Hume (Mr Sharp) has performed very badly in this regard. He had information from the CAA that he was not prepared to table. He took measures to get himself put on the civil aviation inquiry of the transport, communications and infrastructure committee, a very good committee of which I am a member. In these committee hearings, Mr Sharp is so far playing quite an intelligent part. He is asking sensible questions and is getting answers which would lead him to understand quite clearly the process that is taking place. The reality is that there are always going to be air crashes in this country and in every other country. The reality is that we have fewer in this country than most countries do. The only way that you can stop aeroplanes from crashing is to stop them from flying. That is simply an absurd notion. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) gave a sickening performance when he came in here with his heart on his sleeve and spoke about the loss of life. Yes, lives have been lost. It is a sad thing, particularly for the relatives of those involved. But to say that this is the responsibility of the minister is absolutely absurd. Quite frankly, short of going down there with a spanner in his hand and checking every aircraft, the minister could not have done any more. Yet, we have the Leader of the National Party saying that it is all because the minister has not been down to see the Civil Aviation Authority headquarters. What difference would that make? I cannot think of anything more irrelevant. This really goes to the heart of what is wrong with politics in Australia today, particularly with the Liberal Party. The party is devoid of policy direction, it is devoid of ideology and it is devoid of a sense of purpose. It is simply nitpicking. The problem in Australia though, as I have seen in my own state, is that you can get such a gale up with this sort of attack ad hominem-when you attack people not on the basis of the performance of their duty but on personal groundsand, with the media as it is in Australia, a MCCarthyist attitude is generated. I say to members of parliament and to the people of Australia that the minister, as minister of aviation, has done everything that one could reasonably expect a minister to do. He has behaved, in my view, with total probity in this area. The Liberal Party ought to start looking to real issues, rather than trying to drum up problems where they do not exist and trying to condemn a man who has done his job certainly as well as ministers of aviation in the past have done. (Time expired) Leader of the Opposition",133
352,Mr CHYNOWETH,BRENDA THORNE,"One of the things that makes me proud to be an Australian is the fact that real Australians are prepared to stand up and be counted when it matters most. Real Australians are prepared to put their hands up and say, 'I'll do it; it was my fault; I'll just shoot through when the need arises.' Real Australians do not look down at the ground shuffling their feet saying, 'It is too hard for me' or 'It was her fault, get rid of her.' It was therefore with a sense of sadness and pity that I read an article in the Financial Review a couple of weeks ago, which reported: A shakeup of the Federal Opposition leader's advisory staff is expected soon as Mr Downer tries to make a fresh start and put behind him the embarrassments to his leadership ... It went on to say: . .. changes were planned to ensure that Mr Downer received better quality advice on how to deal with politically sensitive issues and avoid undisciplined behaviour. When I read this article, I was appalled. Quite obviously the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) is just not up to the job. He cannot do it. Instead of putting up his hand and saying 'It was my fault; I will just shoot through, ' it is his advisers who are being forced out. The current Leader of the Opposition has squibbed it. What a disgrace! If the current Leader of the Opposition needs advice on how to deal with politically sensitive issues and how to avoid undisciplined behaviour, he should not be in politics in the first place. It is little wonder then that the article went on to say: . . . there are difficulties in attracting good quality staff as Mr Downer has already acquired the image of a loser. Even the people in the Liberal Party's organisational wing have written off the Leader of the Opposition. What a contrast with the mad scramble that went on recently with the eyeing off of the seat of Kooyong by the potential would be Liberal prime ministers. Nobody wants to work on the staff of the current Leader of the Opposition, but just about everyone in the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party stood for preselection. There is no hope for the current Leader of the Opposition-then again, there is no hope for the Liberal Party. Nobody could ever hope to successfully lead a political party which has been driven by arch-conservatives and pseudo small 'I' liberals snapping and biting at each other. To illustrate the point, I refer to an article in a journal entitled Options which appeared in June this year. The article was written by the current Leader of the Opposition, who said: Liberals have fought for . . . the task of building a tolerant and an orderly society based on the dignity of every individual Australian. . . How, then, can the current Leader of the Opposition, or the Liberal Party, condone or support the statements of the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) when he attacked the young Cathy Freeman for displaying her dignity as an Aboriginal Australian?",134

The amendment that I have circulated in assistance to people seeking or having to obtain Medical Review Council as to those to go before the VRB. Quite clearly, that is what the provision be the determinant. It could be that because about something that could consequently affect a minimal amount because the veteran would case in terms of arguing for an additional that the amount should be more, but we have VRB would now have this financial assistance, the Specialist Medical Review Council. It may be that, under the new rules of the simply because the SOPs are binding on the obviously.

It is an excellent idea to give some financial medical advice and for any travel associated minister, we will only move these amendments act-as is the rest of this bill-and they have with the Specialist Medical Review Council. I might point out to the minister that, government to expenditure, he has a one-line is to be found in Appropriation Bill (No.1), 195, item 4-03-which clearly could be applied government to alter its budget-just to find when one looks at $120 billion of expenditure, of the VRB, to applicants to the SMRC. It might be that the government is able to the Senate, or even today, that it will accept support of all members of the House of Representatives I will move our amendments in the consideration importance. I note the government's intention to introduce carer service pensioners and income support it, about $200. I am not sure that that is going the concept of giving financial assistance to the work force. I am wondering just how much in the right direction, so we are not opposing it. MAIN COMMITTEE 2567 substantiated if the government ensures that if of the veteran. That is the area of concern. and for reasons that the minister has announced, the government overlooked the newly established probably be used a lot less often than the my name today seeks to give the same financial medical evidence to go before that Specialist is there for and medical evidence would obviously of the significant nature of it-we are talking a lot of other veterans-that $425 would be probably have to mount an even more substantial SOP, for instance. There may be some argument suggested that whilst people appealing to the it should be extended to those appealing to VRB, medical evidence may not be so necessary, VRB-and there will be less medical debate, quite much medical evidence a veteran might still have be some, and it will cost the individual veteran assistance, both in terms of paying for the with that medical advice. As I have informed the in this House. They are amendments to the been inserted in the appropriate section dealing whilst an opposition generally cannot commit a item in his budget of $4.671 million-which under the schedule for Veterans' Affairs, division to this purpose. So we are not asking the what might be a very small amount of money to extend the government's generosity, in terms announce, prior to this matter being debated in our amendments and have them passed with the and/or the Senate.

But the government ignored government departments-were given a financial we like it or not, it is a fundamental of human Nevertheless, the $200 is a step in the right direction.

Greater competition in the provision of superannuation are crystal clear: Labor is looking after its to the provision of superannuation, the government in order to protect existing super funds and, superannuation. The ACTU has been a constant once again, to have exercised its veto. To date, community as the loser. To the ACTU and this government, it seems income policy, and more to do with industrial superannuation has taken little, if any, account capacity to pay, and it denies individuals the contributions should go.

Main Committee adjourned at 1.01 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: ABC Television: Captioning (Question No. 1288) Mr Taylor asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 9 June 1994: (1) To what extent are ABC TV programs captioned for the hearing impaired. (2) Will the ABC TV news at 7 p.m. be captioned; if so, when. (3) What budgetary provision has been made for captioning in 1994-95 and ensuing years. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Supertext subtitles have been available on selected ABC programs and some purchased BBC programs since 1983. In total, the ABC now broadcasts on average 20 hours of subtitled programs per week. In order to provide a balance of subtitled programs, during any given week, the ABC aims to provide at least two hours of young people's programs, one arts program, one documentary, one drama, the Wednesday special, one religious program and a movie. Australian material is a priority. ABC TV's Late Edition News introduced supertext subtitles on 27 August 1990. (2) The ABC and the Australian Caption Centre have and will continue to investigate cost effective options for the supertext subtitling of this service. However, as the ABC produces seven separate state based 7 p.m. news broadcasts each day, the logistics and costs are significant (3) The Department of Human Services and Health has advised that Budget funding provided to the Australian Caption Centre (ACC) in 1994-95 on a recurrent basis will be as follows: ABC Late News Sub-titling-$116,768 Video Captioning Project-$114,198 TOTAL-$230,966 This level of funding provided to the ACC under the Disability Services Program is on-going and indexed for inflation. NA The ABC will maintain the level of funding provided to the Australian Caption Centre for 199495 at $500,000. Both the ABC and the Australian Caption Centre are continuing to examine technological and other methods which may lead to increased output of subtitled product. Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre (Question No. 1293) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 27 June 1994: (1) Will reduced funding of CSIRO between 1994 and 1997 affect the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre; if so, how. (2) Will adequate funds be provided between 1994 and 1997 to enable the Centre to continue its work. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) In 1993-4, CSIRO provided funding of $326,000 to the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre's core budget and intends to maintain this level of funding throughout the triennium from 1994-5 to 1996-7. (2) The majority of funds for the Centre come from non-Commonwealth Government sources. While the CSIRO intends to maintain its funding support, the ability of the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre to continue its research at the current level will depend on the Centre's success in attracting research grants and continued funding from the Centre's other partners. The Commonwealth provides funds for the Centre's core budget through three bodies. In addition to the CSIRO, the Commonwealth contributes to the Murray Darling Basin Commission and the Albury-Wodonga Development Commission. The Murray Darling Basin Commission will provide $530,000 in 1994-95 (compared to $520,000 in 1993-94) and the Albury-Wodonga Development Commission will provide $394,000 in 1994-95 (compared to $390,000 in 1993-94). Occupational Safety and Health: International Labour Conference (Question No. 1383) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) Did the International Labour Conference in June 1981 adopt Convention No. 155Occupational Safety and Health. (2) Did the former Prime Minister of Australia assure the conference in June 1983 that his Government had committed itself to ratifying the convention as a matter of priority. (3) Did the convention enter into force on 11 August 1983. (4) On what dates, in what circumstances and with what results has the federal Government consulted with the States and Territory governments on ratification of the convention. (5) Did the Assistant Treasurer on 23 May 1994 refer Australia's approach to occupational health and safety to the Industry Commission for inquiry and report within 12 months. (6) Is ratification of the convention being deferred until the Industry Commission's report is received.",178

(4) The proVISion of detailed information on every instance of consultation with State and Territory governments would take considerable time, both to retrieve older files from Archives and to search and analyse all of the relevant files. interests of a prompt response and conserving resources, the following is a summary of the latest position in relation to each State and Territory. The Convention was identified by the Conference of Commonwealth and State Labour Ministers in 1984 as appropriate for consideration for ratification. Western Australia formally agreed to ratification on 28 August 1989. South Australia formally agreed to ratification on 25 February 1991. Queensland formally agreed to ratification on 26 April 1991. Victoria formally agreed to ratification on 8 July 1992. The Australian Capital Territory formally agreed to ratification in September 1992. New South Wales has to resolve some issues of interpretation before being in a position to consider providing formal agreement to ratification. The Northern Territory considers that it complies, and may be able to agree to ratification shortly. Tasmania has identified two relatively minor compliance problems, which should be overcome when relevant new legislation is adopted. At a meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory officials to discuss ILO matters on 2 September 1994, several jurisdictions sought confirmation from the Commonwealth on the interpretation of one of the provisions of the Convention. Officials in my Department are examining the matter. (5) Yes. The Assistant Treasurer, under Part 2 of the Industry Commission Act 1989, referred Australia's approach to occupational health and safety to the Industry Commission for inquiry and report within twelve months of receiving the reference, dated 23 May 1994. The Assistant Treasurer has since extended the reporting date by two months to 23 June 1995. (6) No. It is usual practice for Australia not to ratify an ILO Convention until all relevant jurisdictions (Commonwealth, State and Territory) have established compliance with the provisions of the Convention, and all relevant governments have formally agreed to ratification. Furthermore, consultations with the peak employer and worker organisations (the ACCI and the ACTU) are carried out before ratification is undertaken. At this stage, five governments have formally agreed to ratification and the peak employer and worker organisations have indicated support for the Convention. If the remaining governments agreed before the Industry Commission's report was finalised, the Commonwealth would see no reason In the to delay commencement of the procedures for ratification.
