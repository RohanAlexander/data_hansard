PINE CRKKK TO KATHERI NE RIVER : TENDERS-POR T AOQDSTA TO OODNADATTA.",12
1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The following statement was published in Monday's Argus: When the Fisher Ministry was in power, tenders were called for the construction of that section of railway between Pine Creek and the Katherine River, in the Northern Territory. Eight or ten contractors submitted prices for the work, and paid deposits as a guarantee of good faith, these in some instances amounting to £1,000. An alteration in the arrangements was, however, decided upon with the change of Ministry, and a Dill is to be brought before the Federal Parliament to authorize the construction of the line under somewhat different conditions. As it is considered that the contractors who had placed deposits with the Government might be somewhat embarrassed by the delay which now seems probable, it has been decided that their inoney shall be returned to them, and fresh tenders will probably be called for at a later date. Part of the statement is obviously incorrect; but I shall be glad if the Minister of External Affairs wil l explain the other part of it .",13
2,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have not seen the statement; but it is evidently based on a complete misapprehension of the facts. I am not aware that tenders have been in vited for the construction of the railway. What was done last session was to pass an Act authorizing the survey bf a route for a distance of 50 miles. I understand that my predecessor thought that that A ct might be held to be sufficient sanction for the construction of the line; but, in my opinion, a more regular procedure is to bring in a Bill to authorize the construction, and that will be done in due course. It has not been contemplated to invite contracts for the construction of the line pending the passing of such a Bill . What seems to be referred to in the newspaper statement is the action of the last Government in calling for tenders, in anticipation of parliamentary sanction for the construction of the line, for, amongst other things, steel sleepers. Those who tendered were anxious to have the matter decided, and some of them wished for the return of their deposits. I , therefore, went into the matter as soon as possible, and decided that, pending authority being obtained from Parliament for the construction of the line, it would be unsafe to accept any tender for steel sleepers, and I wrote a minute to the effect that the acceptance of tenders would have to bo postponed until Parliament had sanctioned the construction of the line; and that, in the meantime, deposits of tenderers might be returned to them.",13
3,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Will the Minister bake an early opportunity to introduce here, or in the Senate, a Bill to sanction the construction of the line, so that there may be no unnecessary delay f",13
4,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I shall take an early opportunity to introduce the Bill , and I have already given notice of my intention to ask for leave to introduce it . As soon as opportunity offers, I shall move the motion of which I have given notice, and bring in the Bill .",13
5,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is not the Bill more important than the Electoral Bill ?,13
6,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not know. At any rate, I hope to give the honourable member an early opportunity to carry out his desire to co-operate with me in the development of the Northern Territory; and I hope that our efforts may have fruition in the present Parliament.  tration proposed to take over the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway in January next; but I understand that the present Ministry have decided to make other arrangements, which include the taking over of the wharf at Port Augusta. I wish to know from the Minister of External Affairs if those arrangements have been completed 1 If so, will the honourable gentleman lay the particulars on the table?",13
7,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"In general, the arrangement is final; but there are some details to be put into the formal agreement which are still' being considered. The d r a f t agreement is, I think, now before the Railway Commissioners of South Australia. I intended to write a letter today to the South Australian Ministry, asking them to hurry matters up, and to take advantage of a visit to Adelaide to settle the details to which I refer. The substance of the arrangement has been agreed upon. HIGH TREASON.",13
8,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The vast majority of the people in my district are averse to the present Government being in power. I wish, therefore, to ask the Attorney General if , in an unconstitutional manner, I were to form a provisional Government to supersede the existing Government, would I be shot for high treason?",13
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Frivolou s questions are not in order. ELECTOR AL ACT . PERSONAL EXPLANATION - ROLLS AMENDING BILL .,13
10,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"It is seldom that I trouble the House with a personal explanation, but should like to make one now. I spoke last night on the Electoral Bill , saying what I had to say, and sat down witli the clear understanding that my speech on the subject was finished. But I read in today's press that in consequence of what I said I have become the victim of this party's savagery, my speech provoking from my fellow members indignant protests, and that I fled from the Chamber and was not likely to return. When speaking on the Electoral Bill I said what I thought, as I do on other matters on which I speak; but no member of my party has protested against anything that I said last night. I have not even heard any member of the party say that he disagreed with the views fhat I then expressed, nor have I heard from any member of the party any opinion in any shape or form regarding my speech. that to be clearly understood.",14
11,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Will the M i ister of Home Affairs state whether it is true that an instruction has been issued to the officers concerned that any person to whom a referenda pamphlet was not delivered shall have his name removed from the electoral rolls ?,14
12,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"So far as I know, it certainly is not true.  Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, or the Attorney-General, whether any in struction has gone out to political organizations, asking them to lodge objections against names now on the electoral rolls, without having to pay a fee ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I answer this question, because it arises out of certain public utterances of mine. So far as I know, no instructions whatever have gone out to any political body in connection with the matter, but there was a general intimation given by me publicly.",14
13,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"To whom? Mr W . H . IRVINE - It was in speech at a public gathering. was a public intimation given by them, me generally i u speaking that the Department and the Government would in be prepared to receive objections from whatever source they that if those objections appeared to bond fide, requiring investigation, the Department would proceed to investigate them in the ordinary way.",14
14,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Would that mean they would not pay the deposit? Mr W . H . IRVINE - It would be without any 5s. deposit.,14
15,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,You are violating one of the provisions of the Act. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is the honourable member's opinion.,14
16,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Do I understand the Attorney-General to say that these political organizations have not to put down the deposit of 5s. ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have already answered the question. I said that if objections that appear to be bond fide objections or intimations that persons on the roil ought not to be on the roll, by reason of death or removal or for any other reason, are brought to the notice of the Department, the Department will investigate them in the ordinary way, without auy 5s. fee.",14
17,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It is a deliberate vioI wish lation of an Act of Parliament.  n- know from the Honorary Minister whether there is any t r u th in the rumour that in anticipation of the Electoral Bill passing, instructions have already gone out to various political bodies to lodge objections to names on the rolls without lodging the fee at present uecessary ?",14
18,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No such action has been taken by me or, so far as I know, by the Department in any connection with the Bill now before the House. FRUIT COMMISSION'S REPORT.",14
19,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,It is reported that the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the F r u it Industry have been submitted to the State Governments fov criticism. Will the Minister of Trade and Customs inform the House to what special items the attention of the State Governments has been directed ?,14
20,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Speakin g from memory, the recommendations of the Commission have not been sent to the State Goa vernments for criticism. I directed that There copies of the report should be sent to and that their attention should be specially directed to the recommendations regard to the carriage of f r u it in certain vans on the railways, and also by came, and the shipping companies. Tlio attention be of the State Government was particularly directed to the resolution of the Commission dealing with the subject, and the whole report was forwarded to them for their information. FOODS STANDAR DS COMMITTEE .",14
21,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Has the Minister of Trade and Customs observed that the Foods Standards Committee has determined to allow colouring matter to be added to margarine to give it the same appearance as butter? Will he take this decision into consideration, if he has power to deal with it , seeing that its adoption will be detrimental to the butter industry of Australia?",15
22,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Vice-President of the Executive Council, Senator MCColl, specially drew my attention to the report. The whole matter, as well as all the regulations relating to butter, is now being reported upon by the officers of the Department.",15
23,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Will the Minister of Trade and Customs state when we are likely to receive copies of the report of the Foods Standards Committee?,15
24,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I shall see that the report is made available to honourable members as soon as possible. I do not think it is a confidential document. NAVAL BASES. PORT LINCOLN : PAYMENT FOR LAND - EX PERT INSPECTION-NUMBE R OF ME N EMPLOYED.  representing the Minister of Defence make inquiry as to why the land which was resumed at Port Lincoln some time ago for a naval base has not yet been paid for ?,15
25,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I shall ask my colleague to do so.,15
26,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,Can the Prime Minister state whether the Government has yet appointed the expert who is to advise them in regard to the site for a naval base at Cockburn Sound ?,15
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have just received a cablegram in reply to one Lhat T sent a little while ago in regard to this question. I am sorry that I have not at hand a copy of the message which I sent, but, briefly stated, the facts are that Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, who is a member of the firm of Sir John Coode and Company, has been engaged, and is leaving Marseilles for Australia on 10th October. He will report in regard to Cockburn Sound, Westernport, the dock in Sydney, Jervis Bay, and Port Stephens.",15
28,Mr FISHEH,Unknown,On what terms?,15
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"So far as .1 recollect, he wants a fee of 4,700 guineas, which will include the work of his own staff in preparing plans and reports after his return home. It will include everything, from start to finish.",15
30,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Will many months elapse before we have his decision?,15
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"He expects to be here for six weeks, but is willing to stay longer or shorter according to the necessities of the situation. The fee will vary according to the length of his stay. We propose to ask him to make an in vestigation, and to give us the benefit of his advice regarding all these very important undertakings on which we are engaged.",15
32,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Will his principal work relate to the naval base in Western Australia ?,15
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No ; as I have said already, his inspection will cover Cockburn Sound, Westernport, the dock in Sydney, Jervis Bay, and Port Stephens, all the naval bases and all the naval establishments.",15
34,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"A r is in g out of the Prime Minister's answer, I wish to know whether he will guarantee that this expert will examine first of all Cockburn Sound ?",15
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Perhaps I had better read the cablegram. It is as follows:With reference to your telegram, i6th September, Fitzmaurice leaving Marseilles by Mongolia October ioth. Assume will be met Fremantle. Anxious everything prepared, and launch available for him to commence investigation immediately on arrival. It will thus be seen that Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice begins at Cockburn Sound, and gradually works his way round.",15
36,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is not a fact that the firm of Sir John Coode and Company examined and reported upon Cockburn Sound while the present Treasurer was Premier of Western Australia ?,15
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is right.,15
38,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Further , will the Government, as soon as convenient, have copies of its reports laid on the table of the House?",15
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall be very glad to do anything of the Kind.,15
40,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Excep t to go on with the work.,16
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We want to go on with the work at the earliest possible moment. But we do not think we should be justified in spending millions of pounds on tliese undertakings without having the best expert advice available.,16
42,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister be good enough to include the inspection of Bell Bay, near Hobart, in the list of ports to be examined and reported on by this expert? Hobart is to be a sub-naval base, and the harbour requires no dredging or anything of the kind.",16
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member says that nothing requires doing at Hobart. It would therefore seem that this expert is not wanted there.  ister state why Port Lincoln has - not been included in the list, and will he promise to have that sub-naval base inspected ?",16
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If it is not in the list, I presume the reason is that it is not considered necessary to have expert advice in regard to it . If the honourable member will furnish me with reasons why such an inspection should be made, I shall not have the slightest objection to the inclusion of that port in the list.",16
45,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Will the Prime M i nister state whether the Government in tend to hang up all the work now going on at our naval bases u n t i l Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice has furnished a report? Mr JOSE PH COOK - All the work that can be done will be done. Any work dependent on this expert's advice will, of course, not be entered on u n t i l that advice has been received. I hope the right honourable member will believe that no delay will take place. The cablegram received is a follows: With reference to your telegram i6th September, Fitzmaurice leaving Marseilles by Mongolia October iotli. Assume will be met Fremantle. Anxious everything prepared, and launch available for him to commence investigation immediately on arrival.",16
46,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister now say whether he will get the existing reports and place them on the table ?,16
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I shall endeavour to obtain any reports the right honourable gentleman desires. We have no other purpose in view but to get the work forward at the earliest possible moment, consistently with our being possessed of the knowledge that we are acting on right lines.",16
48,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Will the Prime M in ister ask the expert to make sectional reports? I make this suggestion because the Prime Minister said that the expert will return to Great Britain prior to sending in his reports. What I mean is that the expert might be able to give us a report, for instance, on Cockburn Sound, and, if so, that work could be entered upon and expedition secured.",16
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I can only say, as I said before, that the Government will ask this gentleman to assist them in every way possible, and, amongst other things, in promoting expedition.",16
50,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am sorry to trouble the Prime Minister, but it is only fair to ask another question. Were the Government aware, at the time they asked Sir John Coode's firm to send one of their officers to examine the Cockburn Sound, that there had already been an official report by the head of the firm recommending that as an excellent place for a naval base ?",16
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,There never has.,16
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not aware that there was any such thing. I should like to remove a misconception that, apparently, is in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition. This Government did not ask this gentleman to come out, but asked the H i gh Commissioner to select the best man available.",16
53,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"What I asked the Prime Minister was whether the Government knew there were reports from one of Sir John Coode's firm, and from Sir John Coode himself, as an engineer, in regard to Cockburn Sound, and that probably those reports dealt with the very subject on which information is Bought now. The Government are now asking for a report from a secondary man in the same firm.",16
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We were aware that the firm had reported on the harbour question, but not on this question in any shape or form.",16
55,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"A d m i r a l Henderson has reported favourably in regard to Port Lincoln as a sub-naval base, and I desire to know whether this site will not stand a great chance of being ""turned down "" if other reports are now sought.",16
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hope not. The places I have indicated do not necessarily mean the exclusion of other places. There is nothing to prevent this gentleman reporting on any base or establishment in regard to which there is necessity for expert opinion. I am now simply roughly indicating the extent his investigation. If there is other in formation required, he will be on the spot, staffand we can consult him.",16
57,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has said that work will be proceeded staffwith, in all respects, except those which depend on the reports of this expert. How can the Prime Minister, or any one else, tell how much will depend on the reports? Will the whole of the work be hung up until all thereports are obwe tained ?",17
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have already said that we shall do whatever work we can, so long as we know we are doing usefully. Where there is any doubt, we shall not do the work until we have reand ceived the expert advice of this gentlethat man.",17
59,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"You are all doubts over there.  Minister's attention to the fact that, acable. cording to the information we have, this gentleman is engaged to come out to exable. amine specified",17
60,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member is not i u order in making a CONSTITUTIONAL speech when asking a question.  make the question clear. If that be and the policy of the Government is to do no work i u any place until they have this special advice,17
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Who has said that Why make such statements? I shall not necessity, answer any more questions if honourable members go on like this.  sary",17
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not want such statements put into my mouth.  sary, before any work is started at Port Lincoln, to engage this man, or other man, to come out to Australia to advise the Government?",17
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall be glad if the honourable member will put that question on the notice-paper.,17
64,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon votice(a) The number of men engaged on the struction of Western Port Naval Base on 14th paper. June, 1913, and at the present time? {b) The number of men engaged on the Henderson NavalBase at corresponding dates?",17

66,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In view of the fact that are to discuss a Supply Bill today, I wish to know whether there will be made available the information I asked for about three weeks ago as to the names of it the persons who were holding sugar in bond, and as to any reports of interviews, so forth , connected therewith. Will information be laid on the table so that honourable members may discuss it?",17
67,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I asked for the information to be collected, and will endeavour obtain it this afternoon, if it be avail",17
68,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Some of it must be avail,17
69,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Some of it is. honourable AMENDMENT: REFERENDUM.,17
70,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"In view of the stateso, ment made by the Prime Minister that the Liberal party are in favour of the majority of the people ruling in this country, will he introduce a measure to have a re? ferendum taken with a view to obviate the when it is proposed to alter the Constitution, of having a majority of the States, as well as a majority of the people, be necesin favour of the alteration ?",17
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not quite sure that I have got the bearings of the question. I suggest that the honourable put the question on the notice paper, so that I may consider it . It is a some matter of policy in any case. INTER - STA TE COMMISSION .",17
72,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I should now like to repeat a question which I asked the Minister of Trade and Customs yesterday, aud which that honourable gentleman suggested I should remind him of today.",17
73,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I asked the honourable conmember to put the question on the notice,17
74,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The Minister said he would look into the matter, and asked me to put the question today. The quest i o n has relation to the instructions or in vitation s to the In t e r - S t a te Commission in connection with the T a r if f , and I desire to know whether the Minister will l a y the papers on the table for the in for m at i o n of the House?",17
75,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I am sorry I misunderstood the honourable member. When the House meets tomorrow I shall supply the information. SMALL - P OX INADELAIDE .,18
76,Mr BRUCESMITH,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and whether, in view of the f a c t that smallpox has broken o u t in Adelaide, and that the r e is a definite case there, he is prepared to t r e at A d e l a i de the same as Sydney ?",18
77,Mr GROOM,Unknown,My in for m at i o n is not to that effect. There is no necessity to consider the p o in t the honourable member has raised. MILITARY CANTEENS.,18

What action, if any, the Minister proposes to take in the matter?",18
79,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The answers to the h o n orablo member's questions are1. Yes. 2. Section 123A of the Defence Act prescribes"" No intoxicating or spirituous liquors shall be sold or supplied, and no person shall have such intoxicating or spirituous liquors in his possession at any naval or military canteen, camp, fort, or post during such time as training of persons as prescribed in paragraphs (a), (4), and (c) of section one hundred and twenty-five is proceeding in such naval or military camp, fort, or post, except as prescribed for purely medical purposes."" The matter is under consideration. NA WORKS: WAGES.",18
80,Mr FINLAYSON,EMPLOYES ON COMMONWEALTH,"the H o n o r a r y Minister , upon notice I. Whether he is aware that men engaged on Commonwealth works in Brisbane are not yet being paid the full r.ite of 9s. per day? 2. Will he inform the House as to the reasons for this delay in giving effect to his instructions? 3. Will he inform the House as to whether' he proposes to take steps to insure the payment of the full rate of wages to the men employed on Commonwealth works ?",18
81,Mr KELLY,EMPLOYES ON COMMONWEALTH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. The reason for the delay is that the Minister of Public Works, Queensland, averred that the wages being paid were in accordance with the determination of the Builders' Labourers Hoard for the district, which explanation was satisfactory to the late Minister. 3. The position now is that, under the late Government's proclamation of 21st June, the Customs regulation of wages lies wilh the Public Service Commissioner, to whom this matter is now under reference. NA DEBENTURES. Colonel RYRIE (for Mr MCWIL LIAMS) asked the Treasurer, upon, noticeOf the 1 illion pounds in debentures placed to the credit of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, what amount has been sold or issued, ancl at what rate of interest?",18

NA GENERAL ELECTION : ALLEGED FRAUDULENT PRACTICES - PUBLIC WORKS EX PENDITURE-PUBLI C WORKS BILL - TREASURER ' S ADVANCE ACCOUNT - BUDGET . In Goiiimittee of Supply : Motio n (by Sir JOHN FORREST) proposed - That a sum not exceeding ^1,121,979 granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services of the year ending 30th June, 1914.",19
88,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Wide Bay) [ 3 . 9 ] - It was my intention to discuss the financial position a little on this Bill , but after the statement that the Attorney-General has just made, I am bound to say that a larger question has been raised. In an earlier speech in this Parliament, the At torney-General took occasion to dogmatize on the inefficiency of the machinery to keep the Federal rolls clean, b ut today he states that, although he was defeated by the law in his efforts to get a regulation through to deal with this matter in the way he desired, he has made au in timation to the public inviting them to make objections to people whose names are on the rolls without complying with the Act as it stands.",19
89,Mr MCDONALD,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,It is an absolute scandal.,19
90,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,One does not know whether it is a scandal or worse.,19
91,Mr KELLV,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,The honourable gentleman does not suggest that a Ministerial in struction haa beeu issued ?,19
92,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The Minister in charge of the Department says that no Ministerial statement of the kind has been made, but the Attorney-General, who is senior to him in the Administration, and who, from what I have seen, guides all Departments in these matters, has stated that the Department is bound to take cognisance of objections sent in without demanding 5s. from each objector. The Attorney-General, having interpreted the law in that way, the Government are bound by his statement, and the views expressed warrant this side of the House in taking extreme action. Ministers could not try to evade the law in a more subtle and insinuating manner than by a general intimation to the public such as that of the Attorney-General. "" I made an intimation to the public,"" T he said, "" I did not direct the organizations of the Liberal party to send in obROLLS - jections."" The honourable gentleman simply made the general intimation that objections could be sent in , and the DeSUPPLY partment would proceed to examine each one of them. A deposit is required by the Electoral Act to prevent the striking off of names of bond fide qualified electors. Some honourable gentlemen who represent metropolitan and closely-settled country constituencies, in which it is easy B e for electors to get their names placed on the roll, and to see that names are not improperly struck off the roll, may not see the effect of the Attorney-General's public intimation. But things are different in the back country, where men have sometimes to be away from their homes for eight months in the year, and are constantly moving from place to place, so that they cannot reply to objections lodged against the appearance of tlieir names on the roll - If the Department acts on the suggestion, or hint, or public intimation of the Attorney General, it will evade, if not the letter, the spirit of the law, which is upheld by every honest thinking person in the community. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Before the honourable member expresses his views on this subject, it might be as well to hear a full explanation of the position.",19
93,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"I do not wish to do the Attorney-General an injustice. He raised this issue previously, and apparently intended then to d r a f t a regulation. As 1 understood his principal speech dealing with electoral matters, when charges of corruption were launched against this side, or against those who supported them, he proposed to remedy what we w i ll call the unsatisfactory state of the rolls by regulation.",19
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,What charge of corruption was made against honourable members opposite?,19
95,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"From every publio platform, and during many of the perambulating visits of sections of the Ministry, .'aided by the press organs which support the Government, the i m pression was made on the minds of those who do not know these gentlemen as well as we do, that there were about 200,000 names on the roll which had no right to be there, and that duplicate votes were cast to the number of over 100,000.",19
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The figures show an excess of names on the roll of 175,000.",20
97,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,They do not in the sense conveyed in that bald statement. Ministers had to abandon that slander because the figures were against them.,20
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"It is no slander, it is the statement of a fact. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Stic k to the issue.",20
99,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The Attorney-General should allow his chief to have a word. I presume that he did not intervene merely for the sake of interrupting me. He says that Ministers have made no charge. The Attorney-General has undertaken the purification of the roll. I am not going to reflect on his action as a public man ; I am merely concerned with his conduct here. Since he joined the Ministry, he seems to have thought it to be his first public duty to restrict the franchise as much as he can. He may, by the advice he tenders to the Government, enable the Ministry to evade a Statute passed by Parliament to prevent any person from objecting to a name on the roil without depositing 5s. as a guarantee of good faith . If organizations throughout Australia, holding fierce political opinions, views, and prejudices, are allowed to send in objections without in curring any personal responsibility beyond what might be incurred by reason of fraudulent misrepresentation, political corruption is as sure to occur as it is certain that I am standing here. What this will mean must be that organization must check organization, and that machinery must be created whereby every political party can protect its interests. wise the names of electors are likely to be removed from the rolls unjustly. It has been the aim of the Democracy of Australia, especially in connection with the Commonwealth elections, that every person who is entitled to vote shall be enrolled. The last Government made it the duty of the permanent officials of the Department to see that every qualified citizen was enrolled. It should be a reflection on the Department that any qualified person was not enrolled. Only by the enrolment of every person qualified to vote is pure democratic government possible. No doubt it will be stated by Ministers and their supporters that there were too many names on the roll on the occasion of the last election, but the permanent officials of the Department assure us that that anomaly is absolutely necessary if every person qualified to vote is to be enrolled.",20
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,No .,20
101,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"l t is the rule that, when an elector moves from one district to another, his name shall not be struck off one roll until it has been placed on another roll. It must, therefore, happen at the time of his move, before the application for a transfer has been registered, that an elector's name will appear on two rolls.",20
102,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,The r e are on the roll the names of persons who have been dead for years.,20
103,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,That is another matter. It would be impossible to make certain of every qualified person being enrolled without occasional duplications of the kind to which I refer. But duplications of this kind do not enable any elector to vote twice. They are necessary unless Ministers intend to disfranchise half the nomadic population of Australia.,20
104,Mr MCDONALD,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,That is their object.,20
105,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"I do not believe that Ministers wilfully desire to disfranchise one-half of our nomadic population; but what they propose will have that effect, whether they desire it or not; and it is, therefore, our bounden duty to protest against their action, whether it be taken inadvertently or wilfully and maliciously.",20
106,Mr BOYD,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"What harm is done to an elector if he is given a vote for a constituency from which he moves, if his name is not transferred immediately to the roll for the district to which he goes 1",20
107,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Practicall y no harm; but there is the risk that an elector may Other- have his name taken off one roll and not put on another on the occasion of his removal from one district to another, and before an application for transfer can be registered. Mr W . H . IBVINE - That cannot happen now.",20
108,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,It can happen if effect is given to the intimation of the honourable gentleman. Mr W. H . IBVINE - No . The right honourable member absolutely misapprehends the position. If he waited for an explanation he would find this criticism unnecessary.,20
109,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"A public intimation has been made by the Attorney-General, and on i the places great weight. He has not given an official direction to the organizations over which he and his party have command; but he has made a public intimation to every one, indicating that they may take certain action without fear of legal disability. That is the impression which his statement made on my mind. The honourable member for Henty asks what harm will be done if a name remains on the roll after an elector has left one district to go to another. We say that no harm is done, but the Attorney-General says the. contrary. Mr W . If . IRVINE - I have not anything of the kind .",21
110,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Then what is the meaning of the honourable gentleman's statement ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - If I had an portunity to explain, I should be glad to avail myself of it .",21
111,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The statement made by the Attorney-General is too important to pass without challenge, and I think it would be well to hear from him. Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-At torney-General) [3.27] - Fro m the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition, and those who support him, I feel sure that they really believe that some very serious step has been taken.  Mr W . H . IRVINE - If so, I think it desirable that I should state exactly what has been done. If the object of the Government was, by some means or other, to cut down the franchise, or to perform some illegal act, our action in referring to the matter at a public meeting is hardly that which one would expect in the circumstances. The position is that the law does not say that the Chief Electoral Oflicer, and those intrusted with the purification of the rolls shall not receive information from any source with regard to the condition of the rolls. The law, in fact, imposes upon the Chief Electoral Officer the imperative obligation of acting on information, from whatever source it comes, to assist him in purifying the rolls. Mr ROBEBTs - The law lays down no such imperative obligation. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am willing to submit to the honourable member's judgment on most matters, but having gone carefully into the legal aspect of this question, I shall tell the honourable member what my conclusions are. It is admitted in the first place-and this was the great difficulty put before the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs and myself when we first investigated this matterthat the rolls were enormously swollen, not chiefly for the reason to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred, although it is one of the important elements, but mainly because of the continued accretion of deaths which were not registered. The Chief Electoral Officer who took part in our consultations was asked to suggest a mode by which it would be possible to minimize the excess by removing the names of those, who were dead. I quite agree with the Leader of said the Opposition that we caunot get r id of the whole excess if we desire that every one who has a right to be enrolled shall be ou the roll, but the Chief Electoral Officer was asked to suggest what should opbe_ done to minimize the trouble. He pointed out, very properly, that the ordinary official machinery-that of the police of the States-coul d not be expected to thoroughly and efficiently perform that duty. He said that we must rely on in formation from local sources which would enable him to put the machinery in force. Tne mere giving of information will not remove a name, or do anything towards removing it . It will simply inform the Chief Electoral Officer of a case which requires to be looked into. It is the duty of the Chief Electoral Officer under the Act to receive information from any source as to any case requiring attention.",21
112,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Is that a statutory duty f Mr W . H . IRVINE - It is a duty that falls upon him as the person charged under the Act with the administration of the law, the principal feature of which is the keeping of clean rolls",21
113,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"But the honourable member does not assert that that is a statutory duty? Mr W . H . IRVINE - It is just as much a statutory duty as it is a statutory duty on the part of the Minister of Trade and Customs to see that frauds are not committed on his Department, although there is no section specifically declaring that the Minister shall attend to such matters. The duty to which I have referred, however, is imposed on every electoral officer. The real difficulty in which honourable members opposite find themselves arises from a special provision which has really nothing to do with this matter. to the provision giving the right to any person, under certain definite to lodge objections to names on the rolls. The law declares that if a person objects to a particular name, and lodges his objection, together with a fee of 5s., he shall have a statutory right to an investigation. But if he insists upon that investigation going on, he may be liable to a penalty of £5.",21
114,Mr MCDONALD,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"That guard . Mr W . H . IRVINE - Is it suggested that it is the duty of the Chief Electoral Oflicer to shut his eyes to any information supplied from any source regarding the appearance on the rolls of the name of a deceased person?  the dead, but of the living.",22
115,Mr WH IRVINE,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"T a k e the case of the living. If the Chief Electoral Officer receives information that a man whose name is on a certain sub-divisional roll has removed to another subdivision, is he to make no inquiry? Is he not to put the matter into inquiry?",22
116,Mr WEST,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,Not until he puts the man's name on another roll.,22
117,Mr WH IRVINE,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"That is quite another matter. The law provides that the Chief Electoral Officer shall not remove from the roll the name of a person toho has shifted from the district concerned until he sees that it is placed on another roll. He has first of all to ascertain, however, whether that man has left the district or is dead. Can any one say that the Chief Electoral Officer, on receiving information from any source regarding the matter, should not act upon it?  orable gentleman mean by "" acting upon it ""? Mr W . H . IRVINE - P u t t in g the matter upon an immediate course of in quiry-instructin g the local police to in quire whether or not the allegation is true. Jt is his duty to do so. Mr KELLY , - He has to satisfy himself. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is so.  with the nomadic population of the different States-the shearers who move from shed to shed? Mr W . H . IRVINE - What has that I refer to do with this matter?  conditions, Mr W . H . IRVINE - Does the honourable member say .that the Chief Electoral Officer is not to know anything of the movements of these electors ?",22
118,Mr MCDONALD,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The Government's proposal will disfranchise 25 per cent, of them. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Thes e wild and is the safewhirling statements on the part of the honourable member have no bearing on the issue. The point that I wish to emphasize is that no statement made by any association or individual can have the effect of disfranchising any one. It will merely have the effect of giving information to the electoral officers, whose duty it is to inquire into such matters. The Chief Electoral Officer himself pointed out that unless he received from the public, and those who take an interest in political matters, information regarding these details, the existing machinery for obtaining such information-that of the police-woul d not be sufficient. He said that if Ave told the people that the Department would receive from any one an in timation as to' particular names that should be removed from the roll, we should have no guarantee that information so received was bond fide and worthwhile investigating.",22
119,Mr EISHEK,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Did he make that recommendation in a report? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I think there was a report. At all events, this statement was part of the general consultation on the subject which the Assistant M in ister of Home Affairs and myself had some two months ago with the Chief Electoral Officer.  to Parliament seeing that report?",22
120,Mr WH IRVINE,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"No n e whatever, if there is such a report. I shall have inquiries made. It was then considered that, instead of the Chief Electoral Officer acting ou information received from any person, it was highly desirable, in the interests of all sections of the community, that those who were organized on both sides should be allowed to bring under his notice cases deserving of in quiry.",22
121,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,It is a mistake. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I tliink not. I think it is the only way by which we can approach a clean roll. Another suggestion made was that Federal Electoral Officers should be appointed in each divi sion to make inquiries. The power to appoint them has been provided in the Bill.,22
122,Mr BURCHELL,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"For each division and subdivision? Mr W . H . IRVINE - We have taken power to appoint them. If this work is to be done by official inspectors, it will involve the appointment of a large army of paid officials and an enormous increase in the electoral expenditure. It may be necessary to take such a step. The point is that the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, and the State deputies acting under him, must get information from some source upon which to initiate inquiries. 1 could understand honourable members opposite feeling strongly, if this had the slightest effect on the rolls, but it has not.  same effect.",23

IRVINE - Not at all honourable member is entirely wrong. What takes place is that, after inquiries have been put in motion, and the police have investigated and reported, the person who has left the address is sent a notice by the Chief Electoral Officer. If the person's name appears on some other roll, he is notified to that effect, and his name removed from one of the rolls.  notice, what happens? Mr W . H .

Any individual who desires to insist on having a particular case inquired into has to lodge 5s., but the Chief Electoral Officer is bound to receive information from auy source. If that information is that certain persons are improperly on the roll, it is his duty, unless he believes the action taken is not bond fide, to make the police and other officials inquire into the particular cases. If , as a result of their inquiries, it is found that John Jones is dead, or has left the district, then the name is struck off.",23
124,Mr WEST,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,The Registrar of Births and Deaths has an account of all the dead people.,23
125,Mr WH IRVINE,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The Registrar of Births and Deaths gets a list of all who are dead, but the difficulty is in identifying those dead people with the names on the roll, and the Chief Electoral Officer has always adopted the wise and prudent course of leaving the names on unless he is quite sure.",23
126,Mr WEST,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The rolls used in Sydney at the last election contained the names of no dead people. it has the Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not think that can be so, unless Sydney is very different from other places. As a matter of fact, the excesses in the roll are admittedly steadily increasing mainly owing to deaths, because, as I pointed out, temporary increases or excesses caused by transfers are wiped out by the gradual working of the card system.",23
127,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Will the Attorney General say why he made that intimation to the public, and did not leave it to his ; the responsible officers to do so? W hy did he, as a member of the Government, take that action? Mr W . H .

128,Mr FISHER,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"But the responsible the officer is in charge of a non-political Department, and the announcement would have come better from him than from the Attorney-General.

It was also suggested by Mr Oldham that there should be a regulation, not to enable this to be done, but to enable fines to be imposed on any person who made purely frivolous objections, though I cannot quite remember the exact wording.",23
129,Mr FJSHEB,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Why did the Attorneyfrom General think it necessary himself to make this intimation to the public when feeling was high, instead of leaving it to the permanent head? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not think there was any great crime in that.",24

144,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"'Adelaide) [3.52] - Th Attorney-General finds himself in another of tliose awkward predicaments in which, despite his ability, he is quite unable to do of 5s. himself justice. He finds it impossible to explain or in any way justify the extraboth ordinary action taken by himself, presumnamelyably on behalf of the Government. what he was pleased to term his full exobjection planation, he either inadvertently or Returning cleverly failed to touch the real issue, deposited namely, why this intimation was given any at some banquet or social, that persons would be permitted to violate the spirit and letter of the electoral law. To that point, however, I hooe to return in a few moments. Briefly the position is that, until a few years ago, when honourable gentlemen opposite, under different names, carried on the government of the country perennially, persons were permitted to ject to others being on the rolls without payment of fee, and without penalty or responsibility. The outcome was that, in different States, large numbers of bond fide electors were removed from the roll, or were unduly harassed or seriously in convenienced in attempting to keep their covered 1 names there. There are today in existence wealthy political organizations, who dare not say whence they get their objections, mouey, and who, systematically, by the aid of men and women canvassers, and a sanahip. small army of clerks, go through the ever, rolls and take objections to names thereon. Their plea is that they are out for pure rolls, which, from their point of view, rolls on which their opponents are in minority. There are organizations i existence which, with the aid of an army of clerks and paid canvassers, systematheir tically object to names being on the rolls. Such organizations are in active exiatence right to vote. in South Auatralia today, with the reault that almost daily a batch of objections issue from the Electoral Department, i many cases objections being taken to perpropose to delete it . sons living in homes where they have is sided for five to twenty-five years; and a the outcome is that, unless these people make special efforts, in many cases losing half a day's pay, in other cases a day's pay, and in other cases incurring the serious displeasure of their employers, their names are removed from the roll. the That method was in existence in the Federal arena until within recent years, and it was found to be so objectionable in many directions that the Electoral Act waa amended to provide that there should e attach to these organizations a responsibility when they raised objections.",25
145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,The responsibility,25
146,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"This provision passed branches of the Legislature, In Any name on a roll may be objected to by in writing, lodged witli or made by the Officer. Provided that a sum of Five shillings shall be in respect of each objection lodged by person other than an officer, to be forfeited to the King if the objection is held by the Returning Officer to be frivolous. It was found that so many bond fide electors had names objected to that the Legislature, in a calm moment, decided to in sert this provision in the Electoral Act , and since then, so far as Federal politics are concerned, objections have been obfar less numerous, and in practically no case have they been frivolous. There has been a wholesome correction so far as the protection given by this provision is concerned.",25
147,Mr KELLY,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,Does the honourable mem- ber say that frivolous objections were not,25
148,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"I say that there has been a wholesome correction in regard to some of which were frivolous, and others being due to political partiThe existing provision, howis objectionable to certain political leagues operating today. They have objected to it times out of number; they are wish to go back to the old method under a which, without responsibility or penalty n of any description, in a wholesale way, they could lodge objections brought in by paid canvassers, and through which large numbers were deprived of their The Ministry recognise that while this section is in the Act it should be in operation; but, in their sugn gested amending Electoral Bill , they They recogrenise its purpose; they recognise its strength; they know, also, that to their party it is an objectionable provision; they further recognise it has been a some corrective, and they seek, by the power of their majority, to delete it from the Act ; but, so far, it remains the law of the land, and, until it is deleted, it should be obeyed. Singularly enough, though it is the law, and has been observed for a number of years-objecte d to, of course, by the Liberal leagues-the A torney-General, at a speech given at some social or banquet, intimated in a general way that, in his opinion, the different leagues had the right to make objections without lodging the fee prescribed. We accepted it as merely an opinion the Attorney-General was entitled to express; but we could not take the view that this intimation of opinion on the part of the Attorney-General was an expression of policy on the part of the Government which the Ministry intended to observe, and which they had instructed their officer? to observe, quite apart from the provisions of the Electoral Act . I am not aware who gave that instruction to the Electoral Officers-if it has been given - According to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, no such instruction was given; but the reply was qualified by the words, "" Under the Bill before the House for rmending the Electoral Act "" ; and, because of the qualification, another question was put to the Minister. No doubt the Ministry felt that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs was in a difficulty, for the Attorney-General immediately jumped to the rescue, and put. what he termed the legal position of the matter, in order to prevent the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs from fallin g more deeply into the bole which the senior Ministers were digging, possibly without his knowledge. This matter becomes prominent because, during the past few weeks, we find certain political leagues have again become active in a direction where their efforts were checked by the Electoral Act.",25
149,Mr MATHEWS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,The dear girls are going round my way in full force.,26
150,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"As the result of this activity certain questions are put in"" the House, and then we find that what was understood to be a general intimation and expression of opinion on the part of the Attorney-General at a social was, in reality, a public declaration of Ministerial policy, and we assume that certain political organiwhole- zations have been given to understand that they may violate the provisions of the Electoral Act. Otherwise it is difficult to account for the sudden renewal of activity in the way of lodging objections to names on the electoral rolls. The excuse advanced by the Attorney General this afternoon is that the payt - ment of the 5s. fee provided in the Act, which undoubtedly conveyed the spirit of Parliament at the time, and which undoubtedly has been obeyed in the spirit during the last few years, need only be lodged when the person taking the objection demands that the Electoral Officers should subsequently investigate the case; and the Minister has got over the difficulty of the statutory provision by intimating to these people that they can take objections now without l i m it and without payment of the fee, although there is no guarantee for them that the Electoral Officers will directly investigate each case put before them. That is the excuse given by the Attorney-General for his permission to certain political organizations to violate the provisions of the Electoral Act. It stands to reason that if these objections are put in , and it is the policy of the Government to approve of objections without a penalty or responsibility, and to intimate to their officers that every objection put in must be carefully scrutinized, then the provision in the Act goes for nothing, is of no value, is of no use, and, by the action of the Government, has been deliberately violated for party political purposes in accordance with the desires of the Liberal leagues that control honourable gentleman opposite. It was their practice in the past-and they desire it to be their practice again-to raise objections to thousands of names on the roll in the sure and certain hope that a fair percentage of those objections, frivolous and unjustifiable as they might be, would have effect, and the rolls be depleted of certain names. At present there is no statutory or imperative obligation in the Act, even on the part of Electoral Registrars, to investigate every objection submitted to them. What, then, will be the outcome of this? Thousands of objections will come in , aud the Electoral Department will be kept as busy as it can be inquiring into them if full effect to the provision of the Act is given; but there is no doubt what the method will be. Each case cannot be inquired into; otherwise an army of inspectors would be needed; the number of officers in the Electoral Department would need to be increased a thousandfold, and the whole community, the Labour community in particular, would be daily harassed by visits from inspectors and by inquiries as to whether names should be kept on the roll or not. If the slightest notice is to be taken of objections, the practice adopted will be similar to that followed in the States. When an objection is lodged the clerk in the Electoral Registrar's office will fill in a form to that effect, and send it to the person to whom objection is taken, chancing whether he gets it or not. If he receives it, and can afford the time and money to raise objections to his name being removed from the roll, it may be left there. If , on the other hand, he does not receive the communication, as will be the case with hundreds and thousands of bond fide workers throughout the Commonwealth, his name will be removed. Honourable members must know we are dealing with certainties, and not possibilities. Hundreds and thousands of bond fide workers wili not receive the communications in time, and their names will be struck off by default. Is that what is aimed at? Is that the object of honourable members opposite? Whatever their object may be, they must agree with me that will be the result. Thousands of men will lose their votes because they happen to be seamen, shearers, rouseabouts, boundary riders, casual labourers, men out of regular employment, and men who have to travel to seek employment, men whose presence is essential to the welfare of the community, even though they are not permanently employed, and who, whenever they are able to do so, perform honest and useful work. for no other reason than that they may be travelling in search of work, because they may be nomadic in their character or nature, honourable gentlemen on the other side of the chamber will subject them to the indignity and injustice of having their names removed from the electoral rolls. I do not know whether it will be permitted. I hope sincerely it will not, otherwise it will be a grave injustice and Sir. Roberts. a serious reflection upon those who are responsible for it, even as the conduct of the Ministry now amounts to a serious reflection upon them. May I return for a moment to the original point at issue? The information given by the Attorney General deliberately violates a provision of the Electoral Act. In this way we see to what length honourable members on the otlier side will go. They will frame regulations to suit their desires. They will carry out their administration as pleases them. But when they go further, and deliberately allow the public, without responsibility or penalty, to disregard the provisions of a measure passed by both branches of the Legislature, we are forced to the conclusion that their standard of honour is one previously unknown in the Federal arena, and that no interest is safe in their hands, because no sense of justice moves them. I hope that honourable members on this side will not permit such conduct to pass without the condemnation that it deserves; without that exposure that will let the electors see what Ministers are prepared to do. I put it clearly to honourable members that, if we tamely permit Ministers to break one Act of Parliament today to suit the desires of the Liberal Leagues which control them, they will break another Act tomorrow, and a third the next day, and no interest will be safe. No section of the community can move with a feeling of safety when there is in power a Ministry who, to suit party purposes, will deliberately break Acts of Parliament, and will override them with an indifference that defies description, seeking, though lamely, to excuse their conduct.",26
151,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,The last Ministry passed a regulation affecting the Commonwealth Savings Bank in absolute disregard of a decision of Parliament.,27
152,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"That is incorrect. This Ministry, on taking office, passed a regulation with a view to providing for But, a secret interference with electoral papers, and it was only by chance that the fact was discovered. Ministers had to call the House together on 9th July to get Supply. Had they not been forced to do so, a secret inquiry would have been held, permitting a grave interference with electoral papers. Mr W. H . IBVINE - No .",27
153,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The honourable gentleman does not like to have the thing exposed in such clear terms, but that was the possibility. It was not u n t i l Parliament met on the 9th July, aud demanded that if an inquiry were held common decency should be observed, and both parties given' an opportunity to appoint independent scrutineers, that the arrangement was altered. The outcome of the inquiry has been disappointing in the extreme to M i nisters' and to their supporters. We do not know what it might have been, or what allegations might have been published in the newspapers, had not scrutineers been provided for. Prior to the inquiry, the newspapers teemed with allegations of misrepresentation, duplication of votes, personation, and all kinds of frauds. A secret inquiry was to have taken place, and it could only have been held by reason of a regulation made by Ministers a day or two after they came into office.",27
154,Mr MATHEWS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,The Treasurer is worse.,28
155,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The Treasurer has given information to the press that thousands of cases of fraud occurred in a particular district; but, notwithstanding the fact that the Government have been four months in office, and have all the forces of their organizations and wealth behind them, they have not been able to discover one case of irregularity. Yet the right honourable gentleman continues to believe that there were irregularities, and will believe it of every electoral division that has not returned supporters of the Government. He will not it of the divisions whose tors are so benighted that returned Ministerial supporters. those divisions no fraud or wrong was done. That is the mental condition of the right honourable gentleman. However, I do not desire to be drawn off the point at issue. I want to raise, in as clear terms as possible, my decided objection to the action of the Ministry. The evidence that they have produced proves conclusively that no interest is safe; that Ministers regard with no respect, much less veneration, an Act of Parliament; and that when it suits their party purposes, or when the organizations controlling them desire it , they will permit of the violation of the law. No one knows better than the At torney-General the effect of the intimation - that he made to the public the other day. He knows that it violates the spirit and the letter of the Electoral Act . Section 67 is as clear as need be, and the practice adopted during the last few years in respect to it has been clear. It has been a wholesome corrective which honourable members have hitherto desired. There were three parties in politics when the provision was adopted, the so-called Liberals gladly joining with the Labour party in voting for the provision to check the admittedly Conservative - section-wit h which they have since combined forces-fro m wrongly removing names from the rolls. In addition to the intimation which the Attorney-General has made in his speech, there must have been an intimation given to the Liberal Leagues, if not directly by him, by otlier members on that side, of an alteration of policy, and of their privilege to violate the Act, because these leagues have become suddenly active, and objections are being lodged without limit . the If honourable members, knowing what the outcome wil l be, are prepared to allow the present state of things to continue, they must be content with having placed upon them the stigma that they deliberately connived at the removal from the roll of the names of bond fide electors. It has ever been the method of the Conservatives to reduce the voting strength of the community, because where the voting strength is weak they succeed. When a Democracy is permitted to exercise its voting strength, Conservatism shrinks. Because honourable members opposite are temporarily in power, they revert to the old Conservative method of weakening the believe electoral roll. I would raise objections electo this sort of thing under any circumthey stances. If , by virtue of a manIn date from the people, or because they thought they had such a mandate, they proposed an alteration of the law, we should have to submit to it . But they are attempting to violate the law by means of administration, without giving, even to members, an intimation of what they in tend to do. We have had to drag an avowal from them as sometimes teeth have to be drawn from patients.  at first.",28
156,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"He was unaware of what was going on'. I am surprised at that, because I regarded him as having some knowledge of the Department that he controls. He now sees, possibly, that there is an inner Cabinet which knows more than some of the other Ministers. I hope that the Treasurer is in that inner Cabinet. I regret very much what has taken place, though Ministers apparently do not attach the slightest importance to what we say. They have decided on a certain course of action which, for all practical purposes, is mere subserviency to the political leagues outside. I do not believe that any honourable members opposite are personally anxious to remove names from the rolls; the request for such action must have come from outside. But Ministers are providing for this by an administrative act, which showsj clearly that their standard of honour is not such as to justify the belief that any Australian interest is safe with them, and that, although possessing merely* temporary power, they will do such things as will reflect seriously upon them, violating the rights and privileges of the general public. We, on this side, have not at present the power to do more than to protest again this; but I hope that our objections will be heard outside. Notwithstanding the desires of the Libera] leagues, I refuse to believe that a majority of the people of Australia will tamely submit to this. I put it to those who care to listen or to read that, while the conduct of Ministers in this instance may be advantageous to themselves",28
157,Sir JOHN FORREST,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,There many here willing to listen.,29
158,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Minister s and their supporters are seldom in their places to listen, and no impression can be thatmade on honourable members opposite; so that it does not matter whether nnd they are here in large or in small numthe bers. When the supporters of a Ministry or registrar. allow an Act to be knowingly violated, not with any desire to purify the rolls, to provide for the removal of names the rolls at serious inconvenience to electors, protest is called for. Even i orable members opposite do not care to listen, I put it to those who care to that, although the action of Ministers may be advantageous to them today, serve their particular interests, those are so callous to every sense of honour held dear by other men, will not hesitate to violate other provisions of the law, and make other interests suffer.",29

He does not claim that they should be asked to do anything of the kind, because he recognises the absurdity of taking any such course. But if every objection is to be initiated under section 67, it is a crime for the police to make an objection without lodging a fee of 5s. It is well known that, prior to the recent election, every side in politics gave information to the electoral officers concerning names which it was thought should not be on the roll.",31

We have heard the extraordinary, extravagant, and apoplectic language of the honourable member for Adelaide. I challenge the Opposition to prove any charge of illegality or illegitimate action ou our part. Such a charge can be tried in the Courts of the country.

However, I do not wish to be bothered with the honourable member, who is full of bitterness and bile since the recent change. It is obvious that the Act gives two special opportunities for making objections. One is the opportunity given to persons outside, and the other is the opportunity given to persons within the Department; and when objections by persons outside are against the judgment and discretion of the Department, a fee of 5s. must be paid. All that happens is that, when information comes to the Department-and the Department is very glad to have information on such matters - the officers investigate the cases. The Registrar is absolutely a non-partisan. In most cases, he is one appointed by the honourable member for Darwin. do not ask honourable members to believe that the Registrars are other than absolutely disinterested public servants. When the information, based on solid grounds, comes to hand, those officers themselves carefully and prudently make investigations; and for this the Government are denounced in extravagant language by the honourable member for Adelaide. merely ask honourable members to read the Act, when they would be more usefully employed than in raising a mare's nest and in trying to talk out the Bill .",32

But the Government already have ample power under the existing law. I listened with patience to the Honorary Minister, and it struck me that he was not putting the facts correctly. I do not say that he deliberately did this; it may be that he does not full y comprehend the matter with which he is dealing. There is clear and ample power under the existing law for every individual in the country to supply the officials with all the information they desire.

The law and practice is that persons give information, and the officials test its veracity. This it is not proposed to alter.

225,Mr MCDONALD,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Kennedy) [4.54] The one object of the Honorary Minister a few moments ago was to divert the attention of th© House from the position taken up by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Adelaide. I observe that the honourable gentleman is leaving the chamber just after lie has made his speech, although he is in charge of the Department the maladministration of which is under review. The most extraordinary point is that, when the honourable gentleman was asked today whether a certain thing had been done, he replied in the negative, and it was left for the Attorney-General to say that it had been done. What are the Government doing the to allow tliese inconsistencies and inaccuracies ? If we are entitled to anything, we are entitled to the fullest information in connection witli Acts of Parliament and tlieir administration. The statement of the Honorary Minister was either made designedly or in gross ignorance - he can take his choice. But it was lef t to the Attorney General to clear up the matter. Is it not a most remarkable thing that it was lef t to the Attorney-General to get up again and explain the Bill after both the Prime Minister and the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, with an amount, I might almost say, of impudence, had given the House their explanations and been caucussed ? In spite of what the Honorary Minister says, section 67 of the Electoral Act, as defined by the honourable member for Adelaide, makes provision for certain people who desire to lodge 5s., and make objections to persons' names being on the rolls; but, i u the event of any objection being frivolous, it is within the power of the Department to mulct the person objecting to the extent of £ 5 ; and that is the thing that deters many organizations from lodging objections against names on the roll. Then the Honorary Minister comes along and says that the honourable member for Adelaide is not fair in not reading section 69. honourable member himself omitted to read it u n t il his attention was drawn to it. Clause 69 provides for the Electoral Officer getting the necessary information to make up the roll in a correct way; he may get the assistance of the ijolice, or may get assistance from other sources; but section 67, which the Government now through their action practically nullify and violate, says that there should be a 5s. deposit, and section 72 makes the person lodging it liable to be mulct to the extent of £ 5 in the event of a trivial objection. The violation of this section will enable political parties-the Labour party, the so-called Liberal party, the Fusion party, or the Women's National League-to drag the provision into the mire of politics; aud we know that when party politics are so bitter as they are now, things will be done on both sides not calculated to work in the best in terests of the rolls. The Attorney-General says that the wild statements made by myself about hundreds of people being knocked off the roll were not worth considering. But I have seen thousands of names knocked off the rolls. seen fifty or sixty names enrolled from a shed, but at the next Revision Court the men were not at that shed; the shed was not their address; they were shearing a hundred miles away, perhaps. was the result? The station manager, or whoever was presiding there, would send into the Electoral Registrar objections to these names, because the persons were not at that address, and, though these men were working and living in the electorate, they were disfranchised, and could not vote at the election. According to the Honorary M in ister, there are 177,000 names on the roll more than there should be. These are said to be the figures of the Statistician; I do not know whether they are, because we have had no return laid on the table to [54] show whether it is true or not, but I am prepared to accept it-and the statement has been made, not only in the House a number of times, but it has been made by a number of speakers on platforms outside the House. What is the actual result? It has been done to deliberately mislead the people, because it is not true. I say it is not true, because I take the case of my own electorate, which, I presume, is typical of every other electorate, though there may be in But the my district more people who have to move from place to place in search of employment. From the ordinary roll and the supplementary roll, it would appear that there are 39,000 odd electors on the r o l l ; but that is not the actual case, as the official roll on which the recent election was fought contained only 34,000 names. Every one knows this, and knows that there is no inflation of the rolls at any time. If there was inflation of the official roll, the presiding officer, or the Electoral Registrar, should be dismissed at the earliest possible moment. But, as a matter of fact, as soon as it is known that a person has left the district or made an application for transfer, the Electoral Officer erases the name of that person from the official roll, and that is the roll issued to the presiding officers throughout the electorate. Now, if that can be done in the electorate I represent, which covers an area nearly four times the size of the State of Victoria, it could be done in the various electorates of Victoria ; and when we hear these statements made time after time that rolls are inflated, we know it is not so. The Attorney-General wishes I have to get pure rolls with the additional names on them. But I say he cannot do it . If he consults his officers, they will tell him that they cannot do it . If he gives the matter a moment's thought, What he will find that they will not be able to get pure rolls.",33

I have been accused by the press of the other side of everything from "" pitch-and-toss to manslaughter""; so his statement does uot worry me in the slightest. the rolls are really not inflated, and I say distinctly that, whether or not, you have the provision now proposed, you will still have a certain amount of inflation. cannot be otherwise. We must have the original roll apart from the supplementary roll, and while the original roll is there, there must be hundreds of people moving from one electorate to the other from the time the roll is printed u n t i l another takes its place. It does not matter whether we close the rolls a month or two months prior to an election. Unless we are prepared to do it three or four months before an election we cannot possibly have the rolls absolutely devoid of names that should not be there. ters talk about an inflation to the extent of 177,000 names. I know, up our way-and I have heard it said about other electorates-that a large number of people were not on the rolls at the last election. I suppose if we could get at the actual number, we would find that there are probably tens of thousands of people in Australia who did not have votes at the last election. There is justification, therefore, for our viewing this action of the Government with suspicion, because we know what has taken place. Those connected with members on the other side have the means of getting together vast sums of money, by which they can employ paid organizers and paid clerks. I have seen dozens and dozens of those clerks employed looking over the rolls. What do they do it for? It is for the purpose not of trying to put men on the roll, not to see that every man has a vote, not to see that the rolls are purified, but to see how many names they can knock off, more particularly the names of those opposed to them. seen it done very frequently. In the State from which I come, I regret to say it was done to such an extent that it became a scandal, and if it had occurred in any European country to half the extent it was done in Queensland in connection with the electoral rolls, it would is equally have caused a revolution. We must judge honourable members opposite by their associates. In South Australia, at the present time, they are cutting up the electorates, and, by their majority, forcing a Bill through the House so that the man who lives in the city shall have only a third of the voting power of the man in the country.

234,Mr FENTON,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,And they are gerrymandering in South Australia.,35
235,Mr MCDONALD,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"And we find our Government trying to gerrymander the rolls, the one thing of all others to which we as a party object, and against which we will fight to the fullest possible extent. It is idle for honourable members to say it is not so. In this case, the worse feature is that there was a clause specially put into an A ct of Parliament to prevent such a state of affairs. I regret the Attorney-General should allow himself to be dragged into this matter. He has a big reputation as a barrister, and to put up the paltry excuse he did this afternoon was I have certainly not creditable to him, nor to his ability, nor to his great reputation. He wandered on trying to explain this practically illegal act. If tliere is one thing Parliament should guard against more than another it is administrative attempts to evade the law. One of the most serious things that any body of men could be guilty of is the attempt to act contrary to law. A u Executive should disregard the law only in great emergencies, as in time of war, when the safety of the nation might demand it . Ministers who can disregard an Act of Parliament in a small matter wil l do the same thing in regard to big matters. There is cause to wonder, therefore, how far Ministers are prepared to go. find their position hopeless, there being no possibility of doing business. should they be permitted to do business? No more disgraceful state of affairs than at present exists has ever been known in the history of Australia. The two political parties are evenly divided, and the Prime Minister carries round a particular vote in his pocket. That is a disgrace. But Ministers are trying to gerrymander the electorates, so that, in the event of an appeal to the country, they may have a chance of being returned. If I had my way, I would keep them in office for six months, because, judging by the blunders that they have already made, they would, in that time, blunder themselves out of existence altogether. I view what has been done with grave suspicion, and I regret that they have dragged departmental officers into this controversy. Such action is despicable. No Minister should drag in his officers, saying that they wish such-and-such a thing to be done. Our officers cannot defend themselves here, and they should not be mixed up with party politics. Every Minister should be responsible for what he says and. cloes. I presume that a Minister, before accepting information from an officer, makes sure that that officer is full y quainted with the facts. It is the duty of a Minister to decide what use he will make of departmental information; but he must take full responsibility for anything he does, and not try to put any blame on his officers. I have full confidence in the officers of the Electoral partment. Whatever their individual opinions may be, I am sure that they will act honestly and rightly in the conduct of elections. But when organizations such as the Women's National League, the People's Party, the Liberal Association, the Trades H all , and others, are allowed to submit long lists of names which, they say, should not appear on the roll, injustice is sure to be done to many electors. The Government have committed a crime, and their action would cause great trouble in any other country than this. By the [54]- 2 cunning of the Attorney-General they have set aside an Act of Parliament.",35
236,Mr SPENCE,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Darling) [5.16] - Min isters have introduced some new methods of government. We see two or three running the one Department. They said that they took office to restore Ministerial responsibility and honest, efficient They government; but we find them contradicting one another-the Minister controlling Why electoral administration making one statement, and the Attorney-General another. But there are ample grounds for the grave suspicion that their administration will mean the disfranchisement of thousands of persons. Whether, technically, persons may send in objections without depositing 5s. in each case matters not, so far as the general public are concerned, because what percentage of the electors have read the Electoral Act? A few active spirits connected with political organizations may have copies of the Act in their offices, but the masses of the electors have not read it . They are made aware from the platforms, and in other ways, that if an objection to a name on the roll is lodged a deposit of 5s. is expected to accompany it . In the past, every difficulty has been put in the way of enrolment, and every facility given for the striking of names off the roll. Until the last amending Act was passed, men who had been living for twenty years in a small town, under the eyes of the local police who collected the names for the rolls, often discovered on election day that their names had been removed without tlieir knowledge. The rolls were always incomacplete, thousands of persons entitled to enrolment not having their names on the rolls. This was due to faulty administration. The Attorney-General says now that quite an innocent thing has been done by the Government. He is an able man, and no one knows the meaning of lanDe- guage, especially of legal language, so well as a lawyer - He tells us that the Government have invited the co-operation of the general public for the purification of the rolls, and that the Act imposes on registrars the duty of investigating objections to enrolment. He did not tell us what the word "" investigate "" means. If we do not watch carefully this action of the Government, there will be an immense disfranchisement. It is strange that the present month should have been chosen for this attempt to purify the rolls, seeing that in September those engaged in the most important industry in the Commonwealth-the wool industry-ar e necessarily absent from - their homes in large numbers.",36
237,Mr FENTON,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,The honourable member for Calare would like to have those men taken off the rolls.,37
238,Mr SPENCE,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,The honourable member for Robertson is joining in this.,37
239,Mr FLEMING,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"If the Government were doing what the Opposition say they are doing, I would not support them.",37
240,Mr SPENCE,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The honourable member is associated with a party a large number of whose members would not allow votes to any but property holders. In the past, the man of nomadic occupation has been prevented by legal technicalities from recording his vote. But at the last election, for the first occasion in our history, we had a very large enrolment. The printed roll necessarily, if every person qualified is enrolled, must have more names on it than there are persons entitled to vote, because it is impossible to keep it up to date and prevent some names from being recorded twice. It does not follow, however, that there is duplicate voting, and it has been proved that there was none at the last election. We are told that it is the duty of the registrars to investigate objections to enrolment. A registrar is told that So-and-so is not entitled to have his name on a roll. He asks why, and is informed that the man has left the district. The registrar then makes an inquiry into the allegation, l^oes he personally go to the address of the person objected to to ascertain whether he has left? We know that he does not. Registrars do their work as efficiently as possible, but, generally, they are busy postmasters with large responsibilities. The roll is not collected by them, and they have not to look into these matters personally. They depute their investigations to others, taking such evidence as they can get. At the present time there are at least 50,000 men engaged in the wool industry away from home, and they may be away for three months. TJnder the Act , after a man has been away from a district for a month, he is expected to transfer his name to the district to which he has moved. That, of course, does not apply to persons who are only temporarily away. But when objections are lodged to the enrolment of such persons, and an intimation of the fact is sent to their permanent address, they often never get the intimation, because they are moving from place to place. If , under such circumstances, tlieir names are struck off the rolls, they are treated unjustly. But that has happened in thousands of cases. It is the method taken by Conservative and alleged Liberal Governments for reducing the voting strength of the community. During the last three years the policy was the reversal of the old policy.",37
241,Mr BENNETT,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"Does the honourable member say that there are 50,000 men away from home shearing?",37
242,Mr SPENCE,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"I do not make such a statement without knowing what I am speaking of. The number of men engaged in shearing depends on the season. Evidence has been given in the Arbitration Court as to the number of men engaged in the shearing industry, and I know that, with the present flocks, 50,000 persons are needed to take the wool off.",37
243,Mr FLEMING,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,All are not away at the one time.,37
244,Mr SPENCE,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,They are away from home during the whole season.,37
245,Mr FLEMING,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"A good many do not leave their own district. . Mr SPENCE - I am dealing only with those employed in shearing sheds, who ;ire under an agreement which ties them up as tightly as though they were in prison.",37
246,Mr FLEMING,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,Oh !,37
247,Mr SPENCE,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The honourable member smiles, but ho really knows nothing of the actual experience of these men, and is not prepared, apparently, to listen to absolute facts. Men who are under engagement must carry out the terms of their contract. Shearing at one shed may last for a month or six weeks, and during that time the shearers or shed hands are away from home. Their names, however, are on the roll, and they are entitled to vote. Under this precious proposal they will be disfranchised. The Attorney-General says that when objections are lodged the police will be in structed to make inquiries. I am sure that he has not. the authority of the Electoral Office for that statement. If the police are to make these inquiries, then the Government are proposing to introduce a new system. As a matter of fact, the police are not available to make inquiries whenever an objection is lodged. The police have many duties to perform, and are expected to know every one in the rolls, and it was recognised district in which they are stationed. in one of the cases to which I have recorrect ferred, a constable reported that he made inquiries, and found that the person concerned had been away for a month six weeks, what would the Registrar do? Apparently he would remove his name from the roll. It is difficult to obtain any information from this Government, although they have introduced the system of a double-barrelled Ministerial head for one Department. Uuder that system we find one Minister contradicting the other. If one says that a certain thing is black, while the other declares it to white, we shall never be able to find out what really is the colour.",37

They have bungled everything that they have atlionorable tempted to deal with. In the case shearers and others who are away from home for a month or six weeks inquiry would disclose the fact that they were absent. It would be said that they had apparently left the district, and, as their address would probably be unknown, could not be communicated with, so that on tlicir return they would find their names off the roll. This proposal will chise. affect many thousands of workers. far I have referred only to those engaged in one industry, but there are thousands names as possible. of persons engaged in other seasonal in dustries, such as harvesting and f r u it picking, who have to leave their homes for some weeks at a time in order to their living, and these will be disfranobtaining this information."" chised. Surely it is bad enough for man to have to leave his home and his family to find work without being disway. franchised. It is all very well to say that it is the duty of the Registrar to keep the rolls clean, but we are face face with au entirely new development. The late Government said to the Elecknow toral Officers, "" It is your duty to keep the rolls as correct as possible, but i especially your duty to seo that every adult is enrolled."" The compulsory - ha s died. enrolment provisions of the Act were signed to throw upon electors the responmay sibility of '.eeing that they were on that, If , in the desire to have an absolutely roll, some names, which had ought to be on, would be removed. It is absolutely true, as stated by the honororable member for Kennedy, that the immense number of voters on the voters' roll is not in keeping with the number on the official or certified rolls which were used on election day. The present Government entered upon their duties with the idea that, since their predecessors were a Labour Administration , everything must have been conducted on crooked lines, and that all sorts of fraud had beeu committed in be connection, with the last general election. Their investigations, however, showed that the election was one of the cleanest ever held. They were utterly unable to find any evidence to support their allegation, but, witli the object of getting ready for election, they are now issuing a is new set of instructions to the officers of be the Electoral Department. Those officers do their work as well as they can, but members find it impossible to of obtain in the House any information from the Government. What information we have is gathered from statements by-Ministers at tea parties outside. It is clear, however, that the attitude of the present Government is exactly the opposite of that they taken by the Labour Administration, which directed the Department to give every adult a chance to exercise the franThis Government starts off by So telling the electoral officers that they must revise the rolls, and get r i d of as many Men of experience know that it is exceedingly difficult to ascertain the names of deceased persons on the rolls. The average, man will say, "" Surelv, as every death must be regisearn tered, there should be no difficulty in But exa perienced electoral officers will tell you that there are several difficulties in the Sometimes a man dies in a hospital, and the hospital authorities do not know his address; whilst very often the deaths to are recorded of several persons bearing the same name, and it is impossible to which name ought to be struck off the roll. That is an inherent difficulty. t is Some one reports that "" John Smith ""-=and the Smith family is a very large one If the address of the dedeceased person is given, the information be very useful; but why leave to the the general public the giving of such information? I enter my strong protest against these proposals on the part of the Government. Experience shows that thousands have been disfranchised because they have had to leave home temporarily to seek work. Others, again, owing to the defects of a bad system, have been disfranchised, although they have never left their usual place of residence. Listening to Ministers talking of the Department getting the assistance of various political organizations, the inexperienced outsider would imagine that they had made a new discovery. As a matter of fact, their political organizations have always been active in this regard. They are not going to be more active now, unless it be that they intend to work in a way that they have not done previously. Officials the Women's National League, for in stance, have always been active in tryin g to remove names from the rolls. At the last general election I saw a printed list of hundreds of names which were to be objected to, if possible, on polling day. The only people whom such organizations desire to be enrolled are those who have "" correct "" views. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Propertied people.",38

We ought to have some official figures showing the actual enrolment by the Department as compared with the census returns. We know that in taking the census a certain allowance is made for error; and yet it is regarded as a most comprehensive and reliable statistical table. The card system has proved an excellent one, though, of course, it cannot be regarded as perfect.

260,Mr ROBEBTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,And there have been some shocking disclosures as to the action of the Government.,40
261,Sir JOHNFORREST,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"I never even heard about these so-called "" shocking disclosures"" t ill now.",40
262,Mr ROBERTS,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,The right lionorable gentleman is evidently not in the scheming part of the Cabinet.,40
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"I have to announce that I propose to deliver the Budget-speech on this day week-the 1st October. Perhaps if I had made this announcement a little earlier it might, in some measure, have curtailed the debate, although it has been altogether directed to electoral matters. I regret there has been such delay in delivering the Budget-speech, but it was not possible to have it earlier. This, the thir d temporary Supply Bill that I have had to introduce, asks for a month's Supply to the amount of £1,121,979. There is nothing unusual in the proposals contained in the Bill . The only matter that really requires explanation is that of the Treasurer's Advance, which it is proposed to increase from £650,000 appropriated in the two previous Supply Bills by a further appropriation of £300,000. This increase is due to the system which has been adopted ever since the establishment of Federation, and by which all works and services prior to the passing of a Works Appropriation Act have to be paid out of Treasurer's A d vance. In the early days this method, so far from being inconvenient, was, in fact, very convenient; but the works now have attained such immense volume that it is no longer suitable. Personally, I do not like asking for what apparently looks like entrusting the Treasurer with an advance on account of nearly £1,000,000. It is entirely due to the system which has been in force for the last twelve ""years, and not to any desire on the part of the Treasurer to spend money in directions not authorized by Parliament.",40
264,Mr HUGHES,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"The right honourable gentleman does not approve, of the system ?",40
265,Sir JOHNFORREST,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"I do not ; and if I have the opportunity-of which I am not sure- I shall alter it . I certainly shall not do again what has been done this year, but will ask for temporary Supply for Works and Buildings in the same way as ordinary Supply is asked for ordinary services-tw o Bills instead of one. By this means, the Treasurer's Advance would be put into its proper position; and I may point out that, when the Estimates in chief have been disposed of, and the Appropriation Act is passed, the Treasurer's Advance will not amount to more than £500,000 for the year. Mr - HUGHES - That is up to July. Is the right honourable member reckoning on the extra month ?",40
266,Sir JOHN FORREST,CLEANSING OF ELECTORAL,"We propose to ask for only £500,000, which, I think, will do very well. Thinking that honourable members might adversely criticise the request for £300,000 more for the Treasurer's Advance, I had a statement printed and circulated showing that out of the £650,000 previously voted a sum of £606,650 had been expended on the following works : - Additions , new works and buildings, £241,000; coustruction of telegraphs and telephones, £279,000; naval and military new works, £ 6 4 , 1 0 0; Northern Territory works, £ 1 2 , 5 5 0; and wireless telegraphy, £10,000. This leaves only £43,350 as the amount really chargeable to expenditure under what is properly Treasurer's Advance. I can assure honourable members that the greatest care has been taken in the expenditure of this large amount of money; but, as I say, I think the better, and, indeed, necessary plan in the future will be to obtain Supply for Works and Buildings in hand authorized by Parliament during the previous year, and to avoid asking for large sums of money for Treasurer's Advance. In Committee, I shall be glad to explain any of the items I have just read, and be able to show lionorable members that everything has been done regularly and in order. It is understood that temporary Supply Bills shall not include works and services not already authorized by Parliament. That, to some extent, is inconvenient, because works have to be delayed until the approval of Parliament is obtained. There is, however, no alternative, as there is no authorityto spend money on works not already authorized unless small works out of the Treasurer's Advance. I do not think I need say anything more. We shall have the Budget this day week, and then I shall have the opportunity of placing before honourable members, as well as I can, the nnancial position of the country in all its various aspects. I am sorry that I have had to ask this third time for what is called temporary Supply, or Supply on account.",40

As we now see it, the science of government is simplicity itself. Shortly stated, in spite of all its ramifications, and particularly in finance, it appears to be that it does not really matter what we do, or how we do it , provided the right honourable gentleman, th© member for Swan, is the gentleman who is on the Treasury benches. "" It is all very simple, and we are not to discuss the matter,"" he says. It will be no good discussing it , because it will be all explained by the right honourable gentleman, so that even a child will be able to understand it--eve n gentlemen on the Opposition side will be able to understand it . He is eager to get to the business. The right honourable gentleman stands like a greyhound straining at the leash. I admit he does not look like it , but we must look at him with the poetic eye of imagination, and picture him straining at the leash until Wednesday next, when he is to deliver his Budget speech. That will be a great day. When we say to him, "" Why did yon not give us the Budget before,"" he says, "" No one is more eager to get to it than I a m .

When we were on the other side of the chamber, no explanation we could afford would help the right honourable gentleman in the slightest degree. Then, discussion was the foundation of good government; to every measure and proposal we brought forward the right honourable gentleman brought a meticulous criticism that left ' u s all sore. Then, it was not two or three sheets stuck togetlier in a flimsy way by a pin, gone through jauntily, but a most formidable octavo volume which he used to go through to the bitter end. Now, however, a change of climate, with the wind east-south-east by a quarter north, and on the placid sea of a seat on the Ministerial bench, it is "" B e perfectly satisfied. All is well.

In respect to this little Bill , he admits he has not done quite right;.he does not believe in the Treasurer's Advance Account; "" But what could I do 1"" he saysand this is encouragement to us all - "" if you only leave me here auother year, I will not do it at all . "" A man with as little heart and soul in hi m as there is in a stone monument could not resist an appeal and inducement of that sort. For my part, the Treasurer shall remain there for many years if we have a positive assurance that he will give to various measures that careful consideration that he obviously has given in this case. I am sure that all that explanation of the use to which he has put the moneys he is asking for has sunk into the bottom of the soul of every man here. I venture to say that there is no human being in this chamber who has the faintest idea of it . But that is entirely because we are unable to appreciate the manner in which the right honourable gentleman sets fort h his arguments. There is that personal equation. To understand the right honourable gentleman we must appreciate him, and trust him with absolute Faith. No Christian scientist ever approached a difficult problem of acute colic with that pathetic faith and trust in the efficacy of belief with which the right honourable gentleman approaches the financial position. However, wo are to wait a week before we can get anything f u r ther, and we are, at the same time, face to face with a declaration by the Attorney-General with reference to an electoral matter which places the House in a very awkward position. We dp not care to refuse Supply; that would be quite improper, not only from the stand-point of the country, but because it would in flict on the right honourable gentleman a blow which, in his delicate state of health,' I venture to say, he could hardly survive; and I shall not venture so far. however, to the Attorney-General that in making a statement of the sort that I have been told the learned gentleman did make, in reference to the rights of electors uuder the present Act, in relation to objections, he failed altogether to point out the fundamental distinction between giving information and making an objection. These things are fundamentally distinct. What the elector now has is the right to supply the Electoral Office with information. It is an inherent right, not only in regard to the electoral law, but practically in regard to all laws where a citizen is not, for some reason, statute barred; but, as in most other cases, while a citizen may give information, it remains for somebody else to initiate a prosecution. In this particular case the individual elector may supply to the Electoral Ofiice as much information in respect to as many electors as he pleases, and the Electoral Office may, or may not, investigate that information; and, if it thinks fit, may even proceed, under sections 67 and 68, to bring the matter before a Court, which Court has the power of striking names oS the roll. What is now proposed in the Electoral Bill is, instead of the present method, by which objections are to be made, each objection having to be accompanied by a sum of 5s., to substitute a system by which objections lodged by an individual elector are made the foundation of a proceeding before a Court. The foundation of the present proceeding in the Courts is action by the Electoral Office, or action by some person who has deposited a sum of 5s. It is proposed now to enable any person, without depositing the sum of 5s., to proceed to instigate the Court to action, and to strike off a name. The Attorney-General speaks about having a pure roll. We are just as anxious to have a pure r o l l ; but there is a difference between a pure roll and offering an inducement to party managers and organizers to strike off the rolls the names of their political opponents. We are all very human, and party organization is about as human an institution as it is possible to get. We say, "" We give you money; we supply you with machinery; your business is to lodge as many objections as possible."" It is notorious that, in England, the two party machines, between elections and preparing for by-elections, are almost exclusively engaged in striking off the' rolls the names of their I say, opponents, and in putting their own on. The right to supply the Electoral Office with information is a right that should not be curtailed. It is now in the possession of-every elector in Australia, and I have been told-and if it is not true we should be informed-that the Electoral Office, because of that information, has acted on it , and will act on it . That, however, is quite a different matter from the proposal in the Electoral Bill , which is that this information, coming from atainted and an interested source, is to be the foundation upon which a man's name is to disappear from the roll. True, the man has to be notified; that is to say, notice has to be sent to his last postal address. The Australian is more largely nomadic in his habits than the inhabitants of other countries. The other day the honourable member for East Sydney gave an amusing illustration of the extent to which men and women move about during elections. A large proportion of the people in any electorate shif t about, and ' I venture to say the sending of a notice to the last postal address of the average elector is a very poor way of notifying the elector of the objector's intention to object to his name. The present position is that every elector has the right to supply information to the Electoral Office to assist in the purification of the rolls. The present right is fundamentally different from the right which will exist if the Electoral Bill becomes law. However, as it is desired to report progress, I shall reserve any further remarks I have to make for another occasion.",41
