2,Ms DEAHM,Unknown," Mr appropriate that I, as a representative of the support of the National Environment Protection Environment Protection Council. It is possible too often they are major examples, of each being established to address. The schedule of the council's responsibilities predominant concerns that engage environmental agencies throughout the Hawkesbury and Blue are thrown into sharp relief in Macquarie because large areas of World Heritage class wilderness largest city. It is possible to stand in silence and solitude parks and to look down upon the polluted air occupied by about one-fifth of the Australian absolutely clear that the achievement of ecologically and development is crucial to every business milestone on the path to that achievement I have spoken on other occasions about the in my electorate.

They thereby demonstrate the need for approach embodied in this bill. MAIN COMMITTEE 2031 Thursday, 13 October 1994 took the chair at 10.00 a.m. Second Reading Deputy Speaker, I find it particularly electorate of Macquarie, am speaking today in Council Bill 1994 to establish the National to find within my electorate examples, and all of the environmental factors that the council is is essentially the same as the list of groups, local councils and government Mountains regions.

The Hawkesbury region, which comprises from the industries and vehicles of Sydney of the most efficient places in Australia for the have demonstrated how pollutants generated above the towns of Windsor and Richmond and ugly and dangerous grey-brown concentrations that flow across the whole spectrum from standards of individual vehicles and buildings. in their conclusions that a major regional at local, state and federal government exactly the sort of broad-ranging cooperative NA 2032 MAIN COMMITfEE Most of my colleagues will have heard comments the water pollution and riverine degradation suffers the multiple burdens of providing nearly in Sydney, of providing much of the irrigation productive agricultural areas that still exist acting as a vast drain for the variously treated western Sydney. Much work has been done already at the Commonwealth in rivers and estuaries, and again I refer Rivers from the Division of Water Resources work of the council. Another issue that the council will be dealing is an issue of significant current concern in joy flights conflicting seriously with the natural Blue Mountains National Park, which may Heritage register. Among those who love and use the Blue dissatisfaction with the inability of local conflict. Much hope is placed upon the Commonwealth, new standards that will reflect environmental regulations. The conflict between wilderness experienced in all parts of Australia. It is a again the important role of a body with My electorate has the possibility of suffering highly toxic leachates emanating from the council will be establishing guidelines for investigate the environmental impacts associated the standards arising from them, will be vitally are required to prevent the recurrence The National Environment Protection Council recycling of used materials.

For the past 11 years the Hawke and Keating away from that situation where protection isolated conflicts to the position that prevails journey has seen much of the superficial behind, but has brought us to a point where success. I have spoken of two of the most dramatic which has been sustained by many other crucial discuss the more significant of those. In 1980, the world conservation strategy was conservation strategy for Australia, which was been proposed by a conference in Canberra in Common Future was published. Gro Harlem environment minister of Norway, had been called Nations to establish and chair the World report that ensued proved to be a seminal from it. Internationally, it led to a range of treaties Nations Conference on Environment and Development world's governments were represented and that included the Rio declaration and Agenda MAIN COMMITTEE 2033 that has led to the setting up of the National to examine briefly the history behind the council. in the systematic approach that this government environmental issues that I have just described. and I will return to it later. environmental management was generally that more clearly than the famous, or perhaps for the first time in the broad public arena, the could be endlessly and thoughtlessly exploited of ecology. Ecology lost that time. The much more satisfying to work with concrete, heavy than to send out teams with utes and engineers had lost the ascendancy. Large sections natural environment had an intrinsic value that of development. If we look back upon those two management in Australia, we see how far Lake Pedder was devastating but became the victory later on the Franklin River. isolated from the long-term administrative despite the passion with which they were fought Dr Bob Brown characterised them accurately were lost for ever and, if won, were won only governments have been travelling progressively of the environment was seen in terms of winning today, and that is exemplified in this bill. The glamour and drama of environmental issues left we now have a far greater chance of lasting and best known turning points of the journey developments. I will take a few moments to released. It was followed locally by the national accepted by the federal government after having June 1983. In 1987, the Brundtland report Our Brundtland, the Prime Minister and former upon by the Secretary-General of the United Commission on Environment and Development. The document and many far-reaching initiatives grew and conventions that culminated in the United held in Brazil in 1992. Most of the the conference produced a number of documents 21, both of which were intended to form a broad NA 2034 MAIN COMMITTEE international framework for environmentally incorporated related policy issues such Climate Change and the United Nations international achievements were followed In 1990 the Hawke government began the environmentally sustainable development that of public consultations and of deliberations publication of 11 reports that together contained would lead to the elusive goal of ESD. In November 1992 the Council of Australian environmentally sustainable development, indicating in establishing broad directions and approaches especially those of a national character, should Australia include the national greenhouse response conservation of Australia's biological diversity, strategy and the national forest policy statement. implications of various international conventions. The last development that I will mention environment. It was signed in October 1990 territory chief minister and the President of bill now being debated is the most important described because it contains the specific agreement National Environment Protection Council. The intergovernmental agreement is constructed a cooperative national approach to the environment; respective governments; a reduction in the the states and the territories on environmental business decision making; and better environmental environmental considerations in the decision project, program and policy levels. Schedule 4 of the agreement sets out the Environment Protection Council. They are reasonable, also, above all, cooperative and collectively determine whether to adopt standards, guidelines will be the most effective method to achieve I said earlier that the word 'systematic' described has run parallel to our growing understanding years ago, saving the environment was about during those 20 years that the environment is those that must be preserved, protected and restored.

Honourable members would probably not like it and, therefore, any move towards an integrated national market is very worthwhile. situation where, for example, the laws of neighbouring state, and the publication of simultaneously in both states, can be libellous fairly obvious example of some of the absurdities. In talking of the issue of libel, I would landmark decision that has just been handed public figures, because it is pertinent to this at a disadvantage, of course, in not having law of libel has in effect been liberalised by activism, following on from the decision in the opponent of judicial activism and the interpretation with respect to basic freedoms, such as freedom we need to be very careful of how far we go down the track. One of the points I think that is missing in figures is the question of the monopoly ownership the House of Representatives, I have been involved and as a plaintiff. In particular, I have had experience of what circulation of about 500,000 copies across damaging to me in my occupation, as it was net effect of the article was to suggest that, union had removed money, that we had, in of thousands or millions of dollars. The article journalist who wrote the article had a specific of mine within the union to win union elections. at all. Clearly, I had no potential means of redress not in the newspaper concerned and certainly redress in the media as they stood, essentially this country. There is a lack of diversity partisanship across different strands of political happen to fit within the interests of the dominant of being seriously libelled and of having no media. An individual can get on the local community it is impossible to get access to the 500,000 newspaper report. A person's only protection is the law of libel. a printed retraction and apology, as did the MAIN COMMITTEE 2043 and less relevant in the days of microelectronics of the report. The first is the single national structure. This is a proposition that is long know my views on the federal system. I do national regulation of what is rapidly becoming It is clearly absurd that we still have a libel in one state are different from those in a allegedly libellous material that is broadcast in one and not in the other. That is just one like to take the opportunity to comment on the down by the High Court with respect to libel and issue. I have only read media reports, so I am read the written judgment. It does seem that the the High Court through another dose of judicial political advertising case. I am not a complete of implied provisions in the constitution of the speech and the like, although I think the public debate on the issue of libel and public of our media. Like a number of people in in libel proceedings both as a defendant it is like being libelled in a newspaper with a the state. The libel was potentially extremely then, as a secretary of a major trade union. The in some way, I and other leading figures in the effect, stolen money from the union-hundreds was very cleverly structured because the agenda to run. He was trying to assist opponents There was no attempt to balance the article against that very damaging publication, certainly not on electronic media. I had no effective because we have a monopoly owned media in within our media. There is a lack of mixed view. The end result is that, if people do not media ownership, they are very much at risk potential redress at the same level within the radio station, or something like that, but people who might have read that particular As a result of that law, I was able to obtain president of our union who was also effectively NA 2044 libelled by this article. That is all we wanted. anything like that. All we wanted was to effectively to our reputation, which would not only affect affect us in the longer term, in other areas. Without the law of libel, that stain would that I was in some way criminally corrupt as anything that relaxes the law of libel as it an ability to get some sort of redress when they apply to politicians, because at least we have right. It applies particularly to other lesser public so intensely followed by the media but I would just like to throw that in as reforming the law of libel, issues of reform cannot be avoided because the two are integrally related. I return to some of the other issues that the clients of lawyers should have access to greater In my brief experience as a lawyer for a few that I dealt with. Clients who had previously They simply would not know what was going given an opportunity to make genuine decisions still a real element of lawyers being seen as that permeates the way the legal system and subconscious desire to guard the secrets and the lawyers remain in some sort of dominant position.

Anybody who has been involved in the legal difficulties getting people to voluntarily give of reasons, generally fairly legitimate and practical media into court will only add to that problem the achievement of a just outcome. Clearly, the monopolistic nature of our media is a real lack of diversity, a real lack of ability of the electronic media to get alternative coverage otherwise being presented.

Main Committee adjourned at 12.07 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Electronic Information (Question No. 1363) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (1) be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal to house the services and foster public access. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, two areas provide, or will provide, information in electronic format through public access points. These are Rural Division, Headquarters Group, and the Bureau of Resource Sciences. In addition, the Department is currently examining options for making Departmental information available through AARNet and the Internet. Several other services are provided, or currently being investigated, by a number of government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility. NA Rural Division, Headquarters Group, administers three programs relevant to the question: the Telecentres Program, CountryLink and the associated Australian Country Information Service (ACIS). These are developmental programs specifically designed to address the information needs of Australia's rural and remote communities. They do not provide services for urban or metropolitan communities. NA Telecentres are multipurpose projects designed to exploit the use of modem communications and information technologies to: a. expand opportunities for employment and enterprise, b. increase the competence and confidence of the broad community in the use of such resources, and c. assist in the delivery of services including education and training. To date 31 Telecentres have been funded across Australia under the Commonwealth's program and about 11 additional sites have been funded in Western Australia under a separate but similar WA State Government program. At an investigative level only, a number of areas within the Department, and several of the portfolio's government enterprises, are also particilibraries pating in the Telecentre Program. The CountryLink program aims to improve the access of Australians who live outside of capital cities to the range of Commonwealth Government services and programs. The core service provided by the CountryLink program is the toll free answer line which can be contacted by phoning 008 026 222 between 9AM and 6PM Monday to Friday. CountryLink also produces an annual update of the Rural Book, a 200 page guide to Commonwealth Government services and programs provided free of charge (on request) to non-metropolitan Australians. The ACIS program is designed to provide a community level extension of the Department's CountryLink information service. So far there have been 21 ACIS sites funded across the country. The Telecentres Program is undergoing evaluation and ACIS will be evaluated next year. The evaluations will assist Government in making decisions on how it can best help in meeting the future information needs of rural communities. The Bureau of Resource Sciences provides access, via a dialup service, to the National Directory of Australian Resources database. OTHER PORTFOLIO INFORMATION SERNA The Grains Research and Development Corporation, Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC), Honeybee Research and Development Council, Land and Water Research and Development Corporation (LWRDC), Cotton Research and Development Corporation, Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, all provide information on several hundred research projects through the Australian Rural Research in Progress (ARRlP) database. RIRDC also provides information to the Australian Bibliography of Agriculture public access database and LWRDC makes information available through its own database Streamline which is accessed via Ozline on the Australian Bibliographic Network. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation has a comprehensive electronic market intelligence service provided through the CALM Services communication system. This national system utilises the public telephone network. Access to the system requires a personal computer and a modem. The Energy Research and Development Corporation is currently examining the feasibility of the development of a database as part of its Energy Technology Information Program (ETIP). The database will provide information to the community supporting energy research and development in Australia. As the feasibility evaluation is still in its formative stages, a decision on distribution of the information it will contain has yet to be made. The Pig Research and Development Corporation has funded a project for the 94-95 financial year to establish a pilot scheme whereby producers, advisers, and ultimately, others can communicate electronically. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority is currently investigating a number of possible future applications where information may be provided to the public in electronic format. These are a Register of quota holdings in the South East Fishery, Registers of Statutory Fishing Rights, and Catch data from Japanese longline vessels. As part of its domestic promotion program, the Australian Dairy Corporation provides educational, health and nutrition material in electronic form through computer software packages such as Farming the Dairy Good Way and Healthy Habits. This material is distributed to a wide range of schools throughout Australia. (2) DEPARTMENTAL INFORMATION SERNA Both the Telecentres and ACIS programs administered by Rural Division, Headquarters Group, are based on the community 'self help' model. This means rural communities must take the initiative in applying for the projects and developing and implementing an appropriate management plan. For Telecentres the Commonwealth provides funding assistance for set up and initial operating expenses. Telecentres are expected to become financially self-sufficient within 24 months. ACIS sites provide a Departmental service and subject to the success of the program are expected to be funded on a continuing basis. The CountryLink program is accommodated and operated from within the Department. The Bureau of Resource Sciences NDAR database is accommodated and operated by the National Information Resource Centre in the Bureau. OTHER PORTFOLIO INFORMATION SERNA The ARRlP database, used by many of the Research and Development Corporations for the distribution of information, is carried on the AUSTRALIS network. This is administered by CSIRO on behalf of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management. It is also made available on CD-ROM. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority envisage that the services they are investigating will be provided by a dial up bulletin board which will operate on a personal computer housed in AFMA's Canberra office. The information files will be updated from the corporate database. At this stage, several of the Research & Development Corporations are cooperating with the expectation that they will have a common service to offer client groups. It is expected that there will be an overlap of interests between several areas, for example, grain and pig producers. Currently, they are investigating the feasibility of developing common electronic frameworks. Information specialists have indicated to several of the Research and Development Corporations that CD-ROM technology may be more appropriate than online bulletin boards or network services. In this event, the electronic material will be available for sale in exactly the same way that the printed matter is now. (3) DEPARTMENTAL INFORMATION SERNA Although administered by the Rural Division, Headquarters Group, it is the community's responsibility to decide whether it is appropriate to consolidate the Telecentre and/or ACIS project with a municipal library site or with other services for example business enterprise centres, arts and crafts society or skillshare facilities. So far there have been examples of all these arrangements. The only program requirement is that the decision should be practical and show evidence of broad based community support. In some cases Telecentre and ACIS projects are established on a stand-alone basis, particularly where there is no pre-existing service or municipal infrastructure which could assist in fostering the project. Some local governments are seeking to achieve economies of scale by consolidating community services onto a single site. Such initiatives are welcomed, particularly when they result in improved access to the services being sought by rural communities under the ACIS and Telecentres programs. Access to the NDAR database administered from the Bureau of Resource Sciences, is available to anyone, including municipal libraries, with the appropriate equipment (a modem and computer). OTHER PORTFOLIO INFORMATION SERNA Libraries within several of the government enterprises under the Minister's portfolio maintain strong links, both formal and informal, with the municipal and corporate library networks. They exchange electronic and printed data, particularly with school and municipal libraries in the many rural communities. Other organisations, such as the Energy Research and Development Corporation, will be considering the feasibility of providing access to proposed services through the public library system's dial-up facilities. CD-ROM and online search services are available through most Australian public libraries, and provide access to the portfolio information available on the ARRIP database. Several organisations target specific interest groups such as primary and secondary schools, shareholders, and provision of services on a cost recovery basis. For example, the software packages provided by the Australian Dairy Corporation to interested primary and secondary schools, the delivery of the CALM service by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation which focuses on point to point rural delivery. Given the specific target audiences, these organisation have no plans at present to utilise the network of municipal libraries. Department of Industry, Science and Technology: Grants (Question No. 1410) Mr Richard Evans asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 24 August 1994: (1) How many grants did the Minister's Department make to individuals or organisations in the electoral division of Cowan in (a) 1992-93 and (b) 1993-94. (2) With respect to each grant made in (a) 199293 and (b) 1993-94, (i) under what program was it made; (ii) what was its value; and, (iii) what was the name of the recipient. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1)(a) One grant was made to an organisation in the electoral division of Cowan in the 1992-93 financial year. (b) Nil (2)(i) This grant was a Discretionary Grant from the Industry Research and Development Board under the Industry Innovation Program (ii) $138,150.00 (iii) Modron Pty Ltd GATT: Federal Clause (Question No. 1421) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 24 August 1994: (1) Did the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development state in his answer to question No. 854 (Hansard, 21 June 1991, page 5344) that (a) Australia had not sought to defend the GATT inconsistent actions of its subcentral authorities under Article XXIV: 12 since 1981 and (b) Canada was the only contracting party which had sought to do so since 1981. (2) What will be the position of subcentral authorities as a result of the negotiations at Marrakesh on 15 April 1994. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) I can confirm that the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development stated that no actions by Australia's subcentral authorities had been subject to examination in a GATT panel established under the GATT dispute settlement procedures, and consequently that the issue of Australia seeking to defend these actions in a GATT panel had not arisen. There has been no change in the situation since the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development provided that answer. (b) I can confirm that the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development stated that Canada was the only GATT contracting party which had sought to defend the otherwise GATT inconsistent actions of its subcentral authorities under Article XXIV: 12 in a GATT panel. Since the Minister provided that answer on 21 June 1991 there have been two additional panels in which contracting parties have sought to defend such actions under Article XXIV: 12. The contracting parties involved have been Canada and the United States. (2) The Uruguay Round Agreements signed at Marrakesh on 15 April 1994 have confirmed the existing GATT provisions in Article XXIV:12 requiring a member country to take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure observance of the provisions of the GATT by regional and local governments and authorities within its territory.

Captain Cook Jet, Canberra (Question No. 1463)",144
24,Mr CONNOLLY,VICES,"the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 1 September 1994: (1) What (a) was the original budget for and (b) is the latest estimate of the cost of the restoration of the Captain Cook Jet in Lake Burley Griffin, Canberra. (2) What sums are being paid in connection with the restoration. (3) To whom and why are the sums being paid.",145
25,Mr HOWE,VICES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) A cost estimate of $478,000 prepared in 1993 by the National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA) was based on a report prepared by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd in 1991. This cost included pipe replacement and repair. repairs to structural concrete and replacement of nozzle flow straighteners. (b) The latest construction cost by Sinclair Knight Men in June 1994 is for a total of $936,000. This cost estimate reflects a major change in the scope of works for the project from the original cost estimate. The 1994 costing includes: main pipeline replacement civil structures (underground pump house to be brought up to Occupational Health and Safety and other safety standards) mechanical equipment electrical instrumentation (replacing computer control panel, plus interactive display for public use in the National Capital Exhibition at Regatta Point, Canberra. (2) 1993/94 $65,289 1994/95 $650,000 1995/96 remainder of works to be completed within total project construction cost estimate of $936,000 as outlined in 1(b). Construction supervision is expected to cost an additional $30,000 during 1995/96. Task Force B (3) During the 1993/94 financial year, the $2,947,000 following sums were paid in connection with the $11,034,212 restoration: (i) $23,998 to Gray Diving Services for fabrication and installation/replacement of stainless steel screens to the intake tunnels; (ii) $30,086 to Sinclair Knight Men for production of investigation report on the condition of the Jet recommending options for restoration; (iii) $5,705 to the ACT Electricity and Water Engineering Services for technical assistance including assessment of the two 3.3KV transformers; (iv) $5,500 to the ACT Department of Urban Services for technical assistance including dewatering the nozzle housing in the lake and intake tunnel. The NCPA's 1994195 budget for this project is $650,000. Of this approximately $150,000 will be expended on design, documentation and works supervision fees. NCPA has a staged contract with Sinclair Knight Men to provide these services during 1994/95. A further $500,000 will be expended on construction works associated with pipe replacement.

26,Mr CONNOLLY,VICES,"the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 1 estimate prepared September 1994: (l) Have the profit figures for 1993-94 of the New South Wales division of Australian Construction Services (ACS) been examined to determine their accuracy; if so, (a) what discrepancies were found, (b) were these in the cost centres PX and PY, Industry and Defence, (c) have the month by month profit figures for these profit centres been audited and (d) were gross margins in excess of 100 per cent claimed for July and August; if not, why not, if so, to what are they attributable. (2) What were the NSW division of ACS's (a) recorded and (b) actual losses for (i) 1992-93 and (ii) 1993-94. (3) Did it originally appear that the loss trend for the division was decreasing over the periods referred to in part (2); if so, what are the implications of the actual as opposed to the recorded loss figures on the loss trend. (4) Did ACS take any action as a result of the matters referred to in the preceding parts of this question; if so, (a) what action and (b) when was it taken. (5) Had he been informed of the matters; if so, when. (6) Did the matters have implications for (a) the Department of Finance or (b) any other Commonwealth or State agency; if so, in each case, (i) what implications, (ii) what action was taken in response and (iii) when was the action taken.",145
27,Mr WALKER,VICES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 30 June 1994 trading results for the ACS, NSW Office have been determined. ANAO is currently finalising its audit of the results: (a) so far the audit has not identified any materiANAO. al discrepancies requiring the result to be adjusted; (b) the present cost centre structure of the NSW Office provides a facility for grouping jobs under general market sectors. In the case of cost centre ""px"" and ""py"" these sectors are Industry and Overseas, and Defence respectively. These groupings are a management convenience and are not in themselves trading sub-units. Nevertheless, given the present findings of the audit of the NSW Office it follows that there have been no material discrepancies identified on jobs listed in cost centres ""px"" and ""py""; (c) further to comments provided in (b) above, trading results are not determined at the cost centre level; therefore there were no ""profit figures (determined) for these profit centres"" to audit; (d) gross margins in excess of 100% occurred on three projects in cost centre ""py"" during the months of July and August of 1994. These gross margins essentially reflected the correction of cost estimates on these projects predominantly caused by the incorrect processing of timesheet costs, with the more significant cases being: PY0202: Garden Island Health Centre The timesheet costing adjustment ($1,784) resulted in the total cost estimate for the job being reduced from $20,421 to $18,637. Against the background of a modest increase in the physical progress on the job (2%) for July, that month's income and costs were assessed at $818 and $1,358 respectively, resulting in a gross margin of $2,176 (or 266%). PY0223: HOLSWORTHY 5n RAR Officers' Mess Upgrade A timesheet costing adjustment of $857 contributed to a net reduction in the total cost of the project of $685 identified in July; at the same time the fees for the job were increased as well as the percentage complete (ie from 99% to 100%) giving rise to a gross margin of $5,913 (or 111%) for July. While the above gross margins are greater than 100% they only relate to the month that the adjustment to the project cost estimate was made; the whole of life gross margin will always be less than or equal to 100%. (2) I assume that ""recorded"" refers to the result determined by the NSW Office and ""actual"" the final result supported by the ANAO. In respect of 1992/93, the recorded result was a loss of $6.618 million which the ANAO adjusted to a loss of $6.460 million loss due to an over accrual of $158,000 for rent expenses in the recorded result. The recorded result for 1993/94 is a loss of $3.505 million, which is currently supported by the (3) Yes. Furthermore, the improvement in the trading result for 1993/94 compared to 1992/93 was expected as evidenced by the trading budget prepared for 1993/94. Given that the present recorded result for 1993/94 is supported by the ANAO there are no implications to comment on. (4) The main actions taken during 1993/94 to achieve the improved trading outcome included: bringing staff numbers into line with expected workload; and increasing marketing effort (both local and overseas) as a means to increasing the probability for winning new work at highly competitive prices in a recessed construction industry marketplace. (5) I am aware of the staff cuts and of ACS' marketing efforts and the continuing high priority given to marketing activities. (6) No. Canned Tomatoes (Question No. 1477) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business, Customs & Construction, upon notice, on 1 September 1994: (1) Further to the answer to question No 1332, (Hansard, 23 August 1994, page 140) relating to the dumping of Italian canned tomatoes in Australia, has an application been lodged to re-open the case after the Federal Court ruled in February 1994 that dumping had occurred; if so, (a) who lodged the application and (b) on what basis. (2) Are there any provisions in the relevant regulations against vexatious or frivolous applications; if so, what are the criteria for applying the regulations. (3) Does Australia have regulations similar to those of some other countries which prevent a dumping action being re-opened for up to 5 years; if not, will it consider adopting them. Mr Lee-The Minister for Small Business, Customs & Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (a) An application was lodged with the AntiDumping Authority on 24 May 1994 by Roger Simpson and Associates on behalf of La Doria de Diodata Ferraoli S.p.A., an exporter of canned tomatoes from Italy. The Authority was asked to hold an inquiry into whether the dumping and countervailing duty notices in respect of canned tomatoes from Italy should be revoked. (b) The application was based on changes which were alleged to have occurred in the Australian industry since measures were imposed in April 1992. It was claimed that during a period from April 1993 to February 1994 when the measures were not in force as a result of court action, industry was able to improve its economic performance by increasing sales and maintaining its prices. It was claimed that this occurred despite a significant increase in imports from Italy. (2) No. Applications for revocation of notices imposing dumping or countervailing duties can be made to the Authority at any time. In practice however, applications need to be supported by evidence to justify revocation of the notices. Sufficient information must also be provided in a non-confidential version of the application to allow interested parties to have a clear understanding of the case being put forward. An examination of the history of applications to the Authority for the revocation of measures indicates that there have not been any applications that could be considered to be vexatious or frivolous. (3) I am not aware of any country that has a provision that prevents a dumping action being reopened for up to 5 years. There is no intention by the Government that Australia will adopt such a the policy in the foreseeable future.",146
